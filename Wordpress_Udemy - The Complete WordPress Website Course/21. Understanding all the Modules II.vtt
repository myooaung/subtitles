00:00.950 --> 00:04.770
What does a guy who's a walking KMAX now in this video we're going to be working on a new section and

00:04.770 --> 00:05.770
that it will be.

00:05.810 --> 00:07.490
Let's see him here.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.870
Let's have the full three here and then here would be deployed.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.340
You guys now know how the blob works.

00:13.350 --> 00:16.440
We now know how it works you can create unlimited buttons.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.500
We now know how Caldwell works.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.170
OK.

00:19.230 --> 00:24.570
And we also have the surface to circle counter so let's add a call to action right now here first.

00:24.710 --> 00:24.940
OK.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.090
I'm going to add.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.020
Hello.

00:27.380 --> 00:27.910
OK.

00:27.930 --> 00:33.810
And then I am going to add the button so Button is going to be done one way and then I'm going to add

00:33.810 --> 00:35.450
the concentrate here.

00:36.160 --> 00:36.540
OK.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.000
I'm going to add the link Crais here.

00:38.030 --> 00:40.870
But then you were ill is going to be this right here.

00:42.650 --> 00:48.380
Slap hash Krey and then I have the background so you can add the background if you want to.

00:50.990 --> 00:57.910
And you're going to choose a black and the golden.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.810
So I'm just going to work for the Korean right here.

01:01.780 --> 01:02.570
Here we go.

01:02.990 --> 01:03.410
OK.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.500
So this is looking cool.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.730
OK.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.320
This is how the call to action works so you can how cold works and it's Caldwell action is basically

01:12.380 --> 01:14.640
like a slider like a hitter.

01:14.770 --> 01:15.250
OK.

01:15.260 --> 01:16.990
You can pretty well add anything here.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.350
And then you can change these you can add it any way if you want to it can you.

01:21.390 --> 01:27.670
OK you can just go to design right here and then you can go to the x ray here and then you can align

01:27.670 --> 01:29.700
it to the left.

01:29.980 --> 01:34.720
So this is how the call to work is looking OK so this is how you can manage it or you can add this call

01:34.720 --> 01:36.620
to action any way you want to.

01:37.050 --> 01:37.620
OK.

01:37.780 --> 01:38.840
And this is how it works.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.480
I'm going to come here I'm going to make it the full length.

01:41.500 --> 01:41.900
OK.

01:41.980 --> 01:47.080
So when I go to the right here I'm going to go to the sizing and I'm going to make it full with use.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.320
And let's make it one.

01:49.590 --> 01:50.060
OK.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.410
Now let's click this and let's just bring this to the top

02:01.280 --> 02:04.890
Hey seem like this ends like this.

02:04.890 --> 02:07.570
So here we have a called what should I write here.

02:07.590 --> 02:11.310
I'm going to click this guy right here right here again and I'm going to hit regular and I'm going to

02:11.340 --> 02:12.640
click discovery here.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.280
So let's add another.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.220
And that is the circle counter so you guys are you about how circle counters work.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.020
This is all the circle counterweights.

02:20.070 --> 02:28.860
I'm going to add I am the boss OK and I'm going to add anything right here.

02:28.890 --> 02:29.940
I'm going to add that.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.200
How much person walk how much person do I want.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.040
So I'm going to choose it to be 95.

02:34.050 --> 02:36.530
You can see how this is look at.

02:36.720 --> 02:42.420
Ok so I'm going to hit Turei here and then you can see that I'm done still here I'm going to go to scary

02:42.420 --> 02:44.170
here and I'm going to use it to be for it.

02:44.170 --> 02:46.190
You can see four are coming here.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.620
I'm going to triplicated from here to placated duplicated triplicated.

02:49.950 --> 02:56.160
And let's just bring in a trumpet tray here so you can see all these counters are right coming here

02:57.120 --> 02:57.960
as same.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.370
Exactly.

02:59.370 --> 02:59.840
Here we go.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.850
I can get the full If I want to.

03:01.950 --> 03:02.390
OK.

03:02.460 --> 03:03.440
So you can see that.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.420
Now we're also done with the counters as well.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.080
So let's go to the new one.

03:08.130 --> 03:09.480
Let's go to the regular array here.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.440
You can also design this if you want to.

03:11.690 --> 03:12.090
OK.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.850
So let's come here and let's add this right here and here.

03:17.660 --> 03:23.290
We want to add So basically let's come here and let's change the size of it.

03:23.430 --> 03:23.890
OK.

03:23.950 --> 03:28.510
If you guys do not know what you have we just came here to this circle and then you have to go to the

03:28.510 --> 03:30.540
text sizing.

03:30.630 --> 03:31.200
OK.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.560
And then you can choose the bet.

03:32.570 --> 03:37.020
So how you want it to be so you can decrease it increase it the way you want it.

03:37.030 --> 03:41.890
You can choose it and then you can also change the background color of the color color as well.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.260
So

03:45.580 --> 03:48.910
OK you can see this is how the circular color is in the background.

03:49.050 --> 03:49.530
OK.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.790
Like this.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.570
So this is great.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.070
You can also get the full.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.560
So you can see this is how the circle color is coming like here.

03:56.740 --> 04:00.970
So you can also remove full circle color if you want to remove this whole circle.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.340
You can also remove it from here.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.400
Now we have the sizing you can control it.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.500
We have spacing.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.810
We have the water we can also apply the water and the animation as well.

04:10.030 --> 04:17.360
So let's come here and let's basically come here and add the module of the cord.

04:17.430 --> 04:19.500
So you guys already know about how code works.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.100
We have the common Shrake here.

04:21.150 --> 04:26.570
So let's head the comments and you can see these are the comments tray here appearing we have show of

04:26.810 --> 04:31.660
author Avatar sure reply but then show common to count and then we have the from Ray here.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.590
Then we have the admin label.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.260
So this is the design right here.

04:35.390 --> 04:40.590
Let's come here and let's here let's just click here and let's save it.

04:41.020 --> 04:41.410
OK.

04:41.520 --> 04:47.410
So since this is a page we can not break this but you can see that here we can add the common trait

04:47.430 --> 04:51.740
here so Pursell people can comment on here and people can reply here.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.950
And this is how it will work.

04:53.070 --> 04:55.270
So let's see if this is working on the baid section.

04:55.320 --> 05:00.740
If these comments are appearing on the B section so that we can try if this works or not.

05:03.640 --> 05:09.260
OK now this is not coming on this but you can at it you have to just click edit page and then there

05:09.260 --> 05:10.540
is some settings for that.

05:10.670 --> 05:16.250
But this is usually done via the blog post so if you are editing the blog post then you can add that

05:16.320 --> 05:22.970
to comments section OK let's add the discussion right here and allow comments.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.390
It's out of date

05:30.600 --> 05:31.060
OK.

05:31.090 --> 05:37.870
And since this is a page and I would not recommend you to add comments on the page just because garments

05:37.900 --> 05:39.430
are not added in there.

05:39.490 --> 05:43.870
You can see now you can see that this Colman's right coming right like this.

05:43.870 --> 05:44.390
OK.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.510
So this is how it is working.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.200
If I just add any common tray here and I just said submit comment.

05:49.210 --> 05:52.170
You can see this comment will be submitted.

05:53.610 --> 05:54.180
Here we go.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.790
So let's get this guy right here.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.680
And let's save it.

05:59.730 --> 06:04.090
So now we have to work with another one and that will be the regular section.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.740
We have to just click this guy right here and then let's add one more.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.770
So we have to add contact form you already know we have the countdown timer countdown timer.

06:13.810 --> 06:14.920
So is amazing.

06:14.990 --> 06:20.420
So you can do it for sale products like any venue will create e-commerce Web site.

06:20.420 --> 06:26.440
I will show you that how they are so amazing and there is so best so you can just use that.

06:26.510 --> 06:28.550
How much how don't vote.

06:28.720 --> 06:35.590
Laurie you can see this is how I've chosen this date and our will be like how much are we want to our

06:35.600 --> 06:38.510
is 12 hours in minute is this.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.770
This is how the minute to minute is working.

06:40.790 --> 06:45.590
And this is how the countdown timers working that I have seven days left for the sale to end.

06:45.800 --> 06:51.830
So if I am running a sale on my verbiage to get every every order ill be having 25 percent off so I

06:51.830 --> 06:53.060
can throw the counter like that.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.290
So this is this looks also amazing.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.090
OK.

06:56.090 --> 06:56.860
I'm just going to come here.

06:56.870 --> 06:58.580
I'm going to make this throw the full with

07:02.700 --> 07:05.390
the read it.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.660
Safe make it full.

07:10.270 --> 07:13.040
Make this full.

07:13.390 --> 07:13.880
OK.

07:13.930 --> 07:14.620
Let's come here.

07:14.650 --> 07:17.240
Let's bring this and let's bring this right here.

07:17.350 --> 07:20.360
So I'm going to add a new section right here.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.470
Let's have a regular Ron Moore.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.560
Let's head for one.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.560
Let's go down and let's see that what are we left with.

07:26.570 --> 07:28.450
So we have conduct farm counting timer.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.480
There's an e-mail optin.

07:30.510 --> 07:36.810
This is used for the subtribe farm that you can add the MailChimp integration into this.

07:36.940 --> 07:37.340
OK.

07:37.420 --> 07:41.970
So you can select a list you can select the mail provider and then you can select a list.

07:41.980 --> 07:44.000
And this is how this bill works like this.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.990
I will show you how you can Varjak for the MailChimp later on.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.760
And we will be doing that e-mail marketing.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.590
OK.

07:49.720 --> 07:56.250
So let's come here let's just add a full regular Rabbids right now here again and let's have a full

07:56.250 --> 08:02.850
one so I'm going to add right now would be portfolio so we will be looking for it for you in the upcoming

08:02.850 --> 08:07.460
video that we have the gallery right here so you can show that gallery right here if you want to.

08:07.710 --> 08:08.240
OK.

08:08.330 --> 08:11.440
And we'll show you all the all the images that you have right here.

08:11.490 --> 08:11.890
Okay.

08:11.910 --> 08:17.040
So it will show your gallery if you want to show the gallery where you can display the images that how

08:17.040 --> 08:18.880
you want the images to to be displayed.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.780
So you can show five images.

08:20.880 --> 08:25.230
Then you have the elements you can show title and caption If you don't want to show that pagination

08:25.410 --> 08:27.250
You can also hide the page anation as well.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.010
OK let's come here to this camera here and let's use it to be.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.850
Let's come here to the elements.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.360
That's from here to the background and the Edmon level.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.710
You can see everything is looking totally ok.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.640
I'm going to go to the layout right now and you can see this is created.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.030
And the thumbnail orientation is landscape.

08:43.030 --> 08:46.800
I can also shift it to tree and poor grateful be like this.

08:48.430 --> 08:48.890
OK.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.160
Like iPhone mode.

08:50.490 --> 08:50.960
OK.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.360
Like phone MORENO-CAMPO not just promoting the iPhone now.

08:54.440 --> 08:59.510
I used to get so many e-mails saying that I always promote iPhone too.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.220
I'm sorry guys if I have done that.

09:02.250 --> 09:07.290
So what I'm going to do Greg Now I want to make this amazing so I'm going to come here to rural setting.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.870
I'm going to go to design right here.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.670
I'm going to go to the alignment sizing and then make it full.

09:11.790 --> 09:12.270
OK.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.790
Also when I go to the custom.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.240
And I'm going to make it fun.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.900
So you can see they are now coming like this.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.240
So this is how it breaking.

09:20.250 --> 09:24.250
You can also equalize column height so it looks amazing.

09:24.260 --> 09:24.830
OK.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.540
Now let's come here and let's hit this and you can see how this is looking.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.000
I'm going to go down right here.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.360
And let's add one more.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.230
So I'm going to add the regular array here.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.550
Let's get a full with.

09:36.870 --> 09:41.140
And let's go down there we have the log in tab.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.850
So this will be four if you want to design your log in page that people can come here.

09:45.900 --> 09:49.230
Log into your website so you can also work with that as well.

09:49.290 --> 09:49.770
OK.

09:49.770 --> 09:54.180
I'm going to come here and here you can see this is the log in user name and password so I can design

09:54.180 --> 09:55.870
this as well if I want to design.

09:56.070 --> 10:02.060
And if the person is logged in then it's just well you can also you have to forget your password also.

10:02.100 --> 10:06.220
This will redirect him to the WP log in that speech be you forget password.

10:06.240 --> 10:06.670
OK.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.510
So you can also work with this.

10:09.510 --> 10:12.230
You can also redirect them redirect to the current page.

10:12.390 --> 10:15.390
Ok then we have the background we have the design right here.

10:15.390 --> 10:17.310
You can also design this as well.

10:17.340 --> 10:22.470
So you guys already know about the designing that how you run the farm field color or background color

10:22.500 --> 10:24.580
and everything and the burden colored as well.

10:24.750 --> 10:30.130
So you can choose Custom style for and I need order really badly.

10:30.150 --> 10:34.390
Well you can see how these icons are coming to get pretty well do that.

10:34.570 --> 10:37.840
I'm just going to click here and I'm going to click here right again.

10:38.680 --> 10:43.480
When I have to click wrigglers I'm going to use the full width right now and I'm going to choose

10:47.230 --> 10:53.230
because I now know about the map we know about the number of counter we gays have to find about the

10:53.230 --> 10:53.990
person.

10:54.070 --> 10:59.530
So you can add the person like you can add a team section in the About section where you can show your

10:59.530 --> 11:06.970
team members OK you can just come here you have to enter the name of the person OK the position he is

11:06.970 --> 11:13.840
the CEO of this and the Facebook profile you were real the Twitter profile Google Plus profiling Lincoln

11:13.850 --> 11:16.450
profile and you can see this is coming right here.

11:16.450 --> 11:34.090
You can also show the description and Ziel or Amaan is the current CEO of this crap company OK.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.140
Right but my girlfriend doesn't like it.

11:47.160 --> 11:47.940
OK.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.750

11:49.780 --> 11:54.400
So you can add this profile if you want to add the person details.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.470
This is how you can add it.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.080

This is also great.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.100
OK let's add it.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.690
You can see how this is going to look

14:00.160 --> 14:02.430
premise takes link next Dick's link categories.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.260
Let's select in the same category.

14:04.360 --> 14:09.480

14:10.270 --> 14:15.960
So I'm going to come here and here you can see that we are done with the person right here the portfolio.

14:15.970 --> 14:21.130
And we also are done with the post navigations Let's come here at the post navigation right here and

14:21.220 --> 14:26.770
let's come here to the categories so we need to add the categories right here in the same category.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.510
OK and here would be the taxonomies.

14:31.540 --> 14:36.640
So I want to add the taxonomy name so here would be the Uncategorized

14:39.220 --> 14:40.540
Let's see if this works.

14:44.180 --> 14:47.470
So I don't know why aren't doing this.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.100
Everything gets lost.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.600
And this is just going crazy.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.230
I don't know why this is happening.

14:53.570 --> 14:56.080
This is a bug that he has right now.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.780
So you can are sure the board navigation settings right now.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.910
I hope they just add the update soon.

15:01.910 --> 15:05.150
I don't know why you can see that my pages are unresponsive.

15:05.150 --> 15:08.660
My PC fan is just like.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.590
And it's just like this you can see page and responsa.

15:11.670 --> 15:22.090
So I just have to click extirpate OK let's come here and let's refresh this so on refreshing this you'll

15:22.090 --> 15:25.820
see your below so don't be doing panic OK.

15:25.900 --> 15:31.720
If you are doing side by side to me you have to just click restore and every day will be given back

15:31.720 --> 15:32.010
to you.

15:32.010 --> 15:32.510
OK.

15:32.590 --> 15:36.480
So this is our it is I'm just going to come here and let's add a new section right here.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.030
OK.

15:37.030 --> 15:41.090
I want to come here and I wanted to hit this guy right here because it does suck.

15:41.110 --> 15:45.460
So I want to come here and I want to go down and

15:48.780 --> 15:52.600
we have the post later so you guys already knew about how the pull slider works.

15:52.750 --> 15:57.460
We added that in the full post later we have this search bar so you can also add the search bar and

15:57.460 --> 15:58.310
then we have the shot.

15:58.330 --> 16:03.400
So we will be working up at the shop door on my car and we will be creating e-commerce website then

16:03.400 --> 16:06.240
we will show the shop because we don't have it right now.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.510
So that is why we cannot add them seem like that.

16:08.530 --> 16:13.700
We can also add the sidebar that how we can add to if I just click here sidebar or you can see I can

16:13.700 --> 16:18.330
still like the vivid areas if I just select site Barbizon you can see you'll see that these sidebar

16:18.350 --> 16:20.870
fidgets will appear like here.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.160
This is how they're coming.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.490
OK so now let's hit this.

16:24.490 --> 16:27.240
You can also just make it look like the sidebar.

16:27.370 --> 16:28.420
So if I just come here

16:31.980 --> 16:37.770
and I just increase the size of fit then I can see how they're coming.

16:37.970 --> 16:42.620
If you just make it the full width and then I have to come here to the settings right here and then

16:42.620 --> 16:47.540
I have to go to design the layout and show water separator.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.740
So orientation is great.

16:49.820 --> 16:52.610
So I can align this anywhere OK.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.710
So I'm going to come here and I want to just make it full.

16:56.810 --> 17:02.490
Now let's come here and let's just click this guy right here and we need to add one more.

17:02.610 --> 17:06.610
Let's come here to the regular array here and let's have the full.

17:06.650 --> 17:11.130
So I'm going to go down and then I go down till you find a new one.

17:13.430 --> 17:17.150
So we have this layer player and the last one we have is the social media follow.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.210
You can add them.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.390
These are old so ready to trade for them say two.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.870
I mean it's like the social end for this is the Facebook.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.650
I mean at a link I'm going to link Crais here hash.

17:26.660 --> 17:30.340
Hey And then I'm going to add the background if I want to add the background color.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.130
I can also add the background color.

17:32.150 --> 17:38.260
I'm going to go back I'm going to add a new one and this is going to be the trigger.

17:38.720 --> 17:44.570
So I'm going to go back and get a new one this is going to be Google Plus I'm going to add a new one

17:44.930 --> 17:45.830
and this is going to be

17:48.750 --> 17:50.310
the Pinterest.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.050
I'm going to go back and I'm going to add one more.

17:53.050 --> 17:55.500
So this is going to be the Instagram.

17:55.540 --> 17:58.360
So I'm going to come here to the design right here.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.310
Let's design it so you can go to the spacing right here.

18:01.390 --> 18:06.090
You can go to the border right here you can go to the box châteaux filters and everything.

18:06.380 --> 18:06.670
OK.

18:06.670 --> 18:13.060
And then we go to this guy right here and go to the design and then we can work with the alignment of

18:13.060 --> 18:17.050
there so Fiola if you want to align the center we can also change the text of it.

18:17.160 --> 18:17.600
OK.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.380
We can also change the sizing

18:21.730 --> 18:25.470
spacing and the border and everything like here.

18:25.630 --> 18:30.700
OK I can go to the Condon's Ray here and then I go to the icon and then you can see that I have the

18:30.700 --> 18:32.190
follow Bordin right here.

18:32.200 --> 18:32.580
OK.

18:32.650 --> 18:33.910
So you can also do it like this.

18:33.910 --> 18:39.220
We have the back from Ray here and then we have the admin label so you can pretty we'll manage it like

18:39.220 --> 18:40.810
how you want it to be.

18:46.140 --> 18:50.400
OK if you want to increase the sizing of this you can just add some padding.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.740
OK let's come here to the dark shadow.

18:53.870 --> 18:59.980
And then we have these settings right here so you can see this is how the social media Faldo works.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.080
OK so now what we want to do we want to just click here and now here I want to add one more section

19:07.620 --> 19:09.380
and that will be a regular again.

19:09.450 --> 19:11.320
And I want it to be full with.

19:11.400 --> 19:16.560
Let's go down and here we have the data right here.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.460
So let's add these Dabbs OK.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.780
In these times what you can do.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.440
You can just add it you can add the title boy here.

19:24.500 --> 19:24.830
OK.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.660
And then here would be the conduct.

19:28.850 --> 19:34.520
So let's come here to the Lipscombe feed slash.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.190
OK.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.780
And I want to grab these right here.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.170
So I want to grab this ball.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.730
OK let's copy.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.380
Come here.

19:41.390 --> 19:45.620
Alex pasted right here and now here we can add some two right here.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.450
So this is how it's going to work.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.810
This is an example of that if you want to add one more.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.350
And then here you can add some.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.120
So this is how this is going to work.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.330
Let me add one more.

19:58.470 --> 20:00.570
Let me just skim Here let me get it.

20:03.830 --> 20:04.230
OK.

20:04.250 --> 20:08.540
Now if I just click here you can see how this is coming so if I just click here this one is coming if

20:08.540 --> 20:10.010
I just click here this one is coming.

20:10.010 --> 20:14.180
So this is how you can pretty well manage it that how you want the next step to be.

20:14.270 --> 20:16.220
And you can just edited from this site only.

20:16.310 --> 20:16.720
OK.

20:16.790 --> 20:18.420
So this is how these tab works.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.930
I'm going to click here and I'm going to hit regular right here and I need a full again.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.720
And here we want to work with.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.390
OK so we haven't very good pricing tables right here.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.010
So let's add these pricing tables.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.090
I'm going to click here.

20:34.870 --> 20:36.450
And you can see Deore here.

20:36.630 --> 20:40.260
I'm going to come here and here should be the title to my desk title is going to be

20:44.520 --> 20:47.720
super plan OK.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.200
The subtitle will be subtitle

20:52.860 --> 20:59.220
best for that developer.

20:59.450 --> 21:08.060
And then here would be the currencies from currencies dollar.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.790
And then here is bar.

21:09.910 --> 21:15.050
So if your pricing is subscription based input the subscription payments you'll hear it.

21:15.070 --> 21:22.060
So I just wanted to add the price range here so you can see this is 45 per

21:25.740 --> 21:26.230
OK.

21:26.310 --> 21:29.130
So this is how it is going to go from here to the x ray here.

21:29.250 --> 21:33.590
And this is going to be by now.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.630
OK.

21:34.910 --> 21:37.270
Now here we want to add the context right here.

21:37.290 --> 21:48.160
So in the context we can add pretty well anything.

21:48.430 --> 21:50.110
Now I'm going to come here to the link right here.

21:50.170 --> 21:55.550
And this link is going to be hash.

21:55.820 --> 21:56.150
OK.

21:56.180 --> 22:00.530
What I have to do right now I need to go to the background so I can also manage the background right

22:00.530 --> 22:00.780
here.

22:00.800 --> 22:07.130
I'm going to come here and I am going to just do not show the bullet.

22:07.310 --> 22:10.500
I'm going to copy this and triplicated form one more.

22:10.550 --> 22:11.050
OK.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.430
We have three plans right here.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.000
I'm going to change this plan to be

22:17.220 --> 22:19.920
super duper plan.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.520
Sorry DUPERE plan.

22:23.600 --> 22:28.990
Best for freelancer.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.070
OK.

22:30.200 --> 22:38.170
And here we can also change this to be gorilla plants best for

22:40.850 --> 22:41.620
Goldilocks.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.220
OK.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.660
There we go.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.130
You can see this is how it is looking.

22:44.130 --> 22:48.750
We have the Bino option as well and everything is looking cool Ray here still here.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.930
I'm going to go back.

22:49.930 --> 22:52.050
I'm going to go to the design right here and I'm going to go to the lab.

22:52.050 --> 22:54.410
So we have the feature table background color.

22:54.510 --> 22:56.790
We can also make anything that featured.

22:57.030 --> 22:58.440
Hey I'm going to click here.

22:58.500 --> 23:02.960
This guy right here and I'm going to go to the text right here.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.470
Let's go down and

23:09.910 --> 23:13.060
OK let's just click this guy right here.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.180
OK.

23:14.190 --> 23:21.600
Let's get him here.

23:21.970 --> 23:29.320
Let's go back let's get him here to the elements so OK well I want to I want to go from here to this

23:29.320 --> 23:32.760
guy right here and the bullet if you don't want to shoot the bullet tray here.

23:32.980 --> 23:33.270
OK.

23:33.350 --> 23:34.580
We have to lay out tray.

23:34.590 --> 23:37.300
Here's a feature table back color would be.

23:37.300 --> 23:42.160
So if you want to make any one feature you can also make the feature center item list because we want

23:42.160 --> 23:43.050
to center them.

23:43.210 --> 23:43.890
OK.

23:43.940 --> 23:48.230
And the currency and frequency d'Este.

23:48.390 --> 23:51.360
So you can make it like how you want the frequency to be.

23:51.480 --> 23:56.850
And we have the default currency so you can also change it like if you change it you can see this is

23:56.850 --> 23:59.570
changed to dollar month per month like this.

23:59.580 --> 24:00.440
OK.
