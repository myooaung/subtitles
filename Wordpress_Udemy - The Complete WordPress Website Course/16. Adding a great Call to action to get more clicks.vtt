00:00.980 --> 00:05.680
WHAT DOES IT guys and what KMAX so I'm going to be making some changes right here.

00:05.870 --> 00:06.800
OK what I'm going to do.

00:06.830 --> 00:12.860
I'm just going to come here and I want to change the color of it because it is just matching everything

00:12.860 --> 00:15.290
and it is not looking a bit cool.

00:15.400 --> 00:15.740
OK.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.990
I want to change the color of it and not the full but a little bit.

00:19.980 --> 00:24.920
So I'm going to come here I want to go to the style and when I come here to color I don't want to increase

00:24.920 --> 00:28.000
the color the depth of this.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.330
So I want to increase it a bit.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.190
Increase it.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.060
Increase it.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.380
And this looks cool.

00:32.530 --> 00:32.870
OK.

00:32.960 --> 00:38.670
If I just said this you can see how this is looking so I have this one go down.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.160
And I have this one I can do.

00:41.360 --> 00:41.860
OK.

00:41.870 --> 00:50.510
So what you what I can do once if someone brings his mouse over it then it colors should be changed

00:50.690 --> 00:51.170
changed.

00:51.170 --> 00:51.530
OK.

00:51.620 --> 00:56.450
So I'm going to come here to Hoover and I want to come here to color and at once if someone brings this

00:56.450 --> 01:00.650
mouse then its color should be this one it's color should match this one.

01:00.650 --> 01:01.010
OK.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.440
So it's Gallo's should be a little a little bit changed.

01:03.460 --> 01:04.050
OK.

01:04.190 --> 01:11.130
And now let's come here to save and let's save and let's print let's just come here and here and see

01:11.190 --> 01:13.940
how this is looking so we have what I can do.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.790
So if I bring my mouse you can see this is changing

01:21.170 --> 01:24.350
or if you don't want it to change then you can also keep that.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.300
And if you want the color to be totally changed then you can also make it to be plac.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.300
So you can see that if I print my mouse sre here this is changing to be Plock.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.260
You can go with the Crais a bit of KHRAIS

01:42.570 --> 01:45.800
OK so you can change it anywhere you want.

01:45.800 --> 01:52.270
Any how you want but I don't think so if I need anything on over so I just need it to need this to keep

01:52.640 --> 02:00.710

02:06.320 --> 02:08.380
to action but to hire me.

02:08.530 --> 02:09.010
OK.

02:09.050 --> 02:11.180
