So this is right here and I'm just going to add change

03:20.480 --> 03:23.610
currency and question right.

03:23.710 --> 03:24.660
I'm going to say.

03:24.950 --> 03:28.210
So let's come here and let's have a look at our site so how it is looking.

03:28.480 --> 03:28.820
Okay.

03:28.820 --> 03:34.120
I just go to the seven that completed will be course dot com and then I go to the shop.

03:34.140 --> 03:38.030
So the shop age I should be seeing that sidebar.

03:38.410 --> 03:38.840
OK.

03:38.890 --> 03:39.780
Change currency.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.630
This is said to GBP and you're going to choose a peak here and it should be changing the currency so

03:44.630 --> 03:46.810
you can see the pages automatically loading.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.320
And I can see this is now set to be change.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.000
The currency is automatically changed.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.750
So this is how this plug in works.

03:53.780 --> 03:54.340
OK.

03:54.650 --> 03:56.260
So number Dhanbad this plug in.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.170
Okay let's just use a different plug in to test.

03:59.240 --> 03:59.990
How does it work.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.480
I'm just going to go to install plug in right now and I'm going to remove this plug in.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.550
This is called the FMEA multi currency and it's going to deactivate this.

04:07.570 --> 04:10.240
And let's use another one let's just go with the different plug in.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.030
And let's see how that plug in works.

04:12.070 --> 04:19.420
OK I'm just going to go with multi currency search and it should be here.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.770
So let's just go with this one that has the most installation and

04:29.090 --> 04:31.160
ok like this.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.590
And you can see this is installing right now.

04:33.890 --> 04:39.950
So after this is installed I'm just going to activate and this should be activated so you can see this

04:39.950 --> 04:41.830
plug in will be activated in a minute.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.680
Here we go.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.080
Where is the multi-grain.

04:45.110 --> 04:52.020
Yes this is the one so rule multi-grain see I'm just going to have settings right now so it should be

04:52.020 --> 04:54.090
taking me to the settings of that.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.620
So here we have this.

04:56.760 --> 05:03.570
Enable Yes we want to enable and we have the fixed price visible regular price and sale price for each

05:03.570 --> 05:08.320
product you can fill price correctly that is on the base currency rate.

05:08.370 --> 05:14.520
So we have the default one this is this I want to add one more currency and that will be

05:18.210 --> 05:18.750
this.

05:18.900 --> 05:19.310
OK.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.400
And I want this to be default though the default is the GBP pound sterling.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.180
So this is the raid that is automatically coming and the number of decimal is also coming.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.870
I also want to add the USD.

05:30.140 --> 05:30.580
OK.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.150
Please upgrade to pro-Russian if you need two currencies.

05:33.150 --> 05:34.080
OK.

05:34.890 --> 05:41.730
So and I can see that I need to update to probation if I want to add more than that so I can just go

05:41.780 --> 05:43.600
into categories that's all.

05:43.910 --> 05:44.560
OK.

05:44.630 --> 05:48.160
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to save.

05:48.540 --> 05:54.090
OK and now what I have to do I have to just go to location and this is auto detect.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.050
OK.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.010
Auto select currency.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.040
OK.

05:58.290 --> 05:59.760
Currency by country.

05:59.760 --> 06:06.240
So this will be all said the currency by country so if someone is from this country then it will automatically

06:06.240 --> 06:09.590
select the Pakistani currency from us.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.170
OK.

06:10.230 --> 06:11.340
And this will be so like dolls.

06:11.370 --> 06:15.300
If someone is from this ban it will not select the countries.

06:15.330 --> 06:20.140
I'm just going to remove that this country so that this should be from here.

06:20.730 --> 06:26.640
So now let's go ahead and let's go to let's just save it.

06:26.700 --> 06:29.010
I'm just going to say right now.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.980
And now I am going to just go to check out right now.

06:31.980 --> 06:33.560
So pay in many currencies.

06:33.560 --> 06:41.690
No we just want you to be in our currency so that there is no currency conversion taxes and other stuff.

06:41.790 --> 06:47.250
We have this select your currency so you can just add it here or here I want it to be right.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.390
And the designers this select your currency we have this design.

06:51.390 --> 06:53.460
We have the main colors that to this.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.890
I wanted to be a bit of brown So

07:02.130 --> 07:03.770
that is a brown man

07:06.420 --> 07:08.640
away I want to grab the color go.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.630
I want to go to visit Tate

07:15.120 --> 07:17.740
OK you can see this is how select your currency.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.020
OK.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.290
I want to I want to grab that color.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.260
So color code would be this one.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.460
So now let's see.

07:28.660 --> 07:32.170
Let's just come here and let's add this so the color code here.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.180
I'm just going to paste it.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.620
You can see the colloquies right here.

07:35.620 --> 07:41.470
And then we have a table currencies bar displays on check out Basan card page and other pages so I'm

07:41.470 --> 07:42.000
just going to go ahead.

07:42.010 --> 07:43.540
I'm going to save right now.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.540
OK.

07:45.670 --> 07:49.200
And now let's go ahead and let's have a look at those sites you can see if I just come here and I just

07:49.200 --> 07:50.040
refresh it.

07:51.880 --> 07:57.300
You can see this will be now turned to brown so select your currency and just select it to be Patteson

07:57.310 --> 07:59.780
entropy and it'll turn into that.

08:00.130 --> 08:00.770
OK.

08:00.790 --> 08:06.690
And then I go down and then you will see that the currency is now in this.

08:07.090 --> 08:10.430
OK so I think this plug in is much better than the bad.

08:10.430 --> 08:11.990
So I just like this one.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.330
But if you need more currencies you need to upgrade to pro-woman I just hate about this feature.

08:16.540 --> 08:19.300
So you can just play this feature in I think

08:24.330 --> 08:25.290
it is a pro version

08:33.240 --> 08:35.870
newcomer's multi-color ency.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.690
This is the version to me just click here and you can see this right here.

08:39.690 --> 08:46.590
So this is a promotion that says that is for 25 bucks so you can just pro-change this version and then

08:46.590 --> 08:49.370
you can have more currencies if you want to.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.160
OK.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.690
So now we're totally done with the currency conversion as well.

08:54.850 --> 09:01.460
OK we have added this much OK you can see what I would recommend you to choose this one.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.260
There are two currencies only if you want to add some more.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.140
I think this just works totally OK.

09:06.140 --> 09:10.040
Let's see if our website is mobile optimized.

09:10.190 --> 09:12.010
So this is also mobile optimized.

09:12.010 --> 09:17.360
You can see that currency Kurn murder is also mobile optimized and everything is mobile optimized.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.030
Let's just go here and let's just see our shop.

09:20.030 --> 09:23.310
So I want to go to shoprite now.
