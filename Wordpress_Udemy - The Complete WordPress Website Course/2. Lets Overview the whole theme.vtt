01:02.250 --> 01:04.830
So here I can add the product description right now.

This is the image right now.

01:57.650 --> 02:01.880

02:01.970 --> 02:05.670
And here is everything taken t everything is right.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.740
Coming here the details are coming here and the description is also coming years.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.960
This theme is pretty cool of bad.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.190
OK.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.070
And you can also create And just for you of the categories as well and everything.

02:17.090 --> 02:19.740
So let's just go ahead and let's just review our dashboard.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.780
OK what we have to do is that we have to first come here with the settings and then we have to review

02:23.780 --> 02:29.940
the dashboard so and customize the look and feel of your website by just click going get a very press

02:29.940 --> 02:32.300
customized are really customizing this later on.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.710
We are here to overview this.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.170
Phoebe Kohn Is this you guys already know about it.

02:36.350 --> 02:43.860
And then we have the social so in here I have to just enter this and enter this so like this will be

02:43.860 --> 02:48.870
like Twitter ID and this you have to enter your Twitter ID and Facebook ID here.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.770
And then we have the analytics code.

02:51.150 --> 02:56.620
You can just enter your Google Analytics just to check everything like how much viewers you have.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.360
I'll be just explaining you later on when we will move forward.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.450
So then we have this Google Maps.

03:02.550 --> 03:06.480
OK you can just grab the API key just for that to work.

03:06.480 --> 03:12.240
So you guys already know that in the DV team we work for that Google Map API seems like this we have

03:12.240 --> 03:13.260
to just go ahead.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.650
We need to grab the API.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.930
I haven't just open this up and here you can see it should be open.

03:18.930 --> 03:22.520
This is right here and here it is get a key.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.190
I want to grab the query now.

03:29.660 --> 03:34.540
And in here it says select the projects I'm just going to select the project I'm going to hit next.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.530
And you have to create a new project since we have already created the project and we were just working

03:39.530 --> 03:40.200
with the DV.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.680
That is why I'll be using this one.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.040
I'm just going to copy it.

03:43.360 --> 03:43.810
OK.

03:43.940 --> 03:47.570
And I'm going to come here and I'm going to paste it right now so you can see this is pasted

03:51.020 --> 03:51.550
OK.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.020
And now we have the search.

03:53.040 --> 03:58.940
So the search will basically exclude the exclude from search result pages will be excluded.

03:59.100 --> 04:05.130
The blog post will be excluded and the refined price later use a price later instead of in book feels

04:05.130 --> 04:07.670
refined search for that and then we have the home base.

04:07.680 --> 04:13.250
So this will be the home page like if we just come here and we just want to view our website again see.

04:13.530 --> 04:16.310
Here it is home.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.770
This and everything is coming right here.

04:18.930 --> 04:19.480
OK.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.320
So here is Home Page.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.640
Welcome to our website.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.780

We are number one classified listing become a free member and start listing of upset in minutes.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.460
So this is basically the home page that we have right now.

04:34.840 --> 04:41.380
But this is like that if I just come here and I just open this up in an incognito window that I also

04:41.410 --> 04:42.770
let's see however say it looks

04:46.890 --> 04:47.180
OK.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.600
This is how it is looking OK it's safe to say let's show classified ads.

04:51.720 --> 04:56.030
We are number one that does this and register now just to get started.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.290
So this is how it is looking.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.370
OK.

04:59.380 --> 05:08.230
Then we have new ads so if anyone wants to post an ad and it says please and the fill fields below required

05:08.230 --> 05:13.900

05:46.000 --> 05:48.180
So you can see on just clicking create account.

05:48.270 --> 05:50.540
You can check your email for a new password.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.690
So I'm just going to go ahead.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.420
I'm going to go to my e-mail right now and I'm going to check that e-mail for the password that they

05:55.420 --> 05:56.270
have given.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.380
So I'm just going to come here and you can see your new username and password too.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.240
I'm going to I'm here I'm going to copy the password that I have got.

06:04.420 --> 06:07.170
This is the password and it's going to come here and I'm going to copy it.

06:08.530 --> 06:08.930
OK.

06:09.130 --> 06:12.660
And now I'm going to come here and I'm going just going to come here and I'm going to enter it.

06:12.670 --> 06:17.010
So these are names should be this and the password should be the one that I have entered.

06:17.200 --> 06:17.620
OK.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.850
And I'm going to hit Logan.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.770
So this is going to lock myself in right now and I'm logged in right now.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.970
You can see how this is looking.

06:23.980 --> 06:31.060
I can just go to my dashboard right now and then here I can just also just work that my my profile like

06:31.060 --> 06:33.270
here at a profile.

06:33.290 --> 06:37.400
Again the senator my first name last name my picture can also be coming here.

06:37.450 --> 06:41.500
I can enter my Facebook and I can even generate any password I can hide it and I can

06:45.000 --> 06:48.630
just enter a new password here so you can see this is right here.

06:48.630 --> 06:50.270
Active membership back back.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.880
And so we don't have any of the membership back that is why this is not coming here.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.320
OK.

06:54.510 --> 06:59.310
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going ahead of the profile and you can see that my password has

06:59.310 --> 07:00.490
been changed right now.

07:00.630 --> 07:05.850
So this is how a user can just go ahead and change his password so he can see that we have some featured

07:05.850 --> 07:08.990
listing as well and everything coming here.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Now let's go ahead and let's just come here to this one right here.

07:13.020 --> 07:16.600
So if anyone is just going to post a new ad.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.200
OK.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.790
So let's suppose that this guy come here and he just wants to post a new ad.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.460
OK submit your listing OK.

07:23.490 --> 07:24.530
Please fill in this.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.370
And so this is right coming here.

07:26.370 --> 07:27.610
Exactly.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.990
If I just come here and I just make it like bring it here.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.230
OK.

07:32.670 --> 07:38.730
Let's just bring it right here and bring this one right here so you can see I mean see new ad this is

07:38.820 --> 07:41.660
exactly same as this one right here.

07:41.710 --> 07:46.290
So you can see how this is looking and then we have the membership package that that you would like

07:46.290 --> 07:47.480
to purchase for your accounts.

07:47.490 --> 07:51.210
If you just go to the home page right now and then we go down and

07:54.580 --> 08:01.720
manage ads I have to just said protégées a membership back frequency and say Please select a membership

08:01.720 --> 08:06.810
package that you want that you want to describe and everything is coming here so you can just edited

08:06.850 --> 08:08.670
and it'll be edited here.

08:08.950 --> 08:09.640
OK.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.200
And then we have the terms and conditions so Terms and Conditions will be available when you are posting

08:14.200 --> 08:18.510
an ad so I showed you that how can a guy can post an ad.

08:18.710 --> 08:19.410
OK.

08:19.450 --> 08:25.210
And now what we have to do is that we have to just break into categories.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.270
So here we have the categories menu.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.630
So here in the menu it's going to show the count how many display the number of ads next to the category

08:32.630 --> 08:32.890
name.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.450
So we don't want to show the number.

08:34.670 --> 08:35.960
Hide the empty categories.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.930
Obviously we want to hide the camp to get agrees that does not have any of the product.

08:40.070 --> 08:41.620
But I'll be showing up right now.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.190
OK.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.200
Because I want to show everything OK and then we have.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.060
But if you are selecting it if you are creating it then make sure to hide the empty category since we

08:50.060 --> 08:51.320
don't have so many ads.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.810
That is why we cannot show them.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.870
And I would recommend you one more thing is that if you are creating a classified website then please

08:57.140 --> 09:05.920
make sure that you do not look for me say that that you do not charge them for the advertisement.

09:05.920 --> 09:11.480
Keep it free so that so many people can come they can post the ad and once they posted they should get

09:11.480 --> 09:12.020
the result.

09:12.020 --> 09:15.440
It will be increased day by day day by day day by day.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.810
And then you will start.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.960
You can start getting to pay them.

09:19.090 --> 09:19.680
OK.

09:19.730 --> 09:25.610
Please do not just add that in and tell them to pay first because your website is just starting and

09:25.610 --> 09:26.900
you should not charge them.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.720
There are so many free Web sites for people who can be where people can dispose their add to why they'll

09:31.730 --> 09:35.630
come here and post your ads so they can see that we have the category Dept.

09:35.630 --> 09:40.430
It should be three like the number of levels that the category can go into deep so you can see that

09:40.670 --> 09:42.560
how many subcategories we can create.

09:42.580 --> 09:45.490
It should be like three or you can just like show all.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.900
So you can and I'll be just going up into default.

09:47.900 --> 09:53.560
You can select that how many deep categories you want it to be like for the phones you can dislike iPhone

09:53.930 --> 09:58.610
Android or Windows and you can not go beyond that like if you want to create a new more category that

09:58.610 --> 10:04.490
will not be displayed under that so you can dislike the like to show all to like all categories should

10:04.490 --> 10:05.110
be shown.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.840
And then we have the categories page.

10:06.890 --> 10:08.610
So this is like categories and menu.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.330
OK.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.460
And then we have the categories page.

10:12.020 --> 10:16.670
So anywhere we want to work with the categories page we have the show all OK and we have the category

10:16.670 --> 10:22.150
depth and it should be able to show all the number of levels that the category should display or have

10:22.150 --> 10:26.430
show count height empty and the number of columns.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.880
You can also choose a column like how many columns you want.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.860
I'll choose three and then we have the search categories like.

10:33.170 --> 10:37.050
It will show off and this will be coming up like this.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.730
Do you guys already know that what is here actually is.

10:39.730 --> 10:44.100
We have already Verd when we go creating our e-commerce based website.

10:44.510 --> 10:45.060
OK.

10:45.080 --> 10:51.980
So when we were creating our e-commerce website be free for this type of category here now you can see

10:52.310 --> 10:58.970
that when we were creating this Web site if you just go to Shop-Rite Now you can see this is basically

10:58.970 --> 11:03.990
called here at Chih.

11:04.030 --> 11:07.110
So then we have the Showground and then we have the Hyde M.D.

11:07.120 --> 11:11.080
So this is also coming right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say right now and then

11:11.080 --> 11:15.480
we have the listings so in the listing we would be having all the listing that overpersuade have.

11:15.480 --> 11:21.930
So it's these allow users to edit and publish their ad obviously or no once they publish it they can

11:21.930 --> 11:22.850
not edit.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.490
OK.

11:23.560 --> 11:29.060
And then we have the relisting allow users to relist and pay for that expired ad listing.

11:29.320 --> 11:34.740
It's like 90 days each ad will be listed in the paper in boasting allow users to post in top level of

11:34.740 --> 11:35.690
high tech goodies.

11:35.730 --> 11:36.040
No

11:40.610 --> 11:48.690
allow paid in posting if said M-B and allows posting top level degrees only if they have no time to

11:48.700 --> 11:54.500
get tickets so you have to just sit like this and this or that if there is no subcategory then the main

11:54.500 --> 11:56.030
category will be selected.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.100
Otherwise it will not be selected.

11:58.130 --> 12:04.840
OK so then we have the enquiry form requires visitors to be logged in before they can contact owners.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.450
OK so this is like the most important.

12:07.460 --> 12:13.490
In most cases you should keep this set to no to encourage visitors to question without having to create

12:13.490 --> 12:13.880
an account.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.110
OK lets just said no.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.730
They can this question without creating that account.

12:17.950 --> 12:25.250
But permit users to use HTL mail within their settings turn on the tiny MCE editor on the text field

12:25.580 --> 12:29.260
and allow the ad owner to use HTL TMF.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.230
No no no no no.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.430
We don't want to allow them.

12:31.540 --> 12:31.950
OK.

12:32.150 --> 12:33.780
And then we have the view counter.

12:33.890 --> 12:36.500
It is like show page views counter on each ad.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
This is important until we have to show that.

12:38.630 --> 12:41.560
And then we have show a picture of the user on their ad listing.

12:41.660 --> 12:49.310
Yes moderate ads manually approve and publish each new ad you can understand this because even we were

12:49.310 --> 12:50.290
working with the commons.

12:50.300 --> 12:57.740
I showed you in detail everything edited ads manually approve and are dramatically removed expired Howard's

12:58.340 --> 12:59.310
listings obviously.

12:59.640 --> 13:06.190
OK and then we have the ad images allow images to allow the users to upload and display the image that

13:06.320 --> 13:08.540
Choire the images required at least one image.

13:08.540 --> 13:14.210
Obviously we want to require that at least one image for posting the ad so if anyone is going to post

13:14.240 --> 13:16.830
any ad then we want him direct fire saying.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.420
So then we have the max images C-Max images a user can upload to per listing.

13:21.620 --> 13:22.030
OK.

13:22.130 --> 13:26.780
So and then we have the max size so it can be like one M-B so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

13:26.780 --> 13:32.300
hit Savery now and you can see that we have the security and the security Saiz like back in Texas.

13:32.600 --> 13:39.110
It will be like the back end access would be to the Edmond's only or you can just like that the selected

13:39.110 --> 13:40.180
to be all access.

13:40.190 --> 13:40.740
OK.

13:40.790 --> 13:42.080
And then you have the recapture.

13:42.090 --> 13:47.070
So you guys already know about the recapture that is a free service that you can add and then it's going

13:47.070 --> 13:51.820
to it's going to just filter the bought.

13:51.870 --> 13:57.930
OK so if anyone is coming from the BART and then posting ads on Diom of say that the BART then it has

13:57.930 --> 14:01.790
this service that filled preven the barge to be posted that post the ads.

14:01.830 --> 14:02.650
OK.

14:02.670 --> 14:08.750
And then we have the advertising in the advertising we have like if you just come here and then we go

14:08.750 --> 14:14.900
ahead and view our Web so you can see we have a head right here had it right here.

14:15.050 --> 14:20.710
This is called basically advertising again and to record about Google Ad Sense or buy sell ads.

14:20.840 --> 14:25.810
And then you can add your advertisement and then earn some money.

14:25.950 --> 14:28.260
OK so you can move on with that.

14:28.290 --> 14:33.390
I just feel like I'm here and here we have the image so you can either create your image if you want

14:33.390 --> 14:40.290
to your specific ad or you can also have two options either to enter the cord from your Edisons or if

14:40.290 --> 14:46.800
you want to add a specific ad here of this size then you can add that image and then you can enter the

14:46.800 --> 14:47.470
you are into that.

14:47.490 --> 14:52.540
If anyone clicks there he'll be we do it to to you or else I'm just going to add like curial like each

14:52.560 --> 15:03.860
TTP as Collins last lash you to me dot com slash user slash and Zele grandma and three.

15:04.110 --> 15:04.510
OK.

15:04.690 --> 15:10.180
So if someone basically if anyone just come here and he just clicks on this ad.

15:10.360 --> 15:10.790
OK.

15:10.930 --> 15:16.550
So let's come here let's just refresh and you can see that if a guy clicks on this ad then we direct

15:16.550 --> 15:18.050
them to our website.

15:18.050 --> 15:22.440
So first of all we also have to upload the images.

15:22.490 --> 15:23.910
So this is also important.

15:23.920 --> 15:29.850
OK then it's all very commonly.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.120
So we have to

15:34.830 --> 15:41.190
upload the image OK let's just come here to from you or tell from media library

15:45.140 --> 15:46.220
what's your supply of this one.

15:46.230 --> 15:50.490
And turning to boast so you can see on just clicking there

15:54.820 --> 15:57.910
and on saving this you can see it should be available here.

15:59.510 --> 15:59.780
OK.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.270
This is not working.

16:01.470 --> 16:05.000
I don't know why this is not working.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.410
Displayed in the header.

16:06.780 --> 16:11.920
If I just come here and I just remove it and then I just said save changes.

16:12.120 --> 16:12.730
OK.

16:12.740 --> 16:15.790
And then let's come here and let's just search for it so you can see this is Rimmel.

16:15.810 --> 16:16.370
OK.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.130
This is breaking.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.700
If I just come here and I add and turned the cord.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.660
So if I just add the code right here

16:26.360 --> 16:26.840
OK.

16:27.080 --> 16:31.370
And then I come here and I just said Save genius so let's see if this works or not.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.690
Yes this is working OK.

16:34.780 --> 16:40.500
So now this is working OK you have to enter the image right now and then it'll work only.

16:40.510 --> 16:43.030
So you have to just grab the you are L-A of the image.

16:43.030 --> 16:49.620
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to copy to you or else basically inserting Dubost.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.350
This is not being inserted.

16:51.570 --> 16:52.650
There's going to come here.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.100
I'm just going to come here to me a.

16:55.430 --> 16:55.870
OK.

16:56.040 --> 17:01.100
And then I have to grab the link of this image so this is the link of the image OK.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.810
I'm going to open this up and this is the thing I'm just going to paste it right here.

17:05.130 --> 17:09.950
And let's come here and let's paste it into this box OK.

17:10.080 --> 17:15.050
And then let's come here and that's it save changes so I'm just saving the changes and refreshing this

17:15.920 --> 17:21.500
it will see this mean just coming and if someone clicks here he'll be redirected to my user profile.

17:21.530 --> 17:26.720
So you have to make sure that you use the image that is said to be like the size of the image should

17:26.720 --> 17:29.090
be of this size the size that is mentioned.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.380
The size.

17:30.470 --> 17:30.990
OK.

17:31.010 --> 17:34.160
I'm just going to I'm here and I'm not going to display anything in the header.

17:34.160 --> 17:34.580
OK.

17:34.650 --> 17:38.450
And let's just go ahead and let's just hit save changes so you can see.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.680
Nothing will be coming up here and this will be the normal Web site.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.050
OK everything is totally OK.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.750
So now let's go ahead and we have the advantage.

17:48.200 --> 17:55.670
And in here we have like recent stats and said expired the ads that are saying you can manually expire

17:55.670 --> 18:02.870
them those ads which are like older than 90 days OK because we have explained them in the listings that

18:02.900 --> 18:05.590
the ads are older than 90 days are set to be expired.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.060
OK.

18:06.200 --> 18:12.320
So then we have this right here a user and developer settings which you can go ahead and move on like

18:12.410 --> 18:17.480
light users create their own password hide WordPress toolbar for Wordpress logged in users.

18:17.480 --> 18:23.990
This is important because I don't want to show the toolbars if I just come here to open this up in the

18:23.980 --> 18:29.270
Incognito window and if I just come here and I'm just here then there should be no toolbar WordPress

18:29.270 --> 18:29.750
toolbar.

18:29.750 --> 18:34.590
OK this is like this so that anyone can not see that this is like I'm using WordPress.

18:34.610 --> 18:38.400
OK so you must just hide it because this is important.

18:38.550 --> 18:44.390
OK so these are the things that you can go ahead and you can move like disable log in page to anyone

18:44.390 --> 18:49.470
can not move to date word press dot log and up to you can also disable it.

18:49.610 --> 18:50.010
OK.

18:50.150 --> 18:52.560
And these are like developer's settings.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.050
You should not work for this.

18:54.050 --> 18:54.490
OK.

18:54.590 --> 18:56.620
So now we're totally done with this.

18:56.690 --> 18:59.990
Do not mess anything here guys just leave it as it is.

18:59.990 --> 19:01.690
So now we're totally done with this.

19:01.760 --> 19:07.250
And the next video will be working up for the posting of ads will be working up the categories and then

19:07.250 --> 19:10.050
move for more further Stadion guys.

19:10.070 --> 19:10.900
And by.
