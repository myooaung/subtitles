Now in this video we're going to be working for.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.070
We're going to create our own for a DVD builder.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.710

00:30.120 --> 00:34.490
So here I want to go to Gary here and I'm going to uncheck this because I don't want to show them.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.510
And let's have a look at it.

00:35.540 --> 00:40.070
Say that how our web say clokes OK.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.130

This is the left area which is coming in this fill up here.

00:46.160 --> 00:46.610
OK.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.520

00:53.430 --> 00:53.930
OK.

00:54.090 --> 00:57.430
And you can see everything is being looted totally OK.

01:03.790 --> 01:08.110
I want to add the footer and what I'm going to do I'm just going to click add a new section.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.570

01:10.570 --> 01:14.700
I'm going to click here and you can see I want to call them right here in my footer.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.760
The first one here would be the copyright.

01:16.780 --> 01:23.980
And then he would be called the action to my dad manual read the privacy policy and terms and conditions

01:23.980 --> 01:24.420

So I'm going to come here.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.940
I am just going to click here and I can see I just need to apply the background first.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.490
So you can also create a big footer like this for you can add to call them seek.

01:39.490 --> 01:45.670
It totally depends upon how you want to design your footer but I'm just going to tell you an example

04:53.600 --> 04:58.350
And then here I want to change the color of days to be white.

04:58.430 --> 04:59.450
So this is how it is looking.

04:59.450 --> 05:02.510
You can change the separate color to be different.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.100
All right.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.930

05:52.510 --> 05:56.080
Let's see like this and let's remove these codings that we added.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.320
So let's suppose that we haven't added any of

06:03.880 --> 06:04.900
the colors right here.

06:04.920 --> 06:10.060
OK I can see this is normal and this will be also turn to normal

06:13.010 --> 06:15.010
Let's remove the style from here.

06:15.010 --> 06:15.960

You can see this is totally OK and let's remove this span so you can see that we have removed every

06:21.490 --> 06:24.370

06:48.480 --> 06:52.560
No we have to change the color we cannot change it from this to.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.880
I'm just going to select it.

06:57.900 --> 07:09.120
I'm going to change its color to white.

07:09.270 --> 07:13.860

07:17.860 --> 07:18.610
OK.

07:19.210 --> 07:20.790

07:20.790 --> 07:23.160
I don't know why.

07:23.200 --> 07:23.640

07:57.540 --> 08:01.300
I'm like this someone to come here and I wanted to add the hash tag right now.

08:01.410 --> 08:01.890

Let's go to the design right here.

08:17.770 --> 08:22.210
Let's go to the text and let's fly into left.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.200
So here we go.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.490
This is how it is looking.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.640
You can give some padding to make it matching if you want to make it a bill.

08:28.660 --> 08:36.350
This is not matching so it can go to the spacing right here and give some padding.

08:37.030 --> 08:37.900
Five pixel.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.790
So this is now in a line.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.540
I don't know why

08:43.390 --> 08:44.100
to pick so.

08:44.180 --> 08:44.580
OK.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.130
On two pixels you can see this is totally in line.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.830
So I'm going to click here and you can see this is how my footer is looking.

08:51.140 --> 08:56.970

Now I can also make the changes I can also make it a little more closer to each other if I want to.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.620
So I'm going to come here.

09:03.620 --> 09:09.350
I can remove the spacing to the top right here and also to the bottom so I'm going to move this page

09:09.350 --> 09:11.390
from the whole bottom right here.

09:11.390 --> 09:11.650
OK.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.180
And I'm going to come here and I'm going to Haiti right now.

09:15.990 --> 09:16.690
That's it safe.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.690
And again see this is great totally ok.

09:21.730 --> 09:24.940
I'm going to come here and I'm going to try to view you say how it is looking.

OK if I just go to about page you will see this footer will not be there OK.

09:54.620 --> 09:59.330
So what I'm going to do I want to make this for global so that if I'm going to make changes in future

09:59.350 --> 10:05.530
of this footer I can make only one single and that will be applied to all of the things I can do that
