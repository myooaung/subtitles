00:00.240 --> 00:05.250
Hear what is the guys are welcome x and I can see that this is how our website is looking and our website

00:05.250 --> 00:10.950
is totally done we know everything about us about this word press and we can also award for the plug

00:10.950 --> 00:12.860
ins and we now know everything.

00:12.870 --> 00:15.450
So now let's just go ahead and work with our project.

00:15.480 --> 00:15.930
OK.

00:15.990 --> 00:22.470
So our project number one would be a personal beta website and for that to work we just need to reset

00:22.560 --> 00:28.340
our voyde press to everything new so that we can work from the start and then we can move forward.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.540
So for that you have to go to dashboard make sure guys that you reset your Wordpress to all your defaults

00:33.810 --> 00:35.230
so that you can move forward.

00:35.250 --> 00:40.800
I'm going to go to the plugins and I'm going to hit add Neal and then here you have to just enter would

00:40.800 --> 00:42.390
press reset.

00:42.490 --> 00:43.830
We are going to add this plugin.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.550
OK let's just search.

00:45.780 --> 00:51.950
And now here you can see it is voyde press reset by Matt martes.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.470
OK.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.960
So now here mean just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit install and let's just go ahead and let's

00:56.970 --> 00:57.650
install this.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.060
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to activate and there we go.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.830
You can see this is the plug in that is right here.

01:05.010 --> 01:05.500
OK.

01:05.760 --> 01:12.540
And now what I have to do I have to go to the settings tools and here you can see it's easy to reset.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.970
I'm going to click here and I'm here.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.290
I have to just enter r e s e t.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.350
Reset OK.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.650
And then I have to just hit reset and I have to hit OK.

01:22.710 --> 01:26.940
And that's all you can see that I am totally done with my website.

01:27.090 --> 01:27.640
There you go.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.730
You can see that my wordpress Web site is now back to normal.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.690
And now everything has been deleted.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.330
And this is the website that is looking like it is totally new Web site.

01:37.500 --> 01:43.060
So now Vivah will be breaking up with their new projects that are everything has been reset.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.700
And there is nothing you can see.

01:44.820 --> 01:49.550
This is the sambil page but we will be having teams that be installed.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.680
OK so teens will be here.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.000
But that would be shifted to the default one.

01:54.090 --> 01:57.480
So let's just go ahead and let's quickly delete this team as well.

01:57.770 --> 01:58.530
OK.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.800
And let's just delete every theme that we installed.

02:01.950 --> 02:02.240
OK.

02:02.250 --> 02:08.130
So leave that as it does so that we are just starting our project from the very first that we have just

02:08.130 --> 02:10.440
installed Wordpress and that's all.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.910
So this is our everything is working.

02:11.910 --> 02:14.740
We have our installed plug ins and we have these.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.940
So let's just go at it let's also delete these plugins.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.260
I'm going to come here and I'm going to apply and that's all.

02:21.420 --> 02:23.300
OK you can see that everything is deleted.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.710
Everything is totally new.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.570
And now here I have to work with it.

02:27.750 --> 02:31.000
So first of all basically we have to work for the team.

02:31.090 --> 02:35.890
OK now here the designing part started because you guys know everything about the customization you

02:35.890 --> 02:38.130
guys know everything about menus and everything.

02:38.130 --> 02:40.320
So now here I mean designing part starts.

02:40.350 --> 02:45.400
And now we will be working up on the design rather than the content and everything.

02:45.420 --> 02:50.400
So let's just go ahead let's install a team that I'm telling you this is the team that we will be using

02:50.400 --> 02:53.930
mostly and this team is amazing.

02:53.940 --> 02:57.710
The reason I'm telling you is this team comes with a plug in.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.110
That is the best plug in.

02:59.130 --> 03:05.050
OK before 2016 this plugin was not invented and creation of web site was so hard.

03:05.220 --> 03:05.700
OK.

03:05.820 --> 03:12.250
But now that plugin has been released and it is doing amazing job guys.

03:12.290 --> 03:18.570
OK so let's just go ahead and let's install this team and you yourself will be amazed how great we build

03:19.080 --> 03:20.870
an awesome website.

03:21.150 --> 03:24.600
So let's just go to the appearance and then let's go to Tina.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.970
So here we have to just select adenine and then we have to just add a new theme.

03:29.970 --> 03:37.140
So you have to go to the popular DOB and you will see a theme called Ocean W.P. this team is going so

03:37.140 --> 03:38.010
amazing guys.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.870
This team is now rang as the top team.

03:40.980 --> 03:41.400
OK.

03:41.400 --> 03:46.170
The reason is that it's a board set up plug in and it supports that he felt so let's just go out and

03:46.170 --> 03:49.160
let's install this theme and then learn how to build.

03:49.180 --> 03:53.860
Now I'm obsessed with this so let's just go let's install and let's just activate it.

03:54.540 --> 03:59.580
So I can see this team is activated and we have a new line that says this team recommends the following

03:59.580 --> 04:03.800
plug in the elements are in the ocean extra.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.480
So let's just go ahead and let's install them.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.650
OK let's begin installing plugins.

04:07.890 --> 04:11.530
Let's select all and let's just install and hit apply.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.020
Ok that's all we have to do.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.300
And you can see that these plug ins will be activated.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.930
I'm going to go to install plug in to see if these plug ins are now activated.

04:20.010 --> 04:20.250
OK.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.170
This will appear OK.

04:21.210 --> 04:24.270
You have to just refresh it again and then it will be gone.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.220
You can again see this is elementary.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.840
And this is ocean extra.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.210
Now let's have a look at the website.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.830
OK you can see that this is how our Web site is looking at a site.

04:32.850 --> 04:34.440
Look it's totally changed.

04:34.440 --> 04:34.820
OK.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.930
I know want to say it looks a bit ugly.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.860
I know our Web site doesn't look good.

04:38.970 --> 04:43.520
That is why actors in this venue we will design this website.

04:43.710 --> 04:49.230
You will be amazed to see how great our Web site looks.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.900
So in the next video we'll be just working the pages.

04:51.930 --> 04:52.390
OK.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.180
We'll create pages and then we'll work the Demonios OK and then we'll be working up with the designing

04:57.180 --> 04:57.560
part.

04:57.570 --> 05:00.270
I'll show you how can you work with the designing and.

05:00.620 --> 05:05.120
I'll be moving forward with our project which is I can see the outcome.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.590
So CDM guys and by.
