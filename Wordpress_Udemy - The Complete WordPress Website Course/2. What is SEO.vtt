00:00.560 --> 00:02.640
Hey Guys welcome to this section.

00:02.670 --> 00:08.870
OK so in this section I'm going to be telling you that how can you prepare your website for the ASIO's

00:08.870 --> 00:14.270
who will be doing the on page SEO that is within the website like how you can prepare your website for

00:14.270 --> 00:18.630
the CEO and how you can implement everything that Google sees.

00:18.650 --> 00:25.940
OK so before just going into that I want to give you my tips and those are like make sure that your

00:25.990 --> 00:28.740
website consist of the following pages.

00:28.790 --> 00:29.110
OK.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.950
The about us the home is always there obviously.

00:32.090 --> 00:32.500
OK.

00:32.630 --> 00:36.920
So the About Us Contact Us terms and conditions and Privacy Policy.

00:36.950 --> 00:41.540
These four pages are really necessary if you have it your Web site.

00:41.630 --> 00:44.140
They'll go amazing.

00:44.190 --> 00:48.130
So these five pages are highly recommended by me.

00:48.270 --> 00:48.900
OK.

00:48.900 --> 00:55.200
So let's suppose that if a Web site is based on the on page or sorry the single page website.

00:55.330 --> 01:00.660
OK the one page website that what you have to do like the first project that we were building on was

01:00.720 --> 01:05.610
the let's build a personal Razi you might say OK.

01:05.790 --> 01:11.850
So let's just say to and this is just based on a single page and how we're going to make sure that a

01:11.890 --> 01:13.370
website loads fast.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.740
Oh sorry that oversight.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.640
How can we add pages.

01:17.690 --> 01:18.100
OK.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.010
Like about us and contact us.

01:20.040 --> 01:20.500
OK.

01:20.670 --> 01:23.890
So I would say is to just create it.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.360
Do not add it in the menu if you do not want to.

01:26.480 --> 01:26.720
OK.

01:26.730 --> 01:32.530
But make sure to create those pages because if you have it you have upset credibility will be increased.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.980
And Google Ville Crawley website.

01:35.520 --> 01:43.020
I don't know if Google really implies that but in my experience I have seen that it upsets those who

01:43.020 --> 01:45.160
have these critical pages.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.390
They rank more.

01:46.500 --> 01:46.930
OK.

01:47.040 --> 01:53.030
So if you have at your Web site of Filby ranking on more on the first page of Google.

01:53.120 --> 01:53.510
OK.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.090
So now let's suppose that what to add in the About Us.

01:58.140 --> 02:02.350
I don't think so if I have to ask you about it give you the examples of the About Us pages.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.180
OK you can go ahead and you can measure the different.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.630
There's a different type of websites.

02:06.630 --> 02:07.410
OK.

02:07.860 --> 02:14.400
And then you can look at the About Us page but in the Contact Us page I have seen that you have to add

02:14.490 --> 02:15.570
that you have to add them.

02:15.690 --> 02:16.070
OK.

02:16.230 --> 02:22.110
So in the conduct this page you first have to give the address email address and phone number of working

02:22.110 --> 02:28.770
office hours if possible because you go to Google Ville crawl it crawl your Web site Google Ville search

02:28.770 --> 02:33.450
your web site and then Google will search your website and then it will mark the website to be authentic.

02:33.450 --> 02:36.180
So if you have it it is good for you.

02:36.210 --> 02:40.200
Now the second thing is that make sure to also add the contact form.

02:40.230 --> 02:45.100
OK so you guys already know about it like how to have the contact form and how to do that.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.080
And the third one is the map.

02:48.090 --> 02:51.720
Make sure to add the maps so let me give you an example of the Contact Us page.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.300
OK.

02:52.490 --> 02:54.350
I'm going to go to.

02:55.130 --> 02:55.960
OK.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.950
And the slash contact.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.870
So I'm just giving you an example of conduct that's bait.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.890
I'm not telling you that you have to copy it.

03:04.020 --> 03:04.620
OK.

03:04.770 --> 03:06.970
Because you don't have to copy it.

03:07.050 --> 03:11.780
But if you add it to your website it look amazing.

03:11.790 --> 03:18.150
OK so you can see this is an example like address phone numbers and the e-mail address the contact form

03:18.150 --> 03:19.270
is also here.

03:19.470 --> 03:25.720
And they also have a map so if you have something like that then have a look at it.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.840
We are also working on a project that was the tree.

03:28.980 --> 03:34.980
I hope so if I just go to the contact page that I'm going to give you an example like this is also a

03:34.980 --> 03:39.810
great example that we were building a business website for this.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.720
So I think this is the S3.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.270
Yes this was the one.

03:43.290 --> 03:50.130
OK you can see how it is looking and saying get a call find us and we have a phone number for a number

03:51.090 --> 03:53.560
displayed here and everything.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.050
So it is taking some time to load.

03:55.050 --> 03:55.420
OK.

03:55.430 --> 04:00.630
This is not the like catchy optimized our website is not the catchy up to my so we have to optimize

04:00.630 --> 04:01.560
it for that.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.280
And we've learned so don't worry.

04:03.300 --> 04:10.240
We will also learn how to make sure that our website has the SSL certificate which helps in the ranking.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.300
OK.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.400
So let's wait till this is load.

04:14.430 --> 04:15.690
It is taking so much time.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.660
The reason is that it has the image that we need to compress.

04:18.660 --> 04:24.650
OK so I'm going to be telling you each and everything like how you can do that and how it is done.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.390
OK.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.020
So let's wait.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.570
OK so here we go you can see how it is looking.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.040
This conduct this page is looking amazing.

04:32.040 --> 04:32.640
OK.

04:32.730 --> 04:37.730
So I seriously like this page so you can see how great this page is looking into it.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.870
OK so you can create a page like this.

04:39.870 --> 04:41.640
OK so I'm just giving you an example.

04:41.640 --> 04:46.590
So if you have a page like this your page will not only look good but if you just give every information

04:46.590 --> 04:49.320
about your company and everything you say.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.630
Google the MMOG that Web site to be authentic.

04:51.630 --> 04:52.590
OK I don't know.

04:52.590 --> 04:53.100
I don't know.

04:53.100 --> 04:58.790
I personally don't know if Google doolally works but I have seen their Web sites that do around most.

04:58.800 --> 05:04.190
They have these pages and their privacy policy and the terms and conditions is a must.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.050
OK so it is 100 percent mossed you should be having these pages.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.310
Supremacy both C and the terms and conditions.

05:11.730 --> 05:16.740
So you can generate your page for the privacy policy and the terms and conditions you can write it like

05:17.140 --> 05:21.280
a privacy policy generator OK.

05:21.420 --> 05:28.200
And then here you can just go to the pages that they that it has so this one it will ask you some questions

05:28.560 --> 05:30.330
like Does your have has this like.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.030
Are you the web site owner or this.

05:32.450 --> 05:35.830
OK so I'm just going to go like this web site owner OK.

05:36.090 --> 05:37.310
Why are you creating this.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.790
Because to sell digital products to sell service website or blog provides free information.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.310
So let's suppose that I have this.

05:43.450 --> 05:43.830

OK so this is how it works.

05:58.380 --> 06:06.070
So now I think we're totally done with the tips of the pages that we should be adding in to our Web

06:06.120 --> 06:06.480
