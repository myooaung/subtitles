00:00.780 --> 00:04.470
Wise up guys and Congratulations on completing your essay.

00:04.590 --> 00:08.350
Oh s. And now we're going to be moving up to the C of S..

00:08.350 --> 00:08.950
Part 2.

00:08.950 --> 00:16.660
That is the speed optimization so speed optimization is going to be a great task for you guys because

00:16.660 --> 00:21.020
we're going to learn how to just make our website load faster.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.940
And I'm also going to show you how to integrate TTN and also just integrate the SSL for free which I

00:27.940 --> 00:30.230
know you guys must be waiting for.

00:30.310 --> 00:36.550
So this section is going to be so much fun and we're going to learn everything related to the speed

00:36.550 --> 00:37.360
optimization.

00:37.360 --> 00:45.290
So I am adding the SSL in their speed optimization just because we will be integrating the Cdn.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.570
OK that is content delivery network.

00:47.700 --> 00:52.130
OK then the will be working up with the SSL Fed that.

00:52.270 --> 00:52.820
OK.

00:52.870 --> 01:00.310
So that will be a side by side stuff mule and degrade the CD and the SSL will also be integrated.

01:00.340 --> 01:00.770
Okay.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.630
And then we just have to work with some of the things with our WordPress website.

01:04.630 --> 01:05.230
Okay.

01:05.230 --> 01:11.030
So instead of working on a normal website I thought why not just work with iTunes.

01:11.130 --> 01:17.210
COM that was our project our first project and I'm going to be showing you that how can you basically

01:17.460 --> 01:24.520
put your Web site that the first professional or personal basis say that we created how to make that

01:24.520 --> 01:27.400
Web site go very fast.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.930
So if I just want to go ahead and I just want to show you the speed right now.

01:31.930 --> 01:34.750
If I just go to say speed

01:37.160 --> 01:41.510
test ok I just go here and I just go to SightSpeed test Google.

01:41.630 --> 01:44.150
And here you can see this is Phrag here.

01:44.150 --> 01:46.570
Page Speed I'm going to be entering the page.

01:46.610 --> 01:53.240
OK I'm going to be entering HTP cool and slash slash I tend Ziel dot com.

01:53.360 --> 01:53.890
OK.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.610
And I'm going to be just analyzing it.

01:55.630 --> 01:56.930
And that's going to analyze you.

01:57.050 --> 01:57.650
OK.

01:57.710 --> 02:03.170
It's going to analyze your website and then it's going to tell you that if your website is faster or

02:03.170 --> 02:03.880
not.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.450
OK.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.290
So let's see your result.

02:06.290 --> 02:06.940
OK.

02:06.980 --> 02:12.450
Our Web site would not be very fast because we have to optimize our website for speed.

02:12.470 --> 02:13.100
OK.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.790
I'm not guaranteeing you 100.

02:14.810 --> 02:19.830
I'm not guaranteeing 190 but at least you can get like 70 percent.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.900
Like it should be 70 and it should be 78.

02:24.090 --> 02:24.390
OK.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.730
And then you will see that your upside the load faster.

02:27.730 --> 02:32.330
So you can see that or website speed optimization is very low.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.500
And here as well.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.610
So we have to optimize our website for the best.

02:37.640 --> 02:44.270
And we have to make sure that our Web site loads much faster and then our as your rankings will also

02:44.270 --> 02:48.280
be increased so it should be beyond 50.

02:48.410 --> 02:49.940
Okay like 60.

02:49.940 --> 02:54.240
You can see that not every Web site has the hundred by hundred.

02:54.260 --> 03:01.250
So Google not Google even if you just go to each TTP colon slash slash Google dot com OK and you can

03:01.250 --> 03:03.830
see that not only Google loads faster.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.300
So Google is not also the hundred by a hundred.

03:06.300 --> 03:11.590
So don't be like I want to make sure that my page is hundred by hundred OK.

03:11.630 --> 03:18.530
And if I just go to Facebook dot com and then I just analyze it you can see that Facebook will Sinaloan

03:18.530 --> 03:19.460
much faster.

03:19.460 --> 03:26.090
It will also be not 100 by hundreds and there will still be there so you can see it is the average optimization

03:26.090 --> 03:27.570
is very low so don't be like that.

03:27.580 --> 03:32.810
OK if your optimization is not very good don't be like OK you cannot rank.

03:32.810 --> 03:40.130
You can see that the optimization in desktop is very much higher than the mobile so desktop should be

03:40.160 --> 03:41.110
very much higher.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.730
Your Mobile optimization should be there like your website should be responsive but your desktop optimization

03:46.730 --> 03:47.540
should be good.

03:47.750 --> 03:54.250
OK this is our task ok and it should be above 75 or 60.

03:54.290 --> 03:54.710
OK.

03:54.770 --> 04:01.640
Make sure do not go beyond that because we have to focus on the best speed optimization.

04:01.650 --> 04:09.260
OK let me just let me just go ahead and let me just go for the eBay EBAY Tulkarm which is the one that

04:09.260 --> 04:12.590
I like the most and I always meant I am free.

04:12.680 --> 04:18.100
I just keep it out column and then I just search for the products that are on sale so I can write.

04:18.260 --> 04:23.570
OK you can see that this is also being analyzed and is going to give us the result that.

04:23.570 --> 04:24.740
How much time it takes to load.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.780
So you can see that eBay is the world's best Web site.

04:28.010 --> 04:28.670
OK.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.690
This optimization is also a bit low.

04:30.920 --> 04:36.740
So it matters and it matters doesn't matter too well.

04:37.250 --> 04:45.570
But if your optimization is very high then it should be like above 60.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.270
Don't go beyond 60.

04:47.270 --> 04:51.640
OK so sixty or seventy five it should be above sixty or seventy five.

04:51.640 --> 04:57.470
OK so now in the next video I'm going to be showing you how can you just work with the optimization.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.200
So if we just go to iTunes dot com again.

05:00.320 --> 05:07.790
OK if I just go here and I just search for iTunes Ziel dot com then you can see that Google also gives

05:07.910 --> 05:14.090
us the recommendations that we should be doing to our Web site to our Web site loads faster.

05:14.090 --> 05:14.570
OK.

05:14.630 --> 05:16.300
So let's see what I said giving.

05:16.480 --> 05:16.870
OK.

05:16.870 --> 05:19.690
It's saying optimize images which is the number one thing.

05:19.820 --> 05:24.420
OK we have these optimize the have these images that are not optimized.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.010
We have this news server Spawn's time.

05:27.290 --> 05:27.740
OK.

05:27.740 --> 05:34.250
We have our browser caching we have our eliminate render blocking Javascript.

05:34.370 --> 05:36.370
And we also have identified javascript.

05:36.380 --> 05:39.740
OK so we will also be we'll be working up with the stuff.

05:39.770 --> 05:44.870
OK I'm going to be showing you how can you use different type of plug ins to enhance the look of this.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.030
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

05:47.060 --> 05:54.890
In the next video we will be working up with our speed optimization that is going to be a very amazing

05:54.890 --> 05:55.600
task.

05:55.610 --> 05:56.140
Goodbye.
