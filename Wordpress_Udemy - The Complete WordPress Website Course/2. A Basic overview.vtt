00:00.520 --> 00:04.570
Hear what is up guys and what KMAX are now in this video we will be working up their Web site right

00:04.570 --> 00:04.840
now.

00:04.840 --> 00:09.790
OK so first before getting it started I think we need to change that theme because I just take it is

00:09.790 --> 00:10.930
being my no right.

00:11.170 --> 00:11.450
OK.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.740
I'm just going to go do the appearance right now and I'm going to keep themes and I'm just going to

00:14.740 --> 00:19.520
change the themes I'm just going to change the theme right now because I can not face this thing anymore.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.430
I'm going to come here.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.610
I'm going to choose ocean Lupi.

00:23.230 --> 00:26.270
OK let's come here.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.180
This is right here.

00:27.190 --> 00:30.820
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit install right now so I just like this theme.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.730
This is the theme is simple.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.010
Ok this theme works pretty well.

00:35.020 --> 00:35.770
Amazing.

00:35.770 --> 00:39.430
That is why I dislike it so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit activate and he can see

00:39.430 --> 00:42.880
this team recommends the following plug ins I'm just going to go out and I'm going to install them.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.630
OK I'm just going to click this and I'm going to hit install and I'm going to hit apply.

00:46.630 --> 00:51.430
So it should be a fight to both of them and you can see installing and activating the plug ins and these

00:51.430 --> 00:53.010
plug ins are activated successfully.

00:53.010 --> 00:57.850
So now let's have a look at our Web site how it is looking so you can see this is how it is looking.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.930
It is just another WordPress site and we have hello world and continue reading.

01:01.930 --> 01:06.400
So you can see now we're going to overview all the settings for WordPress website.

01:06.440 --> 01:06.970
OK.

01:07.030 --> 01:09.920
I just wanted to change the team because I was just dying seeing that.

01:09.990 --> 01:10.500
OK.

01:10.520 --> 01:14.960
So first thing that we want to focus is that we want to design the forum.

01:15.100 --> 01:15.510
OK.

01:15.580 --> 01:21.480
So if you just go to all forums right here and then you can see this is how the forward would be.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.060
And you're first going to design the form of our site.

01:25.060 --> 01:29.740
So first of all what we have to do is that we need to create a new form.

01:29.930 --> 01:30.250
OK.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.270
And then we'll be very keen on the social networking site.

01:33.420 --> 01:33.790
OK.

01:33.910 --> 01:37.310
So let's just come here and let's just create a new for him.

01:37.330 --> 01:42.300
OK so the forum name is going to be so let's suppose that you have a company.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.340
OK.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.470
Here you are creating a Web site for your company where you people can just come here.

01:47.650 --> 01:52.630
Or you're just creating a website for a fool beginners like you run a restaurant.

01:52.690 --> 01:53.150
OK.

01:53.180 --> 01:58.110
And or you run a classroom where people can discuss everything.

01:58.270 --> 02:02.840
So this will be like I run a hotel management software or something like that.

02:02.980 --> 02:08.590
And I teach everybody that how can they just learn everything.

02:08.590 --> 02:12.990
So this is going to be like recipe's

02:18.620 --> 02:19.230
recipes.

02:19.250 --> 02:24.210
OK recipes and in here you can see that here would be the main forum.

02:24.230 --> 02:25.370
This would be my meaning for you.

02:25.400 --> 02:25.960
OK.

02:25.970 --> 02:32.030
So you can see that this type is going to be a form and the status is going to be the open so that this

02:32.030 --> 02:35.930
forum will be open and the visibility will be public.

02:35.930 --> 02:41.170
So this is the public forum where people can just join in and they can post anything.

02:41.180 --> 02:45.420
So I'm just going to come here to screen options and make sure that everything is selected right here.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.610
This is a slug basically.

02:46.610 --> 02:47.090
OK.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.260
This is called a slug so we don't have to just edit here.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.110
I'm just going to come here.

02:51.130 --> 03:04.260
I'm going to add anything so I'm just going to add this form is like so I can add it's like please tell

03:04.590 --> 03:09.890
me the new recipes.

03:10.170 --> 03:10.570
OK.

03:10.750 --> 03:15.190
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit publish right now so this forum is going to be published

03:15.190 --> 03:18.660
so let's open up this forum right now.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.030
OK.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.430
And then you can see that how this for a look.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.540
So this is how the forum is looking OK.

03:23.610 --> 03:27.270
This is a recipe a forums and this forum is empty.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.270
Oh bother.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.000
No topics were found in the recipe so if I just go to forums right now OK then you can see that in the

03:34.000 --> 03:37.460
form we have this forum that says the recipes.

03:37.510 --> 03:43.240
So in the recipe any person can just open up any of the topics so he did.

03:43.240 --> 03:48.550
He just opened up the topic like so like the topic is.

03:49.000 --> 04:03.730
I just tried the prawn prawn Rice Szasz like just like I hope I'm going to all right.

04:03.750 --> 04:04.860

04:05.030 --> 04:07.770
I just tried the prawn Rice just like crispy

04:10.180 --> 04:15.880

04:27.460 --> 04:34.420
And the topic Dag's can be anything the topic type would be normal since I am the guy I am the administrator.

04:34.420 --> 04:37.500
That is why I can select that it should be sticky and super sticky.

04:37.540 --> 04:41.200
I'm just going to tell you this sticky and super sticky later on but this is the topic.

04:41.230 --> 04:41.940

09:51.460 --> 09:52.830
So I'll just see it.

09:52.930 --> 09:54.700
The hell is this guy.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.210
He just said this is so funny.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.360
I'm just so angry and I'm the Edman.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.190
So what I'm going to do I'm just coed.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.780
I'm going to open up this user.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.560
OK.

10:02.710 --> 10:11.310
And what I'm going to do right now I am just going to go ahead and I'm going to go to settings and I'm

10:11.310 --> 10:15.350
going to change this guy's password so that he cannot log in or what I can do.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.980
I can just go with a campaign platies do like what he can do to my site so I'm just going to select

10:19.980 --> 10:22.470
this user as spammer and I'm going to save it.

10:22.710 --> 10:30.760
And this user can log in and he can not just like post anything so if I just come here and I'm just

10:30.780 --> 10:32.500
gonna open my say right now.

10:32.610 --> 10:34.250
So I'm just giving you a basic overview.

10:34.260 --> 10:39.300
You can see your account has been marked as a spammer so you can see that he just replied that this

10:39.300 --> 10:40.160
is so funny.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.380
That is why you can not just do anything.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.340
This is just an example of how our Web site is looking.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.770
OK very good to understand.

10:47.790 --> 10:51.530
Every setting later on we will progress our course.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.980
They they did not where you guys.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.200
So now we are totally done with this.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.010
OK we have now created the form we are now.

10:58.050 --> 10:58.670
With this.

10:58.800 --> 11:03.300
OK in the next video we'll be working the forums first and then we'll going to be breaking up with the

11:03.330 --> 11:10.650
replies and how this messaging works and how can we build a complete social networking based Web site

11:10.860 --> 11:14.130
so stadium guys and in the next video will be working up at that that by.
