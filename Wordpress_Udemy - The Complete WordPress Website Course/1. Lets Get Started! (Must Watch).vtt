00:00.800 --> 00:05.800
Have what is a guys and welcome to the scores so you're probably here in the section number one and

00:06.040 --> 00:06.670
number one.

00:06.790 --> 00:11.980
So I would give you some of the tips that will help you keep going but this course because I have seen

00:12.280 --> 00:17.740
so many guys they just buy this course and then they end up taking that course they don't watch it because

00:18.100 --> 00:19.450
they might not understand this.

00:19.570 --> 00:23.080
And so here I'm going to be giving you five tips that you can implement.

00:23.260 --> 00:29.830
And then you yourself will keep going with this course so make sure to implement them and it will help

00:29.830 --> 00:33.510
you guys a lot and not just skip this video this video is so important.

00:33.670 --> 00:33.990
OK.

00:34.090 --> 00:38.090
So the first step we have is the speed of the video.

00:38.290 --> 00:42.370
So if you think that I'm talking a little bit more faster or if you think that I'm talking a little

00:42.370 --> 00:48.010
bit more slow then what you can do you can just go ahead and you can manage the speed here.

00:48.020 --> 00:54.120
So if you are a fluent English speaker and you think that I'm talking I'm talking very slow.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.720
And then you can make it much faster and it will help you guys a lot.

00:57.730 --> 01:03.010
Make sure to just set it because this course is for everyone guys because there are so many guys who

01:03.010 --> 01:08.920
know English very well and so many guys who know English a little bit so this course is for everyone

01:08.920 --> 01:09.840
obviously guys.

01:09.850 --> 01:16.210
OK so if you think that I'm talking very slow then make sure to just go ahead and keep it 1.5 x and

01:16.330 --> 01:18.440
it will solve your problem.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.510
And you yourself will be key.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.330
Will keep going.

01:21.430 --> 01:21.900
OK.

01:21.910 --> 01:25.640
So the second tip we have here is the quality of the video.

01:25.660 --> 01:27.040
This is very important guys.

01:27.040 --> 01:31.010
OK so this is a web development course that is called the world press corps.

01:31.150 --> 01:31.500

01:31.510 --> 01:35.170
