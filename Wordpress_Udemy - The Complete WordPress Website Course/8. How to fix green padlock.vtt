00:00.520 --> 00:02.130
What is a guy Zen Welcome back.

00:02.130 --> 00:07.500
So one thing that you may have noticed and that is that you can see that the Krien padlock is actually

00:07.500 --> 00:08.380
not appearing.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.780
I'm sorry I didn't notice that.

00:09.950 --> 00:10.260
OK.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.560
The green padlock is still on here.

00:12.690 --> 00:16.550
If I just open up this image but this is coming right here not in here.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.510
So there is a problem that is not loading that this page is fully not secure.

00:22.530 --> 00:22.890
OK.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.670
Let me just go ahead let me copy this let me open this up in a new tab or an incognito window and let's

00:29.670 --> 00:32.200
see if this padlock is coming or not.

00:32.190 --> 00:36.080
So this padlock is coming and then that padlock is gone.

00:36.150 --> 00:37.800
Let's see what is the problem.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.710
I'm going to be coming here and going to be clicking inspect.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.920
OK so you have to just click inspect and you can see this is coming.

00:43.920 --> 00:51.720
So we have to click console and you can see the is the page at I NZL dot com was loaded or DBMSs Patrick

00:51.720 --> 00:54.240
rested and in secure image.

00:54.250 --> 01:01.300
OK so this page crested and in secure image which is causing this issue.

01:01.630 --> 01:02.300
OK.

01:02.580 --> 01:03.240
What I'm going to do.

01:03.270 --> 01:08.010
I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to hit inspect element and let's see if this image is actually

01:08.010 --> 01:09.840
being loaded.

01:11.450 --> 01:19.620
So this image is loading what the background image you can see this image is loading this one.

01:19.790 --> 01:27.080
OK well that is the HDTV we have to change this so that it loads the full one.

01:27.260 --> 01:27.710
OK.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.440
So how are you going to do that.

01:30.580 --> 01:35.640
Well let's just come here and let's just click edited elementary.

01:35.820 --> 01:36.270
OK.

01:36.380 --> 01:42.710
So I'm clicking out of the Telemann Tor and now here you will see that the image would be totally there.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.600
I have to just remove the image from there.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.630
And then I have to add it back with my elementary so that the each one is added not the normal one I'm

01:53.630 --> 01:57.840
going to click here and I'm going to go to the style and this is the image.

01:58.040 --> 01:58.460
OK.

01:58.580 --> 02:02.890
So I have to come here and I have to just add this image again.

02:03.110 --> 02:03.590
OK.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.010
The HTP s right now.

02:05.270 --> 02:08.420
I'm going to click insert media this image just right here again.

02:08.420 --> 02:13.180
I'm going to go down go down and still this image is also with the HTP.

02:13.190 --> 02:13.450
OK.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.330
I hope that you guys are following what I'm saying.

02:16.430 --> 02:22.880
OK you can see if I just come here and you can see this image was actually added with the HDD be OK.

02:22.970 --> 02:31.360
But now since we have added the HD B-S we have to change all the images so that it loads perfectly OK.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.760
I'm going to come here and I'm going to click this guy right here again.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.530
I'm going to go do style.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.820
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit delete.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.130
Come here again.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.190
I'm going to hit this.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.850
And now you can see this is HGT.

02:43.900 --> 02:44.650
That is coming.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.930
I mean I hate insert media.

02:46.130 --> 02:47.710
That's all I have to come here.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.960
I have to just set a date and my page is going to be updated.

02:51.980 --> 02:57.130
So now let's come here and let's just hit it unsealed.

02:57.950 --> 03:00.720
I hope this loads perfectly.

03:00.870 --> 03:01.960
Let's see.

03:01.970 --> 03:05.540
So this is till now green and this is totally green.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.230
Now you can see this is green.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.980
That is totally up and running.

03:08.990 --> 03:11.310
So you just have to go to the elementary page.

03:11.360 --> 03:11.800
OK.

03:11.960 --> 03:18.200
And then you have to re add the image because the image is actually loading from the HDD B instead of

03:18.200 --> 03:20.560
the HDD DBMS which was causing the issue.

03:20.660 --> 03:27.470
And I can see this Krien padlock is totally coming and everything is totally right here and running

03:27.470 --> 03:29.150
perfectly.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.810
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

03:31.810 --> 03:36.340
And next video will just work more.

03:36.390 --> 03:36.760
Goodbye.
