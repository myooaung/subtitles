WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:02.430
What is up guys and welcome back.

00:02.430 --> 00:08.140
So in this video we're going to be working with this section right here and now I think that editing

00:08.340 --> 00:15.190
this team is now free easy you guys now already know how this plug in works totally OK so but that wasting

00:15.220 --> 00:15.750
any time.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.440
Let's get started.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.970
Let's dive into it.

00:18.010 --> 00:24.470
First thing I want to add is the about section where I want to add something here.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.620
So that will be we'll go with that divider.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.960
Here would be an image here would be the content in here.

00:33.030 --> 00:37.530
You can be any image right here that represents our company.

00:37.660 --> 00:41.390
So our company is basically for hardware that is why I want to focus on that.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.390
So I just want to drag this column I want to change the look of the column.

00:45.490 --> 00:46.140
I want to come here.

00:46.150 --> 00:51.310
I'm just going to come here and say it's a Talk column so if I just get it you can see how will be two

00:51.310 --> 00:52.020
columns.

00:52.150 --> 00:54.560
You can see this is how it is working.

00:54.730 --> 01:00.970
Now here I want to add one thing and that will be about the content and here would be the image.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.840
So you have to basically focus on the box.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.420
Now here are what I have to do.

01:07.800 --> 01:16.810
First I think I should also add a heading right here.

01:16.980 --> 01:21.790
So let's go ahead let's delete this let's track this heading and let's drop it right here.

01:21.810 --> 01:28.780
I want to come here and I want to change this to be who we are.

01:29.420 --> 01:29.940
OK.

01:31.090 --> 01:31.710
And there we go.

01:31.730 --> 01:34.860
I want to align this to Senator.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.510
I want to change the color so let's get in here.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.180
Let's change the kludgey plaque

01:43.900 --> 01:45.220
cool.

01:45.450 --> 01:50.190
Now what I want I need the topography I want to change this.

01:50.190 --> 01:53.470
So I want to increase this base pay.

01:53.670 --> 01:58.500
And I want to change the font so it can be open sounds OK.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.860
And I want to change the font the vate.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.530
So this is now very much Tinner.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.090
I just want to bring this to top right here right here.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.670
So above so that it looks good.

02:10.800 --> 02:18.060
So when I go to advance tray here and I cannot bring this to top because we This team is restricting

02:18.060 --> 02:25.620
us to go above there you can see that OK basically the ocean will be team gives complete access to this

02:25.620 --> 02:28.090
team but this team is just getting right here.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.070
But we can't do that.

02:29.070 --> 02:33.510
How can we do that we just have to come here to the margin we have to just sit and unlink values we

02:33.510 --> 02:39.440
have to just bring this up so you can see this is going above and I think this one's just fine.

02:46.570 --> 02:46.990
OK.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.680
Cool.

02:47.720 --> 02:52.720
I want to come here and I want to hit save so you can see who is coming right here.

02:52.730 --> 02:53.940
I want to go to the content.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.160
I want to come here and I just need to get that the divider.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.320
So I want to divide it drag the divider and I want this right here.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.170
You can see dividers coming right here.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.080
I want to go to vate.

03:06.140 --> 03:07.970
So I to increase the weight a bit.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.230
I want to just come here to practice the center.

03:10.250 --> 03:13.490
I want to just bring this right here.

03:14.430 --> 03:15.870
This much.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.760
And I want to just trick trees.

03:17.790 --> 03:24.740
So I wanted this above re here pay what I will do I'll just skim your eldest to advance and I want to

03:24.730 --> 03:28.550
decrease the margins so let's give here and let's just decrease it.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.520
You can see this is right here.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.560
This looks cool.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.280
OK if I just click this you can see how this is looking.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.210
So this is just going this is not coming OK.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.360
This team is creating some mess.

03:40.380 --> 03:40.910
OK.

03:41.160 --> 03:48.810
The reason is that because this team is not completely optimized for that that we have free here.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.280
I want to just go on here and I want to use the zero because we can not go beyond its limit.

03:53.290 --> 03:56.630
So this team is not getting giving us everything.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.610
I want to come here.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.560
I just want to delete it.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.350
OK.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.600
Let's come here.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.390
Delete this column.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.390
Let's try this heading right here and let's see if this heading is coming.

04:13.390 --> 04:15.820
So this heading is coming we cannot change this.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.080
We cannot go above it.

04:17.080 --> 04:23.450
This team is just limiting us so basically that is why I recommend to go read the ocean team.

04:23.590 --> 04:28.770
But I just wanted to make some changes make some edits that have what are extra things we can do with

04:28.770 --> 04:29.280
our team.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.390
So I just wanted to add here who we are

04:36.280 --> 04:36.900
who we are.

04:36.940 --> 04:42.990
I want to track this to center and I want to change the color of this to be a bit of Krey.

04:43.150 --> 04:48.480
I want to come here right here to typography and Cree's it a bit and the IT font.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.250
You can choose this to go to the vase.

04:51.310 --> 04:56.420
So we should be three Henry.

04:56.950 --> 04:59.750
I don't know why I like open sense but I'm in love with this.

04:59.770 --> 05:00.050
OK.

05:00.070 --> 05:04.600
Now what I want to do I just want to go to the line Hey two eldest shoes a line height to be zero.

05:04.910 --> 05:05.650
OK.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.310
I want to go to the concentrate here.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.080
And let's see if we can see this.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.480
OK we can see this now.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.960
So I want to go to this guy right here.

05:12.970 --> 05:15.750
I want to drag the columns in I want to drop it right here.

05:16.090 --> 05:16.520
OK.

05:16.570 --> 05:18.960
And here should be everything.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.840
So

05:24.740 --> 05:28.690
let's get in here and we need some text here right here.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.900
I want to go to the text editor and history here.

05:31.910 --> 05:37.900
I want to add some text so I'm just going to copy all this copy and paste paste paste based.

05:38.180 --> 05:38.800
OK.

05:39.140 --> 05:50.000
I want to come here and when I hit backspace Let's go above to it's really not go above and let's do

05:50.060 --> 05:55.330
this so you can see this is a whole paragraph that is coming I want an image right here.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.250
I'm just going to go to the image and this is right here.

05:58.250 --> 06:03.320
So what is the image that we should get the free let's say that if you will be using right now would

06:03.320 --> 06:05.030
be Bicks eBay dot com.

06:05.030 --> 06:10.760
Keep that in mind I use these extra things are going to help you a lot because you need to get the best

06:10.790 --> 06:15.710
images and picks eBay has some of the best images so I'll be just going up with a transparent and I'm

06:15.710 --> 06:17.970
going to need and I need a hardware.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.500
OK.

06:19.610 --> 06:20.640
There we go.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.360
So I need to basically

06:36.310 --> 06:38.450
I think like this one.

06:38.650 --> 06:41.360
This is not going up with the team color.

06:41.370 --> 06:43.490
We pretty well need a colorful ding.

06:52.220 --> 06:52.420
OK.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.020
I want to come here I want to just sit like this.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.450
And I want to download this is being downloaded.

06:56.450 --> 07:03.370
I want to go to this guy right here and ask him here to choose your image.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.190
I want to come here and I want to get into it.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.230
Media So this is coming here.

07:15.250 --> 07:22.800
I want to go to the medium size thumbnail the medium size.

07:23.450 --> 07:28.090
Let's go to style let's just create a bit so that it looks.

07:28.100 --> 07:28.820
Phil

07:32.850 --> 07:38.970
OK everything what school you going to go with the Hoover animation so you can go with the polls or

07:39.000 --> 07:40.290
you can go with the grill.

07:40.290 --> 07:44.000
So it would be Kro but I didn't think so if animation looks cool.

07:44.010 --> 07:47.690
So you could see our heavy our section looks pretty well.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.990
I want to add a new section and menu section should be full of it.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.140
OK.

07:52.530 --> 07:55.610
What I want to say here I want to just come here to edit section.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.220
I don't want to stretch this section.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.390
I want this mission to be full.

07:59.700 --> 08:00.830
OK.

08:00.920 --> 08:07.470
And I need a background image so my background image is going to be style.

08:07.490 --> 08:10.040
Let's go to the normal let's good to the Bactrim type.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.050
And I want to go to the image right here.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.890
So I need an image.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.330
I think we have any minute.

08:15.380 --> 08:16.880
Let's go let's search.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.570
If you have any image trace you are just one.

08:20.900 --> 08:21.470
OK.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.250
I want to hit insert media.

08:27.310 --> 08:30.440
This is coming fully Yes.

08:30.490 --> 08:33.620
This image is coming fully OK.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.010
I want to go to the position so attachment attachment should be fixed.

08:38.020 --> 08:42.240
OK so there might be some problems with your image.

08:42.460 --> 08:43.120
OK.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.640
There might be some problems with this plug in some teams might not work great.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.070
OK.

08:48.070 --> 08:51.230
Like this team is just restricting us to some things.

08:51.250 --> 08:51.610
OK.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.300
But don't just lose your job.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.780
You can try any other team and use this plug in or use or just go with the ocean between.

08:57.790 --> 09:02.260
So I'm just showing you a new way basically to how to implement it.

09:02.410 --> 09:06.930
I want to go to the sites to be covered so that we have the parallax effect.

09:07.090 --> 09:07.350
OK.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.880
I also want to go to the overlay and I need an overlay right here so let's copy this.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.380
Let's just go with this team color thing.

09:14.380 --> 09:19.750
OK basically you have to focus on one thing is to choose the color and then stick to it do not choose

09:19.750 --> 09:26.090
so many colors or the ways it will look like a joker silo or anything at all.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.480
OK I want to go to discolors So we have a purple ish color

09:35.610 --> 09:36.100
call.

09:36.260 --> 09:36.960
OK.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.200
I want to go to one increases.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.220
I want to take it.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.910
Yes.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.490
OK.

09:42.600 --> 09:46.020
I want to come here and we done with this.

09:46.710 --> 09:47.760
What I want to say here.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.630
OK so this is basically a treaty and this is a blue.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.200
And this is a pair of purple.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.890
So I think I should be going up at the median.

09:54.900 --> 09:55.440
OK.

09:55.710 --> 09:56.670
Yes.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.230
And I want to go to the purple right here.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.430
So the purple OK.

10:02.590 --> 10:07.200
And I want to go to the location so my location should be here.

10:07.240 --> 10:13.170
The angle should be 90 to that it comes to rectally OK.

10:13.380 --> 10:18.050
And I want to increase the location here so I can see that we are pretty well.

10:18.120 --> 10:22.500
We are free and we have the first color to be blue and the second color will be blue and then we have

10:22.500 --> 10:24.780
the location to be like this.

10:24.780 --> 10:31.200
We can also stick to the Tartar and we can also just increase the location so that it goes here right

10:31.200 --> 10:31.730
here.

10:31.920 --> 10:32.720
OK.

10:32.910 --> 10:35.780
Now when we add something you will see how created this.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.510
I want to add something here.

10:38.670 --> 10:45.360
Now I want to add some counters and everything Silviu will be doing that in the next video so stadium

10:45.360 --> 10:46.590
guys and Buh-Bye.
