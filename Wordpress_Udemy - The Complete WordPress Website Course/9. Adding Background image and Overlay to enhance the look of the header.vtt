You just need to open up the Adobe Photoshop or you can go with any of the editor that you use but make

01:55.820 --> 01:58.980

01:59.180 --> 02:02.360
So I'm going to go to the it'll be photoshop.

02:02.750 --> 02:07.390
I'm going to open this up and let's resize it.

02:07.390 --> 02:14.390
Basically I want to resize it to the resolution of one to 2 year old by 720 so that it looks great.

02:14.440 --> 02:14.770
K.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.430
this is right here.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.920
I'm going to open a new file.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.710

02:28.960 --> 02:32.510
OK let's just open it up and it should be right here.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.970
I'm going to drag it and drop it here.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.060
So here we go.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.320
This image is right here.

02:40.330 --> 02:43.630
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit enter and now

02:46.660 --> 02:49.480
let's just change let's just create it

02:57.860 --> 03:00.000

03:02.580 --> 03:08.600
Let's just come here to Deathstar and I'm going to save it as the JPAC file.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.860
So there you go.

03:09.870 --> 03:13.610

03:14.640 --> 03:17.470
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here to the elementary page.

03:17.670 --> 03:18.340
OK.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.280
And I want to make this backdrop not this video.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.930
So this is the column I can assign the background to this column.

03:24.930 --> 03:30.270
I can assign the background to this heading file where I can assign the background to this whole section

03:30.270 --> 03:30.900
right here.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.250
So it totally depends if you want to assign the Bactrim here if you want to change about from here or

03:35.250 --> 03:39.830
if you want to assign the background to this action by applying to this whole section will look great

03:39.840 --> 03:44.570
to make sure that you come here and you just hit EDID section to this Holberg planes comes.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.020
OK.

03:45.090 --> 03:50.540
You have to go to the style have to come here and say is the color OK.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.760
You just have to just come here and it is the image right here.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.460
I'm going to upload an image right here.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.660
OK.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.720
I'm going to go hit I'm going to upload a file.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.040
And it was under the desk top and its name is this.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.830
So I'm going to upload it right now.

04:05.910 --> 04:09.630
And this image should be uploaded after it is uploaded.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.790
I'm going to hit insert media.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.400
So here we go.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.630
He can see that this image is just coming right here.

04:16.830 --> 04:17.320
OK.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.230
And now what I'm going to do.

04:20.230 --> 04:25.490
I'm just going to come here to position and see attachment so it should be fixed.

04:26.140 --> 04:26.590
OK.

04:26.770 --> 04:35.360
And the repeat should be no repeat say should be covered.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.620
So it is looking great.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.910
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go to the layout to this whole

04:42.910 --> 04:48.440
section and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit full it now the it it just come here.

04:48.460 --> 04:55.230
Just come here to night and it should be fit to screen for the screen is very large your show.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.220
I don't think so if I need to make it fit the screen but I think I should be going up at the minimum

05:00.220 --> 05:07.310
height minimum height should be like 500 pixels OK.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.640
500 looks cool.

05:08.830 --> 05:09.270
OK.

05:09.430 --> 05:14.160
And now what I want I need an overlay of this so that it looks great.

05:14.310 --> 05:14.960
OK.

05:14.980 --> 05:21.360
I need a blue overlay so that this text is visible so that this image is also visible.

05:21.370 --> 05:26.470
And this text is also visible and I can see that if I move it this image is not moving so these are

05:26.470 --> 05:27.410
the things that you need.

05:27.550 --> 05:32.460
You need to do the attachment to be fixed and the size to be the cover.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.160
Don't just change anything or leave this as default.

05:35.330 --> 05:40.270
OK I'm going to go to the background overlay and I'm going to go to the bathroom.

05:40.300 --> 05:46.700
So it should be classic and the color should be blue.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.640
So I need

05:53.900 --> 06:00.090
the blue one increase it a bit OK.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.940
And it can see how created this looking

06:06.420 --> 06:11.110
go if I just close it right here you're going to see how this is looking.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.320
So this is how my website is looking right now.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.500
And you can and already see that it is looking great.

06:16.500 --> 06:21.660
So this is how you have to do the fun and make sure that you keep it as simple as you can because your

06:21.680 --> 06:23.620
website is another thing.

06:23.760 --> 06:29.370
The main things are the images the images what people see and get attracted to make sure that you choose

06:29.370 --> 06:34.150
the best image from here and your design should be amazing.

06:34.170 --> 06:34.570
OK.

06:34.710 --> 06:38.920
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to increase this to full and

06:45.650 --> 06:49.350
OK and the opacity should be a bit more

06:51.870 --> 06:52.510
thing.

06:52.510 --> 06:53.720
This is vinyl here.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.950
It's just too weird.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.010
This looks cool as well.

07:02.070 --> 07:02.780
I don't think so.

07:02.810 --> 07:04.920
I think I should be going up in my main team.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.300
That is the blue one.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.760
So here's the

07:14.840 --> 07:15.370
OK.

07:15.380 --> 07:16.460
There's a school.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.730
Now you can see that it is looking great.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.600
So what I'm going to do.

07:20.600 --> 07:25.180
I'm just going to bring this to Center-Right here so you can see that this is the whole column.

07:25.190 --> 07:26.600
This is the whole section.

07:26.690 --> 07:32.000
We have made this section we have given this section a height so you can see that if I just come here

07:32.000 --> 07:36.510
you can see the height is minimum height and the minimum height is set to 500 pixel.

07:36.620 --> 07:36.950
OK.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.310
So you can see that 500 pixel is right here.

07:39.410 --> 07:45.820
And if I choose it to be like the screen then it's going to be fit to my screen too if I just hit this.

07:45.970 --> 07:50.600
Can see that this is now fit to my screen so if you want to make it fit to your screen you can also

07:50.600 --> 07:52.250
go with this but I don't think so.

07:52.250 --> 07:57.320
If it looks created to my website I'm going to I'm just going to go with the minimum height width of

07:57.410 --> 07:58.300
500 pixel.

07:58.390 --> 07:58.880
OK.

07:58.970 --> 08:05.240
And now I'm going to edit this text and I want to align this to center because this is center of a look

08:05.640 --> 08:06.540
much better.

08:06.590 --> 08:11.360
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to just come here and see the alignments you have to just click

08:11.360 --> 08:15.830
this and then it's going to appear and you have to just hit center and you can see that this is now

08:15.890 --> 08:17.680
a line to center.

08:18.410 --> 08:22.670
So you can do anything right here if you want to change your phone tray here if you don't think so that

08:22.670 --> 08:23.650
you don't like your font.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.580
If you think so you can change it.

08:25.610 --> 08:27.130
You can change it to anything.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.200
You can change it to anything you like.

08:30.250 --> 08:35.770
OK so now what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save and I'm going to

08:35.770 --> 08:40.580
just click here and you can see how my website is looking.

08:40.650 --> 08:47.820
So here should be my picture and here should be the thing that is WordPress developer and I see your

08:47.820 --> 08:48.290
expert.

08:48.330 --> 08:52.510
I can also do a signature or I can add a signature right here.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.850
Here should be my picture.

08:53.850 --> 09:00.960
And then here should be a burden that saves see my services or see my education or something like that

09:01.260 --> 09:06.120
or contact me so you can add a call to action button right here so you can do anything pretty well anything

09:06.120 --> 09:07.590
that would just say OK.

09:07.590 --> 09:12.740
So we're going to learn now in this video what extra things you can do with this elementary plug in.

09:12.750 --> 09:17.440
So now I think that you guys have the confusion clear about this column.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.870
If I just ended this column you can see that this column is being edited.

09:20.880 --> 09:26.610
And I can assign this column anything so I can assign this column a color if I want to assign this column

09:26.640 --> 09:28.260
color I can assign this.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.200
This is how it works.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.860
So I'm just going to go ahead.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.660
I don't want to assign this anything right here.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.290
It seemed like this.

09:34.320 --> 09:41.400
I can't assign the section I can assign this text thing so I can also assign the text saying a background

09:41.400 --> 09:42.070
or texture.

09:42.180 --> 09:45.630
So you can also see that it has the text châteaux right here.

09:45.630 --> 09:49.630
If I just come here and I want to just give the text shadow.

09:49.740 --> 09:55.890
So I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to go with the black one and you can see that it has a text

09:55.920 --> 09:58.020
shadow right here.

09:58.470 --> 10:04.590
So the horizontal should be like here and the vertical should be so.

10:05.120 --> 10:05.590
OK.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.420
And if I just click here you can see how this is looking.

10:09.620 --> 10:09.950
OK.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.240
So now what I'm going to do.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.080
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hate safe.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.860
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

10:14.860 --> 10:19.560
In the next video I'm going to show you how can you add an image right here and then do whatever you

10:19.560 --> 10:24.840
want you want to add anything you can do to make sure that you play with the stuff.

10:24.850 --> 10:25.260
OK.

10:25.380 --> 10:26.980
Make sure that you go ahead.

10:26.990 --> 10:32.670
You can play with size you play with vaid you play with transformation the style line high letter spacing

10:32.670 --> 10:34.400
and everything and you guys are going to love it.

10:34.390 --> 10:40.130
So I also like letters spacing pretty well so you can just do the letter spacing as well.

10:40.260 --> 10:40.680
OK.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.370
And if you want to make and make it work.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.540
So thanks a lot guys for watching this in the next video will do the work.

10:46.580 --> 10:46.910
Goodbye.
