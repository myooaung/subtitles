00:00.490 --> 00:02.230
What is up guys and welcome back.

00:02.250 --> 00:07.410
Now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you create a page that displays all of your

00:07.420 --> 00:13.030
post that you have posted so it can be like a blog page so you can create a new page and name it as

00:13.030 --> 00:17.810
the blog or you can copy epal dot com and you can create a page called NEWSROOM.

00:17.810 --> 00:18.180
OK.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.930
So since I am a big fan of football I don't know why.

00:20.930 --> 00:22.370
I just use their products.

00:22.710 --> 00:32.370
Yes I know Windows instead of the Mac mechanism for tutorial purposes guys the average guys who use

00:32.550 --> 00:33.940
Windows are more.

00:34.050 --> 00:39.940
So that is why I use Windows and just teach you everything but I prefer to use my I don't know why.

00:40.470 --> 00:46.950
So let's just go ahead and let's quickly add a page and then just make it our blog page.

00:46.950 --> 00:53.310
So I'm just going to go to the amnion and I'm going to name that page as the news rooms so that it should

00:53.310 --> 00:55.820
display all the post.

00:56.070 --> 01:00.110
Or you can just keep it there or keep that page as the blog page if you want to.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.720
OK and like you can name it as blog.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.720
I don't know why I am copying that pulled out.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.270
Let's just go ahead and let's quickly name it as the plot.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.800
So in that blog page it should show all the post.

01:11.850 --> 01:18.360
OK let's just go ahead and let's quickly just make it just keep it published so I'm going to go ahead

01:18.390 --> 01:19.720
and I'm going to publish this.

01:19.770 --> 01:21.930
That's all you have to do to not do anything.

01:22.080 --> 01:28.500
Let's just go ahead and let's quickly view this page so you can see that this is our blog page and this

01:28.500 --> 01:29.340
is how it is looking.

01:29.610 --> 01:31.920
But I want to make this page.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.790
I want this page to show the post.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.680
Ok like here should be the post coming.

01:36.690 --> 01:43.500
So for that I have to do exactly the same thing that we did for making our home page to be our home

01:43.500 --> 01:45.320
page and how we're going to do that.

01:45.510 --> 01:51.940
Let's just go ahead and let's quickly go to settings and let's just go to Reading.

01:51.960 --> 01:57.660
So in the here and now we have to select a post-paid to be our blog page.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.680
Let's just select it and let's hit save changes and I'll see the magic.

02:02.010 --> 02:08.910
OK what I'm going to go to the all pages and then I'm going to go to the blog page you can see Tay's

02:09.060 --> 02:15.840
post page and if I'm going to view this page then see guys you can see today's his blog and in here

02:15.840 --> 02:17.240

02:17.270 --> 02:17.550
OK.

02:17.550 --> 02:24.560
This is coming and then this is coming and every post is filled come that Vitthal post in future.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.330
So let's go ahead and let's quickly add a new post as well.

02:27.390 --> 02:27.580
OK.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.830
I'm just going to bring my mouse here and here you can see that in the Tabari we have some different

02:31.890 --> 02:32.760
things here.

02:32.820 --> 02:37.160
So for you it just adds a post like if you want to add a post.

02:37.170 --> 02:37.390
OK.

02:37.410 --> 02:41.170
I'm just going to add a new book and I can see it takes us directly to our AD.

02:41.460 --> 02:52.460
So I'm going to name it as you like I can Ziel now offers web development.

02:52.710 --> 02:53.290
OK.

02:53.490 --> 02:53.990

03:00.340 --> 03:06.300
Let's quickly copy and let's just go to our new post and let's just paste it right here.

03:06.530 --> 03:07.370

03:30.810 --> 03:33.360

03:33.620 --> 03:36.070
And when I go to my blog page.

03:36.080 --> 03:41.510

04:09.950 --> 04:11.510
They have the category of press release.

04:11.510 --> 04:14.600
They have the category of a feature like a new feature.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.460
