so this is our contact page.

00:55.400 --> 01:02.510
I just don't like this team I don't know why I just install this and am not happy with this much because

01:02.510 --> 01:08.360
we can not customize this header and the header is the most important thing guys.

01:08.630 --> 01:09.160
That is why.

01:09.320 --> 01:09.600
OK.

01:09.650 --> 01:10.430
So no problem.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.030

This is this is amazing.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.000
OK.

04:02.030 --> 04:06.020
So this is basically already designed and developed.

04:06.170 --> 04:14.010
So I don't think so if I would get that feeling of like you have designed yourself.

04:14.030 --> 04:16.630
I just like this you can design this on that.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.850
This in over the ocean W.P. team.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.630
I didn't think so.

04:20.630 --> 04:21.530
Yes you can design it.

04:21.530 --> 04:22.430
This is very easy.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.690
You can design it easily

You can prevent calling.

06:07.260 --> 06:08.670
OK I'll just come.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.100
You can see that if I just come here it is not scrolling.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.780
OK I can just go read some stuff if I wanted to.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.600
I can also go with the shape divider.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.060
OK we don't have a sheet of 280 right here.

06:21.060 --> 06:26.550
I can go to this structure style and then I can go to the shape dividers so I can even write it as well

06:27.150 --> 06:33.020
if I just go to the top tray here and then I go to the train go.

06:33.030 --> 06:34.450
So this is not looking good.

06:34.720 --> 06:34.940
OK.

06:34.950 --> 06:36.730
This shape divider is not working.

06:36.740 --> 06:41.570

Oh my God.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.870
OK I won this below.

09:07.350 --> 09:08.520
So now we have front page.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.610
I want to change the front page navigationally bill to be whole.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.710
OK.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.730
I want to come here I want to hit save.

09:14.730 --> 09:15.120
And there we go.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.140
Let's check out our Web site so we're totally done with that.

09:18.150 --> 09:23.210
Let's say at OK we have heard this the world's leading hardware company.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.470
We have about we have a code section.

09:25.580 --> 09:31.660
We have a responsive slider super features Trigon and drop and everything coming right here.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.910
This is looking pretty well I think.

09:34.010 --> 09:35.090
Yes.

09:40.030 --> 09:46.020
So you can basically get some examples from them as well and then create your own website okay.

09:46.570 --> 09:52.210
The next section is also going to be great because I want to show you a new team and that team is also

09:52.270 --> 09:56.380
exactly like the elementary plug in.

09:56.380 --> 09:56.610
OK.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.560
But that team is the best team I have ever used.

09:59.560 --> 10:04.240
I just wanted to show you the elementary plug in just because Elementary is free.

10:04.390 --> 10:04.920
OK.

10:04.930 --> 10:09.110
And you can also go with pro-woman if you want to but I don't think so.

10:09.280 --> 10:15.340
If you want to go with the best team ever then I have a new team and I will introduce you that team.

10:15.420 --> 10:21.040
Basically I use that team for mostly my clients who am I don't want to work on coding.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.400
I am a web developer as well.

10:22.400 --> 10:28.690
I basically called the website with HDMI and see Asus and if I don't feel like coding and I think I

10:28.690 --> 10:33.630
want the best design then that I always use that team if I don't want to use that team.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.600
Then I go with this element top plug in.

10:35.770 --> 10:39.450
OK so now let's go to the About page and see about page as well.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.660
It's about this is who we are.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.990
There's a book called by numbers in what I Kline's say and then we have that contact right here.

10:48.010 --> 10:52.130
So everything looks cool.

10:52.180 --> 10:57.750
I want to go to the home page right here and I want to make some changes so let's come here and lotted

10:57.790 --> 10:58.480
customize

11:10.190 --> 11:15.470
and let's go down go down.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.770
And here we have the footer right here.

11:17.770 --> 11:20.470
So we want to change the footer right here.

11:20.470 --> 11:32.620
I want to go to Fuller settings and use for parallax simple contact boxes and boxes so you can change

11:32.800 --> 11:33.830
these as well.

11:33.940 --> 11:37.810
So you can add some footer if you want to you can see how this is looking.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.320
So we have a contact box right here.

11:41.370 --> 11:44.670
It can change this but I cannot change this footer right here.

11:44.680 --> 11:52.330
I can see that that team never used that ocean WB team it gave us the complete access to change this

11:52.330 --> 11:54.950
whole footer but this is not accessing us.

11:55.130 --> 11:58.220
OK so we can change this right here address.

11:58.220 --> 12:03.850
OK we can change icon we can change this to be we can change this as well and we can also change the

12:03.850 --> 12:05.500
social links.

12:06.340 --> 12:09.680
So now we are totally done.

12:09.790 --> 12:13.500
Hey you can see everything looks pretty well on this.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.040
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

12:15.040 --> 12:20.760

12:20.770 --> 12:22.880
So this is basically a company based website.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.710
Ok I'll show you a different type of company based Web site that you can build.

12:26.860 --> 12:27.360
OK.

12:27.500 --> 12:33.520
And I and then I'll also give you some projects as well that you have to do.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.560
And then you have to submit me just that project.

12:36.570 --> 12:38.160
So thanks a lot guys who are watching this.
