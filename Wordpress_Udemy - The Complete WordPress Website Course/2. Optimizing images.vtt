00:00.520 --> 00:05.430
Is guys in what KMAX So in this video I'm going to be showing you how you can work with these speed

00:05.430 --> 00:06.390
optimization.

00:06.390 --> 00:09.130
OK so welcome to your second lecture.

00:09.180 --> 00:09.510
Right.

00:09.570 --> 00:14.280
So I'm not working on Create a WP site rather than I'm working on iTunes.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.650
The reason is that because iTunes zeal is already made and this was a worry first project.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.160
OK.

00:19.170 --> 00:25.180
So I wanted to show you that why not just work with it on a Web site that is already built and developed.

00:25.200 --> 00:25.640
OK.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.370
So if I just go to speed test site OK situs speed or speed testate or whatever.

00:32.580 --> 00:37.230
OK you go here you search here later on the Internet and you just go with the developers that Google

00:37.230 --> 00:39.970
dot com side that has the page B.Com insight.

00:40.100 --> 00:40.510
OK.

00:40.650 --> 00:45.360
And then what you have to do you just have to copy your you are out you have to come up here and then

00:45.360 --> 00:46.550
you have to paste it.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.340
OK I'm going to be clicking here.

00:48.370 --> 00:53.210
Analyze and analyze and then it's going to tell me that what is the speed of my web site.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.580
OK let's wait.

00:54.600 --> 01:01.140
Let's see then that the number one tip that it is giving is that the he is saying that we should be

01:01.170 --> 01:03.030
optimizing our images.

01:03.060 --> 01:09.210
OK if you just go to a desktop you can see we have optimized images so we have two images that are right

01:09.210 --> 01:12.210
here and that needs to be optimized.

01:12.210 --> 01:16.470
OK if I just click here and I just double click here I am going to copy this.

01:16.590 --> 01:16.980
OK.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.060
I'm going to be coming here to New tablet I'm going to paste it right now.

01:20.190 --> 01:20.510
OK.

01:20.520 --> 01:24.930
And let's see how this is the image which is right one.

01:24.970 --> 01:29.890
OK this image needs to be optimized and it needs 90 81 percent reduction.

01:30.030 --> 01:30.460
OK.

01:30.650 --> 01:36.080
So it like this if I just come here and I copy this one on to him here and let's paste it.

01:36.550 --> 01:38.890
OK let's see how much this image needs.

01:38.940 --> 01:45.590
This is the image that we have used here and this image also needs to be optimized so we have two images.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.930
This and this and we will optimize both the images.

01:48.930 --> 01:49.620
So let's get started.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.790
First of all what we have to do do we have to download the images.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.720
Do we have to open them in the photo shop.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.390
Do we have to do this stuff.

01:56.420 --> 01:56.810
No.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.980
We're not going to do that.

01:57.990 --> 02:01.540
The only thing that we have to do is that we have to install a plug in that's all.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.590
And then we have to work to optimize it into this is so easy guys.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.150
And the plug in is also free.

02:06.150 --> 02:10.470
There is also a pro version that is used to just optimize more images.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.220
OK so it will give you like 500 images approximate I don't remember.

02:15.270 --> 02:16.440
Let's just go ahead and let's see.

02:16.520 --> 02:16.820
OK.

02:16.830 --> 02:17.770
I'm going to be coming here.

02:17.790 --> 02:24.150
I'm going to be entering my username and then here I am going to be entering my password so I hope the

02:24.150 --> 02:25.970
password is right.

02:26.190 --> 02:26.950
Let's see.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.040
So I haven't I haven't opened this website since I have designed it.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.690
OK I didn't have much time.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.150
OK.

02:33.150 --> 02:35.340
It's been like more than a month.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.900
And you can see so there are some of datings as well let's just go ahead and let's quickly update them

02:40.170 --> 02:42.970
because it's important.

02:43.080 --> 02:43.420
OK.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.000
I'm going to be selecting all going to be clicking apply.

02:46.110 --> 02:52.590
And then let's go to the plug ins to the install plug in as well and let's just update them.

02:52.850 --> 02:58.070
So this is now being updated from here I don't know if this is a bug what the word Press.

02:58.070 --> 03:01.250
Let's just go to plug in and then let's update from here.

03:01.820 --> 03:06.710
Let's get a date now to the date now and let's update now and update them.

03:06.890 --> 03:11.000
So you can see every plug in is going to be updated.

03:12.410 --> 03:14.530
Let's see yes.

03:14.530 --> 03:15.100
OK.

03:15.190 --> 03:20.440
Now what we have to do is that we need to just go with a plug in.

03:20.440 --> 03:24.820
Actually I even don't remember the name of the plug in so let's just go ahead and let's just search

03:24.820 --> 03:26.870
for the compressed images.

03:26.980 --> 03:27.400
OK.

03:27.460 --> 03:31.330
And the keyboard for the one.

03:31.330 --> 03:34.810
So this plugin has an image that was related to porn.

03:35.140 --> 03:39.160
As far as I remember yes this one.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.020
Yes this one.

03:40.040 --> 03:43.970
Compressed J-P easy PND images by tiny PMG.

03:44.110 --> 03:44.800
OK.

03:45.130 --> 03:47.540
I have used the smush.

03:47.670 --> 03:48.150
OK.

03:48.250 --> 03:52.580
Smush is used by so many installers but I don't know it didn't work for me.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.170
OK.

03:53.170 --> 03:58.500
Whenever I install it whenever I activated and then I work it doesn't give the result while that's come

03:58.500 --> 03:59.410
across.

03:59.410 --> 04:05.080
Jay bagging mpg images I find it to be amazing because it works super awesome.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.250
OK.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.140
That's my opinion.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.770
If this doesn't work you can go with any other plug in right here that is related to compress images

04:11.800 --> 04:13.180
as a WordPress developer.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.920
You shouldn't be Velle of fear that if a plugin does not work or if a plug in and there's a plug in

04:17.920 --> 04:21.930
that you don't like there's there would be another plug in that you have to find out.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.290
You can find that.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.160
Still searching with the keyboard.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.170
And if that's a bayed plug in you can search it on Google.

04:28.270 --> 04:28.590
OK.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.370
And then get it.

04:29.530 --> 04:33.590
So I'm going to be going to going ahead and I'm going to be just installing this right now.

04:34.060 --> 04:35.640
And let's just activate this plug in.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.200
OK.

04:36.220 --> 04:41.530
So I'm basically showing you that how installing this plug in and doing the magic when this plug in

04:41.530 --> 04:47.810
and infill actually works with your side and your side will boost your speed.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.040
OK.

04:49.110 --> 04:53.620
It says Please register or provide an API key to start compressing images.

04:53.620 --> 04:56.600
I'm going to be clicking here and let's see what it says.

04:56.740 --> 04:57.920
OK.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.970
Here's a file compression.

05:00.130 --> 05:00.710
OK.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.680
Make sure that this is OK here.

05:02.830 --> 05:03.100
OK.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.190
And then it takes to register a new account.

05:05.230 --> 05:10.120
So if you don't have an account you just have to register a account you have to click here and you will

05:10.120 --> 05:12.470
be given a link basically.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.690
OK you have to open up your link and you will be taken to your dashboard.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.020
OK.

05:17.050 --> 05:22.150
Since I am already registered but I'm going to be clicking a dashboard and it's going to redirect me

05:22.150 --> 05:23.260
to the dashboard.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.450
So once you click

05:28.340 --> 05:32.070
OK it is safe me to just log into your account the de-link.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.360
OK so I don't have the password.

05:34.550 --> 05:36.710
I'm going to be going to e-mail.

05:37.010 --> 05:38.430
And let's just grab the link.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.820
And here we go you can see these tiny PNB going to be clicking here and I'm going to be clicking log

05:43.820 --> 05:49.630
in that magic playing let's just log ourself and so here we are in the log tab.

05:49.730 --> 05:50.880
OK.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.590
Is compressed images 0 out of 500.

05:53.590 --> 05:56.390
So I have the images left that needs to be compressed.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.650
OK.

05:57.670 --> 06:00.660
I'm going to be going to the API.

06:00.770 --> 06:05.020
So where is the FBI guiding this is the ABH.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.560
OK I'm going to be clicking here.

06:06.740 --> 06:13.750
I'm going to be copying this and then I am going to just go ahead and paste that into this one.

06:13.850 --> 06:16.520
OK so you have to just go ahead.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.650
You have to paste it and then you have to hit save.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.040
OK.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.180
That's all you have to do.

06:20.330 --> 06:24.940
And then he will see that once you click here save your account is connected.

06:25.310 --> 06:25.740
OK.

06:25.940 --> 06:31.050
So you can see that now if your API key is wrong it will give you an error.

06:31.070 --> 06:36.180
So make sure that you cannot cure this tiny PAGG account whether your wordpress.

06:36.290 --> 06:36.650
OK.

06:36.650 --> 06:44.720
And you will be having just like these Monch you can see that I have used zero images and it is 500

06:44.770 --> 06:45.160
left.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.660
OK but it just showing just you have made one compressions this month.

06:48.670 --> 06:49.020
OK.

06:49.030 --> 06:49.910
I don't know why.

06:50.140 --> 06:57.370
OK so you can see that I am here in this right now so you can see everything is right here.

06:57.370 --> 06:59.450
Do not change anything.

06:59.660 --> 07:00.240
OK.

07:00.430 --> 07:01.680
Do not change anything.

07:01.690 --> 07:03.820
We are here and everything should be here.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.510
So here are the settings of the ping.

07:07.630 --> 07:11.090
OK so if you need any custom setting you can just go ahead with them.

07:11.090 --> 07:16.960
OK let's just go ahead and let's go to media and then we have to go to bulk optimization.

07:17.050 --> 07:25.330
OK unplugging this he can see it has start Bell customization and we have uncompressed images is 23

07:25.570 --> 07:28.660
uploaded images A-6 estimated cost is zero dollars.

07:28.700 --> 07:34.070
OK it's free because we have 500 images per month usage.

07:34.120 --> 07:40.480
I'm going to be going ahead and I'm going to be clicking this and it's just it is just going to basically

07:40.480 --> 07:41.260
work with this.

07:41.290 --> 07:49.660
And then let's see if this compress the images and the images are actually compressed or not or whatever.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.830
Ok so I'm going to be going ahead and I'm going to pause my video right now.

07:53.980 --> 07:54.460
OK.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.520
Once it is on I'll be back.

07:58.230 --> 07:58.600
OK.

07:58.630 --> 08:05.130
So you can see that the initial size was two point seventy three M-B and now that's currencies are takes

08:05.140 --> 08:07.300
one which is a huge stink.

08:07.300 --> 08:15.790
OK you can see the current size is now in kilobytes and it was before in megabytes or 7000 kilobytes

08:15.790 --> 08:16.880
which is so much.

08:17.020 --> 08:23.640
OK so you can see how much reduction is done here and you can actually see how it is good.

08:23.770 --> 08:31.210
OK now let's go ahead and let's see how our website works on the optimization and you will be amazed

08:31.210 --> 08:33.510
to see such a great result.

08:33.510 --> 08:39.490
But as you can see that the images will slow down on your website a lot so you have to focus on the

08:39.490 --> 08:40.260
images first.

08:40.380 --> 08:40.630
OK.

08:40.630 --> 08:41.120
That is right.

08:41.130 --> 08:42.060
Give us here.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.530
I'm going to be clicking analyze again and let's see.

08:44.530 --> 08:46.610
So it was on 47 before.

08:46.690 --> 08:49.350
I hope it it's not and for these seven again.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.460
Fingers crossed.

08:51.460 --> 08:58.420
Ok ok you can see it in no changed from seven to seven.

08:58.790 --> 08:59.290
Thank you.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.020
Thank you.

09:00.300 --> 09:00.770
OK.

09:01.030 --> 09:07.710
You can see that the optimization has changed from 47 to 70 which is super awesome.

09:07.750 --> 09:08.960
You don't have to do anything.

09:09.280 --> 09:09.840
OK.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.350
Like if even even now at this point.

09:12.580 --> 09:13.260
OK.

09:13.450 --> 09:20.170
At this point even if you did not just do anything else if you did not just cover the second lectures

09:20.170 --> 09:25.080
or upcoming lectures you're done OK because Google is not like that.

09:25.090 --> 09:30.510
OK you have to just achieve the 100 or 80 OK.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.850
You have to just be beyond 65.

09:33.990 --> 09:34.540
That's all.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.360
OK.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.420
So you can see that we are still here in the 70 and I'm going to be giving you some more tips OK that

09:40.420 --> 09:44.660
you can work with and you will see that your reps hate the Villard much faster.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.240
OK.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.930
So in the next video Altro you can buy.
