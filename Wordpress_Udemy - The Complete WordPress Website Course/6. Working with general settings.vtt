OK so you can create basically logos like this.

07:08.810 --> 07:11.420
I'm just showing you that how the logos works basically.

07:11.590 --> 07:11.900

So this is my local one.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.290
Select I want to crop it

07:44.270 --> 07:46.240

OK.

07:56.790 --> 08:01.710
And I want to go down and again see that this logo is being same but I want to change the color.

08:01.800 --> 08:06.290
So when I go to the dark logo I want to select the logo I want to go to upload files that would come

08:06.300 --> 08:09.360
here and here should be the logo too.

08:09.510 --> 08:14.450
So you can see that when I change my scroll or it might this you can see this will be changed.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.390
What's going on here.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.520
You can go above right here.

08:17.630 --> 08:22.130
It's just come to say let's go on here.

08:22.320 --> 08:28.370
And this as well want cropping page.

08:28.430 --> 08:29.080
So there we go.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.180
Now you can see how this is going to change.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.000
OK.

08:32.150 --> 08:35.960
I'm going to go down and you can see this is first plaque and this is right.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.590
And now I go down and this is red and this is what it said.

08:38.630 --> 08:41.030
So you can pretty well change the stuff.

08:41.180 --> 08:41.910
OK.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.360
Then we have the local max height.

08:43.370 --> 08:47.270
You can change the global max height as well you can change if you want to.

08:47.510 --> 08:51.080
OK but I'm going to go with the default one that is 70

08:55.400 --> 09:02.450
so now what we want to do we want to go back and we can pretty well change our self Vidar customization

09:02.450 --> 09:03.570
colors as well.

09:03.840 --> 09:11.240
OK we can we can go with Bactrim to mange and everything but I think we don't want to do it what we

09:11.240 --> 09:17.690
want to do is that we have two options either to go with this team and edit all the stuff with this

09:17.690 --> 09:18.100
team.

09:18.130 --> 09:20.020
OK you can edit them completely

09:23.160 --> 09:27.460
or hey what you have to do you have to just come here you have to just click here this and you can change

09:27.460 --> 09:30.720
it so you can change it like blue collar.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.240
OK.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.510
And this is will be my the world's

09:39.310 --> 09:42.880
leading Hi there.

09:50.730 --> 09:52.350
Hardware Company

09:56.440 --> 09:57.210
OK.

09:57.380 --> 09:58.860
Then we have the action button one.

09:59.030 --> 10:07.400
So it's going to be I can edit edited action but I'm one Debrett index would be about us or something

10:07.400 --> 10:09.420
like that about us.

10:09.920 --> 10:15.490
And it's going to link to any year and then we have the target to be saying tab and I mean head apply

10:15.500 --> 10:16.140
changes.

10:16.140 --> 10:22.280
OK I want to go to this right now and I want to get here and I want to get to here get a quote.

10:22.620 --> 10:23.090
OK.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.470
And then the link is going to be anything.

10:25.580 --> 10:26.590
So I want to come here.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.460
I am going to head to St.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.830
Let's go ahead so you can open this up in a new job as well so then we have about us get a code.

10:33.020 --> 10:33.330
OK.

10:33.350 --> 10:34.690
Then we have responsive design.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.890
You can change it.

10:36.080 --> 10:36.350
OK.

10:36.350 --> 10:41.470
You have to come here to Prowse icon and you can choose an icon that you want to Andray here.

10:41.750 --> 10:47.420
And then you can come here and then you can apply changes so this is basically pretty very easy and

10:47.480 --> 10:52.670
I don't think so if I should show you because you guys already know how he changed this you just have

10:52.670 --> 10:57.560
to come here and this is a portfolio portfolio means the projects that you have done so you can come

10:57.560 --> 11:00.670

11:00.680 --> 11:01.670
You are totally done.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.810
So this is how you can manage it completely.

11:03.860 --> 11:09.770

11:09.770 --> 11:10.640
pro-woman.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.120

11:20.320 --> 11:22.010
We are totally done with our home page.

11:22.010 --> 11:27.610
Let's just design our new page and that will be our About page OK so you can basically change this completely.

11:27.610 --> 11:29.260
I don't think so if I should show you this.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.190
I'm going to go ahead.

11:30.200 --> 11:36.050

11:42.910 --> 11:49.090
I want to add a new page and that will be about page OK.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.450
And I want to come here to default template.

11:51.490 --> 11:56.300
I want to come here and I want to hit publish.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.710
Let's see our page right now.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.300
How is it looking.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.800
So this is how our page is looking.

12:02.840 --> 12:08.160
We have her home about service to world deleting Harburg companies also got me so I can just choose

12:08.160 --> 12:14.430

12:29.150 --> 12:31.220

12:35.790 --> 12:38.720
You have just come here and then you have to hit customize.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.160
OK.

12:39.290 --> 12:46.820
And I think if this team gives you the ability to customize this header if you want the changed at her

12:46.870 --> 12:48.010
head for a cure.

12:48.180 --> 12:48.860
So

12:51.930 --> 12:53.450
OK we have this hero.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.270
OK we have her pages here right here.

12:56.270 --> 12:59.400
You can change these hero if you want to.

12:59.550 --> 13:02.440
You can change the color of type to be an image right here.

13:02.450 --> 13:06.830
And this is going to be an image so you can see how this is looking.

13:07.280 --> 13:07.560
OK.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.190
I think this looks pretty well ok.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.300
I think this looks good.

13:11.330 --> 13:19.850
Well I'm going to go to back to his hero and the text should be show subtitle.

13:19.850 --> 13:22.390
I don't think so if you need this.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.130
About his fight.

13:25.310 --> 13:28.790
I'm going to go to polish right now and you can see that this is probably still here.

13:28.790 --> 13:32.030
So this is how you can manage pretty well any of the team.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.290
And now here we want to add some stuff.

13:34.460 --> 13:34.910
OK.

13:35.030 --> 13:44.560
What we want to add is that we can first let's go ahead let's hit new page here and let's just hit this

13:44.590 --> 13:45.210
again.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.510
So that nothing changes.

13:48.550 --> 13:51.710
You can see this is how I say this looking if you go down.

13:51.710 --> 13:54.350
Our head is being changed.

13:54.730 --> 13:58.960
Now what I want to do I want to add a new section and then we're going to edit that so I'm going to

13:58.960 --> 14:01.580
hit and new section this is right here.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.430
I want to come here.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.280
I'm going to hit this.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.900
And now here we can add it.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.170
This whole team.

14:07.360 --> 14:13.830
So in the next week I'll show you that how can you edit this whole team and how can you work with it.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.130
Stadium guys and by.
