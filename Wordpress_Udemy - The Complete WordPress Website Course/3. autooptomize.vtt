WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:05.730
What is up guys and what KMAX so and that's what you are going to be showing you how can you just work

00:05.730 --> 00:08.660
with more optimization.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.240
OK.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.000
So the number one thing we have here is to leverage browser caching.

00:14.010 --> 00:14.590
OK.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.490
This means that when we visit a Web site.

00:17.610 --> 00:18.260
OK.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.510
You can see that this Web site consists of files.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.070
OK.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.950
They can be like images.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.820
They can be script files and they can be so many files OK if I just come here you can see that these

00:29.820 --> 00:32.430
files are loaded first.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.060
OK.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.810
You can see this is a style sheet and everything.

00:35.940 --> 00:41.640
So these files these all files are loaded first and then the website page letter.

00:41.670 --> 00:41.980
OK.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.440
Let me show you if I just go ahead and I just open up you can see this is a file.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.770
So this follows first.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.410
OK.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.680
Then this file loads first.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.270
OK.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.120
And then every file load.

00:53.250 --> 00:58.620
Ok so you can see that every file loads and then the page loads so which takes a lot of time.

00:58.840 --> 01:08.770
OK now what is meant by that leverage browser caching is that when a guy was it's I NZL dot com the

01:08.760 --> 01:11.380
page vild download all these files.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.720
OK.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.950
Like in my browser and then I will go to like another page.

01:16.980 --> 01:22.860
There will be the higher Me page ok if I just go to higher Rashmi.

01:23.050 --> 01:23.540
OK.

01:23.680 --> 01:31.270
So if I just go to higher main page then it will not load all these files again it will save these files

01:31.570 --> 01:33.730
in the cache of the browser.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.120
OK.

01:34.210 --> 01:35.140
And then it's a lot lower.

01:35.130 --> 01:38.070
So this means that the leverage browser caching is meant.

01:38.080 --> 01:38.690
OK.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.930
So this is what they mean my deliveries are caching.

01:42.250 --> 01:46.120
So you can just go ahead and you can work for the leverage problems or caching.

01:46.400 --> 01:53.200
OK you can also work with the printer blocking javascript and you can also work with the minification

01:53.200 --> 01:54.380
of java javascript.

01:54.400 --> 01:59.430
OK so I'm going to be telling you one plug in that's going to do almost all of the jobs.

01:59.860 --> 02:01.030
And that is all optimized.

02:01.050 --> 02:01.480
OK.

02:01.510 --> 02:04.480
Most people say you should be going up at the Double Tree.

02:04.550 --> 02:05.970
TC OK.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.050
W3 to look at.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.610
She is also a plug in that is the most famous.

02:10.750 --> 02:15.310
Like many talking about e-commerce Web say the commerce is the most famous.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.050
OK let me talk about compressing images.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.830
This my shit is the most famous.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.440
OK.

02:20.530 --> 02:26.380
And let me talk about the speed optimization the W3 is the most famous.

02:26.410 --> 02:26.950
OK.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.410
But you can also go with that.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.010
OK you can install that plug in.

02:32.020 --> 02:35.110
You can also install does that will be super catchy.

02:35.140 --> 02:35.450
OK.

02:35.450 --> 02:39.570
And you can also install that optimize so I'm going to be going ahead and let's try this one.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.340
OK.

02:40.390 --> 02:46.030
Or just go with the optimize so I'm going to be clicking auto searching for auto up to my ears.

02:46.070 --> 02:52.270
OK and let's see what this plug in sais and what it said about optimize the speeds of your website by

02:52.300 --> 02:59.020
optimizing JSE says Josh removing And Moji cuff optimizing Google fonts and more.

02:59.080 --> 03:05.460
So I'm going to be going ahead and I am going to just click here.

03:06.460 --> 03:06.940
OK.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.930
So once we click here let's just go ahead and activate this.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.660
OK.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.120
And on clicking the Activate.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.060
I'm going to just work with my website.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.340
I'm going to open that up and see your tools.

03:17.350 --> 03:21.070
And let's see if that optimize plugin works better or not.

03:21.090 --> 03:27.390
If it doesn't work then we will delete it now guys keep that in mind.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.830
You have to try.

03:28.990 --> 03:29.580
Keep trying.

03:29.620 --> 03:30.340
OK.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.700
You may understand one plug in your Mandelstam the other plug in.

03:33.820 --> 03:39.240
So if our optimizer is not working for you maybe W3 total cash will work for you.

03:39.250 --> 03:39.620
OK.

03:39.790 --> 03:45.610
Let me show you what the double DC is going to be going to add new I'm going to be clicking.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.070
I'm going to be searching for the bullet for DC so W3 DC may be the option for you.

03:50.110 --> 03:53.510
So if the optimizer doesn't work you can go to W3 DC.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.360
OK so it has the 1 plus million installs.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.150
OK so you can just go at any if you want to.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.130
So this is what I mean.

04:04.470 --> 04:04.790
OK.

04:04.820 --> 04:12.730
And this you can also go with the W.P. super gaeshi as well which is by WordPress company.

04:12.860 --> 04:13.240
OK.

04:13.340 --> 04:19.100
So it also has the 1 plus million active installations so you can go with any 30 There are so many if

04:19.100 --> 04:22.830
one plugin doesn't work don't be like OK you can not do that.

04:22.850 --> 04:24.120
OK you can do that.

04:24.170 --> 04:28.000
Maybe you are not understanding the plug in maybe your hosting environment doesn't match with that plug

04:28.000 --> 04:29.850
in configuration or something like that.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.490
Let's just go ahead and let's optimize it.

04:32.620 --> 04:37.260
I'm going to be checking all of them are going to be cleaning seaven empty.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.300
And you can see everything is done.

04:39.460 --> 04:39.930
OK.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.260
Now let's see if our website speed is increased.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.800
If it upsets we it not increased we will go and check another plug in will see that.

04:46.840 --> 04:52.960
How can we just work with different plug ins to enhance this we have to say to our reps say speed was

04:52.960 --> 04:58.700
around 70 OK now as it is increased to 76.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.910
But I think that this is down a bit.

05:02.330 --> 05:06.400
So you can see that our reps speed is a bit increased.

05:06.430 --> 05:06.710
OK.

05:06.710 --> 05:11.470
From 70 it has increased to 76 OK.

05:11.600 --> 05:19.050
Now if I just go ahead and I just go to the plug in and I want to go ahead the double is super dashi.

05:19.190 --> 05:19.640
Okay.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.660
I'm going to be installing this I'm going to be just activating this.

05:23.660 --> 05:29.870
Let's see if this plugin works if both the plug in works at a time if both the plug in doesn't conflict.

05:30.040 --> 05:38.850
OK so now what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I am going to go to the settings.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.350
OK.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.420
So the caching should be on.

05:43.460 --> 05:49.910
So I'm just gonna catchy update everything and I'm going to be clicking update status to tell you have

05:49.910 --> 05:50.440
to do.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.580
You can go to the Advanced Settings.

05:52.790 --> 05:53.270
OK.

05:53.390 --> 05:58.090
You can work with them but I'll be just opening up the caching that's all.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.020
OK.

05:59.030 --> 06:05.850
So now let's see if our Web site Peeters increased or not.

06:05.850 --> 06:06.510
76.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.090
It was on 76 before.

06:08.290 --> 06:14.930
OK let's see if our Web site speed is increased or it has not increased.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.410
So it's still there.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.080
OK.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.890
So there will be super catchy is not just doing much things.

06:20.890 --> 06:21.340
OK.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.750
So there are advance settings.

06:22.750 --> 06:28.510
There are advance settings that you can find on the document of this.

06:28.540 --> 06:29.110
OK.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.920
So you can just read that you can read that.

06:32.050 --> 06:35.490
What are the things used for some things and everything like that.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.000
OK and then you can work with them.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.440
But since this plug in mains headings did not work for me.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.120
What I'm going to do.

06:42.220 --> 06:43.270
I'm just going to go to plug in.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.220
I'm going to go to install plug ins and I'm going to be just deactivating that plug in.

06:47.320 --> 06:47.750
OK.

06:47.800 --> 06:54.760
So this is also recommended that make sure that you are not using to drive plug ins into one single

06:54.760 --> 06:55.270
web site.

06:55.390 --> 06:55.610
OK.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.960
Because the boatful conflict like this is also for caching.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.280
Speeding up the Web site and this is also this is for the compressing images.

07:03.280 --> 07:10.410
OK so both of them are different but this and this is totally not totally but maybe a bit tame.

07:10.510 --> 07:17.320
So I don't think so if I need that so you have to think OK whether you need this plug in or you don't

07:17.320 --> 07:17.780
need this.

07:17.830 --> 07:21.520
OK you can see the reps say speed is kind of bad.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.110
Amazing.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.410
OK I our HP is totally cool totally.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.120
OK.

07:26.290 --> 07:29.900
Now let's come to this and let's see what we can do with this.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.980
It is showing us to reduce the server response time.

07:33.310 --> 07:41.750
What does this is that your server needs to be where he hides so for that you have to buy the Wii.

07:41.780 --> 07:42.220
OK.

07:42.350 --> 07:44.630
Since we are on a shared web hosting.

07:44.690 --> 07:48.240
OK if I just go to host dot com Let me show you.

07:48.260 --> 07:52.980
You can see that we bought the shared web hosting which is obviously nothing.

07:53.260 --> 07:53.760
OK.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.800
So which is which is very very cheap.

07:57.170 --> 08:01.100
Ok for three years you're getting it for 150 bucks.

08:01.130 --> 08:01.640
OK.

08:01.730 --> 08:05.530
But if you won best servers you can go for the VPN.

08:05.540 --> 08:11.360
So we means the watchful private server that would be your own server only your website would be running

08:11.360 --> 08:11.840
on it.

08:12.020 --> 08:12.310
OK.

08:12.320 --> 08:18.270
And you would be giving specific crimes specific CPQ specific space and specific Benvenuto.

08:18.380 --> 08:21.740
But it says very much CAUSLEY even that to G-B RAM is very costly.

08:21.740 --> 08:27.140
If I just go ahead and I just go to buy now and if I just want to show you I can see that they're still

08:27.140 --> 08:28.700
giving you 75 percent.

08:28.940 --> 08:38.920
And we go down even if we you can see how much it is costing us for three years.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.340
So that is huge.

08:40.340 --> 08:40.950
OK.

08:40.970 --> 08:44.860
Like nobody would be investing in this either.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.600
From my perspective I know.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.220
OK.

08:47.270 --> 08:52.520
Because we are here to start a business not we are we are a business and mirror creating a Web site

08:52.520 --> 08:53.230
for that business.

08:53.230 --> 08:53.800
OK.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.030
So obviously you would not be investing this much.

08:56.090 --> 09:01.860
So make sure because everything we have done here is totally OK.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.740
Seventy five percent is a lot.

09:03.900 --> 09:04.890
OK.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.520
You can just go and search for a popular Web site those are so amazing and you can even work for them

09:10.520 --> 09:15.800
and you will see that they're not even just there below 50.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.240
OK.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.700
So 25 percent is totally OK.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.370
OK.

09:19.490 --> 09:23.110
So now we're totally done with our speed optimization.

09:23.150 --> 09:23.480
OK.

09:23.480 --> 09:30.050
And the next video I'll show you how to integrate the CD and how CDN they'll just work with our speed

09:30.050 --> 09:30.800
optimization.

09:30.810 --> 09:32.810
Okay so that's another thing as well.

09:33.010 --> 09:33.410
Okay.

09:33.530 --> 09:42.730
And after that I'll show you how to work with the SSL.

09:42.910 --> 09:43.400
Okay.

09:43.670 --> 09:48.150
So after that I'll show you how to work for SSL which is the most amazing part.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.550
So stadium guys and Mike.
