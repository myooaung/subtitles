00:00.840 --> 00:06.500
What is a guy who's in welcome x so as in the Privets video we installed it for press in it and basically

00:06.570 --> 00:12.310
Viviani create so many websites like more than 10 websites or just like that.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.690
So we can not buy so many domain names.

00:14.700 --> 00:20.400
Instead we can create subdomain names for free and then we can create too many websites OK.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.910
So what I want to do is it will create subdomain names like s one for Site 1 S2 for Site 2 so it will

00:26.910 --> 00:30.040
be like S1 complete double B course dot com.

00:30.140 --> 00:30.560
OK.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.110
And then we will move on with this so let's go ahead.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.610
Let's go to the dashboard.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.460
Or C the C panel.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.000
OK.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.890
And what's your have to do we have to go down.

00:40.050 --> 00:42.460
And here it say's subdomains.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.040
So you have to come here and we basically want to create a subdomain name.

00:46.050 --> 00:48.980
So I want to create a subdomain name for this one.

00:48.990 --> 00:49.400
OK.

00:49.470 --> 00:53.400
And this domain name will be for a complete table of course dot com.

00:53.430 --> 01:03.030
So my document Trude is going to be sub underscore DOMA ins slash and Swannack.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.900
I guess one

01:07.460 --> 01:10.050
dot complete of course stuck

01:14.790 --> 01:20.420
complete W.P. of course dot com as one that complete that will be course dot com.

01:20.430 --> 01:20.760
OK.

01:20.910 --> 01:26.340
So once I created this will be created and then we're going to install WordPress in it.

01:26.340 --> 01:33.650
So let's go ahead and let's hit create and you can see that as one that complete double the course has

01:33.650 --> 01:34.320
been created.

01:34.400 --> 01:42.520
Now we fast we have to install word press and how we will do that if we have to go to File Manager.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.250
OK.

01:43.280 --> 01:49.820
And then we have to you just go to subdomains right here and we have to we have this as one that can

01:49.820 --> 01:53.920
be doubled because dot com we have to basically upload that

01:58.140 --> 02:03.360
upload we have to basically upload that WordPress file we have to selected we have to just upload this

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
WordPress zip.

02:04.470 --> 02:07.020
We have to open it up and you can see that this is being uploaded.

02:07.020 --> 02:16.940
So after it is uploaded what we have to do we have to go back and then we have to extract it.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.850
Here it is extracted.

02:22.860 --> 02:31.540
Now what I have to do I have to refresh this and I have to remove this I have to just hit delete and

02:31.540 --> 02:34.520
that should be delete what you have to do you have to know hey check this.

02:34.570 --> 02:35.990
And then you have to hit OK.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.050
Confirm.

02:38.120 --> 02:46.770
So now we have to basically log on to S1 dot complete the course dot com it this.

02:46.940 --> 02:47.820
And there we go.

02:47.930 --> 02:51.290
You can see that it is showing a 404 not found right now.

02:51.440 --> 02:51.780
OK.

02:51.860 --> 02:58.310
But what you have to do you have to wait for like five minutes or more than five minutes and then you

02:58.310 --> 02:59.360
will visit this page.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.190
This will be done.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.400
OK so you have to wait for like some time because host kid is a bit slow in the subdomain name.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.400
OK so when they are done they will just get that and our site will be up and running.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.810
So after five minutes or four minutes I'll just be back.

03:13.970 --> 03:16.270
And then I'll show you how to install it.

03:16.340 --> 03:22.030
But basically you guys already know how to install WordPress natively have to just go to my school database.

03:22.360 --> 03:22.770
OK.

03:22.820 --> 03:26.120
And we have to install WordPress in the same database.

03:26.140 --> 03:30.480
OK we have to install word press in the same database that is see of course.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.150
OK the user name is going to be this.

03:32.150 --> 03:36.520
But if you will be using a different extension.

03:36.530 --> 03:41.300
OK so make sure that even Stolberg press with this method do not install were impressed with Arto mattered

03:41.300 --> 03:46.900
because you will see a lot of database and it will be having a lot of things so do not install it that

03:46.900 --> 03:47.290
way.

03:47.450 --> 03:49.610
Just install and press for this method OK.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.960
So after like five minutes I'll just be back.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.750
I'm just pausing you right now so that everything looks good.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.620
So I'm just pausing you right now and I'll be back when it is done.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.420
What does it guys and you can see that I have now.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.290
This website is totally up and running and runs.

04:05.330 --> 04:09.000
And when I visited this you can see that this is the video that is coming right here.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.160
I want to just sit next.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.300
Continue to get the next set up.

04:12.380 --> 04:18.530
And I want to go to hit let's go and I want to enter my wordpress database name so my wordpress database

04:18.530 --> 04:20.750
name is going to be this one.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.900
I want to come here and I want to paste it right now.

04:22.910 --> 04:23.320
OK.

04:23.390 --> 04:30.700
So my user name is going to be this one I want to copy this right now.

04:33.350 --> 04:33.710
OK.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.820
I'll just copy them here and let's say it based.

04:36.900 --> 04:37.350
There we go.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.920
And now I want to enter the password

04:42.460 --> 04:48.040
so now a have to enter that database has solved this as it is make sure that it is Looby host and then

04:48.040 --> 04:51.700
we are going to name it as W.P. as one.

04:51.700 --> 04:52.220
OK.

04:52.240 --> 04:58.510
So this is basically make sure that this is unique every time you install WordPress in a database in

04:58.510 --> 05:01.810
the same that you can see that we are installing in the same database.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.280
So make sure that this is unique.

05:03.310 --> 05:08.020
Don't use a double underscore mean make sure that you use that to be a unique and that you have to hit

05:08.080 --> 05:10.920
submit and wait.

05:10.990 --> 05:14.860
You can see that it is already sparkly you have made it to the part of installation.

05:14.860 --> 05:18.920
Now I have to just run the install and it's you know take me to the new window.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.560
And now here I have to enter the tables my Sithole is going to be say one or anything.

05:24.580 --> 05:28.470
So you can pretty well change it later on so I'm going to be just entering the site one.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.060
OK.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.770

So email addresses this and I want to install WordPress now and you can see that WordPress has been

05:47.020 --> 05:53.050
installed in S1 complete self Lupi course dot com and now we are totally done.

05:53.050 --> 05:58.450
So in this video we're going to be just deciding that what you have to create in this I guess we have

05:58.450 --> 06:03.790
a lot of say to create and you guys are going to learn how to create different offices and make sure

06:03.790 --> 06:08.060
that you try each and every Web site simultaneously.

06:08.130 --> 06:13.490
That how we say you make sure that you watch to watch a video and this video you're watching right now.

06:13.530 --> 06:15.270
