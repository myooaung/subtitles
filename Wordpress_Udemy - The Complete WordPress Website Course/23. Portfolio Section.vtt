00:16.150 --> 00:21.120
What is it guys and what KMAX are now in this video we're going to be working with the portfolio.

00:21.190 --> 00:21.550
OK.

00:21.610 --> 00:22.180
So let's get started.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.780
First of all what we have to do we have to just make sure that everything is safe right here.

00:25.810 --> 00:26.290
OK.

00:26.290 --> 00:26.850
I'm going to come here.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.270
I'm going to hit save and make sure that everything is safe.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.640
So let's just go ahead and let's hit the visual builder.

00:32.710 --> 00:33.640
OK.

00:34.660 --> 00:40.270
I just drink a lot of water just like my tummy is going whoo.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.050
OK.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.930
Let's just come in here and you can see that I am here in the Navy.

00:44.980 --> 00:45.490
OK.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.830
And you can see that this is the project based.

00:48.850 --> 00:49.420
OK.

00:49.810 --> 00:55.920
So what is a portfolio basically poured for you is basically the company it can be the company portfolio

00:55.930 --> 01:00.120
it can be a personal portfolio or it can be any portfolio that you want to show.

01:00.250 --> 01:08.920
So portfolio is basically the work that you have done the past ago or that years ago or the recent very

01:08.920 --> 01:10.420
study you have done or something like that.

01:10.420 --> 01:11.820
So how portfolio works.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.670
I'm going to show you in this video and this video is going to explain everything.

01:16.690 --> 01:22.390
Let's just go to the dashboard right here and you can see that when you install this DV This is the

01:22.720 --> 01:27.790
this is the section that is automatically created and this refers to basically projects all projects

01:27.820 --> 01:29.750
and categories and tags.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.330
OK.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.870
So if my this company is about the event management.

01:33.880 --> 01:34.310
OK.

01:34.420 --> 01:38.570
So I'm just going to add the portfolio about the events that I have created.

01:38.590 --> 01:39.020
OK.

01:39.100 --> 01:44.020
So first of all I have to just add that projects categories that can appear.

01:44.100 --> 01:44.430
Okay.

01:44.470 --> 01:47.020
So the first one will be the marriage events

01:50.320 --> 01:50.720
Okay.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.340
And this is going to be the description is going to be nothing.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.330
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit add Neal.

01:56.430 --> 02:00.270
The second one would be country

02:03.230 --> 02:04.550

02:07.390 --> 02:08.710
and the third one would be

02:15.130 --> 02:15.630

02:15.850 --> 02:17.820
And let's just add in your category.

02:17.970 --> 02:18.360

02:18.430 --> 02:20.680
So now you can see that they are coming like here.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.310
Okay.

02:21.310 --> 02:27.100
Now what I have to do I have to add these events right here that I have created basically or I have

02:27.100 --> 02:28.900
managed or I have designed them.

02:29.110 --> 02:34.690
OK so now what I have to do I have to just add Neal and I have to basically add those events that I

02:34.690 --> 02:36.530

02:36.700 --> 02:42.900
So I have to add here the company name that I have done the event for so 8th for the marriage.

02:43.000 --> 02:55.120

OK so now I have to represent that hall basically here that I have managed the event.

03:28.830 --> 03:32.730
So I'm going to go do that and I just had dog gone to grab some images because

03:35.770 --> 03:42.490

08:23.620 --> 08:28.640
So I have the layout so it is basically true so you can also set the grid as well.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.460

08:30.580 --> 08:32.060
OK.

08:32.120 --> 08:32.850
I'm like this.

08:32.870 --> 08:33.600
What you can do.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.410
You can add it on the layout the read regular mode.

08:37.420 --> 08:37.970
OK.

08:37.990 --> 08:40.310
And under regular mode it will be different.

Hey.

15:52.470 --> 16:00.190
So some like this you can manage it you can get it you can get the thrown at and label design the layout

16:04.920 --> 16:06.500
filter criteria text.

16:06.510 --> 16:08.200
This is the folder created your text.

16:08.310 --> 16:13.720
This is the page anation This is the speccing the border the sizing and everything is right here.

16:13.830 --> 16:14.570
OK.

16:14.570 --> 16:20.740
So here you can see everything is coming here perfectly.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.240
Here are the five that are coming right here.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.020
OK.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.020
So thanks a lot guys for watching still here.

16:27.020 --> 16:33.450
I think that now we have understanded every day we build the functionality.

16:33.530 --> 16:35.510
I would recommend you to not to make it full.

16:35.540 --> 16:35.940
OK.

16:36.080 --> 16:36.620
Let's come here.

16:36.650 --> 16:42.230
Let's make this hazing to be just like this you can make it you can make the custom it to be normal.

16:42.260 --> 16:46.220
But make sure that you do not add it to be full with because it is not looking good.

16:46.470 --> 16:46.920
OK.

16:47.030 --> 16:51.490
So you can see everything is looking pretty well and amazing right here.

16:51.890 --> 16:58.100
If you want to make these text to be in the center you can also align it to the center as well.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.790
So I think Center makes it much better.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.760
OK.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.720
Everything looks amazing.

17:03.740 --> 17:07.310

They see the portfolio so make sure you add your portfolio in your home page.

17:23.450 --> 17:28.550
If not possible try to edit in the About page because this is really very important since you don't

17:28.550 --> 17:30.520

17:30.620 --> 17:31.610
That is what I cannot show it.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.550
