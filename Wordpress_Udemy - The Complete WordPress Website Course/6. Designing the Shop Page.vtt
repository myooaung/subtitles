00:00.500 --> 00:03.320
What does a guy who's a man can Maxson you can see that everything is done here.

00:03.320 --> 00:04.100
I'm just going to come here.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.510
I'm just going to hit go to dashboard.

00:05.510 --> 00:11.930
So let's just remove this and you can see that our WordPress website is totally ready and running's

00:12.010 --> 00:13.310
Let's have a look at her site.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.180
OK.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.340
This is our Web site those looking.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.160
We have our local.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.620
We have our menu right here.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.330
And then we have a call to action.

00:20.360 --> 00:25.620
This is this it's going to take us to the all products page where we should be taking to the shop.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.570
So let's just click here and let's see how it is so if I just come here you can see how the shop age

00:30.570 --> 00:31.490
is looking.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.200
We have everything coming here.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.920
And you can see how crazy it looks.

00:35.930 --> 00:36.420
OK.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.070
We have the B.G. nation as well here.

00:38.090 --> 00:40.570
So in this video we'll be working up the shelf Bage.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.540
We're going to design this.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.020
OK.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.870
So let's just come here.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.860
Let's just click this customize section

00:48.800 --> 00:52.540
and here we're going to customize this whole so you can customize it with the elements.

00:52.550 --> 00:58.790
But you can customize this with here since this team gives the maximize customized maximize customized

00:58.790 --> 01:01.790
ability Max Max customizable.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.680
That is why this team is the best.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.020
So I'm just going to go to commers right now and then we're going to design this page so you can also

01:09.020 --> 01:11.710
design it from the video here here from here.

01:11.780 --> 01:17.090
We're going to design the current step from here so you can see that it has the general So we have custom

01:17.170 --> 01:19.860
commerce sidebar display featured image.

01:19.860 --> 01:21.070
So this is set to Yes.

01:21.300 --> 01:21.750
OK.

01:21.830 --> 01:23.990
Because the feature image should be yes.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.040
No it is for the category B.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.790
So it is not for that cartridge.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.970
And then we have the cross Seldes kown.

01:30.080 --> 01:34.030
It's going to tell you that on the card if we just go to the shopping card great.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.220
Now I we don't have any of the card in right here.

01:38.370 --> 01:39.940
So let's just go to the shopping cart.

01:39.990 --> 01:44.300
If I just go to x 6 that can play double B course dot com.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.930
And then I go to the shopping cart.

01:45.940 --> 01:53.510
So let me just go to the shopping card.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.170
Now here you can see how this is so it.

01:56.350 --> 01:56.610
OK.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.330
I have to add a product in the card.

01:58.340 --> 01:59.250
Then it's going to work.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.820
So I'm just going to add a product.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.840
So let's just add this product.

02:03.190 --> 02:03.810
OK.

02:03.820 --> 02:08.440
This is in here I'm just going to hit the cards right now and you can see that it should be having the

02:08.440 --> 02:09.190
card count.

02:09.190 --> 02:18.550
So if I just go to this game here and I just read first yes let's just reload this OK since we don't

02:18.550 --> 02:21.400
have any of the product that thing.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.730
That means that the up sales are the cross-sell seen here.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.210
That is why this is not coming.

02:26.240 --> 02:34.080
But if I just go to this one I think both teams I think it has the cross sales thing.

02:34.100 --> 02:39.400
So let's just come here and let's just open up the view card so you can see OK.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.270
Also don't have.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.220
But I just remember that the first one Beej has that he has this one.

02:44.240 --> 02:44.630
OK.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.260
So this one do have that two card.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.340
If I just click here Bukhara right now and then you can see that it sees you might you may be interested

02:52.340 --> 02:53.010
in.

02:53.060 --> 03:01.340
The reason is that if I just open this product up OK and then I go to the edit product OK and then I

03:01.340 --> 03:01.910
go down

03:04.570 --> 03:08.770
and then I go to the linked products and you can see that up sells.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.250
They should be having that.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.450
So how did this upscale work if I just add any products if I just add a logo

03:17.840 --> 03:19.900
logo 15 logo

03:23.310 --> 03:23.760
OK.

03:23.830 --> 03:28.700
And now is go ahead and let's just save.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.680
So this is the flying ninja.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.170
OK this is not Doulos.

03:32.190 --> 03:38.240
If I just go to voodoo over that we added just right now and then I go down to the edit product.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.970
OK let's just say at it product OK.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.120
And then I go home.

03:42.160 --> 03:46.210
So I suppose that I go down and then I go tooling products and you can see that in the products we have

03:46.210 --> 03:52.320
the cross sales what this means the cross sells mean that it will show on the card page.

03:52.550 --> 03:56.830
Okay and upscaled I mean that it will show in the product page itself.

03:56.860 --> 04:02.440
If I just go to View product right now then here would be you might be interested and you may also like

04:02.450 --> 04:04.660
so you may also like page.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.680
You can see that we have this like here.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.800
You may also like the related one.

04:08.800 --> 04:17.140
Just leave the related one related works on the category basis but you may also like works on that upscale

04:17.350 --> 04:22.860
and the cross sales mean you can see the logo 15 and over 60 is in the cross-sell.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.490
And this is called local 15:16.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.940
So this is this is what I mean exactly.

04:28.090 --> 04:35.860
You may be interested in this and if I just come here and I just go to my comments right now and then

04:35.860 --> 04:41.300
I go to general and you can see that it says cross cells count and cross sell column in the card.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.830
So this is set to this so we just have to.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.960
So do not mess with it because they have chosen the best thing that they choose so to speak and you

04:49.960 --> 04:51.900
may be interested in is coming too early.

04:51.910 --> 04:52.690
OK.

04:53.080 --> 04:53.370
OK.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.180
I want to go back and I have the menu card.

04:56.310 --> 04:56.620
OK.

04:56.650 --> 04:59.260
This is the one hide if empty card.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.370
So if there is no nothing then it's going to it's going to be hitting but I don't want it.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.820
OK we have icon card and count and total.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.300
So you can also add the total if you want to.

05:09.460 --> 05:10.010
OK.

05:10.030 --> 05:11.990
And on total you will see how it's going to look

05:14.880 --> 05:16.750
OK I have to hit publish right now.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.830
And then I have to come here and I have to just refresh this

05:25.390 --> 05:28.320
so you can see this is not just freaking out.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.410
No way.

05:29.410 --> 05:30.120
This is so weird.

05:30.160 --> 05:35.140
And then it is going I don't know why this is happening here but on the ground it will also show the

05:35.140 --> 05:35.780
total.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.360
OK.

05:36.490 --> 05:42.490
So then we have if we just choose it to be like I can and I can card doodle then it'll just show the

05:42.500 --> 05:44.220
icon and card.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.940
OK.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.520
But I do not know why it is not working.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.600
OK so let's just use it to be like icon and card count.

05:52.630 --> 05:53.900
So I just want to go with this.

05:54.160 --> 05:59.380
And then we have the drop down and go to card and the custom links are how this is going to work.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.200
If someone clicks then a dropdown will.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.520
If I click here a dropdown is appearing.

06:04.660 --> 06:05.090
OK.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.460
You can also make it like if someone clicks the go to card then it's going to take them to the card

06:09.490 --> 06:12.840
page like it will redirect to slash cart.

06:12.930 --> 06:13.700
They mean that.

06:13.780 --> 06:14.140
OK.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.930
But I just need to drop down because dropdown looks amazing.

06:16.990 --> 06:20.590
I have the icons so I can choose any icon that I want.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.920
I think this one looks great.

06:24.060 --> 06:27.270
And then I have custom icons so you can also use a custom icon.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.240
We have that card dropdown styling.

06:29.250 --> 06:35.460
So if someone clicks here we have this and we can also stylus it so I can also make it like the price

06:35.460 --> 06:37.810
color the removing color.

06:37.980 --> 06:38.610
OK.

06:38.610 --> 06:44.040
We have the border color so you can also make it like you can give it a border if you want to.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.040
OK.

06:45.040 --> 06:50.370
And we have the checkout button back on.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.130
OK.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.950
We have the checkout button color.

06:52.950 --> 06:53.520
We have that check.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.510
Check out Burton color on Hoover so you can see everything is right here.

06:57.530 --> 06:59.600
And you can make the changes from here.

06:59.910 --> 07:03.190
I'll ask him here to our case and this is what I mean.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.140
OK.

07:04.140 --> 07:07.320
This is the base that we have this is called the archive.

07:07.320 --> 07:07.970
So it is.

07:08.070 --> 07:10.090
It is showing that Craig's List of buttons.

07:10.090 --> 07:10.770
This is this.

07:10.770 --> 07:13.810
If someone clicks you can see this is now changed de-list.

07:14.070 --> 07:14.520
OK.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.560
The default category view can be close to you are green.

07:17.580 --> 07:21.320
But I would recommend you to go with the crane because mostly people use Dikran.

07:21.610 --> 07:24.120
OK then we have the excerpt Lent.

07:24.170 --> 07:24.510
OK.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.540
You can change it to be like length of the short description of the list view.

07:28.940 --> 07:29.450
OK.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.230
So you can make it you can shop smart.

07:32.610 --> 07:35.590
If I just click here you can see this is right here.

07:35.610 --> 07:40.560
So you can make a change going to be going to eighty five words and it would be 25 and it would be so

07:40.560 --> 07:42.550
much larger.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.110
OK.

07:43.230 --> 07:48.110
So you can make it to be like 23 if you want to.

07:48.380 --> 07:54.120
And you can see this is now set to 18 sharp sharp sword sharp result.

07:54.200 --> 07:59.130
So this is like this and this is the sort so if you want to uncheck this this will be hidden and no

07:59.130 --> 08:01.830
one can sort it from on the bases.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.280
And then we have the shot result count.

08:04.290 --> 08:06.620
So you can also show it if you want to.

08:06.630 --> 08:11.390
But I would recommend you to go with this and then we have the elements positioning Let's come here

08:12.610 --> 08:13.760
and we have this right here.

08:13.830 --> 08:14.650
OK.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.360
How this is going to work is that we have the image on top.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.190
OK.

08:18.270 --> 08:23.020
And I have the category so I can also bring the category in top and the category would be on top.

08:23.040 --> 08:23.240
OK.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.050
This is the poster.

08:24.050 --> 08:26.430
This will be on top but it will look so ugly.

08:26.460 --> 08:27.130
I know.

08:27.330 --> 08:27.750
OK.

08:27.750 --> 08:32.760
So I'm just going to bring it down below to the default settings then we have title we have the pricing

08:32.810 --> 08:34.870
and then we have the description of that card.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.990
Description A lot appear on the view.

08:36.990 --> 08:40.500
Obviously if you show the description it will look so much mess.

08:40.590 --> 08:40.760
OK.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.540
And then we have to add two card button.

08:42.770 --> 08:43.350
OK.

08:43.380 --> 08:46.750
And then we have the product anti-media that is made swap.

08:46.910 --> 08:47.500
OK.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.260
This is like this.

08:48.270 --> 08:52.840
If I just come here you can also make the gallery slider.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.990
So the gallery slider would be here.

08:59.950 --> 09:04.990
You can see how this is looking but I think image map looks good a bit to me so that if you were your

09:04.990 --> 09:08.640
mouse your head is going to show the next image that you have.

09:08.650 --> 09:13.900
So if you just open up any of the product so you can see if I just open up this product then you can

09:13.900 --> 09:19.550
see that I have two images so if I bring them out here on the shop then it's going to show me this image.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.480
So this is how it works.

09:20.520 --> 09:25.650
OK then we go down and we have the page anation style.

09:25.660 --> 09:29.440
You can see this is Outlook's so you can also change it to be like infinity scroll.

09:29.560 --> 09:35.130
How infinity scroll will work is that it will open up every page and there will be no pagination.

09:35.260 --> 09:40.150
It will be like it will load the page when you go down so you can see this is the end of the content.

09:40.180 --> 09:40.800
OK.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.990
If we go down and it's a lot more more more more more and more.

09:43.990 --> 09:49.120
So this is called Infinity shrugged but I always prefer to use the standard one because I think standard

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
looks good.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.280
OK.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.050
And we have just this much

09:56.780 --> 09:59.630
so let's go back and we have the single.

09:59.690 --> 10:01.020
So how does single work.

10:01.190 --> 10:01.760
OK.

10:01.760 --> 10:07.400
You can design a single page and like if you just open up any of the single product KHRAIS here.

10:08.140 --> 10:08.750
OK.

10:08.810 --> 10:13.790
And then we will take into the single page and then we can work with it so we can just hide the title.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.830
We can hide the rating.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.240
We can hide the price excerpt or anything.

10:18.380 --> 10:18.890
OK.

10:18.890 --> 10:23.530
And then we have the Dabbs position so that tab's position are decenter we can make it great.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.350
I can see this is not changed to write to me.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.950
Vee-Vee are going to make it to the left so I think left looks good.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.280
Let's just move to the center.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.090
So then we have the cells count.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.260
This is the upscale.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.130
We can make it like three four.

10:35.220 --> 10:35.990
We can make it one.

10:35.990 --> 10:39.550
So this would be one only one upscaled would be coming here.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.550
OK.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.930
I want to make it three let's just use the default one.

10:45.260 --> 10:45.470
OK.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.610
And then we have the cells column as well.

10:47.670 --> 10:50.430

10:53.610 --> 10:55.090
And let's just go back.

10:55.530 --> 11:00.000
Now we have the advance dialing and this is the main thing that we want to focus on.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.370
So then let's just go to the shop page right now.

11:02.760 --> 11:03.040
OK.

11:03.040 --> 11:08.160
And in the shop we have to work on this one right here so this we have the on sale background this is

11:08.160 --> 11:12.510
going to be green they continue to be red if you want to go with the red one.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.100
OK.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.700
And then we have the on sale color.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.240
So you can make it anything that you want.

11:17.430 --> 11:24.670
I will go with the block OK and then we have out-of-stock background out-of-stock color the color the

11:24.670 --> 11:31.610

11:55.530 --> 11:58.630
color and the product and we add to cart.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.710
I basically want to work with this so you can just mess around with this.

12:01.810 --> 12:02.640
You can just change it.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.430
We have the price calculator.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.440
This will be here.

12:05.670 --> 12:06.030
OK.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.170
And delete price.

12:07.210 --> 12:11.200
Color and the title color and Hoover and everything.

12:11.870 --> 12:14.490
I just want to work at two card background colors.

12:14.510 --> 12:16.880
I want to make it black.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.070
I want to focus on my sight color basically.

12:19.110 --> 12:19.730
OK.

12:19.850 --> 12:26.570
And I want to Bactrim color on Hoover so at Ducard Bactrim colors this would be turned to crazy if someone

12:26.570 --> 12:27.300
brings his mouse.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.880
It's going to turn to create and then we have Ducard color.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.100
So this is going to be white full white.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.690
So I'm just going to make it full right.

12:34.970 --> 12:35.470
OK.

12:35.660 --> 12:40.470
And then I have to card color on Hoover so on Hoover it would turn blue.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.740
I don't want it to be blue.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.440
I don't want it to be black.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.400
I'll just make it white.

12:47.400 --> 12:47.650
OK.

12:47.650 --> 12:51.470
And then we have a two card botter style so I just want it to be solid.

12:51.790 --> 12:52.670
Nothing else.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.460
OK.

12:53.470 --> 12:57.560
Or is just what just make it known.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.580
No water gray.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.760
I think this looks cool.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.470
This looks amazing.

13:03.470 --> 13:04.830
Seriously.

13:09.320 --> 13:14.380
At Ducard borders is at Daugaard border radius so you can also add the border radius like if you add

13:14.390 --> 13:17.590
25 and then you add the border to be solid and it would be

13:25.890 --> 13:27.590
at Ducard border radius.

13:27.590 --> 13:32.640
This is not applying I don't know why but this would turn to circle.

13:32.630 --> 13:35.800
So if you just supply it so let's have some here let's just save it.

13:36.110 --> 13:36.930
Let's just come here.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.720
Let's see our page.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.930
If it works here our Hate is not working here.

13:42.080 --> 13:42.880
So I'm going to come here.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.580
I'm just going to choose.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.320
No I don't want anything.

13:45.590 --> 13:50.300
And then we have the single product so a single product if you just click here and then you can change

13:50.300 --> 13:53.810
it like the color quantity plus minus color.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.330
If you just opened this up.

13:55.610 --> 13:56.340
OK.

13:57.020 --> 14:01.190
And then you can see that we have the plus minus as well in the comedy section so you can also change

14:01.190 --> 14:02.350
the color of days.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.170
You can also change the color of the burden.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.740
So this is how it's going to work.

14:05.750 --> 14:12.320
But I am going to change the color of the button so I'm just going to go down.

14:12.450 --> 14:16.310
So I just don't know why they don't have the option for the two card.

14:16.390 --> 14:17.940
OK I cannot change that to card.

14:17.950 --> 14:21.200
But then you can see everything is totally up and running.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.840
And this is going so great.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.150
OK.

14:26.170 --> 14:29.890
So now you can see everything looks great everything is up and running.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.760
And this is how our website is looking.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.590
So now we have designed the whole shop page.

14:34.650 --> 14:35.400
OK.

14:35.410 --> 14:36.820
We are we have this.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.310

14:42.660 --> 14:47.300
