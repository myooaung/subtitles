00:02.280 --> 00:06.300
So in this video we are going to be adding some boast OK.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.860
We basically want to add some bozo and then we're going to design our page because this is crucial to

00:11.130 --> 00:13.170
say OK.

00:13.610 --> 00:18.590
So what I have to do I have to just add a new post.

00:18.590 --> 00:22.050
OK let's get the examples of the blog that how blog where it's basically.

00:22.070 --> 00:26.340
So I'm going to go to a download blog dot com.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.060
This is my favorite blog OK.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.830
You can see this is how the blog post works.

00:32.610 --> 00:33.180
OK.

00:33.580 --> 00:39.000
We have this Apple made by our daily deals sort these things like this.

00:39.060 --> 00:39.680
OK.

00:39.700 --> 00:44.070
So they blog about IOS Android and something like that.

00:44.140 --> 00:47.320
This is basically the technology blog.

00:47.790 --> 00:48.350
OK.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.310
And the next one is us.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.300
Look.

00:57.420 --> 00:58.920
There's a nine to five Mac

01:01.970 --> 01:02.280
OK.

01:02.290 --> 01:07.600
This is also the one I want to open up the new one

01:11.300 --> 01:11.870
OK.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.430
OK.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.840
So let's have a look at this one.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.530
You can see that this is a new blog and this is also the best blog ever.

01:18.520 --> 01:24.700
They just get some iPhone hacks that how to install some tweaks using Cydia in everything.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.080
OK.

01:25.130 --> 01:30.290
So I basically used to read them how to downgrade from us eleven point two to eleven point one point

01:30.290 --> 01:34.810
to an iPhone or iPad security research and everything that relays it.

01:35.000 --> 01:35.310
OK.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.790
So we are basically going to create a blog like this.

01:38.810 --> 01:39.900
OK.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.670
I'll try my best to just for a try creating a blog like this.

01:43.670 --> 01:47.610
And I'm going to show you how the categories work how the dogs work and how everything's work.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.050
So we're going to categorize them.

01:49.130 --> 01:49.600
OK.

01:49.670 --> 01:53.210
Let's go ahead and let's go to the dashboard right here.

01:53.210 --> 01:59.130
I'm just going to close everything and we basically want to add some dogs or categories.

01:59.150 --> 02:02.990
I'm going to go to the post right here and I'm going to go to the categories we're going to categorize

02:03.380 --> 02:04.200
these boast.

02:04.250 --> 02:04.960
OK.

02:04.970 --> 02:11.540
I want to go to and first of all I'm going to change this category to be uncock from Uncategorized to

02:12.380 --> 02:13.390
us.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.420
OK.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.790
We are basically creating a technology based blog.

02:16.790 --> 02:17.270
OK.

02:17.450 --> 02:30.090
And this should be us and I'm going to hit update OK or let's change this to Apple or just leave it

02:30.090 --> 02:30.720
as Iowas.

02:30.740 --> 02:31.110
OK.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.760
Let's go to the back to categories.

02:32.790 --> 02:37.800
OK we have our AOS and then let's create a new and that would be Android.

02:37.980 --> 02:38.400
OK.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.130
I want to enter this slog to be in the Y.D..

02:42.650 --> 02:43.650
OK.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.990
And the Piran category should be non elected and name categories.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.750
I'm going to show you how these categories for it basically.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.400
OK.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.790
We also want to consider creating an iPhone.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.560
OK.

02:58.560 --> 03:06.120
And there should be iPhone and the Piran category should be iOS because iPhone comes in the U.S. So

03:06.150 --> 03:08.600
I'm going to hit any new category.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.290
There we go.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.130
Iowa is the main category and iPhone is the sub category.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.350
OK so we can also create the category to be Apple.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.200
And this to be iPhone.

03:18.330 --> 03:18.870
OK.

03:18.900 --> 03:19.520
So I'm like this.

I want to create i mac.

03:22.580 --> 03:23.180

03:23.220 --> 03:28.650
And I wanted this to be IMAX and appear in category should be Iarbus.

03:28.680 --> 03:35.390
I'm going to add new category so you can see how this is looking if I view this iOS category.

03:35.500 --> 03:41.570
You can see this category is iOS and this is going to show the category of the page iOS blog.

03:41.730 --> 03:43.190
OK you can see.

03:43.350 --> 03:48.520
And this post is assigned to this because we have our Uncategorized posed as iOS.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.180
That is why this post is designed to this.

03:51.180 --> 03:58.740
I also want to create some tool here and that is going to be Samsung and this is going to be coming

03:58.770 --> 03:59.670

08:25.970 --> 08:34.540
I need to post about the Dell laptops.

Why you should not buy cell laptops OK.

08:46.100 --> 08:46.870

09:02.430 --> 09:06.420

09:06.420 --> 09:16.010
So now here you can see if I just open up my disposed it is right here and it why you should not buy

09:16.360 --> 09:17.020
laptops.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.670
So this is coming right here.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.350
If I just open this up I can see that this is coming.

09:21.350 --> 09:25.370
Read this category slash windows slash Dell slash laptops.

09:25.380 --> 09:30.370
This is the category of that why you should not buy Dilip saab So this is how you can create it.

09:30.470 --> 09:34.780
You can see that I have all post I have Dell I have those.

09:34.790 --> 09:38.360
And then I have the laptops right here so this is how it's going to work.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.180
This is the man that is coming.

09:40.250 --> 09:46.700
So it is going to show all the categories that we have under the laptop so if I just add a new category

09:46.790 --> 09:50.930
I just go to the post right here and then I want to add a new cat.

09:50.960 --> 10:05.150
Did you post so that is going to be Dell really uses new core I seven a laptop.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.260
OK.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.210
I'm going to come here and I'm going to add some stuff right here.

10:10.300 --> 10:10.870
OK.

10:10.910 --> 10:11.690
I'm just kidding.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.800
And I want to come here and I want to hit publish soon now.

10:15.980 --> 10:16.440
OK.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.870
I want to assign the categories.

10:17.870 --> 10:22.690
Well so this is basically my basic category this high us that is where I want to come down.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.290
I want to go to the

10:30.940 --> 10:31.720
laptops.

10:31.820 --> 10:32.810
Let's set a date.

10:35.790 --> 10:38.230
And there we go you can see that the Post has been updated.

10:38.230 --> 10:41.170
Dell really uses a new core iOS 7 laptop.

10:41.250 --> 10:44.160
So we have laptops and you can see this is our test coming.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.870
I have the main page.

10:45.870 --> 10:50.140
Then it sees a Dell and then it sees the windows then it sees the laptops and then I say this.

10:50.190 --> 10:55.890
So if I just choose a Dell you can see that in the dell tab it's going to show these categories because

10:55.890 --> 10:59.190
the main and primary category is the Dell itself.

10:59.190 --> 11:03.460
If I want to choose so many categories right here if I want to choose.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.920
So let's suppose that I want to choose to tell as well.

11:08.230 --> 11:08.980
OK.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.870
And again the two categories are right here.

11:10.950 --> 11:11.670
I want to update

11:14.590 --> 11:17.630
and you can see Dell laptops both are selected.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.600
So if you select only one it doesn't matter if you select two it doesn't matter.

11:21.600 --> 11:27.180
But if you select one of the other category it is going to appear that in that category it's going to

11:27.180 --> 11:28.990
associate that with or waterboarding.

11:29.070 --> 11:32.590
What are the subcategories in that and how do you get a look.

11:32.730 --> 11:36.420
So this is how it is working if I just CO-2 the categories right here.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.020
OK.

11:37.050 --> 11:39.580
And then I can also edit this whole category.

11:39.600 --> 11:44.130
You can see it sees the description as well so if I want to add any of the description in the Android

11:44.130 --> 11:46.900
tab I can also add the description.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.620
OK.

11:48.610 --> 11:51.580
If I just go to categories right here and in the dell tops.

11:51.670 --> 11:55.430
OK so I want to come here I want to hit at a Dell category.

11:55.430 --> 12:01.320
I can even add something to that well in this category.

12:03.110 --> 12:13.920
We show the photos that are associated wed.

12:17.270 --> 12:17.870
When

12:22.360 --> 12:27.200
where the cell company.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.090
OK.

12:28.190 --> 12:30.000
I want to come here and I want to update.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.280
And now we can see that this should be coming right here.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.930
If I just go to and if I just come here to view this category.

12:36.980 --> 12:39.110
Let's see if this this team shows this.

12:39.110 --> 12:44.980
This team is not supporting this team is not showing me the Dell category.

12:45.050 --> 12:47.100
I just give you the nose right here.

12:47.180 --> 12:50.990
I can see nothing happened so you can see we have two categories right here.

12:50.990 --> 12:55.580
We have Dell and we also have this laptop so we selected two categories.

12:55.580 --> 12:56.850
That is why they coming.

12:57.260 --> 13:03.500
So I don't think that categories and post Association is now very much easier for you and you can see

13:03.830 --> 13:08.930
it is also coming under the categories we have the recent post as well.

13:08.930 --> 13:15.710
So now what we're going to do basically we are going to just get a plug in and that plug in will be

13:15.710 --> 13:21.910
getting some Demel content to our website because we don't have much time to add so many posts.

13:21.920 --> 13:27.260
OK we will be getting a plug in and we will be installing that plug in and we will just add demo content

13:27.260 --> 13:30.850
to say that we can manage this whole blog and we can work with it.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.680
So in the next video we'll be doing that.

13:32.700 --> 13:33.290
Goodbye.
