00:00.550 --> 00:06.360
What is up guys and Congratulations on completing the installation of Wordpress section.

00:06.370 --> 00:12.190
So now we know how to install Wordpress and the basic web hosting how to install WordPress in a free

00:12.190 --> 00:17.920
web hosting using the auto installer and how to install WordPress on our own computer.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.890
If we do not want to buy any of the hosting right now and we want to install everything on our computer

00:24.160 --> 00:26.200
just for learning purposes.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.200
So everything.

00:28.210 --> 00:34.420
The word press should be totally same whether you are using the hosting or whether you are using the

00:34.420 --> 00:38.880
free web hosting or you are using it on the computer using the zem.

00:39.060 --> 00:41.930
OK so now this is the main part.

00:41.950 --> 00:46.010
And now there are going to be reviewing everything about the dashboard.

00:46.110 --> 00:46.530
OK.

00:46.540 --> 00:53.950
This is the admin panel you can see if I just go to my home page you can see how my website is looking.

00:54.070 --> 00:54.480
OK.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.100
This is how my website is looking and everything is coming right here so we're going to be overseeing

00:59.140 --> 01:00.260
the basics of this.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.190
And then I'm going to show you how can you build a basic web site using this team.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.810
And then we're going to be working up with the project.

01:07.810 --> 01:08.290
OK.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.450
So the reason why I'm telling you everything about the basics is because we cannot start the project

01:13.450 --> 01:19.660
guys right now because the projects about like creating a personal Web site Business Web site professional

01:19.660 --> 01:25.810
blog and everything we have to first coord this section that is about the overview and the basics so

01:25.810 --> 01:30.760
when Vivah learn everything about the word press then we will learn 100 percent not 200 percent you

01:30.760 --> 01:36.670
can call it like 15 percent of Wordpress then we will be able to understand everything and we will be

01:36.670 --> 01:40.160
able to work on our projects that are here.

01:40.180 --> 01:46.000
So make sure to just go ahead and complete this section do not miss a single video single lecture here

01:46.030 --> 01:50.080
because every lecture here guys is very important.

01:50.080 --> 01:54.830
So first of all I want to say that you can see that this is how I even say it is looking OK.

01:55.030 --> 02:01.150
This is the default team that is already installed by word press and you can see a toolbar is coming

02:01.150 --> 02:08.140
here that says that you are logged in so it will be just coming to the administrator who is the user

02:08.140 --> 02:11.650
or who is the administrator and who is currently logged in.

02:11.650 --> 02:13.410
So you can see that I am logged in.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.160
OK you will not be seeing any of the profile feature.

02:16.180 --> 02:19.120
Do not worry guys me to learn about the profile picture later on.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.340
So do not get confused.

02:20.380 --> 02:25.290
You will not be seeing any of the profile picture but this is how you will see your Wordpress dashboard.

02:25.420 --> 02:34.090
OK so now what I am going to do I'm going to tell you if a user who is not the person who is not the

02:34.090 --> 02:38.460
admin is treater off the website logs into your of of site then he will see it like this.

02:38.470 --> 02:42.400
I'm just going to copy and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to open up the private.

02:42.430 --> 02:48.490
You can open this private tab by just trusting control shift and end and the private tap will be open

02:48.490 --> 02:49.500
on Chrome browser.

02:49.510 --> 02:53.550
So I have to pay said and let's just go ahead and let's visit our Web site.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.650
So if the guy is not logged in then he will not see that Tabari can see.

02:58.780 --> 02:59.290
OK.

02:59.290 --> 03:02.710
So this is how our Web site is looking to a normal user.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.740
And this is how our website is now.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.460
We're going to be covering the dashboard how the dashboard.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.280
So you have to just type this slash like I'm your domain name dot com.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.410
And then you have to write W.P..

03:15.620 --> 03:16.810
Gosh admen.

03:17.010 --> 03:17.520
OK.

03:17.530 --> 03:23.560
So I'm just writing here or you will be taken to the Wordpress dashboard or the admin panel.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.770
OK I'm just going to go at and I'm going to hit enter.

03:26.760 --> 03:35.640
And so now you can see that I am logged in to my wordpress dashboard and this is what we call the Wordpress

03:35.640 --> 03:36.180
dashboard.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.670
It says Welcome to WordPress.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.340
And we've assembled some links to get it started.

03:40.410 --> 03:44.060
I'm not going to get too bored ok because I don't want to explain everything.

03:44.070 --> 03:48.430
You will understand it and we will be moving on and working with different projects.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.370
But I'm going to be telling you that what are the things that are used the most.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.720
OK so a number one we have the pages.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.300
Pages are used the most because we want to create pages and then we have the post.

03:59.310 --> 04:03.990
So if you want to create a blog I'll tell you later on just don't get confused with the post right now

04:04.290 --> 04:06.440
because post confuses a lot.

04:06.570 --> 04:06.880
OK.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.900
We will understand it later on when we will be moving on with the word press so pages are the most important

04:12.900 --> 04:14.580
thing that we all use.

04:14.580 --> 04:20.040
We can create pages and we can view all the pages right here so you can see if he very mouse here.

04:20.040 --> 04:24.850
This comes if I just go ahead and I just click all pages.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.150
You can see it's a sample page.

04:27.150 --> 04:30.360
And this is default created by word press.

04:30.390 --> 04:36.300
If I just go ahead and I just view you can see that it says the sample page.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.830
And this is how the page is looking.

04:38.880 --> 04:45.930
And here is the view of the page you can see it my title and it is just another WordPress website.

04:45.990 --> 04:51.870
And here we have the page Thaila here and we have the page content right here.

04:51.870 --> 04:57.630
So if I just go ahead and I just want to edit this page OK I'm going to go back to all pages and I just

04:57.630 --> 05:00.180
click here this edit.

05:00.180 --> 05:05.070
And on clicking here you will see that Vivaah will be having this right here so you can see it's a simple

05:05.070 --> 05:05.700
page.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.540
And then here we have this as an example page and everything.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.150
And then here we have this.

05:11.190 --> 05:13.680
So this was the title and this was this.

05:13.710 --> 05:18.450
If I just go ahead and I open it up in the new up there let's see how this is looking.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.950
Well I have the title here.

05:20.190 --> 05:21.420
This one is the title.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.910
And then we have the content right here.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.000
So then we have the Kundan right here.

05:26.040 --> 05:26.320
OK.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.630
So we're just talking about a really basic web site.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.050
OK.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.530
How a basic web site looks like.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.010
OK.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.570
So let's just go ahead and let's create the main pages that are to the main page.

05:37.560 --> 05:43.140
So what are the main pages the main pages are like home page about page and the contact us page.

05:43.140 --> 05:48.780
So these three pages are the main page that every website should contain and then we will create those

05:48.780 --> 05:54.540
pages to learn how the menu works how to integrate a menu here and how to how to just customize our

05:54.550 --> 05:55.780
website and design it.

05:55.810 --> 05:59.940
So we've learned WordPress then we will move forward with more stuff.

05:59.940 --> 06:04.200
So the next video will show you of that how can you create these pages.

06:04.230 --> 06:04.640
Okay.

06:04.770 --> 06:09.630
And then how can you create a menu and then how can you set up a basic web site that will show you how

06:09.630 --> 06:11.330
can you integrate a blog with it.

06:11.340 --> 06:14.850
Because blog is also really important for a website.

06:14.870 --> 06:17.820
We'll show you how you can integrated and then something.

06:17.820 --> 06:24.080
Some stuff like that and will move forward with our simple basic and just a normal website.

06:24.210 --> 06:24.620
OK.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.990
So then we will be moving on with more professional say.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.970
So Stadion guys and Buh-Bye.
