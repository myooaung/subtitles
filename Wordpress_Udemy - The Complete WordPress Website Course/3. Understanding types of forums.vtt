00:00.450 --> 00:01.480
What does a guy you don't want.

00:01.490 --> 00:03.930
So make sure that you have to user accounts here.

00:03.930 --> 00:09.170
If I just go to all users right now and you can see that this guy is bound to I'm just going to non-spam

00:09.270 --> 00:14.050
this is not spam and make sure that you have to use your accounts so that you can manage everything.

00:14.130 --> 00:19.050
I'm going to open up the Internet Explorer and then I'm going to open up as a complete double B course

00:19.050 --> 00:19.670
dot com.

00:19.890 --> 00:26.610
Ok complete Lupi course dot com so that I can just interact with each other here and I can just work

00:26.610 --> 00:27.010
with it.

00:27.150 --> 00:31.190
OK so first of all we're going to overview all the things that we have in the forum.

00:31.410 --> 00:31.710
Okay.

00:31.710 --> 00:34.880
And then I'm going to tell you what are the topics and then the reply.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.190
So for him is basically the main part.

00:37.290 --> 00:43.910
The topic is that comes under the forum and the replies are like that the people who reply.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.520
Ok so this is what we call.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.960
Now let me just come here and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to register.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.800
I'm just gonna log in.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.880
So back OK.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.610
The password should be.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.240
Let's log in.

01:01.740 --> 01:04.160
OK I am logged in you can see I'm here.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.150
I was just bam.

01:05.340 --> 01:06.290
And now I'm logged in.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.390
So you can see this is totally up and running.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.550
What I'm going to do right now I am just going to go ahead and let's just for everything.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.400
So you can see that if I just go to all forums right here you can see in here we have the recipes and

01:20.400 --> 01:22.770
it says please tell me that your recipe.

01:22.920 --> 01:23.600
OK.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.950
This is the forum that I have created so you can see that if you run something then you can create a

01:28.950 --> 01:30.110
recipe for him.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.640
OK you can even trash it if you want to then and it'll be trashed.

01:33.660 --> 01:42.870
So let's suppose that I run a school OK and I want to create an L.A. based website like learning management

01:42.870 --> 01:48.170
system where people can just interact with each other using that for.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.680
OK so let's suppose that I want to do that so now I'm going to hit New for him.

01:51.900 --> 01:57.300
And then here I just want to go ahead and I want to just create like students forum or something like

01:57.300 --> 01:58.920
that or I can just create

02:02.610 --> 02:07.740
Yes just go with the students so and the students here the people can just move on.

02:07.740 --> 02:16.490
In this it is specifically for students for him like the students can interact with each other and then

02:16.490 --> 02:18.110
they can just manage everything.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.890
OK so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.370
So this in this forum.

02:23.450 --> 02:23.940
OK.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.340
I want to create a new more for him.

02:26.390 --> 02:26.740
OK.

02:26.750 --> 02:32.490
And that will be the Piran for him of the students so let me show you what what I mean exactly.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.420
Here would be the English.

02:34.810 --> 02:35.480
OK.

02:35.600 --> 02:43.010
And this English is the parent off the students so this means that students can interact with English

02:43.070 --> 02:43.800
in here.

02:44.090 --> 02:48.230
OK what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit this publish right

02:48.230 --> 02:56.100
now so you can see the link could be changed to form slash form slash student slash English.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.460
What I mean exactly.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.340
Let me show you.

02:58.430 --> 03:04.970
OK if I just come here then I can see how this is looking so you can see in the students we have a new

03:04.970 --> 03:07.120
form and it say's English.

03:07.160 --> 03:12.410
So this is the form dad is that has another for him.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.600
It can see that I haven't subscribed in here to this forum.

10:21.670 --> 10:25.520
I'm just going to go ahead and I am going to just close it.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.900
So unclogging close.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.850
While this means that this is now done no one can reply to it if I just come here and I just open this

10:33.850 --> 10:34.070
up

10:39.660 --> 10:44.900
and see the topic problem is closed to new replies because this problem is solved.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.980
And now no one can reply to it you can see this essay is to say is thank you so much sir.

10:50.050 --> 10:50.920
This is the question.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.490
This is the title and everything.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.550
And this is out of luck so this works pretty well.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.410
Is this social networking website where it's so amazing.

10:59.590 --> 11:02.080
And now I can see this is totally done.

11:02.170 --> 11:06.080
So now we are a bit done Vidar so of their forums.

11:06.100 --> 11:10.480
Ok now I'm going to show you how this decie works.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.850
How does that work that we say.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.700
That's the superstate.

11:14.870 --> 11:19.510
So now guys we're going to be talking about dead super sticky and sticky.

11:19.550 --> 11:27.910
OK so super sticky and sticky means that if you want to add any of the topic into the top section then

11:27.910 --> 11:29.020
you can add that.

11:29.020 --> 11:33.090
So let's suppose that in English I want to add a topic.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.360
And inside the English I want to add a topic and I want to make it sticky.

11:37.360 --> 11:43.660
That means the English so that like if I want if I if there is a news in English like

11:47.250 --> 11:55.320
English teacher will be absent tomorrow.

11:56.570 --> 11:57.010
So.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.490
So let's suppose that there isn't Neela's.

11:58.530 --> 12:03.940
OK this is the news and this is so much important news and everyone should be listening to that.

12:03.940 --> 12:11.170
OK so I'm just going to enter this and that topic type is going to be sticky so this will be like it

12:11.170 --> 12:16.880
will come to the top of this every post so there will be so much questions posted by so many people

12:17.200 --> 12:24.530

12:45.070 --> 12:46.370

14:28.190 --> 14:34.510
this is the news OK the news is coming still on top and these then these are coming already here.

14:34.610 --> 14:39.220

14:39.230 --> 14:39.630
OK.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.610
This is the topic of the English.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.520

like this so if I just open this up at a topic then I can see this is sticky and this is also open.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.290
I can even make it like closed.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.370

16:10.210 --> 16:11.020
OK.

16:11.020 --> 16:15.490
I just come here and I just make it super sticky and I just open this up in the Internet Explorer and

16:15.490 --> 16:17.560
I just go to students.

16:17.770 --> 16:24.480
Then you can see here is the topic that is coming here and that is English teacher will be absent tomorrow.

16:24.490 --> 16:25.960

So this is like if I want to make a news about hold school that I can just enter and use like if I just

16:44.140 --> 16:49.510
like school will be closed tomorrow.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.370
OK.

16:53.390 --> 16:57.110
And then I go ahead and I just sit there all day because this is super sticky so that is is very very

16:57.110 --> 17:01.850
important and everybody should know that school is closed.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.070
So then it will appear on all of the forms.

17:05.090 --> 17:10.310
If I just come here you can see it is not appearing in this student's forum but if you just go inside

17:10.310 --> 17:15.620
the students and see that it is coming right here this is the most important news.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.760

18:42.900 --> 18:44.280
So you can see this is how it.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.020
Very timid very.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.610
So amazing this forum is working like this.

18:47.610 --> 18:49.240
We have the notifications as well.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.070
So you can just build and have them ask for your students.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.490
I'm just giving you an example like if you want to build an element for our students where students

18:56.490 --> 18:59.710
can interact with each other then you can just go ahead with that.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.530
And this is like school will be closed tomorrow.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.040
So this is how it was working.

19:04.050 --> 19:10.050
And so now we're totally done with the understanding basic understanding of forums that how forums work

19:10.710 --> 19:16.680
how can we just build forums how can people just interact with each other and how can this day go on.

19:17.130 --> 19:21.690
So now the next video will be working over the social networking website for how people can just interact

19:21.690 --> 19:24.250
with each other and learn how to design this website.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.550
This is also important.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.600
And then we'll move forward.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.410
So stadium guys and Bebai.
