00:00.310 --> 00:04.650
Hear what is up guys are Malcolm X so now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you

00:04.680 --> 00:10.860
basically get the beat of web hosting which is the most professional matter and that will just keep

00:10.860 --> 00:11.480

00:11.600 --> 00:17.130
OK so you have to just click resources available to the video that you are watching and it'll tell you

00:17.130 --> 00:19.180

You have to click here and you will be taken to a new page for it will take you to host gator dot com.

00:24.930 --> 00:31.110
OK so this is the company that I personally use for all of my clients and for my website as well.

00:31.200 --> 00:31.560
OK.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.950
So if you want to go with this company then you can go with this.

00:34.950 --> 00:41.460
This is my recommended company you can go to any of the other paid web hosting companies like Blue host

00:41.550 --> 00:43.210
or like Go Daddy.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.110
Go Daddy is not recommended by me because I have used that and I don't find that good to be good.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.330
I don't know why but Goretti was not that good for me.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.580
The whole skater is the one that I like the most.

00:55.740 --> 00:56.220
OK.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.980
So make sure you go ahead and click there.

00:58.980 --> 01:04.080
The link is the affiliate links so that you when you buy the web hosting from here I'm going to get

01:04.080 --> 01:05.040
a share.

01:05.070 --> 01:06.620
I'm going to get a commission basically.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.400
So this just helped me keep going with more courses like this.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.980
But if you want like you don't want to give me any of the commission and you just want to go over there

01:17.090 --> 01:22.020
and you can just type post gate or dot com and then you can buy the host get it from there.

01:22.140 --> 01:22.480
OK.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.290
So now let's go ahead and let's just hit get started now.

01:26.310 --> 01:31.560
So you will be taken to a new page and here it says host gaitered accomplished web hosting.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.510
And here it has got the baby plan.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.270
This is the plan that I personally recommend and I use for myself as well.

01:39.270 --> 01:45.910
The reason is that it offers the single web site and this offers on limited web sites.

01:45.940 --> 01:49.710
I would highly recommend you to go with this because you can see that we will be building a personal

01:49.710 --> 01:50.250
web site.

01:50.250 --> 01:55.550
You'll be building another business web site professional blog and e-commerce Web site and everything.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.250
That is why we will be creating a lot of Web sites.

01:58.290 --> 02:03.850
So that is why I would highly recommend you to go with this baby plan and it will give you an unlimited

02:03.960 --> 02:05.970
web sites.

02:05.980 --> 02:11.350
The reason I would say not to go with the business plan is because they give you the private SSL and

02:11.350 --> 02:13.090
you can get that SSL for free.

02:13.090 --> 02:16.290
So why you want to go with like paid things.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.620
I will show you how can we get SSL for free.

02:18.670 --> 02:22.560
So just go ahead and let's go with the baby plans and go over the business plan.

02:22.600 --> 02:28.230
OK let's just go in and let's click sign up now you can see they give 40 percent off to the new customers

02:28.270 --> 02:34.390
but I will give you my coupon code and that you can enter there and you can get 60 percent off guys

02:34.390 --> 02:38.140
so let's just go ahead and let's hit Sign up now.

02:39.010 --> 02:42.390
So it will cost you around like $150.

02:42.400 --> 02:42.980
OK.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.420
And you are you are also getting like 45 day money back guarantee.

02:46.420 --> 02:48.200
So why not just invest in.

02:48.280 --> 02:53.260
And if you find it to be good for you then go ahead and if you find it to be like not good for you then

02:53.260 --> 02:54.340
just leave it.

02:54.340 --> 03:00.400
So let's just go ahead and let's enter the domain name so the domain name here would be like the domain

03:00.400 --> 03:05.200
name that you want your company to be like is that you to me dot com The googled code.

03:05.270 --> 03:05.850
OK.

03:05.950 --> 03:13.180
So since our first project is the business the personal website so that is why I won my domain name

03:13.180 --> 03:18.970
to be like a personal like let's just go ahead and let's build a personal web site for myself so I'm

03:18.970 --> 03:27.250
going to be naming it as like I can Ziel dot com.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.060
OK.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.660
So it will be like dot com.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.810
Let's just go ahead and let's hit enter and you can see that this domain name is available and that

03:34.820 --> 03:37.720
has now entered as my domain name.

03:37.730 --> 03:42.680
So if your domain name is not available like if someone has already used that domain name then it will

03:42.680 --> 03:44.310
give an error right here.

03:44.330 --> 03:44.740
OK.

03:44.840 --> 03:49.470
So I can see that this name is available and it is costing me like $15 per ear.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.560
But but since we have applied to 60 percent off that that is why it will cost you like four dollars

03:54.560 --> 03:55.450
approximate.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.330
OK so now let's go ahead let's go down and let's just uncheck this it says add domain privacy protection

04:01.340 --> 04:02.620
for iTunes.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.220
I'm just going to check this.

04:04.400 --> 04:04.800
OK.

04:04.970 --> 04:12.650
The reason I am checking this is because make sure that your privacy is public because you want your

04:12.650 --> 04:19.160
users so that whenever anyone is coming to your website he should know that who is the CEO who is the

04:19.160 --> 04:19.790
owner.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.930
He is this address in Mer's everything.

04:22.070 --> 04:28.070
So make sure that you keep your domain to be like public because we're not scamming anything scamming

04:28.070 --> 04:31.890
anyone that is why we want our company to be public.

04:32.090 --> 04:32.530
OK.

04:32.630 --> 04:40.610
So it is also good for just like interference for your customers like if anyone is like oh I don't know

04:40.640 --> 04:45.220
if this company is a scam or if this company is not good for you then they will just go ahead.

04:45.230 --> 04:50.690
They will just go to domain privacy and then they will just grab your name and this and then the day

04:50.780 --> 04:53.930
they will know that OK he's the owner he's the official owner.

04:53.930 --> 04:56.230
That is why I just want to go with them.

04:56.270 --> 04:59.860
So make sure to just you just keep it as the public.

05:00.080 --> 05:00.420
OK.

05:00.590 --> 05:02.420
So then we have the package type.

05:02.430 --> 05:05.810
This is the baby one selected already and we have the billing cycle.

05:05.810 --> 05:07.470
It says 40 percent off.

05:07.490 --> 05:10.300
I'm going to give you a coupon code that you can enter below.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.990
And you can get 60 percent.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.540
Let's just go ahead and let's add a user name here.

05:14.540 --> 05:18.170
So I'm just going to enter my user name which will be my name OK.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.950
And then I have to enter the security.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.230
And so it can be like anything but it should before it is it.

05:23.270 --> 05:28.190
And then you have to enter your details here and then you have to select the payment method which can

05:28.190 --> 05:31.160
be like credit card or PayPal.

05:31.250 --> 05:32.760
So now you have to go there.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.800
And here it says the additional services guys so we'll come to this later.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.920
But let's say I'm here to coupon code and let's just enter here.

05:41.980 --> 05:45.640
WP E.C oh 60 OK.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.950
And many just click here and then you had a valid date.

05:49.010 --> 05:55.310
You will see that you will be given 60 percent off if I just come here you can see it is giving us 60

05:55.310 --> 05:56.840
percent off right now.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.870
So let's just go down and let's uncheck them.

05:59.960 --> 06:04.200
OK listen check this and let's check this out.

06:04.280 --> 06:11.670
The reason why I'm telling you to uncheck this is because this is for security and this is for backup

06:11.910 --> 06:14.820
you don't need backup and you need security.

06:14.820 --> 06:19.500
The reason I'm telling you is because this is the complete world press corps and I'm going to tell you

06:19.530 --> 06:22.130
everything like how can you even secure your website.

06:22.320 --> 06:27.870
So just don't buy this because this is the extra stuff and you can secure your website with wordpress

06:27.900 --> 06:28.570
plugins.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.070
OK.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.420
We'll discuss that later on.

06:30.420 --> 06:36.930
So do not just buy this and uncheck everything and you can see that it is costing us one forty eight

06:36.930 --> 06:40.600
bucks for three years you can see if you just come here.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.750
It's 36 months.

06:42.780 --> 06:45.960
So it is costing us like three point nine per month.

06:45.960 --> 06:51.090
So this is a huge discount guys you have to just accept the terms and conditions and then you have to

06:51.330 --> 06:52.510
hit checkout.

06:52.600 --> 06:59.040
Now you can see that they are setting up my account and you can see in a few moments you will gain access

06:59.040 --> 07:04.890
to all of the award winning products and features that sets her apart from its competition so you can

07:04.890 --> 07:08.220
see that this is the host get her account that is being built.

07:08.370 --> 07:13.060
And when it does build you will see how amazing this whole Scooter is going to look.

07:15.020 --> 07:15.440
Here we go.

07:15.470 --> 07:18.650
You can see that it says welcome to host get her family.

07:18.650 --> 07:24.750
The order has been completed and this is how my seat panel is looking like what do you have.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.880
Do you have to just go to your e-mail account.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.800
OK.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.760
You have to just open up your e-mail account or your e-mail account is OK and then you have to see your

07:34.760 --> 07:35.400
mail.

07:35.510 --> 07:40.330
They must have given you the e-mail that your get account is not set up.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.160
So let's kill two other males and he can see that it is the host get her account info.

07:45.260 --> 07:50.450
You have haven't just heard this and her is going to be all of your Infoseek and see that it says you

07:50.450 --> 07:56.510
can log into our billing system using the e-mail address we send to and the password included in your

07:56.510 --> 07:57.860
Volcom e-mail.

07:58.070 --> 07:58.560
OK.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.550
So the shared plan is the baby plan.

08:01.610 --> 08:08.980
And our this is our control panel this is our username and this is our domain name and this is our password.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.040
And this is our first name server.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.540
The second name server and the server IP.

08:13.550 --> 08:18.560
So what is the name server basically this is basically the user name to enter your C panel.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.330
This is the password to enter it.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.610
So if I just open this up you can see that it's going to take you to the sea battle.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.300
Here you go.

08:26.330 --> 08:30.290

You have to base that.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.120
And then you have to copy the password

08:41.940 --> 08:44.950
OK and then you have to base that great here.

08:45.630 --> 08:49.260
So now you have to hit again and when to click log in.

We have everything right here.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.510
We have a domain name and we have everything.

09:05.610 --> 09:11.220
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to close this and you can see that I can manage my web site completely

09:11.520 --> 09:12.410
from here.

09:12.420 --> 09:20.810
You can also go to the portal of your web hosting so you can just open up in the new page OK.

09:20.850 --> 09:26.590
So now I'm going to enter poort old host gator dot com to log intimacy log into my portal basically.

OK.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.740

So if you are logging into host Skeeter you should see this portal if you're seeing the normal portal

10:11.450 --> 10:13.890
and make sure to log in to the new portal.

10:13.890 --> 10:18.910
OK so then what you have to do you have to you'll be seeing your domain name right here.
