00:00.570 --> 00:04.890
What is up guys and what KMAX an hour in this video we're going to be working with the category builder

00:04.980 --> 00:06.690
of these categories OK.

00:06.810 --> 00:11.790
So you can see that we have these pages and this is the category the app or this is a category and this

00:11.790 --> 00:12.540
is the category.

00:12.640 --> 00:17.660
And this is going to go ahead and I'm going to name this undelete distillate category that is Uncategorized.

00:17.670 --> 00:20.090
I don't know I just don't like this one.

00:20.100 --> 00:26.320
This is just a default league created by press so you basically have to go ahead and rename this category

00:26.340 --> 00:30.990
you can not delete it so I'm just going to go to dashboard right here and I'm going to rename this category

00:30.990 --> 00:35.670
to anything like.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.580
Let's just go ahead and go to post go to categories and then let's just rename.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.440
So I'm going to go to this right here and I'm going to hit it and I'm going to name the name.

00:46.530 --> 00:54.200
So the name that I'm going to be entering would be something like best sellers.

00:54.360 --> 00:54.650
OK.

00:54.780 --> 01:00.240
So it is just the category so I'm just going to enter the or else so this will be to you or L if I just

01:00.270 --> 01:05.470
open up the Uncategorized post you're going to see that this is basically called a u r l.

01:05.550 --> 01:09.420
So I'm going to enter the name and this will be best sellers.

01:09.420 --> 01:09.930
OK.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.540
So this is called a slug basically.

01:11.560 --> 01:11.970
OK.

01:12.060 --> 01:13.640
I'm going to hit a trade now.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.960
And now let's go ahead and let's rephrase this.

01:19.980 --> 01:28.700
If I just refresh this you're going to see nothing is kind of come here.

01:28.930 --> 01:32.890
Let's just get back to categories and this is just stop.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.930
I don't know this is confused right now so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to open up the people

01:37.260 --> 01:40.570
you can see this is how the people are searching.

01:40.770 --> 01:46.650
I want to go to best sellers right here and you see how this best sellers category is working.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.610
This is confused.

01:47.610 --> 01:49.500
This is still confused.

01:49.650 --> 01:51.330
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to remove this.

01:51.330 --> 01:57.110
And you can see this is how the best sellers category is and this is our layout so this is how it reads.

01:57.270 --> 02:00.970
I'm just going to go ahead and we are going to be freaking up at the category bowler.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.730
This is the category builder as well.

02:03.810 --> 02:06.380
We use the home page as a category.

02:06.510 --> 02:11.250
You can see that we hit it at its layout and now we're going to be working over the output best seller

02:11.280 --> 02:12.110
and plugging deps.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.480
I'm going to go to apple right here and you can see that on the apple.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.700
This is the added category I can add to the category and I can add a delay out as well.

02:20.790 --> 02:25.640
So in the layout I can just align anything I can add a slider and I can do anything.

02:25.630 --> 02:27.650
This is the either option you can do it.

02:27.710 --> 02:32.070
I and the other option is that you have to go to this right here and then you have to go to the dashboard

02:32.070 --> 02:32.580
right here.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.480
I'm telling you both the options are OK.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.930
I mean you have to go to extra and then you have to go to category Boulder and then you have to build

02:38.930 --> 02:39.590
a category.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.270
So this is the home base that we built.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.180
And this is the default category that is applied to all the categories that be created if edited is

02:47.190 --> 02:49.710
going to apply to all the categories that we do create.

02:49.710 --> 02:56.130
OK so if I just said here let's just go ahead let's just edit this category OK and then it should be

02:56.130 --> 02:57.110
a mercenary.

02:57.120 --> 02:57.700
OK.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.580
You can see featured post later and blog feed machinary.

03:00.660 --> 03:01.350
I'm just going to come here.

03:01.350 --> 03:02.170
I'm going to Italy.

03:02.220 --> 03:09.120
And instead of this blog feed machinary I'm going to click here and I'm going to add the blog feed standard.

03:09.540 --> 03:15.340
So I'm going to hit Curren category slash taxonomy and then I'm going to hit the post per page so post

03:15.400 --> 03:17.280
per page is going to show 6.

03:17.340 --> 03:17.850
OK.

03:17.910 --> 03:21.660
And then we go down we go down and I'm going to hit save and exit.

03:21.750 --> 03:22.200
OK.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.120
So let's just go ahead let's say update

03:28.680 --> 03:32.440
so now let's go ahead and let's refresh this so refreshing.

03:32.490 --> 03:38.350
You're going to see instead of this this is now applied to this so it is showing the blog feed standard.

03:38.460 --> 03:42.990
And if I just opened up the blogging tips it's to show that blog read standard it is showing the normal

03:42.990 --> 03:45.250
blog feed standard post OK.

03:45.270 --> 03:49.180
I can also go to the people reviews and then here would be on that as well.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.170
Hear how.

03:51.170 --> 03:51.630
OK.

03:51.770 --> 03:57.310
So this is what is working what I'm going to do right now if we want to add a specific category.

03:57.350 --> 04:00.070
So let's suppose that we want to add a specific category like this.

04:00.230 --> 04:00.710
OK.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.690
We edited the default category so this is going to apply today.

04:03.700 --> 04:08.960
So if I want to just add that people reviews for people reviews I want to show machinary I'm just going

04:08.960 --> 04:13.370
to go ahead I'm going to hit edits lay out from here or I can just go ahead I can hit add new and I

04:13.370 --> 04:14.760
can add a default category.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.560
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to add a name right here.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.250
It is going to be people reviews.

04:19.280 --> 04:21.140
OK people reviews

04:25.810 --> 04:26.270
OK.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.970
And then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to select the people refuse from here.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.840
This is important.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.200
You have to select it.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.630
This is really very important.

04:33.630 --> 04:34.730
You have to select it.

04:34.770 --> 04:35.140
OK.

04:35.160 --> 04:39.600
And then you have to come here to insert column and then here you can add a slider's if I want to add

04:39.600 --> 04:43.960
a slider only for people reviews.

04:43.970 --> 04:44.340
OK.

04:44.420 --> 04:49.470
I'm going to come here to feature both slider and I'm going to select the current category toxic taxonomy.

04:49.580 --> 04:49.850
OK.

04:49.850 --> 04:52.310
So this is the Kurn category that I have selected.

04:52.310 --> 04:52.670
OK.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.470
And then I'm going to go down and it's going to show the number of bows and that is six only.

04:56.480 --> 05:01.370
So I'm going to go there and I'm going to hit save and exit and I'm going to hit publish right now so

05:01.370 --> 05:06.230
on publishing you're going to see how this is going to look if I just come here in a free Frechette

05:07.680 --> 05:08.090
OK.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.260
You will see that this will be applied to this and this is how it is working so I can either just edit

05:13.270 --> 05:19.080
it directly from a disk team options re here category builder or I can just come here and I can hit

05:19.110 --> 05:25.620
edits lay layout and I can also edit it from here as well so if I just click it you're going to see

05:25.620 --> 05:29.020
that it is applied to this and this is already selected.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.240
So this is how it's going to work.

05:30.240 --> 05:35.040
You can either CO-2 dear and then you can add a new rule to them and then you or you can just directly

05:35.040 --> 05:35.360
at it.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.260
So I'm just going to go ahead.

05:36.270 --> 05:40.800
I'm going to hit this right now and I'm going to hit insert module and then here it's going to show

05:41.370 --> 05:44.350
the I want to show the feature post later.

05:44.460 --> 05:46.720
So this is going to be Curren category taxonomy.

05:46.830 --> 05:50.360
And then I also want to show the post.

05:50.390 --> 05:55.280
So I'm going to hit at Dreux and then I want the full row and then I'm going to hit insert module and

05:55.280 --> 05:58.100
then here I can also add a post carousal.

05:58.160 --> 06:03.080
So you can see how it's going to log if I just add it and I'm going to select Curren category that post-Lehman

06:03.110 --> 06:06.270
is going to be 5 so I'm going to hit the save for now.

06:06.320 --> 06:06.970
I'm going to go ahead.

06:06.980 --> 06:12.770
I'm going to update Craig now and then I'm going to I'm going to show you how this people revues category

06:13.040 --> 06:13.460
is going to vary.

06:13.460 --> 06:20.720
So this theme is basically built on the category function so you can just see how amazing it's going

06:20.710 --> 06:20.960
to look.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.690
If I just go to my website right now let's just go to my site.

06:24.860 --> 06:25.270
OK.

06:25.370 --> 06:28.510
And then I want to go to the people review.

06:28.520 --> 06:34.780
So unclogging this you're going to see OK we have this and then we have the post kurios all right here.

06:34.790 --> 06:35.070
OK.

06:35.090 --> 06:42.290
It is showing the posts right here and here would be a sidebar but I can just click here and these solver

06:42.310 --> 06:42.790
run.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.200
OK so like it's going to show all the slider of the boast.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.640
So this is how these Crucell.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.490
You can also add it on the home page OK.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.870
I'm going to show you how you can add it.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.030
If I just get an extra three here and then I hit edits lay out.

06:54.110 --> 06:59.120
I can also just come here I can go to Stevy category builder and then I can hit category builder and

06:59.120 --> 07:01.180
then here I can work with this home page.

07:01.190 --> 07:01.450
OK.

07:01.570 --> 07:03.610
But I'm just coming here and I'm just editing it.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.370
And here I want to add a slider instead of this.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.580
I want to add a slider the featured post another featured both I won the post Kurosawa's.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.710
I'm going to hit this.

07:12.830 --> 07:13.230
OK.

07:13.280 --> 07:18.260
I'm going to hit all the categories that we have right now and the post limit is going to be 10.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.820
So it's going to show 10 post right here.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.580
I'm going to update right now.

07:23.050 --> 07:25.230
And let's just go ahead and view our website

07:28.580 --> 07:33.170
so here you can see this is how it is looking if I just click here you can see these new posters coming

07:33.170 --> 07:36.980
so it is just basically a Crucell of both that is coming right here.

07:36.980 --> 07:37.820
I just like this.

07:37.820 --> 07:42.890
I think it looks good but let's have a neuro and let's add a slider because that is also important.

07:42.890 --> 07:43.910
I'm going to hit this.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.560
I'm going to add the feature post liar and I'm going to select all the categories and it's going to

07:48.560 --> 07:50.240
show only three latest post.

07:50.270 --> 07:50.780
OK.

07:50.780 --> 08:00.530
I'm going to see an exit and I'm going to bring this right above.

08:00.590 --> 08:01.800
Why is it not moving.

08:06.500 --> 08:06.960
OK.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.640
I don't know why it is not moving.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.790
Let's just come here.

08:14.810 --> 08:15.370
OK.

08:15.450 --> 08:16.060
We have.

08:16.140 --> 08:17.040
This is not working.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.990
I hope to fix it soon.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.210
This used to run this used to work.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.740
But this is not OK.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.360
Let's just was just putting this right above.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.150
OK.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.240
This is also working let's just putting it like this so we can not just grab it from here.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.300
Well we this is used for setting's I'm sorry I'm sorry.

08:33.390 --> 08:35.680
This is your first setting this is not used for grabbing.

08:35.730 --> 08:39.200
So I'm just going to have the feature for slider and I'm going to track it here.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.470
I'm going to update right now and then you can see that this is going to be updated right here.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.830
I'm going to go to you say tray here.

08:46.870 --> 08:49.220
All I have to update at first.

08:49.650 --> 08:50.200
OK.

08:50.500 --> 08:50.800
Yeah.

08:50.820 --> 08:51.400
Here you go.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.890
I can see this is updated.

08:52.900 --> 08:58.230
This Caruso is coming then we have three Dabbs for post and then we have all the posts that are coming

08:58.230 --> 08:59.010
right here.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.650
OK so now we're totally done with this in the next video.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.150
We will be working of at the menu.

09:03.150 --> 09:08.110
I'm going to show you how can you create a mega menu that is going to show inside if I just print memos

09:08.220 --> 09:09.920
you or to this best seller.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.640
Should a Maegan menu and the post will be coming here so let's just go to Mashable dot com.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.230
OK.

09:15.270 --> 09:19.710
And then we're going to build a machinable dot com matchable dot com is the world's best blog.

09:19.710 --> 09:20.340
OK.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.730
And you can see that they use this type of thing.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.240
So if I just come here you can see how this is.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.570
Let's just wait till this is loaded.

09:28.690 --> 09:29.010
OK.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.620
You can see this is how it is.

09:31.890 --> 09:34.600
This is taking some time to load your new wife.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.590
I think my internet is slow right now.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.330
So this is you can see this.

09:38.430 --> 09:41.500
This is how this is basically called the mega menu.

09:41.670 --> 09:42.180
OK.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.680
So you're going to create something like this.

09:44.670 --> 09:49.320
And if I just bring my mouse away here it's going to show all the categories that has the post to sign

09:49.320 --> 09:52.720
it so we can select how many post categories we want to show.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.150
We can also add the top category top post in here like this.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.060
So you will understand it later on a bed then you will see it.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.620
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.160
And in the next video we will be working a bit more stuff so stay tuned.

10:06.180 --> 10:06.930
And Buh-Bye.
