05:25.540 --> 05:27.370
The logo is also going to be refreshed

05:30.330 --> 05:37.050
so you can see this has our head are looking so we basically want to try to make sure that we choose

05:37.410 --> 05:40.580
a great hair color and I think Hetter looks amazing.

05:40.620 --> 05:46.190
So say it seemed like this if you want to change the A settings of this you can also change it.

05:46.190 --> 05:50.690
We have web site content video and everything we have said polygraphy so you can change the default

05:50.890 --> 05:54.500
font body color and everything like here.

05:54.580 --> 05:59.230
And we also have a background so you don't have to add any background image or hey let's come here to

05:59.230 --> 06:01.060
the headers and mean navigation.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.850
This is the main stuff we have to work.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.300
So we have the header format.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.470
You guys already know about it.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.770
We have the primary menu bar and matches this.

06:07.900 --> 06:12.700
So we're going to come here to the menu height so you can increase or decrease it.

06:12.730 --> 06:19.430
I'm just going to make it a little bit more and less this one local max height should be

06:27.150 --> 06:27.940
cool.

06:28.190 --> 06:32.760
And then we have the letter spacing so I don't know feed letters spacing and everything looks cool here

06:32.810 --> 06:35.700
at Tech school or school actively in school.

06:35.820 --> 06:36.770
And the background color

06:44.490 --> 06:46.610
a thing we meant to be Crea

06:50.570 --> 06:53.720
or if we just decrease the opacity of this

07:00.880 --> 07:01.740
it looks cool.

07:01.750 --> 07:06.460
Let's go to the About page and let's see how the About page looks because we have to customize this

07:06.460 --> 07:09.820
whole menu was looking amazing.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.670
Let's go to this conduct page and you can see that I just decrease the opacity of the top logo.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.680
And you can see it has gained some creative fact.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.310
OK so this looks amazing.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.500
I'm going to go down and we have everything like here.

07:22.510 --> 07:27.760
We don't need that dropdown menu so we don't have to worry Connett and everything looks pretty cool.

07:36.230 --> 07:36.690
Cool.

07:36.710 --> 07:37.400
I'm going to come here.

07:37.460 --> 07:38.220
I'm going to go back.

07:38.330 --> 07:42.670
And here we have the second menu bar so we can also add this MCKENRY menu bar.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.680
If we want to.

07:43.940 --> 07:44.310
OK.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.090
You can add it if you want to add.

07:46.280 --> 07:51.020
And then we have the fix navigation settings so this is basically like this.

07:51.150 --> 07:56.360
If I just hide the logo image you can see if you just go above this little is coming if I go down.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.560
The logo is being hidden but I don't want this.

07:58.580 --> 07:58.930
OK.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.160
I want it to be normal.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.560
And when we go down Ivonne the background color to be white

08:08.830 --> 08:09.410
it white

08:17.880 --> 08:19.170
for white it is OK.

08:19.170 --> 08:24.540
And the second re many willing color looks amazing.

08:24.570 --> 08:28.240
So let's use it to be full Black.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.460
Phil Black looks good.

08:29.640 --> 08:30.020
OK.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.190
If you go above you can see this is transparent.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.030
And if we go down it is full black.

08:34.060 --> 08:35.370
So I think full blacks look good.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.820
OK we're totally done with this as well.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.080
I'm going to go back and then we have the history elements so you can show the phone number and the

08:42.140 --> 08:43.680
e-mail and the top pray here.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.310
And we have the social icons.

08:45.310 --> 08:50.410
So and I don't want to show the search icon because this is not a blog.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.690
This is a professional based Web site OK.

08:52.690 --> 09:00.110
I want to add the phone numbers so the phone number is going to be a plus 9 2 3 7 3 5 2 9 7.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.020

09:51.560 --> 10:00.910
I'm going to go to the second menu bar and one the background color to be the full black yes the background

10:00.910 --> 10:02.610

This looks super awesome.

10:08.950 --> 10:09.240
OK.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.900
Everything looks amazing.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.930
You can see we have the phone number here and then we have the e-mail address.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.900
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to publish it for you now.

10:18.130 --> 10:21.780
And now we are just left with the foot right here.

10:21.790 --> 10:23.700
So you want to come here to the story here.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.620

10:24.700 --> 10:25.550
I'm going to go back.

10:25.690 --> 10:26.860
And then we have the footer.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.990
So do you have two options how you can create footer.

10:30.010 --> 10:33.410
The first one is you can create the for the builder OK.

10:33.430 --> 10:38.560
And then you can make it global and add to every of your page.

10:38.920 --> 10:43.780
And the second option we have is that you can create the widgets.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.850
So I'll show you both the options.

10:46.390 --> 10:46.840
OK.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.760
When you come here to the layout and then we have the footer column lay out so there will be four of

13:15.660 --> 13:16.900
can add anything here.

13:16.950 --> 13:17.720
So.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.030
Or I can just leave it as a two column footer.

13:20.070 --> 13:24.590

13:39.950 --> 13:42.730
And if you don't want any of the footer you can just go back.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.090
And then you can remove the footer as well.

13:45.090 --> 13:49.470

17:08.990 --> 17:13.010
You guys already know about these custom links OK because you were following my course from start.

17:13.040 --> 17:13.530
OK.

17:13.610 --> 17:18.240
I'm going to add a privacy policy page here.

17:18.390 --> 17:23.720
And one more page I want to add and that is the terms and conditions

17:27.850 --> 17:28.760
I'm going to hit at too many.

17:28.780 --> 17:33.640
So you can create these pages make sure that you created you should be having in terms your own terms

17:33.640 --> 17:38.560
and these and you have to come here for money and then you have to hit save so you can either show them

17:38.590 --> 17:44.500
in their toolbar or you must have to show that in the below below section here.

17:46.150 --> 17:50.750
Here we have these privacy policy and terms and conditions.

17:51.030 --> 17:55.460
So you can see this is coming right here the privacy policy and the terms and conditions.

17:55.470 --> 17:56.850
Everything is coming right here.

17:57.060 --> 17:57.990

17:57.990 --> 18:00.780
You can also add a trade above if you want to.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.080
OK.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.760
I'm going to show you how can I do this.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.890
Let's publish it.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.370
Let's go to the menus right here.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.020
OK.

18:07.050 --> 18:08.750
And I want to add this right above.

18:08.760 --> 18:09.650
So I'm going to come here.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.280
I'm going to choose a good primary secondary menu.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.110
Let's come here and uncheck that for many.

18:14.130 --> 18:14.970
I'll take this.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.890

So this is how it is looking we have privacy policy and the terms and conditions right above.

18:25.300 --> 18:29.050
But I don't think so if it is looking cool right here.

18:29.050 --> 18:35.230
So I think we should be adding that into our sexuality.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.600
So I'm going to go to the

18:40.020 --> 18:46.450
appearance and then menus and then here I have to select it to be for many instead of the second really.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.110
