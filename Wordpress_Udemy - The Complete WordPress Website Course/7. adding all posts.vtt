What I'm going to do I am just going to go to the right here to the style.

03:21.050 --> 03:28.690
The headline is going to be the right and this the enemy killer is also going to be white.

03:28.980 --> 03:32.510
So we can choose to be a bit of gray

03:35.360 --> 03:36.000
OK.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.000
What I want to do.

03:41.870 --> 03:46.970
OK what I want to do right here is that I want some spacing to the top.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.070
And so what I'm going to do I'm just going to assign the padding right here.

03:50.270 --> 03:55.450
So the padding is going to be what uncheck this because we don't want to link families together.

03:55.700 --> 04:03.590
And I'm just going to assign this to be 20 pixels from the top and from the bottom it should be 20 not

04:03.680 --> 04:05.970
20 15 or 15.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.940
Fifteen looks fine and I want it to be like 30.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.080
So this looks cool.

04:13.090 --> 04:14.590
It should not miss the most.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.630
Just click here and you can see how this is looking.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.960
You should not miss these best bows.

04:18.970 --> 04:23.700
You should not miss the most viewed post.

04:23.710 --> 04:24.960
This is how it is looking OK.

04:25.060 --> 04:29.170
What I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save and you can see

04:29.170 --> 04:36.710
that I'm totally done with this.

04:36.830 --> 04:41.120
So here now what we want to do is that we want to add here

04:43.660 --> 04:48.510
the whole section where we would be showing all the products all the post here.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.110
And then here should be the sidebar.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.130
So let's add any section and I'm going to add the full section.

04:54.170 --> 04:54.720
OK.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.000
This is right here.

04:56.150 --> 05:04.600
What I want to do a one this section would be the full width let's just stretch it and let's add the

05:04.600 --> 05:07.380
full here so you can see it is coming right here.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.550
I want to call them here.

05:08.620 --> 05:11.490
I want to hit a good column in the column section.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.060
You can see that this is the section right here and this is the call.

05:15.400 --> 05:21.520
I want to head this in I want to hit a column and see two columns are right here on this column to be

05:21.520 --> 05:27.230
here for just two positions each to be 675 by 25.

05:33.910 --> 05:34.850
OK here.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.280
I want all the post.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.190
And here I want this Ibori here.

05:42.310 --> 05:42.730
OK.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.860
So let's get started.

05:44.020 --> 05:52.090
What I have to do right now is that I want to go to this guy right here and then I have to grab first

05:52.090 --> 05:58.930
of all the text that is going to show a heading right here so I want I just want basically some of the

05:58.930 --> 06:00.840
gapping from two words right here.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.790
I want I want to go to the advance section right here and I want to give some more.

06:04.840 --> 06:11.550
So the margin is going to be let's just hit this and the margin on top is going to be 20 pixel.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.190
So I think 20 pixel looks good.

06:13.210 --> 06:14.640
Let's just go with a 30 pixel

06:24.530 --> 06:26.930
so 30 pixel looks a little bit cool.

06:27.010 --> 06:28.940
Ok i think i should go with more.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.470
Let's have the 50 pixel I just created a bit OK.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.420
This looks cool.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.140
So we have a head array here.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.620
And then we have this right here.

06:45.540 --> 06:49.980
And now here I want to grab this text I want to drag it and drop a tray here and you can see this is

06:49.980 --> 06:51.690
right here.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.290
I want to show all posts.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.200
So you can show it this all posts and then dot dot dot.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.060
OK.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.010
And I won the sidebar here.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.810
So about the search stuff and stuff.

07:03.970 --> 07:11.050
OK I'm going I'm just going to click this right now and I want to the sidebars should be the sidebar.

07:11.150 --> 07:19.000
What is the sidebar.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.210
This is the sideburn here.

07:20.230 --> 07:24.130
I'm going to drag it and drop it right here so you can see sidebar is right here.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.690
I'm going to choose the sidebar.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.260
Let me show you what a sidebar is.

07:27.310 --> 07:32.400
If I just come here and I just click to complete will be coarse dotcom.

07:32.710 --> 07:32.980
OK

07:37.780 --> 07:39.820
and then hear what I have to do.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.810
I have to go to the dashboard right here.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.780
And I want to go to the appearance and then midget's.

07:47.780 --> 07:51.350
So in the rigid section you will have the sidebar basically.

07:51.440 --> 07:56.600
And for a blog the sidebar verts a lot and for blog you should be having the sidebar so you can see

07:56.900 --> 07:58.590
that we have a Rite-Aid bar here.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.580
We have a left sidebar.

07:59.590 --> 08:03.100
We have search results sidebar we have footer we after two three four.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.290
So you can add this.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.060
So we have the right sidebar.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.740
So I want this to be right Tabari and you can see all this side where stuff is going to appear here.

08:12.260 --> 08:12.870
OK.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.380
I think this looks cool.

08:14.390 --> 08:18.500
And now here we need to show all the post that we have right here.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.720
So I'm going to come here.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.320
I need to Stylo out of bed.

08:21.350 --> 08:28.250
I want to choose this to be the block because we have a team that we can only use the black and blues.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.490
So black and white sorry ok.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.720
I want to go here.

08:31.760 --> 08:37.250
I want this to be fall down and I want it to be a little bit of creation cool.

08:37.340 --> 08:39.060
I want to come here I want to click this again.

08:39.140 --> 08:44.860
I want to hit typography and I want to increase this is OK.

08:44.980 --> 08:54.120
And here I want to choose the font to be open since I want to choose the fate to be the 500.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.140
So this looks cool.

08:56.350 --> 08:58.450
I want to grab this depost now.

08:58.540 --> 08:59.050
OK.

08:59.050 --> 09:04.960
So I want to come here and here in the pro elements we should be having Dubost right here.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.850
So let's get to this guy right here and let's select West.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.500
Yes.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.520
Here we have the post.

09:09.550 --> 09:13.010
I want to drag it and drop it right below.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.440
So this is right here.

09:14.500 --> 09:14.710
OK.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.590
You can see all the posts are coming.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.980
So we have three columns.

09:18.010 --> 09:20.630
We have post Burbidge on six.

09:20.790 --> 09:21.120
OK.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.710
Now here we want to show all the boast.

09:23.770 --> 09:24.360
OK.

09:24.550 --> 09:25.750
No questions asked.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.560
So how I'm going to do this.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.290
So what I have to do I basically have to work on this first.

09:32.380 --> 09:38.470
Let's change this to be like this a Prader V and the dash foot we say the standing.

09:38.510 --> 09:39.170
OK.

09:39.470 --> 09:40.390
I want to go down.

09:40.520 --> 09:47.570
And here in the page anation I basically have to select the numbers so you can see that we have the

09:47.570 --> 09:53.870
numbers right here and numbers are coming and make sure you come here and you saw the post page to be

09:53.900 --> 10:00.050
six columns is this the image is this and everything is this OK supposed support page 6 right here.

10:00.050 --> 10:02.110
You can also choose it to be 9 if you want to.

10:02.330 --> 10:07.340
And you can see that the page edition is coming right here and that's going to take us to the next page

10:07.430 --> 10:12.280
if we have any other till you can see this so it's going to work and we have.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.580
This is classic.

10:13.580 --> 10:19.810
We have the columns we have the post Burbidge we have the image position we have the image size and

10:19.820 --> 10:21.420
then we have the image fit as well.

10:21.590 --> 10:25.000
So now you can see this is working totally OK.

10:25.070 --> 10:29.720
What I have to do I have the query I have to choose the post only post and nothing else.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.080
OK.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.380
And the autobio should be data because we want to show the recent post to the top.

10:34.490 --> 10:40.700
OK so that is why the autobio is date and the order is descending because we want to show the recent

10:40.820 --> 10:41.830
That was the recent post.

10:41.840 --> 10:47.500
If you use the ascending then it's going to show the post that was created first on this blog.

10:47.540 --> 10:47.910
OK.

10:47.990 --> 10:49.900
So this is out.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.300
Now what I'm going to do.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.470
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit Tave.

10:54.710 --> 10:56.870
I also want to do one more thing with that.

10:56.870 --> 10:59.790
We want to add this so I'm going to go to the style right here.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.680
I want to go to the columns and I want to decrease that column.

11:03.710 --> 11:04.870
Now it looks pretty well

11:08.620 --> 11:08.890
yes.

11:08.920 --> 11:09.630
OK.

11:09.760 --> 11:17.490
What I want to do right here is the rows gap should be increased a bit cool or increase it more.

11:17.850 --> 11:18.460
OK.

11:18.630 --> 11:22.800
I want to go to the image right here so you can choose the spacing of the image that how you want the

11:22.800 --> 11:24.400
image spacing.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.870
I think this one just fine.

11:25.950 --> 11:30.960
I want to go to the content tray here so you can also work with this to kind and color you can change

11:30.960 --> 11:31.920
the color.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.560
You can change the topography you can.

11:36.560 --> 11:42.730
This is the title basically and typography should be I think more increased the titles should be increased

11:42.730 --> 11:44.670
a bit.

11:46.380 --> 11:46.870
Cool.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.450
OK.

11:47.510 --> 11:50.710
I want to choose the font to be open science.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.740
And there we go.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.420
I would increase the size right now.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.930
OK this looks amazing.

12:00.930 --> 12:01.780
And then we have the vaid.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.300
So if you want any of the bait we can choose the specific bait.

12:05.610 --> 12:06.030
OK.

12:06.030 --> 12:11.910
And then we have to transform so we can also transform it to be uppercase so that every title that we

12:11.910 --> 12:15.460
have should be uppercase if you want the uppercase if you want to.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.090
OK I think we should be using the default one.

12:18.210 --> 12:23.370
OK we go down and then we have this style so you can choose the normal help bleak and then we go down

12:23.370 --> 12:25.120
we go down and then we have the metta.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.930
So this is the middle way here.

12:26.940 --> 12:30.670
I want to change the color to be a bit more black.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.510
Black and everything is cool here.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.750
A one some spacing to the top notch to below.

12:36.810 --> 12:39.320
So I want some spacing to the top right here.

12:39.810 --> 12:44.170
From the title to this one the spacing down below as well.

12:44.360 --> 12:44.670
OK.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.360
And this should be more as well.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.060
Let's use ETAs well here.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.750
OK that is cool.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.780
I want to change the color of the excerpt.

12:53.800 --> 13:01.220
Well let's just make it full block or two normal and then we have the read more burden.

13:01.570 --> 13:07.110
So read more but it's going to be full black.

13:07.290 --> 13:07.720
OK.

13:07.810 --> 13:15.370
Now let's change this to be a bit of Crais change to be a bit of create this is totally OK and change

13:15.370 --> 13:16.830
the title to be a bit of crazy.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.420
Well OK.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.700
The title should be a bit of.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.300
So you can see that

13:25.480 --> 13:27.540
this is coming right here this is coming right here.

13:27.550 --> 13:32.290
So we basically want to give some padding to the left because it is sticking to the ball.

13:32.290 --> 13:38.710
So what I want to do I want to just select this whole section OK and I want to go to

13:42.650 --> 13:45.330
if you choose the boxed Dan

13:53.770 --> 13:54.580
this looks fine.

13:57.790 --> 14:00.000
Yes I think this looks fine.

14:03.860 --> 14:06.470
Or if we choose to be full with

14:09.550 --> 14:13.630
let's use the box and let's just remove it.

14:14.020 --> 14:19.490
OK let's just click here and this is also a cool thing.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.450
But I think we should change it.

14:22.460 --> 14:27.980
We should change it to be more.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.740
I think this much this much looks cool.

14:34.480 --> 14:34.710
Yes.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.400
OK.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.430
So I can see this is how my website is looking.

14:38.590 --> 14:40.640
If I just click it it's going to take me to the page do.

14:40.660 --> 14:47.420
So now let's go ahead let's just click this guy right here let's save and now let's go to our Web site

14:47.710 --> 14:48.300
right here.

14:48.340 --> 14:52.150
I want to go to the visit site and you can see that I am right here.

14:52.150 --> 14:55.120
It sees the logo is coming here that e-mail is coming.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.080
Here are the social links for coming here.

14:57.280 --> 15:03.030
And then the all posts are coming here so you can see the read more tag is also here.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.600
So I can add anything pretty well I can go to the beach too as well if I want to.

15:08.770 --> 15:11.620
And you can see it has taken me to the page to right here

15:15.670 --> 15:21.460
so this is now the second page the third base and every page is coming so you can also choose the different

15:21.460 --> 15:23.320
page anation style if you want to.

15:23.500 --> 15:28.870
If I just come here I select just one right here and then I go down and here it seems to be a.

15:28.870 --> 15:33.130
So if I wanted a different style I can go with the number and the premise next.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.300
Also looks crea.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.160
OK if I just say like this you can see this is coming like this.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.690

15:39.700 --> 15:44.650
So this is going to show all the posts like this and the previous and next step is also going to appear.

15:45.010 --> 15:50.810
So this will be the private label and this will be the next label or you can

15:53.510 --> 15:56.120
just remove it and keep only these labels as well.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.140

16:01.250 --> 16:02.150
Refresh.

16:02.150 --> 16:06.680
And there we can see this is how it is looking we have to run to three and then we have the premise

16:06.720 --> 16:11.150

16:11.150 --> 16:13.730
