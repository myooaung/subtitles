All in my professional borage they don't want that I always really like court press developer and you

So I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit this OK.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.530
And I want to add something.

00:18.540 --> 00:22.450
So when we want to add this we just click this guy right here.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.390
So I'm just going to go ahead.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.690
I'm going to hit this guy and then you can see that I can add pretty much anything.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.300
So I need an image OK.

00:31.380 --> 00:34.820
So I'm just going to drag it and drop it frame here.

00:36.150 --> 00:36.810
OK.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.310
And it should be here.

00:38.590 --> 00:40.700
So it says choose the image.

00:41.020 --> 00:47.670
I'm just going to come here and I need the image to be like a better 150 went by 150 Not very much large.

00:47.740 --> 00:54.040
So I'm just going to come here and I need to upload the file select file and just select the file that

00:54.040 --> 00:55.050
I want to upload.

00:55.080 --> 00:55.730
So

01:04.550 --> 01:10.000
this is the one I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit this and you can see that it is coming

01:10.020 --> 01:11.040
right here.

01:11.090 --> 01:14.270
I'm just going to come here and it is insert media.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.470
So this is right here.

01:15.470 --> 01:23.660
You can see that this is coming right here and I'm going to go to the style and here I have the bottom

01:23.660 --> 01:24.760
radius.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.480
So for botter radius I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to rate this going to come here and it

01:29.480 --> 01:30.580
takes 200.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.010
OK so you can see that this is now off the center.

01:35.110 --> 01:35.540
OK.

01:35.660 --> 01:41.650
I think I should be going up to 50 to 50 300

01:46.140 --> 01:46.630
Yes

01:50.770 --> 01:51.630
OK.

01:52.090 --> 01:52.570
Yes.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.810
Three hundred.

01:53.860 --> 01:57.470
So here we go you can see that the border has been applied.

01:57.580 --> 01:57.930
OK.

01:57.940 --> 02:03.280
I'm just going to come here and it seems that Tom may also be 150 at 150 so you can see that how this

02:03.280 --> 02:09.480
is looking this is the image that is coming and it is also the circle right here.

02:09.670 --> 02:14.980
So you can see how created this the border should be solid.

02:15.460 --> 02:22.750
And so you can see that I am basically editing this image right here on clicking this image or applying

02:22.750 --> 02:23.560
this image.

02:23.620 --> 02:28.900
This is the content where you have to choose the assignment choose the alignment made size and everything

02:29.230 --> 02:29.910
you can.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.080
And this is the style where you can style everything.

02:33.100 --> 02:33.540
OK.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.380
So here is the size for the opacity.

02:36.510 --> 02:39.580
Her is over animation.

02:39.580 --> 02:43.230
And then we have the body type so the border is going to be solid.

02:43.360 --> 02:43.870
OK.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.260
And the color is going to be the full one.

02:47.410 --> 02:52.890
So this is going to be a bit cool.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.810
So you can just control the transparency right here.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.060
You can you can see that if I just increase it.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.160
How this is changing the border is changing.

03:01.290 --> 03:06.060
OK so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to use the normal one.

03:06.060 --> 03:06.480
OK.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.340
And the border really it should be rounded.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.130
So then we have the caption right here.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.410
If you want to add a caption You can also add it.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.260
But since we have our name right here so I didn't think so.

03:15.420 --> 03:20.080
If it is recommended so now we're totally done with this.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.780
You can also do add some animation.

03:22.780 --> 03:28.300
So if I just come in here you can see and I want to just add to my animation so I can just go with the

03:28.300 --> 03:28.750
flow.

03:28.870 --> 03:31.780
So if I just bring my mouse you can see how this is coming.

03:31.870 --> 03:37.720
So let's just skim here and if I just bring my mouse and can see so you can give this effect pretty

03:37.870 --> 03:42.090
well and you can see how trade it is looking like just love it.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.560
So now you can see you can change it.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.370
You can change it to be like hangs.

03:46.390 --> 03:51.310
Q So you can see how this is changing so you can change it to be prÃ©val.

03:51.650 --> 03:54.100
Buzz is also great.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.440
You can see I'm dancing.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.890
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to go to the floor one because I like this one OK and I'm

04:01.890 --> 04:02.990
going to go ahead and I'm going to hit sick.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.830
So I'm looking just like pretty much an egg.

04:06.420 --> 04:13.620
So now I want to add another text and that is going to be my tagline my professional line that I want

04:13.620 --> 04:14.220
to add.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.570
So I'm going to click this guy right here again.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.290
OK.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.890
And I want to go to.

04:21.660 --> 04:25.260
So you can pretty much go with the heading where you can go with a text editor.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.340
So it totally depends.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.920
You bulldoze the thing.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.470
It's going to do the same job.

04:29.610 --> 04:34.220
So I'm just going to grab the text editor right here because I want to text not a hitting.

04:34.260 --> 04:43.250
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to add this to be fab developer or avoid press developer

04:48.650 --> 04:52.160
and there's no expert.

04:53.080 --> 05:01.020
So there we go and know what I want I want to go to the style and I want to align this to center so

05:01.020 --> 05:10.370
you can see that this has been aligned to center and the text is going to be white a bit off right now

05:10.470 --> 05:11.570
for white.

05:12.170 --> 05:12.550
OK.

05:12.670 --> 05:19.080
And the typography should be on and the size should be this.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.010
This looks cool.

05:22.110 --> 05:22.770
OK.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.580
Yes this looks cool.

05:25.690 --> 05:33.600
So now what I want I want to change the family so it's going to be open since

05:36.480 --> 05:42.410
OK and the rate should be 300.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.800
This looks amazing.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.540
This looks seriously amazing.

05:45.540 --> 05:46.680
OK.

05:46.770 --> 05:50.420
And then we have the styles so it should be the default one.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.300
The transformation should be no transformation.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.660
And we have the line height so you can just manage the line hydrate here.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.440
So I'm just going to go with the normal one.

06:03.890 --> 06:04.910
I think this one.

06:05.170 --> 06:05.590
OK.

06:05.810 --> 06:06.630
This looks cool.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.230
This looks cool.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.030
Kind of cool.

06:08.030 --> 06:12.860
I'm just going to crab This right here and I can see how this is looking.

06:12.890 --> 06:15.210
So I just need a bit more line height.

06:15.260 --> 06:16.790
OK.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.290
Getting this much.

06:22.410 --> 06:23.660
