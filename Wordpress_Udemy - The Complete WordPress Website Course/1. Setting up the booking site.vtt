WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:06.790
Hear what is up guys and what KMAX now in this video will be working out what this looking site OK so

00:06.790 --> 00:09.690
you can see the Is my booking site.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.810
I have just installed Wordpress and now I have to just install Wordpress and this will be done.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.590
So basically what a booking site is.

00:15.640 --> 00:23.300
If you just go to any the websites like hotel or motel booking like this OK and they can see the DVD

00:23.350 --> 00:30.190
like you have to book the hotel and they just charge you for the nights you stay or for something like

00:30.190 --> 00:30.400
that.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.850
So this is how these type of booking works.

00:32.860 --> 00:41.290
You can see if I just come here to Expedia hurrican just dumb books any hotel and it will work the way

00:41.920 --> 00:45.400
it were like on the nights you want to stay and then it'll work.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.290
So this is outrageous.

00:46.300 --> 00:51.850
Visit like in this video we will be talking about that how can we build a website like this seem like

00:51.850 --> 00:54.560
this if I just go to either NZL dot com.

00:54.770 --> 00:56.870
OK this is the Web site vier.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.680
I just want to just look for it.

00:58.690 --> 01:04.270
Lake here is the higher the functionality how we want it to work so that a person can just hire me for

01:04.270 --> 01:05.380
just $10.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.630
There are for like $20 per hour or a just like how I want to work for.

01:11.650 --> 01:16.560
So he can just hire me and the hiring me will be worked on the payment basis and everything.

01:16.570 --> 01:17.700
So how this will work.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.590
I wanted to make it work as well.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.450
How will they do that.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.360
So this video will be working up there.

01:22.420 --> 01:25.300
Basically this will cost you a lot.

01:25.310 --> 01:31.570
Guys seriously if you have a client and who wants to just add that functionality then you can charge

01:31.570 --> 01:33.580
him for that specific plug in.

01:33.580 --> 01:34.090
Okay.

01:36.220 --> 01:40.690
You can charge him for that specific plug in cars that plug in will cost you $250.

01:40.690 --> 01:41.090
OK.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.620
But I'm just telling you how it works so that you can understand this.

01:44.620 --> 01:45.050
OK.

01:45.130 --> 01:48.290
So first of all you have to just go ahead and you have to install WordPress.

01:48.310 --> 01:52.400
I also assure you that if you want to learn how you can get this plug in for just 10 bucks.

01:52.420 --> 01:53.660
OK.

01:53.660 --> 01:59.260
Now let's go ahead and little plug into this plug in is costly a bit and is basically a big plug into

01:59.520 --> 02:04.360
if you are creating it for a big company like bird there is should be the hotel bookings or something

02:04.360 --> 02:05.130
like that.

02:05.170 --> 02:09.050
Then there are earnings so then they you should pay them.

02:09.100 --> 02:19.290
OK so that is why they cost you so if you just go to commers commerce extension's commerce extensions

02:19.290 --> 02:23.990
and then here you will see new commerce extensions in this.

02:24.090 --> 02:32.290
They have this specific plug in that is created by them and that is called Basically the commerce distribution.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.420
No no no no that is called Commerce booking.

02:35.420 --> 02:38.180
So if I just come here and I just search for booking

02:41.270 --> 02:42.370
Yes this is the one.

02:42.740 --> 02:46.540
So they will cost us it will cost you like $250.

02:46.680 --> 02:53.600
They allow customers to book appointments for services but doubt leaving your site so you can just add

02:53.600 --> 02:55.590
that functionality on your own website.

02:55.820 --> 02:59.490
And guys your customers will be able to just do that.

02:59.660 --> 03:06.840
So if you do not want to just pay this much OK and you want to learn it you just want to be like.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.380
I just want to try it but I don't want to pay that much.

03:09.410 --> 03:14.570
And then you can get it for like voicemail you know dot com is basically a Web site where you can get

03:14.570 --> 03:17.260
this plug plug in for just $10.

03:17.450 --> 03:18.620
OK.

03:18.770 --> 03:23.430
I myself don't know if this is allowed or not but they will give you the license.

03:23.450 --> 03:27.610
Actually that is called the GPL and GPL is basically the word press license.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.000
OK.

03:28.010 --> 03:32.630
If you just come here and you just search for is M. Legat.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.400
OK I have surged a lot.

03:34.400 --> 03:41.050
I've searched a lot but and some people say that Lumo is like that to you use you don't.

03:41.390 --> 03:42.360
You don't have to worry.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.330
So I have just searched a lot and that is why I'm recommending you this Web site.

03:46.340 --> 03:51.890
I myself don't know if this is allowed or not but you can see there there is no reason that in course

03:51.890 --> 03:57.500
of modifying the code strip Devil people could not also add and these guys didn't write that word took

03:57.500 --> 03:59.160
on being on them for support.

03:59.160 --> 03:59.900
Maybe a bad idea.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.390
There are some things that you should consider OK.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.710
I suggest sticking with the actual plug in auditors.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.530
But if the risk is worked the difference in cost go for it.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.170
So you can just go ahead.

04:12.230 --> 04:14.820
OK.

04:15.050 --> 04:21.720
I serged answer is mostly people say it does look good but if you just want to learn it then please

04:21.720 --> 04:22.660
just go with this.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.810
And if you want to create it for your client then please guys to not go with this will no doubt it is

04:27.810 --> 04:30.350
the right and you should buy it from them.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.600
You should charge your client for this this much.

04:32.610 --> 04:33.070
OK.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.150
You should charge your extra client if you are doing it.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.760
But if you are just doing for learning purposes I don't think so.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.360
This is wrong so you can just go ahead you can go down.

04:40.470 --> 04:43.490
And here you can see it says bookings.

04:43.560 --> 04:48.600
So this is the exact same plug in which is they giving and they are also giving the same plug ins if

04:48.600 --> 04:51.180
you just want to just go ahead and learn it.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.160
You can just go ahead and learn it from them.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.340
You can purchase it for just 10 bucks.

04:55.880 --> 04:56.430
OK.

04:56.840 --> 05:01.980
So now let's go ahead and let's just basically create our website so you can just grab it from here.

05:02.010 --> 05:07.630
If you're creating it for your client please guys to not just buy from them and do not see money please.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.720
They have the right it's their right.

05:09.720 --> 05:14.250
Obviously guys they have three of the plug in and it's their right to just they should be get to they

05:14.250 --> 05:15.260
should get paid.

05:15.270 --> 05:19.740
But if you wanted to learn that you can go with that so now I have here and I'm just going to go ahead

05:19.740 --> 05:21.000
and I'm going to enter my username.

05:21.120 --> 05:21.580
OK.

05:21.630 --> 05:30.160
And then I have to enter my password so my password is going to be an alleged hit log in so I'm not

05:30.160 --> 05:31.870
going to sit my say site up.

05:31.900 --> 05:36.050
And then after setting up everything I want to go ahead and make my website look great.

05:36.070 --> 05:39.810
So for this will be vidoe will be going on with commerce.

05:39.820 --> 05:43.810
We have to install it first but let's just go from here to the permalink and do this because this is

05:43.810 --> 05:44.290
important.

05:44.290 --> 05:45.790
I'm just going to I'm here I'm just good at it.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.150
I'm going to save changes.

05:48.590 --> 05:49.580
I'm sick and tired is done.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.530
I'm just going to go ahead to plug ins right now and I'm going to add Oh so in here I search for commerce

05:56.110 --> 05:56.530
OK.

05:56.780 --> 06:00.180

06:04.640 --> 06:06.500

06:08.330 --> 06:10.880

06:10.880 --> 06:16.300
I also have to upload the plug in that that that is this new commerce.

06:44.050 --> 06:44.330

06:44.350 --> 06:48.290
