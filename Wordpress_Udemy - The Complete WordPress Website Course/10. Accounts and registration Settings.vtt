00:00.600 --> 00:04.700
WHAT IS IT guy is one can make it now and you will be working it that counts setting so you can see

00:04.700 --> 00:07.380
that I explain you everything here.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.830
So I don't think so if I need to explain you this is on my account page.

00:10.850 --> 00:11.990
This is our registration.

00:11.990 --> 00:17.870
I explain to you that we need to enable the registration on the checkout page and able to customer registration

00:17.870 --> 00:21.230
on my account page if someone visits my account page.

00:21.230 --> 00:27.840
So let me just open up the private tab and let's just enter the as five complete table because dot com.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.480
OK.

00:28.490 --> 00:36.110
And then here if someone wants to just go to my account page then you can see that we only have given

00:36.110 --> 00:39.800
the access to log in and retest and entered a password.

00:39.830 --> 00:43.390
We haven't given the access to register to say so.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.020
You will.

00:44.030 --> 00:49.300
You can dislike that the only customer I can only read Dyster on the checkout page.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.750
Not the My Account page.

00:50.900 --> 00:56.390
So if you want them to just register to your website on my account page you will enable it and then

00:56.390 --> 00:57.720
you will hit save changes.

00:57.740 --> 00:58.150
OK.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.680
And then when someone will come here he will just come here and he will refresh and then you will see

01:03.680 --> 01:07.430
that register page is also coming right here.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.300

01:08.360 --> 01:12.460
OK so a person can enter his email address password and then he can register himself.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.300
So this is how the registration works.

01:14.330 --> 01:18.880
Then we have the log in display return thing customer and log in reminder on checkout page.

01:18.890 --> 01:19.380

01:28.070 --> 01:28.630
OK.

01:28.730 --> 01:29.930
And then I also just go.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.820
Go ahead and head to court.

01:32.290 --> 01:32.660
OK.

01:32.780 --> 01:37.410
And then I would go to view card Krait here and then I proceed to check out.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.960
So you can see that this is showing returning customer.

01:42.320 --> 01:42.740

So this is showing that.

01:43.940 --> 01:44.420
OK.

01:44.480 --> 01:51.410

01:51.740 --> 01:57.030
automatically generate a user name for a customer e-mail automatically generate customer password.

01:57.170 --> 02:02.510
OK so you can also automatically generate customer password and then you can send them to e-mail but

02:02.720 --> 02:05.480
let the customer set his own password why you want to generate it.

02:05.480 --> 02:05.960
OK.

02:06.050 --> 02:09.530

02:09.680 --> 02:11.050
And this is totally done.

02:11.180 --> 02:16.700

02:16.700 --> 02:17.930
to email right now.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.330
