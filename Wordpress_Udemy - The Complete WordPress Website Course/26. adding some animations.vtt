00:01.130 --> 00:05.270
WHAT DOES IT guys and what can I say now in this video we're going to be working up with the animation.

00:05.270 --> 00:05.680
OK.

00:05.690 --> 00:11.990
This is so important because you have to add some animation to add some to your website so you can see

00:11.990 --> 00:13.110
that if I just come here.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.380
DV basically adds some of the effects in the any nation.

00:17.390 --> 00:20.870
Because if I just go down you can see this is not coming.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.150
It go down.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.120
And then this appears OK then this appears not disappears.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.340
This appears so I'm going to go down you can see everything is OK.

00:30.410 --> 00:31.310
Everything is coming.

00:31.310 --> 00:33.210
This is not appearing.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.070
It appears here

00:38.400 --> 00:40.850
so I want to basically design it like this.

00:40.850 --> 00:44.310
That how it should be looking so amazing.

00:44.360 --> 00:50.970
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here to enable the visual Bilour

00:56.020 --> 01:04.230
don't Freestore I'm going to go down and here I want to add these animations so I want to first of all

01:04.230 --> 01:06.820
add the animation to the slider.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.190
OK.

01:08.190 --> 01:13.050
Otherwise I would not recommend you to add any animation to here to the slider because this slider comes

01:13.050 --> 01:17.070
to the top so don't you don't have to add any mission right here.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.330
But let's add the animation to our services section so I'm going to go to that design right here.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.990
I'm going to go to the animation and you can see that it's going to appear like this fade.

01:24.990 --> 01:34.820
You can also move with the slide the bounce the zoom the flip the fold the real OK.

01:34.940 --> 01:40.250
So don't use the roll OK because it looks so much cheap it can go with the fold and you can also go

01:40.250 --> 01:41.260
with the flip.

01:41.390 --> 01:41.810
OK.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.720
It can also go with feet as well.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.810
So I think it looks cool.

01:46.820 --> 01:50.620
You can also increase the animation duration like it would be two seconds.

01:50.660 --> 01:54.320
It is 200 milliseconds or two thousand milli said it takes seconds.

01:54.350 --> 01:57.140
This means that it will load in two seconds.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.320
It will basically appear you can see if I just decrease it and increase it.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.840
You can see it is taking two seconds to load properly and any mission repeat is loop.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.800
If I just a little bit you can see it blink blink blink.

02:08.830 --> 02:11.660
So if I just change it to one milliseconds to see the magic

02:17.690 --> 02:18.770
so you can also create it.

02:18.770 --> 02:19.780
You can also do it.

02:19.790 --> 02:20.340
OK.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.960
So you can do that pretty well.

02:23.060 --> 02:27.590
But I want to make it at once because I don't want anything like this.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.160
OK.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.840
And then we have them go down.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.920
We can also delay that how much milliseconds you want to delay to that it for the home and comes here

02:34.230 --> 02:34.850
then.

02:35.090 --> 02:37.210
This should be appearing so you can also delete.

02:37.220 --> 02:39.150
It totally depends upon you.

02:39.340 --> 02:45.280
The animation starting opacity should be zero percent tonight and any to 100 percent.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.310
So if I just add it you can see

02:53.640 --> 02:54.760
this is how it is feeding.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.270
OK so you can change that as well.

02:57.270 --> 03:02.450
So if you just make it 100 percent you can see there is no effect because the starting capacity is just

03:02.450 --> 03:04.520
100 percent how it's going to show the effect.

03:04.560 --> 03:11.100
So you can pretty well change it or you can change it that how you want it to be will be going up it

03:11.230 --> 03:12.480
you're a person here.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.290
And 950 millisecond from here.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.100
I'm going to go down.

03:18.570 --> 03:23.400
And here we already have these right here so you can also change how you want it to be.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.190
If you just come here and then you click the gear icon.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.710
You go to the design you go to any missions you can see this is you can select it to be like a top icon

03:31.710 --> 03:32.340
to bottom.

03:32.340 --> 03:35.460
So this is like you can also make it fade.

03:35.490 --> 03:37.370
This is this is referring to the full.

03:37.470 --> 03:38.760
So you can also do it like this.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.960
OK.

03:40.260 --> 03:43.590
Top to bottom so you can just go to left to right.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.630
So this is the image icon.

03:45.630 --> 03:49.870
Any mention of the full not the full animation to make sure that you add it to.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.770
You can also set it to no animation if you don't want to add any information.

03:52.770 --> 04:00.180
You can also go to right to left or since this is right here so I wanted to just come here to top to

04:00.180 --> 04:02.170
bottom so that it comes to the top to bottom.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.380
And let's just come here.

04:03.420 --> 04:06.690
Let's just work this one right here and let's go.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.950
This one should be from this side to this side.

04:08.950 --> 04:12.000
So this is the left side too right.

04:12.030 --> 04:13.740
So I'm going to go to the design right here.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.280
I want to go to discovery here and it should be left to right.

04:17.310 --> 04:23.150
This comes from the site and this one should be from Ed Dunbar.

04:23.190 --> 04:32.840
And this one should be from right to left ok cool let's just save it.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.170
Let's come here and let's see this piece as well.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.610
So now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to open up my website and let's see how this is going to

04:39.610 --> 04:39.890
look.

04:39.940 --> 04:40.820
You guys are going to love it.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.620
OK.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.860
Let's get him here let's see it.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.830
Let's go down.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.120
You can see this is coming from the left.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.840
This is coming from Bob and this is coming from right.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.580
So this is how you can pretty well make these animations.

04:53.670 --> 04:54.180
OK.

04:54.180 --> 04:55.270
I go down I go down.

04:55.270 --> 04:56.600
And here we have this right here.

04:56.610 --> 05:02.700
So we have to work on this since this is a call to action and it needs the animation to get users in

05:02.930 --> 05:03.440
interactive.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.580
OK I'm going to come here I'm going to go down in here we have you here.

05:08.070 --> 05:14.860
You can also make the four two from this should be coming from left to the right.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.660
I'm going to come here.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.440
I'm going to click here here and here should be the design right here.

05:19.590 --> 05:22.550
Let's get to the animation and slide.

05:22.550 --> 05:38.570
So it's going to slide from left Sorry the right way the animation duration can be 750.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.850
Henry Gore seemed like this.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.970
Have to apply this to hold X right here.

05:43.060 --> 05:43.300
So

05:46.770 --> 05:51.730
you can also do one thing you can just you know this is not the whole role.

05:51.830 --> 05:52.080
OK.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.000
You have to do it to every three setting so you have to go to the design right here you have to go to

05:57.000 --> 06:03.340
the animation you have to slide it and the lighting should be from the right.

06:03.420 --> 06:08.940
This is coming to this camera here and we have two iterations that duration can be 900 make sure that

06:08.940 --> 06:12.300
you choose to for every single thing right here.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.940
I'm going to select a divider here is like this.

06:14.940 --> 06:18.510
Let's get to the design and let's get to the animation.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.850
Let's go move on to make it slide and then we have this one.

06:21.870 --> 06:22.410
OK.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.220
And then this should be great.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.650
So this is also coming.

06:25.650 --> 06:30.330
You can also make it to 900 and it.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.870
So I guess we have to apply to disburden right here.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.690
I'm going to go do that design right here.

06:34.820 --> 06:38.080
And this burden is going to be three.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.580
I want to come here and this here is animation so it is also going to slide.

06:42.740 --> 06:48.880
So it is sliding from right direction is right.

06:48.910 --> 06:52.670
So I'm going to change it to 900 ok cool.

06:52.690 --> 06:57.100
I'm going to come here and I'm going to click here so you can see how this is looking like this I want

06:57.100 --> 07:02.950
to apply to decide right here if I go to the design I go to the animation and this is going to slide

07:03.280 --> 07:05.210
from the left to to the left.

07:05.230 --> 07:07.220
OK I can see how this is looking.

07:07.270 --> 07:13.320
I'm going to change it to 900 to come here and let's save it let's go here and let's save it.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.710
So now let's go ahead and let's have a look at it.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.910
Say refresh

07:21.430 --> 07:22.350
and here we go.

07:22.540 --> 07:26.870
If I just go down you can see how this is looking how this is looking.

07:27.310 --> 07:32.560
I go down and this is how it is looking so you can also pretty well delay it a bit to that the user

07:32.590 --> 07:34.770
reach a in a direction.

07:34.870 --> 07:35.850
And then he sees that.

07:35.850 --> 07:39.790
So you can just come here you can go to the design right here and then you can go to the animation and

07:39.790 --> 07:46.460
you can delay it for like 500 milliseconds or 300 milliseconds.

07:46.720 --> 07:52.510
It's like this Gary here he's slick design they go down and then you slide it to be three hundred milliseconds

07:56.140 --> 07:57.110
want to add this to.

07:57.130 --> 08:03.980
But and right here design animation and delays should be three.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.360
Henry OK.

08:07.780 --> 08:14.350
So Mike this we have to come here we have to go to design right here and then we have to go to the animation

08:14.440 --> 08:17.390
and then we have to delay it for 300 milliseconds.

08:18.330 --> 08:23.440
Same save it said 300 milliseconds is like.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.460
You divide 1 seconds into three two three.

08:28.620 --> 08:28.990
OK.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.610
I'm going to come here.

08:30.630 --> 08:32.610
I'm going to come here and I'm going to rephrase this.

08:32.640 --> 08:38.100
So let's go to the top page let's come here and let's refresh.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.140
Here we go we go down.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.150
This is coming.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.290
We go down.

08:42.290 --> 08:43.340
This is coming like this.

08:43.340 --> 08:49.430
We go down and this is coming amazingly OK so you can pretty well delay it more if you want to let me

08:49.430 --> 08:49.950
go down.

08:49.970 --> 08:51.960
You can see this is coming and everything.

08:51.960 --> 08:57.170
So you can pretty well do these animations to every type of websites that you create.

08:57.210 --> 09:01.950
Make sure that you do not add so much bone see effects and bad and bad.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.560
And the rolling effect is not added to not at all.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.840
Guys I'm telling you once again to not to not make your votes look cheap.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.030
OK.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.590
Make sure make sure that you have your say.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.490
Decent.

09:13.490 --> 09:14.050
OK.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.390
So here we go.

09:15.410 --> 09:16.510
Everything looks cool.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.240
Now we have to do the mobile optimization.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.340
You can pretty well add it to both the pages and then you can work with it.

09:22.340 --> 09:27.800
So now we have to work with the mobile optimization and we will be doing that in the next video so stadium

09:27.800 --> 09:29.050
guys and by.
