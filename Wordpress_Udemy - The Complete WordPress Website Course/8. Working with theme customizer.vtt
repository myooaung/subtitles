WEBVTT

00:00.580 --> 00:04.690
What is up guys and what KMAX in our industry are you going to be working at the team customize or.

00:04.690 --> 00:05.820
And this is very important.

00:05.820 --> 00:11.160
So let's just go with this let's just go to team a miser and let's just added our team totally.

00:11.170 --> 00:11.740
OK.

00:11.750 --> 00:17.120
I'm just going to go to all the settings simultaneously so that I can just explain it to you that are

00:17.120 --> 00:17.550
important.

00:17.570 --> 00:18.260
OK.

00:18.260 --> 00:22.390
So let's just go to general settings here we can go to the channel settings we have the layout settings.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.010
OK we can just enable the box layout.

00:25.120 --> 00:25.520
OK.

00:25.610 --> 00:32.350
So this is the old layout this people used to just have the box layout and all the older days fan.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.930
They can just create their box layouts.

00:34.940 --> 00:38.380
So I'm just I'm just someone this I just wanted to be the normal one.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.690
This is now the people create the blog.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.070
OK so then we have the sidebar of it we can control manage our Sidebar right here so you can see if

00:46.070 --> 00:46.910
I just increase it.

00:46.910 --> 00:48.650
The sidebar is being increased.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.150
I'm just going to go with the normal one.

00:50.150 --> 00:55.280
And then we have the website cutterhead So if I just decrease that he can see the column section.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.100
The spacing is being decreased.

00:57.230 --> 00:58.760
So you can do it if you want to.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.700
I think it looks great.

01:01.050 --> 01:04.100
But the normal one you can see there are a bit spacing.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.060
I don't if you don't like the spacing you can just decrease it.

01:08.470 --> 01:09.430
I Lucrece it.

01:09.450 --> 01:10.910
I'll just set it to two I guess.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.440
I think it looks great.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.760
All right let's just choose it to be this one then.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.010
No I think it will set it to two.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.410
So just give some spacing not too much.

01:19.410 --> 01:19.950
OK.

01:19.950 --> 01:25.410
Here you can very good the content bid like if you want to increase it for the big websites you can

01:25.410 --> 01:27.480
increase the content as well.

01:27.660 --> 01:29.420
But I'm going to be going up in a default one.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.300
And then we have the X in color.

01:31.350 --> 01:35.880
OK let's just come here and let's change it so you can see this color is being changed.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.080
So you can pretty well manage with which color you want to go with.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.650
And then you have to stick to it.

01:40.650 --> 01:46.950
So make sure that you just make some changes for the customization that it applies to every thing.

01:46.970 --> 01:52.650
Didn't I just come here to a single module and then change it so that you just choose one and then you

01:52.650 --> 01:53.300
stick to it.

01:53.340 --> 01:59.400
I'm just going to go with the purple one because I think I like it a bit and I'm just going to stick

01:59.400 --> 01:59.970
to it.

01:59.970 --> 02:01.790
OK so this is a kind of blue.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.280
OK.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.550
And I think it looks great so I'm going to go back KHRAIS here and then we have the topography settings

02:06.570 --> 02:11.330
so Harry can just work with the default team fonde and the heading text size.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.780
This is the heading text size.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.580
So change is going to increase it take and see this is being increased OK.

02:17.690 --> 02:20.210
And this is looking so cray cray.

02:20.210 --> 02:21.580
I love this.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.300
I'm just going to go with the normal one.

02:23.450 --> 02:24.290
OK.

02:24.290 --> 02:26.330
So then we have the body text size.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.540
OK we can increase or decrease it.

02:28.730 --> 02:29.210
OK.

02:29.210 --> 02:30.190
And then we have the heading.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.330
Einheit you guys already know about the line height spacing from the top the bottom the sides.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.890
So it can just increase it.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.130
Sorry sorry sorry.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.760
I'm just increasing the text size.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.570
I was just confused.

02:44.570 --> 02:45.380
What is happening.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.150
It is going to increase the line height and you can see the height from the top and the bottom is being

02:50.150 --> 02:51.320
increased.

02:51.650 --> 02:53.310
Then we have the body height as well.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.480
You can increase the body height if you want to.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.850
And you can see here right here.

02:58.850 --> 03:01.040
This is increasing.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.820
I'm just going to go with the default one right here and then we have the heading fun style.

03:04.820 --> 03:07.810
So everything is capitalized here.

03:07.940 --> 03:08.720
OK.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.310
Just click here you can see.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.740
Nothing is capitalized.

03:11.870 --> 03:13.250
And I came and underline it.

03:13.380 --> 03:13.910
OK.

03:13.910 --> 03:15.230
I can even make it a Telic.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.210
I'm just kidding.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.590
I'm not going to make it underline but it Telic looks fine to me.

03:19.910 --> 03:24.230
So I'm going to go down and then we have the heading on here you can choose how you want the fun to

03:24.230 --> 03:28.150
be so you can choose a different font you can choose anything from here.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.920
OK I can.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.670
I think this looks pretty cool.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.500
Break here.

03:33.690 --> 03:34.280
OK.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.460
I'm looked for is the font mean I liberate.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.670
I think this looks cool.

03:38.670 --> 03:39.500
This looks cool.

03:41.400 --> 03:41.790
OK.

03:41.950 --> 03:48.700
But this will only apply to the heading that the body takes the body text should be visible to us and

03:48.790 --> 03:49.870
easy to understand.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.860
And so I think it is looking closer.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.490
If I choose it pro

03:57.560 --> 04:04.810
the adventure looks cool but I think I should go with the default one because default font default one

04:04.900 --> 04:06.730
is more likely to read.

04:06.940 --> 04:12.310
OK so then we have the body link color the body Technicolor and everything you can manage it.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.740
So I hope you're understanding.

04:13.750 --> 04:19.350
And you guys already understand if you are watching my whole series of videos from from the top.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.380
So then we have the background color here you can manage the background color that hung in the background

04:23.380 --> 04:23.810
color.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.940
But I'm just going to be going up did you fold one or if you want to go with a more enhanced You can

04:27.940 --> 04:28.630
go with the hash tag.

04:28.640 --> 04:36.250
EBay EBAY and then ebay this is the one that I personally use and I like to use.

04:36.250 --> 04:42.780
So I'm just going to go with the publish and let's just go to the header in navigation settings here

04:42.780 --> 04:44.830
we can manage the Henrie navigation settings.

04:44.910 --> 04:50.620
You probably already know if you have word if you have created this web site I mean that is as tree

04:50.750 --> 04:52.760
complete there will be course dot com.

04:52.770 --> 04:57.310
This is exactly the same as this we can manage everything from here.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.190
OK.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.210
I'm just going to go to the head of format settings and you can see that we have the left right centered

05:03.210 --> 05:03.980
and everything.

05:04.020 --> 05:08.140
So I can select Sigurd's like the centered one and you can see this is now centered.

05:08.140 --> 05:12.540
So I'm just going to go with the left side because I think I like this and that would have height navigation

05:12.600 --> 05:13.420
until I crawl.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.650
So this is going to hide it.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.740
If I just crawl my page you can see the navigation is appearing.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.960
So you can pretty well do that if you want to but I think it looks unprofessional to not do that.

05:21.960 --> 05:26.950
OK then we have the primary menu bar settings here we can make it the full width if we want to.

05:27.030 --> 05:29.930
You can see this is now added this form.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.790
So I think it looks create them forward.

05:32.850 --> 05:37.440
We can also hide the logo image so I don't think so if logo image should be hidden.

05:37.590 --> 05:40.400
So this looks cool but I'm not going to make it full with.

05:40.440 --> 05:40.730
OK.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.420
I'm just going to go with the default one.

05:42.420 --> 05:45.820
And then we have the menu hide so we can increase the menu height as well.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.430
OK we can decrease it a bit.

05:47.460 --> 05:48.900
How much we want to decrease it.

05:49.020 --> 05:49.340
OK.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.420
I'm just going to go with the default one.

05:51.450 --> 05:54.800
And then we have the logo right so we can increase decrease the local height as well.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.880
And you're going to make it a little bit smaller so that it looks cool.

05:58.950 --> 06:02.660
And then I also want to increase decrease the size of that menu.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.860
I think it looks cool.

06:03.940 --> 06:06.170
Then we have the text size which is referring to this.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.980
We can also increase or decrease it.

06:09.350 --> 06:09.820
OK.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.430
And it's going to increase it more.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.430
This looks cool.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.400
Ok cool.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.430
And then we have the letter spacing so you can just go with the letter spacing as well.

06:21.470 --> 06:23.740
I'm going to go with Yvonne 0 1.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.800
OK and then we have the default font.

06:25.940 --> 06:29.480
And you can change it you can change that how you want it to be.

06:29.480 --> 06:32.420
You can also change to be a bio library.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.450
OK.

06:35.590 --> 06:39.130
So here can manage that text color and everything from here.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.540
The background color as well.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.380
OK so if you want to choose a different background you can go with that.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.580
But since you have chosen this one right here.

06:45.670 --> 06:51.880
One thing I should be going up with a bit of purple right here so you can see that this is how this

06:51.880 --> 06:54.890
is looking so make sure that you manage this with this as well a bit.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.500
And since this is right here than the full one so you can make it the full.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.160
But I don't think so Flegg the floor.

07:00.370 --> 07:04.320
So you have to make it a little bit Faid so that it is visible to me.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.720
OK.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.380
And then we have the Hoover link active colors.

07:08.410 --> 07:11.630
You can select this as well if you want it to be a different thing.

07:11.650 --> 07:16.030
So if we should make a change this is the default settings are looking cool.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.660
And then we have a text color right here.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.110
I think text color it needs to be more visible.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.490
This is now visible a bit.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.260
I think it was looking a bit cool.

07:26.290 --> 07:29.010
I'm just going to use it to be a little bit of create not the full.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.400
So this is looking pretty well right now.

07:31.540 --> 07:37.690
OK let's go down and then we have the dropdown menu active link color dropdown menu dropdown menu text

07:37.690 --> 07:38.330
color.

07:38.470 --> 07:39.030
OK.

07:39.070 --> 07:42.910
So we have this dropdown menu and text call or a drop down menu line color.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.610
OK this is the line colored here and everything.

07:45.610 --> 07:50.860
So we have the dropdown menu feeding from top so you can see this is changing.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.360
This is like this.

07:52.420 --> 08:01.730
Hey if you go to this skill in from center then you get to see this is also a trait thing that we have

08:01.900 --> 08:02.350
here.

08:02.510 --> 08:08.930
But I basically like slide in that slide in vertically Yes.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.750
I I just like this one.

08:10.750 --> 08:14.590
So I'm just going to select this one and then let's go ahead and let's safe right now.

08:14.770 --> 08:17.650
OK let's just go to this right here.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.310
Let's go to the second row menu bar settings.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.350
And here we have this one right here.

08:22.390 --> 08:30.270
You can manage the color if there so I'm going to be choosing a bit darker this OK and when you make

08:30.270 --> 08:35.370
it a little bit more darker so that it is visible to me I think it looks cool.

08:35.370 --> 08:36.920
It looks cool right now.

08:37.210 --> 08:38.450
Is it fully darker.

08:38.550 --> 08:43.400
OK I'm going to make it a little bit saying ok cool.

08:43.510 --> 08:44.020
OK.

08:44.040 --> 08:50.550
So you can see this is changing a bit and we have that text COLLAERY here is takes scholars also like

08:50.570 --> 08:53.800
this you can pretty well manage everything from here.

08:53.910 --> 08:58.960
You can see then we have the search card icon background color and everything from here.

08:58.970 --> 09:03.870
And we can manage it so we can also make it full with if you want to you can see this is now turned

09:03.870 --> 09:04.470
full of it.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.330
OK.

09:06.650 --> 09:08.460
So everything looks cool right here.

09:09.470 --> 09:09.910
OK.

09:10.060 --> 09:14.830
I'm going to go back right now and then we have the fix navigation fix navigation is basically this

09:14.840 --> 09:15.620
that is coming.

09:15.730 --> 09:20.060
So you can just come here to fix navigation and you can change the menu to be more light.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.050
And if you just go you can see this is increased.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.800
And if you go down this is like this.

09:23.800 --> 09:28.020
So you can also in this you can change the background color as well.

09:28.120 --> 09:35.730
OK I can make it full light if I want to and this is now changed to full right and I can make the text

09:35.730 --> 09:37.010
color to be black.

09:37.020 --> 09:40.640
So now if I go down you can see how this is gray.

09:40.710 --> 09:45.270
I'm going to choose the default one and the default one for the background cause I want it to be the

09:45.270 --> 09:45.720
default.

09:45.720 --> 09:52.350
So let's just make it a little bit of purple righ here so that it matches everything the blue looks

09:52.350 --> 09:53.260
cool as well.

09:53.430 --> 09:53.830
OK.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.430
But I don't want the blue.

09:55.530 --> 09:59.570
I want this to be the matching with this so it should match.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.070
I want it to be more purple.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.690
I like purple from here.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.690
Decrees.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.240
The Pasotti from here.

10:06.340 --> 10:10.430
I want to be more like blue.

10:10.600 --> 10:10.950
OK.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.950
So I can just get that code from here.

10:12.970 --> 10:13.960
Let's just come here.

10:14.020 --> 10:18.050
Let's just Krabbe decode color picker page active let's just Krabbe this code.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.890
OK and I want to paste it right here.

10:22.400 --> 10:22.830
OK.

10:23.010 --> 10:26.250
So let's go down and you can see that the color you means same color.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.390
OK what I'm going to do.

10:27.450 --> 10:32.340
Now I want to hit publish right now and I'm going to go back and there we have the header elements sitting

10:32.360 --> 10:39.660
so I mean here we can just show the social icons we can show that search bar and we can also show trending

10:39.660 --> 10:42.760
bars so I think I like this one this is so amazing.

10:42.780 --> 10:43.930
So I did not change it.

10:43.950 --> 10:44.950
OK.

10:45.060 --> 10:50.230
And if you want to remove the social icons you can remove them but I think it is a good way to add that.

10:50.370 --> 10:54.410
And you can get some followers and everything.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.050
Let's go back and let's go back and then we have the footer settings right here.

So we can manage it we can just increase the size.

11:36.510 --> 11:37.080
OK.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.900
And then we can also change the color and everything.

11:39.900 --> 11:45.330
So you can also make it seem like this if I just change the background color to be a bit of blue you

11:45.330 --> 11:46.730
can see it will be blue.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.240
I can make it feel like here it can increase the capacity.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.260
You can see this is changed to this.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.650
It can do very creative.

11:53.670 --> 11:56.160
You can do manage that how you want it to appear.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.610
So I think it looks cool right here.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.560
But this much color.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.080
OK.

OK.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.420
You can see this is black.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.830
You can increase the capacity and everything from here so you can see how this is changing.

12:30.830 --> 12:37.100
