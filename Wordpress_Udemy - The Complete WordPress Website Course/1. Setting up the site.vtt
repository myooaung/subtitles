00:00.390 --> 00:05.760
Hear what is up guys and what KMAX are now in this video we will be working up a Web ad management website

00:05.790 --> 00:10.430
or a classified Web site so if we just go to like Gumtree it's OK.

00:10.530 --> 00:15.900
We just come here and just we just go ahead and we hit enter so you can see this Gumtree is basically

00:15.900 --> 00:22.380
like an ad management website for you can just post your ads and then we can the surge and then they

00:22.380 --> 00:24.400
can just see OK this is the.

00:24.530 --> 00:25.640
Ok cool.

00:25.650 --> 00:30.270
They looked around the images and then they can see that this is the category of dad and then this is

00:30.270 --> 00:34.130
the description and then this will be like the user information as well.

00:34.260 --> 00:38.490
So he can just conduct them and then he can say OK you're just supposed to do an ad on Gumtree.

00:38.490 --> 00:39.120
I just saw it.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.640
Is it still available.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.250
Can I buy it as the price negotiate.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.410
So this is like that.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.940
We want to build a Web site like that.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.930
And in this video we're able to up at that so let's get started.

00:48.930 --> 00:51.930
First of all I have to just enter this site title so it is going to be like

00:55.410 --> 00:59.890
classified website OK.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.930
And then you have to enter your username

01:04.650 --> 01:05.880
and then you have to enter your password

01:10.910 --> 01:14.650
and then the e-mail address.

01:14.670 --> 01:18.150
Just it install a word press and it can see the word press should be installed.

01:18.170 --> 01:23.210
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to log in and you can see this board is here and it's going to go

01:23.210 --> 01:25.580
hit and I'm going to enter my log in details right now.

01:29.570 --> 01:35.650
Now let's just log in so you can see that I am in here and now here we have to work of say what we should

01:35.650 --> 01:37.830
do to get started.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.620
First of all we have to just come here and we have to just come here to the permalink right now and

01:41.620 --> 01:45.610
then we have to select the post name and then we have to just sit safe genius and he can see that we

01:45.610 --> 01:50.980
are done OK and then we need a specific team that we can install here.

01:51.160 --> 01:58.410
And then we can argue that he can see this is normal and say OK this team is a bit much costly OK this

01:58.420 --> 02:05.530
team is very much CAUSLEY So if you want it if if a client say that they want then they need an add

02:05.530 --> 02:09.650
management functionality into their website or something like that and then you can move on.

02:09.730 --> 02:13.620
So I'm just telling you this just because you can just create it.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.760
That is why I just thought why not just add it.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.070
So this team is a bit costly.

02:18.100 --> 02:22.320
This team will cost you like Athina sorry $69.

02:22.330 --> 02:25.140
This team is class-C press OK.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.390
This is the one you just open this up.

02:27.430 --> 02:32.340
You just search for classy presidency's WordPress classified ads thing.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.970
So this is how the team works.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.700
You can see everything is here.

02:35.710 --> 02:40.350
It has multiple pricing mode custom fields and farm membership packs.

02:40.630 --> 02:41.180
OK.

02:41.320 --> 02:47.260
And it has the custom add management fully customizable auto complete to just social networks log in

02:47.530 --> 02:50.620
and everything so it has so much of things that you can add.

02:50.890 --> 02:51.290
OK.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.710
But the team is a bit costly You can see 69 bucks for this is the lifetime license.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.190
OK.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.670
And unlimited websites to help and support.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.100
OK.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.850
And this which you have to buy it for just one time.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.390
And then you can just uploaded any viewer any viewer you want.

03:06.540 --> 03:07.050
OK.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.800
So this is how you can work with it.

03:09.090 --> 03:09.700
OK.

03:09.700 --> 03:17.470
And if you just go to themes right now you can see it has so many themes it has like Vin van daj it

03:17.470 --> 03:18.480

03:18.700 --> 03:20.530

03:21.130 --> 03:23.890
Ok so this is like a freelancer based.

03:23.890 --> 03:24.430
OK.

03:24.430 --> 03:27.580
So you can just work that is I'm just telling you about this at times.

03:27.590 --> 03:28.100
OK.

03:28.150 --> 03:29.980
You can just go with the business directory.

03:30.070 --> 03:32.710
You can go with a coupon Beeld based Web site.

03:32.860 --> 03:33.350

03:48.490 --> 03:52.130
So I'll be just moving on with this team you can see classified ads team.

03:52.150 --> 03:57.910
It's easy to set up and everything she just said by now and then you have to just buy this team.

03:57.910 --> 04:00.290
And after you buy it you have to just skim here.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.120
And then you have to upload it.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.810
I'm just going to go to dashboard right now and then I'm going to try to upload it.

04:06.810 --> 04:11.280
So let's just come here and let's just go to the plug ins sorry the themes and then let's go to the

04:11.280 --> 04:12.220
teams right now.

04:12.420 --> 04:17.910
So here we have to just click Add new and in here it'll take us to there and we have to upload the team

04:18.080 --> 04:19.310
let's just choose the file.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.400
It should be in the desktop.

04:20.580 --> 04:21.000
OK.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.190
We want to go down go down till I find this so

04:29.680 --> 04:32.120
it is uploaded on my desktop I just cannot see it.

04:36.570 --> 04:40.560
Classy classy press OK.

04:40.570 --> 04:44.960

04:45.260 --> 04:46.340
OK.

04:46.670 --> 04:47.700
I just got fed it.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.550
So this is right here.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.400
I'm just going to drag it frayed here.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.730
This is here I'm just going to come here now.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.520
And then here I'm going to upload it to.

04:54.770 --> 04:59.020
Let's just choose File let's just slide this and let's just search for classy press.

04:59.030 --> 04:59.990
This is right here.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.510
I'm not going to upload it and then I'm going to install now.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.980
So you can see this team is being installed right now.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.050
And after this is installed you can work with it.

05:09.050 --> 05:15.080
So if you do not if you just want to learn it then please guys don't just invest in it because this

05:15.080 --> 05:16.970
is just for testing purposes.

05:16.970 --> 05:20.090
And I just wanted to show you that you can't even create this Web site.

05:20.120 --> 05:25.280
So if a client comes to you and he sees that he needs a basic type of ad management web site then you

05:25.280 --> 05:30.850
can buy the team for him and he can tell him that we need to add more functionalities.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.300
And that is why we want to add this.

05:32.300 --> 05:38.020
But if Klein doesn't say anything and he does just need a simple say then do not go with that and I

05:38.030 --> 05:39.910
buy this because this is not worth it.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.930
Basically if you're doing it for yourself or if you have a project like this or if you need to submit

05:44.930 --> 05:48.590
a project for your university or something like that then you can move on with this.

05:48.610 --> 05:53.280
But otherwise I would recommend you not to do that so that you can see this is pretty well it's going

05:53.280 --> 05:57.000
to show the random ads and essays says it is the default created ads.

05:57.200 --> 06:02.480
If you just go to my first classified ads you can see how this is looking I say is this street city

06:02.480 --> 06:05.620
state country is it listed and expires.

06:05.630 --> 06:06.860
And here is a description.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.430
So here's everything.

06:08.510 --> 06:12.950
And if I just come here to Boston and you can see I can just come here and I can even create a listing.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.560
Here is the terms and conditions and everything.

06:15.590 --> 06:17.200
And here is the cost per listing.

06:17.200 --> 06:22.550
You can just select one so I can add free listing you can make for your listing based website and then

06:22.550 --> 06:27.710
you can make it famous So once it gets famous you can also put your ad and you can earn money if you

06:28.040 --> 06:31.600
are planning to basically earn money with this type of website.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.630
Then do go ahead.

06:32.630 --> 06:34.170
Do go ahead create your.

06:34.190 --> 06:41.840

06:41.840 --> 06:48.350
Web site so you can just like be like ads darte big company dord gone so big company big company will
