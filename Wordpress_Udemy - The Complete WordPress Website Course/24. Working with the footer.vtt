00:00.710 --> 00:04.910
What is it guys and what KMAX So we're going to be adding some lengths to the rate here.

00:04.940 --> 00:10.340
OK we're going to add some stuff and then we're also going to be working up the footer right here and

00:10.340 --> 00:11.760
this one right here.

00:11.810 --> 00:15.560
So let's get started first of all you have to just go to customize.

00:15.830 --> 00:20.750
And then we have to work with it to basically that's the footer and the header.

00:20.750 --> 00:26.990
We cannot edit this elementary but we can edit everything instead of that element.

00:27.030 --> 00:32.010
Tori OK inside the content area so

00:36.620 --> 00:37.400
here we go.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.290
You can see that we have our photo right here.

00:40.310 --> 00:46.190
We have full of widgets right here so you can see that we have our photo trade here.

00:46.220 --> 00:49.870
So if you want to show some photos it you can also show some for our budget.

00:49.880 --> 00:57.260
But since this is a normal web site or a personal web site that is why I don't think so that we need

00:57.260 --> 01:02.690
to add photo Brigitte's but we will be adding the photo of a later on but we will build another website

01:02.720 --> 01:04.830
and another company based Web site.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.400
OK so this is a personal web site.

01:06.410 --> 01:10.730
I didn't think so if it requires the footer visit so you can see that this line will be gone and this

01:10.750 --> 01:12.440
will look much better right now.

01:12.440 --> 01:12.950
OK.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.110
And now we have to go back and here is the bottom.

01:17.210 --> 01:17.570
OK.

01:17.630 --> 01:22.680
So what you can do you can change this so you can read here anything.

01:22.830 --> 01:23.620
Copyright

01:26.920 --> 01:28.840
copy right.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.430
And you can add the copyright time.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.250
Basically OK.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.310
Copy Right.

01:34.320 --> 01:38.790
So I'm going to add that copyright and that is going to be and O why.

01:39.020 --> 01:39.430
OK.

01:39.480 --> 01:44.830
And I'm going to add this to and see that it's that it gives the copyright signature right here.

01:44.860 --> 01:50.710
Can see and then I want to enter the name that is that that will be the site name that will be I and

01:50.880 --> 02:04.070
Ziel calm copyright and dot com 2017 and then it's going to be DSA designed

02:08.050 --> 02:16.960
web site design read and I want to have I want to enter a hard sign right here.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.760
So for this I want to go to the font awesome fund.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.760
Awesome dord I O.

02:23.950 --> 02:24.900
Slash icon.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.490
So you have to visit this website.

02:26.820 --> 02:27.200
OK.

02:27.310 --> 02:32.990
And then you have to search for the icon and that is going to be hard horror.

02:33.280 --> 02:33.670
OK.

02:33.730 --> 02:37.570
So I want to grab this one right here.

02:38.530 --> 02:38.920
OK.

02:38.960 --> 02:46.600
You have this girl I want to copy this code and I want to come here and I want to paste it right here.

02:46.600 --> 02:53.490
She can see that it says designed website design with lup Web site made it

02:58.090 --> 02:59.160
ok that's cool.

02:59.170 --> 03:01.890
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right now.

03:02.080 --> 03:02.680
And there we go.

03:02.680 --> 03:08.530
And now let's come here and let's view our website.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.750
So here we go you can see that this is how it is working.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.050
We have our this totally changed.

03:14.270 --> 03:16.060
And this is also coming right here.

03:16.100 --> 03:20.080
This is however upstaters looking say it is now full and final.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.260
And you can see everything is looking great.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.060
OK.

03:23.060 --> 03:30.500
So basically Velvel stop for a king with this website right now and Vitthal over another Web site in

03:30.500 --> 03:31.370
the next section.

03:31.370 --> 03:37.220
The reason is that we also want to add some Bateman's services there should be the dashboard for person

03:37.460 --> 03:44.310
who is hiring me and the person can also pay me by a credit card and be Bell our data bank transfer.

03:44.310 --> 03:49.480
So we will be adding that later on when we will be learning how to build e-commerce website.

03:49.490 --> 03:56.470
But this this was the section to tell you that how can you build a normal website normal static web

03:56.460 --> 04:03.450
site and you can see that this is the way that we have build is the best design no one will create websites

04:03.530 --> 04:08.270
for you with this design this is this website is build the best design and you can design it yourself.

04:08.270 --> 04:12.280
Now you can see that you have to just focus on single color.

04:12.300 --> 04:18.290
Make sure you can use different types of shades but you can see that V single color and this is how

04:18.590 --> 04:19.170
it is looking.

04:19.280 --> 04:19.790
OK.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.610
We have a different color right here.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.160
OK.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.340
We have black color but this is basically a crate I catching that is why I added this.

04:27.500 --> 04:34.160
OK so you can see that we we now know how to design a normal based one page website.

04:34.180 --> 04:40.230
So this is our one page website that we have designed in the next video will design a lot of say design

04:40.300 --> 04:45.280
business versus normal normal business web site and there will be also the blog functionality.

04:45.320 --> 04:51.830
Also built a total total blog website where there would be the fun full page home page for having the

04:51.830 --> 04:55.280
blog website then available online e-commerce store.

04:55.300 --> 05:00.320
You'll also build websites like Facebook will also build up site of a forum functionality where people

05:00.320 --> 05:08.510
can post question will also build a chat Web site and so many websites with this WordPress OK so stadium

05:08.590 --> 05:09.290
is for dad.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.000
But now we will stop it right now.

05:11.030 --> 05:18.020
OK so ill just go with another website and Vende Vivah learn how can we accept payments.

05:18.050 --> 05:22.690
Then I will also degrade Beaman functionality to this website later on.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.920
But you guys also have to stop this right now.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.120
Let's go to another Web site and build it.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.430
Say OK so now we are totally done with this website.

05:31.550 --> 05:33.920
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

05:33.950 --> 05:34.790
Stay tuned.

05:34.820 --> 05:35.850
