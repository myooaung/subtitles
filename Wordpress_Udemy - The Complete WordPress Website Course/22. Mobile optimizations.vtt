00:00.660 --> 00:07.990
What is getting engaged and so in this video we're going to be very king with our responsiveness.

00:08.000 --> 00:08.840
OK.

00:09.060 --> 00:14.250
What we want to do is that we want to make sure that a website looks good on mobile devices and also

00:14.270 --> 00:16.970
on side by side will also work for the pop up stuff.

00:16.970 --> 00:19.790
So this bubble should only open on mobile devices.

00:19.790 --> 00:24.170
Sorry the computer devices and this public should not be open on mobile devices.

00:24.170 --> 00:29.280
Else he the guy should be taken to the next page or the higher Me page.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.350
OK so let's get started.

00:30.350 --> 00:36.280
First of all what I have to do I have to just hit additivity elementary.

00:36.370 --> 00:36.870
OK.

00:37.010 --> 00:39.690
And here I want to add it to my website completely.

00:39.860 --> 00:44.970
OK so we want to make sure that a website looks good on mobile devices.

00:45.020 --> 00:45.550
OK.

00:45.590 --> 00:50.330
And what I will do I will just come here I'll just click this and I'm going to hit the tablet so I'm

00:50.330 --> 00:51.800
going to view the tablet mode.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.670
So this is how my website is going to look on tablet.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.040
I have my photo right here.

00:57.050 --> 01:01.880
I have my name I have about me and everything looks cool on tablet.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.410
OK.

01:03.860 --> 01:04.590
Yes.

01:05.770 --> 01:08.190
So we want to work with this on tablet mode.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.010
We want this to be good or bad.

01:11.020 --> 01:11.410
OK.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.360
So our name looks good.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.490
Our tagline looks good.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.220
Our burdens are old looking.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.220
But yes this is also looking good.

01:25.170 --> 01:29.570
Or we will just change it and we will give some more spacing right here.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.250
OK.

01:30.270 --> 01:32.110
And what I can do looks good.

01:32.550 --> 01:33.180
And follow me on.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.180
We want to change some things here.

01:35.310 --> 01:41.460
So for this what I want to do I have to just select select from here and then I have to just click here

01:41.460 --> 01:41.870
again.

01:41.940 --> 01:42.350
OK.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.030
And now what I have to do I just basically want to come here and I want to give to make some changes

01:48.030 --> 01:48.720
right here.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.530
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to click this guy right here and the settings are going to appear

01:52.810 --> 01:53.160
OK.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.460
So you can see that the tablet mode has been selected from here.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.920
I want to go to this style.

01:58.320 --> 01:58.800
OK.

01:58.950 --> 02:01.800
And here I can manage the size I can manage the batting.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.880
You can also manage the spacing so I am going to manage some spacing a bit.

02:05.910 --> 02:08.890
I want to increase the spacing right here and on tablet mode.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.160
I think this much spacing looks good.

02:11.280 --> 02:11.780
OK.

02:11.820 --> 02:15.860
And on computer it has this much on more on tablet.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.060
It has this much OK so you can also control the padding You can also control the size if you want to.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.620
But I think the size looks cool.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.870
Let's come here let's come here and let's just click this guy right here.

02:27.000 --> 02:27.400
OK.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.320
And

02:33.510 --> 02:35.740
let's come here to style.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.390
To advance

02:41.250 --> 02:43.200
column.

02:43.210 --> 02:45.790
OK so here I want to work the column right here.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.780
So you basically don't have to just click this which you have to come here and you have to make sure

02:49.780 --> 02:51.310
that you are in the column section.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.250
You have to edit this column.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.450
And we want to increase the size of this column.

02:55.450 --> 02:57.420
OK so I'll just increase it a bit

03:00.410 --> 03:00.780
OK.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.090
This looks cool.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.130
This looks cool.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.360
Yes.

03:07.760 --> 03:08.290
OK.

03:08.570 --> 03:09.980
This is Corey now.

03:10.070 --> 03:15.810
So what I want to do right now I want to go down and Burtis this guy right here.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.370
I want to click this I want to go to style.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.200
I want to change the size on tablet mode.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.080
You can see that the tablet is selected.

03:23.080 --> 03:23.810
I want a game here.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.380
I want it to be this much

03:29.090 --> 03:29.760
call.

03:29.890 --> 03:30.200
OK.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.830
So this is not a professional developer.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.750
I also want to decrease the size of the burden right here cause this is looking very much bigger.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.000
But if you refrigerate it to this.

03:40.030 --> 03:42.370
So I'm just going to decrease this ice a bit.

03:42.530 --> 03:42.910
So

03:47.830 --> 03:49.520
size looks good here.

03:49.550 --> 03:51.160
I want to decrease the line height

04:00.210 --> 04:01.450
OK.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.120
The line height should be more

04:09.630 --> 04:10.260
OK.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.950
Now this is looking cool.

04:21.070 --> 04:23.710
Now you can see that we are totally done.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.560
But this of

04:28.250 --> 04:32.770
our button or this tagline and everything and everything looks cool.

04:32.810 --> 04:33.210
OK.

04:33.380 --> 04:40.910
So let's come here and let's come here to the mall buy a mod and let's see how a replay looks on mobile

04:40.910 --> 04:41.810
device.

04:41.900 --> 04:47.060
So on mobile device you can see that we need to do a lot of customizations.

04:47.060 --> 04:47.540
OK.

04:47.630 --> 04:52.510
So we first need to get some spacing right here because this is going really very above.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.150
It will touch the logo right here.

04:54.170 --> 05:00.620
So I want to give some spacing to here oh just gives the spacing this whole column.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.640
So let's come here.

05:01.640 --> 05:06.440
Let's select this OK and let's go to the advance section and here we want to give some padding to the

05:06.440 --> 05:11.930
top so just make sure that you uncheck the values and then give the batting so I want to give some more

05:11.930 --> 05:12.860
padding.

05:13.430 --> 05:13.720
OK.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.790
This looks cool.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.330
I want to also change the name.

05:19.370 --> 05:27.510
I want to come here to style and for a mobile device I want to change the name to be this much OK.

05:27.740 --> 05:29.560
And this is looking cool.

05:29.570 --> 05:34.150
I want to just change it slightly a bit to that it looks normal.

05:34.610 --> 05:35.190
OK.

05:35.270 --> 05:40.610
And now here I just want to show both of the buttons right here because it will not look good.

05:40.850 --> 05:43.060
So I'll just show only single button right here.

05:43.070 --> 05:46.940
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to click this column.

05:46.940 --> 05:49.440
I'm just going to hit at it call them OK.

05:49.550 --> 05:56.120
And I want to go to the advance and here in the responsive DOB I just want to come here and I want to

05:56.120 --> 05:56.570
hit

06:05.050 --> 06:05.500
OK.

06:05.540 --> 06:09.240
I want to just select this one OK and I want to disable this.

06:09.260 --> 06:14.230
I want to disable this on mobile device so when I come here to advance this column is not working.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.840
So I just want to disable this button right here.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.600
Let's go to responsive and we want to hide this on MOBA.

06:20.930 --> 06:21.340
OK.

06:21.410 --> 06:25.040
So you can see that if I just click this this is hit right now.

06:25.520 --> 06:31.220
I want to come here to hire me button and this Higher me burden should be aligned to center on mobile

06:31.220 --> 06:32.010
devices.

06:33.820 --> 06:37.040
Let's go like this right now and you can see that this is how it is looking.

06:37.430 --> 06:37.670
OK.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.450
We have.

06:38.470 --> 06:39.030
We.

06:39.070 --> 06:44.830
This guy right here and we have her name and this logo is doing a problem.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.260
We'll do that as well to change it.

06:47.470 --> 06:47.870
OK.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.230
We go down and then we have this as well.

06:50.230 --> 06:51.990
So this is looking not good.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.320
Ok I'll show you.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.650
How can you change it.

06:55.120 --> 06:55.520
OK.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.630
And then we have this.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.120
This is looking cool.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.340
This is not looking good.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.440
This is not looking good.

07:01.710 --> 07:02.030
OK.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.560
So we have to do some customization more.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.880
OK let's get in here.

07:05.910 --> 07:06.580
Let's go down.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.770
And here we have this thing.

07:07.950 --> 07:18.620
So we want to do some changes right here so for immobile what we want to do is that we can not change

07:18.620 --> 07:18.850
it.

07:18.860 --> 07:25.170
Basically we have to do a lot of coding and there is a trick to do that for mobile devices for mobile

07:25.190 --> 07:29.020
this whole thing should be fully right.

07:29.150 --> 07:32.600
And that should be sorted fully blue and they should be right.

07:32.630 --> 07:33.100
OK.

07:33.170 --> 07:35.670
So I want to work with this one I'm going to do.

07:35.690 --> 07:37.330
I'm just going to come here.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.000
Analytical style.

07:41.290 --> 07:48.920
Come here and you can see that there is no option for mobile that we can not manage this on mobile.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.810
We cannot change this time.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.570
We can not change the location on mobile devices so there is no tab.

07:53.570 --> 07:58.190
So what we are going to do we're going to just go to the desktop version.

07:58.480 --> 07:58.990
OK.

07:59.240 --> 08:04.400
And if we want to just do one thing and that is to duplicate this section you can see that we have two

08:04.700 --> 08:05.880
sections right here.

08:05.900 --> 08:11.120
So we want to create one section for our desktop and then tablet.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.810
And the other section will be only for mobile devices OK.

08:14.960 --> 08:26.200
So for mobile what we want to do is we want this we want to just come here and pay and we want to change

08:26.320 --> 08:27.220
the background.

08:27.250 --> 08:33.030
We will be just one to Clairette OK sorry

08:38.370 --> 08:40.460
I want to come here to this section right here.

08:40.470 --> 08:48.540
I want to edit this section OK so I want to clear this basically just come here it is style and I wanted

08:48.540 --> 08:55.250
this to be a classic OK and let's come here and let's clear everything OK.

08:55.520 --> 09:01.800
And so OK we have about musicians coming right here.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.500
If I just click this you can see here are three.

09:05.530 --> 09:06.730
So I just want to come here.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.550
I want to delete one more right here.

09:09.380 --> 09:09.770
OK.

09:09.930 --> 09:14.330
This might be so confusing to you right now but you will understand what I am what I am talking about.

09:14.400 --> 09:20.610
So I just cleared the background from here and now let's see how this is going to look on mobile device.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.050
So I will just come here.

09:23.490 --> 09:25.340
OK I'll just come here to Mobile.

09:25.440 --> 09:25.900
OK.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.350
And you can see that on mobile.

09:27.350 --> 09:30.520
We will show this only we will hide this.

09:30.540 --> 09:30.950
OK.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.790
And on computer we will hide this only and we will show that.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.940
So how we were going to do this.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.570
Let's come here.

09:39.570 --> 09:40.990
Let's talk the dust up and.

09:41.250 --> 09:41.810
OK.

09:41.910 --> 09:45.510
And let's come here and let's select this section.

09:45.570 --> 09:45.800
OK.

09:45.810 --> 09:51.430
So we're going to edit this section.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.240
What I'm going to do.

09:52.270 --> 09:53.850
I'm just going to come here to advance.

09:53.890 --> 09:59.680
I want to go to responsive and this is going to be hit in on desktop and tablet.

09:59.890 --> 10:00.340
OK.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.860
And this is going to be hit in on

10:07.300 --> 10:08.290
Dumaguete one.

10:08.460 --> 10:08.980
OK.

10:09.070 --> 10:16.990
So you can see that this section will be hidden on mobile and this section will be hidden on desktop

10:17.050 --> 10:19.900
and that if I just open up right here you can see

10:24.440 --> 10:30.800
if I just get in here and I open up the tablet mode and then I click this and again see

10:35.520 --> 10:37.730
I want to go to the mobile version right here.

10:38.720 --> 10:46.180
I click this let's go down let's go down down and you can see that or that section that mobile line

10:46.420 --> 10:47.510
has been hidden.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.150
OK.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.520
So this is being hidden.

10:49.660 --> 10:54.640
And this is coming right here because we have hidden that on the mobile.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.240
OK.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.460
So I want to get him here.

10:56.500 --> 11:00.820
I just want to get him here to see if we have if that is working as well.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.210
So let's come here to responsive.

11:02.380 --> 11:07.060
So this will be hidden on the stump and this will be hidden on tablet both as well.

11:07.060 --> 11:12.270
So if I just open up the tablet mode and then I click this you can see that this is not hiding it but

11:12.270 --> 11:14.950
it will basically hide on tablet.

11:14.950 --> 11:15.510
So

11:22.800 --> 11:26.910
let's here let's say let's come here and let's view our page

11:31.160 --> 11:31.910
OK.

11:32.110 --> 11:40.060
You can see that this is normally working here and this section that we have added for Mumbai is only

11:40.300 --> 11:45.850
will only be available for only work on mobile device if I just small my screen you can see that this

11:45.850 --> 11:51.240
is changing this is changing and if the mobile version appears this section is automatically disabled

11:51.670 --> 11:53.040
and this is basically going.

11:53.050 --> 11:55.630
So this is this is the video that is used for mobile devices.

11:55.630 --> 11:56.080
OK.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.390
So this is how you can work on mobile devices.

11:58.390 --> 12:02.140
And if this increases you can see that this white version is coming.

12:02.140 --> 12:06.720
This line version this line version and once it goes right you can see this has changed.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.350
So this is outrageous.

12:08.500 --> 12:08.910
OK.

12:08.980 --> 12:16.600
Now what I want to do I want to come down and let's go to the mobile section because we're working on

12:16.600 --> 12:18.060
mobile right now.

12:18.790 --> 12:19.720
OK.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.630
Mobile.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.640
Now let's go down let's go down.

12:22.710 --> 12:23.990
And here we have the follow me on.

12:23.990 --> 12:29.720
So I wanted to create the size unfollow me on so much.

12:29.820 --> 12:36.690
I want to increase this that I want to come here and manage this right now.

12:36.830 --> 12:41.480
So when I go to the style I want to go to the site and I wanted to create the a bit.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.640
OK I want to go to the padding and I want to decrease the batting.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.690
Let's just increase the batting.

12:47.120 --> 12:47.800
OK.

12:47.810 --> 12:48.950
The spacing

12:54.330 --> 12:56.010
spacing is fine OK.

12:56.130 --> 12:58.750
So you can see how this is looking we can also decrease the size a bit

13:08.540 --> 13:09.160
OK.

13:09.170 --> 13:10.150
Now this looks cool.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.200
OK so I also want to decrease some spacing right here.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.800
So I want to come here to advance.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.940
Basically I want to edit this whole section.

13:17.950 --> 13:20.570
So I want to come here to advance and

13:25.500 --> 13:28.870
get Let's come here to Mobot right now and let's decrease some betting.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.970
So from top I want it to be 15 pixels and.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.170
OK I went and checked this

13:40.320 --> 13:46.200
and for bottom I want to increase it and this much only 22 22 pixel 20 pixel from bottom.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.600
OK this looks cool.

13:47.610 --> 13:50.070
Now I want to go down and I want to edit this guy right here.

13:50.310 --> 13:51.630
So I want to go to style.

13:51.660 --> 13:57.020
I want to go to space and I want to select it this much.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.780
So I think we need to increase it a bit much.

14:04.610 --> 14:10.240
Need a professional developer OK.

14:10.400 --> 14:15.150
I think that just looks cool because we need the fun to be a little bit bigger.

14:15.260 --> 14:18.470
So we also want to go and increase the line height.

14:23.350 --> 14:24.330
Yes.

14:25.510 --> 14:36.500
That's like school letters spacing should be normal you need a professional developer or spacing should

14:36.500 --> 14:38.000
be below this.

14:38.000 --> 14:38.960
Ok cool.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.660
Now you can see that this is used for mobile devices.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.420
OK.

14:42.440 --> 14:48.170
Now if I just save my this thing and I want to open this up this website on a mobile device you're going

14:48.170 --> 14:50.720
to see how this is going to look.

14:51.170 --> 14:51.680
OK.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.130
So I'm just going to say I'm just smelling it up.

14:55.700 --> 14:56.810
And this is my mobile device.

14:56.810 --> 14:57.650
OK.

14:57.650 --> 15:01.040
I go down I go down and this is my thing this is my name.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.500
This is my higher me.

15:02.570 --> 15:05.170
So if I just open it up you can see that this is the plug.

15:05.180 --> 15:10.820
This is coming but I don't want the viewers to see the pop up so I'll just disable this pop up I'll

15:10.820 --> 15:14.700
show you how can disable pop up on mobile devices later on.

15:14.870 --> 15:21.430
OK then we have the about me section we have h TMLC says and what I can do.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.460
Follow me on it's looking good.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.530
Need a professional developer and hire me.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.080
Everything looks amazing right here.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.890
You can see that this is how this plug in rates you can also do the mobile optimization.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.780
That is why I really love this.

15:33.790 --> 15:38.530
And if you go to if you go with any of the other team you you we're not going to get this functionality.

15:38.570 --> 15:42.990
That is why I always recommend my students to go with this ocean.

15:43.140 --> 15:43.680
OK.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.740
And just plug in this plug in is doing the job.

15:45.730 --> 15:48.800
Not this team you can use just plug into any of the team.

15:48.900 --> 15:49.180
OK.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.150
Basically this plug in is doing the job.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.440
OK.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.360
So this plug in is called a mentor.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.720
There is also a pro version.

15:55.740 --> 15:59.290
I will also show you later on that why you should shift to pro-women.

15:59.310 --> 16:02.320
You can buy that shows I'm using my affiliate.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.480
OK so a little bit later on I'll show you now.

16:05.610 --> 16:06.290
OK.

16:06.570 --> 16:10.600
You can see everything is totally done now.

16:11.770 --> 16:17.380
I want to just sit it safe and I can see that we are totally done with this page customization mobile

16:17.380 --> 16:18.400
optimization.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.420
I'm just going to come here.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.190
I'm going to hit go to dashboard.

16:21.190 --> 16:25.990
I don't want to change the settings for the next page that I have so we have two pages basically right

16:26.020 --> 16:26.970
now.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.400
OK the other page is hire me.

16:29.590 --> 16:30.230
I want to game here.

16:30.250 --> 16:36.110
I'm going to hit that element or.

16:36.240 --> 16:42.270
And now here you see we want to go to the tablet mode to let's see what is.

16:42.270 --> 16:44.880
How is it looking on tablet tablet is fine.

16:45.010 --> 16:46.950
And the mobile is not fine.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.870
So when I'm mobile we want to go restyle.

16:49.030 --> 16:52.560
We want to go to the site so you can see that the mobile version is selected.

16:52.690 --> 16:57.580
I want to increase the size to be this save and there we go.

16:57.580 --> 17:01.510
Are there spaces automobile optimized so you can see that mobile optimization is very easy.

17:01.510 --> 17:07.040
First you have to make sure that you focus on your website creation and then you have Absurdistan.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.290
You can get the mobile optimizations.

17:09.290 --> 17:13.740
Let's go ahead and let you go to dashboard now we're totally done in the next video we'll be working

17:13.750 --> 17:21.820
up the pop up thing that how to disable pop up on mobile devices and on tablet.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.290
No not not the tablet.

17:23.290 --> 17:29.710
So pop up for good on tablet but there should be no pop up on mobile devices so if someone says he should

17:29.710 --> 17:35.590
be taken to that page and if someone clicks on desktop a pop up should appear so.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.560
So like I said watching this in the next video.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.610
Phil move on with that by.
