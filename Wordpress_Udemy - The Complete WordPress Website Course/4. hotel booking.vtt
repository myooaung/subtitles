WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:07.320
What is up guys and what KMAX are now in the studio we will be working up good like if we want to build

00:07.990 --> 00:09.560
like a hotel booking thing.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.550
OK so then how we want it to be.

00:11.550 --> 00:14.710
So first of all what we have to do is that we need to add a new product.

00:14.730 --> 00:15.090
Okay.

00:15.090 --> 00:19.710
And then we have to work with it to first of all we have to enter the hotel booking so Lesbos that this

00:19.800 --> 00:20.910
is the hotel name.

00:20.910 --> 00:24.670
So this is buu Calo hotel.

00:24.870 --> 00:25.490
OK.

00:25.570 --> 00:29.980
And let's suppose that this is the hotel room and I want to just go ahead and I want to sign the product

00:29.980 --> 00:34.690
demand so product image is going to be let's just go ahead and let's add an image so I'm just going

00:34.690 --> 00:35.610
to add

00:38.390 --> 00:39.830
I said this one.

00:40.100 --> 00:40.630
OK.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.200
And now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit said product.

00:43.220 --> 00:44.860
So on just clicking it.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.420
You can see it's Filby here and everything is here.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.920
So this is like to call a hotel.

00:51.030 --> 00:51.440
OK.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.510
And we have the categories so we can at any category like hotels or something like that.

00:55.770 --> 00:58.380
OK but we don't want to add any of the category here.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.950
I just want to come here and I want to slight.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.100
I'm like bookable product.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.690
OK.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.750
And since this is a virtual product OK that is why I have to select that this is the virtual product.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.250
OK.

01:08.430 --> 01:15.210
And on one single room we want to assign this to a maximum person like only for a maximum person can

01:15.210 --> 01:16.010
live in a room.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.470
If they go beyond that we don't want we don't allow it.

01:19.470 --> 01:23.740
So our policy doesn't allow it so we can just add it like it has persons.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.040
OK.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.210
There would be some for a child for a child.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.400
We would charge him more.

01:29.460 --> 01:29.850
Oh sorry.

01:29.850 --> 01:34.580
For adults we will charge more for child people charge him like less.

01:34.590 --> 01:38.880
OK so we will be giving the pricing on the basis of the person.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.460
OK we will not be charging on the basis of the blocks.

01:41.490 --> 01:44.550
We will not be charging on the basis of the rooms he types.

01:44.550 --> 01:48.610
We will charge extra for different types of resources that he adds.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.720
OK but we will be charging basically on the person basis like how many adults they have and then how

01:54.720 --> 01:56.750
many children that have.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.310
OK.

01:57.360 --> 02:05.470
And then we have to worry that the has resources so you can be like a basic bedroom or for like normal

02:05.470 --> 02:10.660
bedroom or for like a business room or a luxury room or something like that so I'm just going to check

02:10.660 --> 02:12.580
this as well.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.330
I'm sorry.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.490
So now here we have this one right here.

02:16.690 --> 02:21.250
So this is going to be on the daily basis like on days bases and then we have the fixed blocks.

02:21.260 --> 02:27.480
Now the customer can define how many times how many blocks you want so this is right here.

02:27.700 --> 02:33.370
And that booking duration is going to be like on one day basis and the minimum duration the minimum

02:33.370 --> 02:42.310
duration is going to be like it's the minimum duration is going to be like one and the maximum duration

02:42.650 --> 02:45.230
is going to be 30 days or anything.

02:45.310 --> 02:50.600
I don't think so how how many time a family stays in a hotel.

02:50.650 --> 02:55.180
I would say 15 if the if if they wanted to stay in like 30 days.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.680
They would just buy a room.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.210
They would just rent a room.

02:58.210 --> 03:00.780
So I think 15 days maximum.

03:00.790 --> 03:01.910
They do not go beyond that.

03:01.930 --> 03:06.070
But if you want it to be like 30 days you can go out but no one chooses this.

03:06.110 --> 03:10.120
So is you that this is Turkey.

03:10.420 --> 03:13.630
So then we have enabled calendar range bigger.

03:13.630 --> 03:17.880
Let the user select a start and the date on the calendar.

03:18.100 --> 03:23.360
OK start and end date on the calendar duration will be calculated dramatically.

03:23.740 --> 03:28.840
What this means is that if I just select this OK and then I just come here and I just publish it right

03:28.840 --> 03:29.290
now.

03:29.460 --> 03:29.760
OK.

03:29.770 --> 03:32.810
And let's just open this product up in a new tub.

03:32.980 --> 03:38.800
So let me show you then you will see that once you open up the product and you'll see that I can select

03:39.160 --> 03:43.560
a start date and then I can select and engage if I just select 22 right now.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.160
OK.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.150
And then I can select and date right here.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.460
I'm going to select here like three.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.450
So it's going to be like from 22 to 3 is booked.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.020
OK.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.990
But I have to select the type that is why the pricing is not coming so we will be working up and that's

03:58.170 --> 04:01.260
the price and the type later on and we'll move forward.

04:01.270 --> 04:01.620
Okay.

04:01.720 --> 04:08.160
So we are charging him from like he has to disliked the first two player selection as needed.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.000
So we just like it like he needed from 2 to choose.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.380
And so my and it is going to be 23.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.340
So his booking will be from 20 22nd to 23.

04:17.530 --> 04:20.050
He can just like it from 20 to 22nd.

04:20.320 --> 04:20.680
Okay.

04:20.830 --> 04:22.960
So this is for just one single day.

04:23.470 --> 04:24.550
So this is it works.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.180
OK.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.920
But I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go down and this is what I can see that enabled calendar

04:29.920 --> 04:34.700
range pick or that customer can select his own star day and the day.

04:34.720 --> 04:41.710
Obviously obviously you guys should be selected because you cannot assume this that the person will

04:41.710 --> 04:43.760
stay on that day or that day.

04:43.870 --> 04:46.440
So customers should have to select his own start date.

04:46.440 --> 04:52.870
So if you just selected like 29 tentatively 22nd from 29 and if he so like 27 and it will be like 27

04:52.870 --> 04:53.480
to 30.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.890
So these are the dates that he is booking right now.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.940
So this is how this range will work.

04:59.130 --> 04:59.610
OK.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.950
Make sure that you guys go ahead.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.040
Just guys create it like this and then you publish your product and then just play around with it.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.180
So then you will understand it easily.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.750
OK what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and here and say is an e-book calendar.

05:12.790 --> 05:13.230
Great.

05:13.270 --> 05:13.620
OK.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.530
And then we have Kolender display this should be all this was about you guys already know about this

05:17.530 --> 05:20.750
so I won't explain it but did not check this.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.970
If you want my opinion.

05:24.070 --> 05:24.390
OK.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.720
And then we have the person.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.360
So in the person it's like minimum person are the maximum person so minimum person should be obviously

05:31.360 --> 05:35.250
one like there should be a one single person staying in our room.

05:35.410 --> 05:35.970
OK.

05:36.040 --> 05:41.740
And then we have the maximum person maximum person will make how many how any person can stay in this

05:41.740 --> 05:43.400
specific hotel room.

05:43.500 --> 05:43.870
OK.

05:43.990 --> 05:52.390
So the maximum person can stay five maximum prison already think three free maximum person and that's

05:52.390 --> 05:53.270
all OK.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.310
And then we have to multiply all cost by person count.

05:57.700 --> 06:05.530
So this means that if you just select it then all the cost that we have for one single room then that

06:05.530 --> 06:08.870
will be very as like it will multiply on the basis of person.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.250
So you can select it.

06:10.380 --> 06:10.830
OK.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.960
If you want to but let's just go ahead and let's say like that.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.770
OK.

06:14.980 --> 06:19.210
Multiply all costs by person count count person as booking.

06:19.210 --> 06:23.670
I'll tell you later on and enabled the person types let's just come here and let's just uncheck this

06:23.680 --> 06:24.750
resources Stob.

06:24.970 --> 06:25.220
OK.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.650
People will be understanding this later on.

06:26.650 --> 06:31.060
But first let's just work for the person so that there is no confusion that you guys face.

06:31.090 --> 06:31.520
OK.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.220
And then we're going to come here to block cost and block costs is going to be like $50.

06:36.310 --> 06:36.750
OK.

06:36.850 --> 06:40.010
And then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit a date.

06:40.350 --> 06:46.950
So on this date let's go ahead and let's just refresh this page and see what we have selected.

06:46.950 --> 06:55.110
Let me show you first of all we have to select a start date and an end date so presume is basically

06:55.820 --> 06:56.120
Henry.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.500
So we have chosen two rooms.

06:57.510 --> 06:58.210
OK.

06:58.290 --> 06:59.960
And then we have the booking cost.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.260
So my booking cost is like hundred bucks.

07:02.340 --> 07:05.800
If I just come here and I just increase it you can see that I have two persons.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.580
That is why the booking cost is basically two hundred dollars.

07:09.630 --> 07:14.040
If I just selected to be like three person the booking costs will be $300 because I've chosen three

07:14.040 --> 07:18.090
rooms two rooms if I just come here and I just select this one single room.

07:18.390 --> 07:21.570
Then the booking caused is going to be like we're only 150 bucks.

07:21.570 --> 07:22.030
OK.

07:22.140 --> 07:25.320
Because I'm just charging for one single room and it has the person.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.790
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to go with 3 3 3.

07:27.860 --> 07:30.090
The price of this is just costing now.

07:30.330 --> 07:38.210
But if we need like a children and an adult category in here so that for a person like for adults we

07:38.230 --> 07:40.160
will charge them $15.

07:40.290 --> 07:43.440
And for children we want to charge them like $25.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.820
How can we do that.

07:45.050 --> 07:45.530
OK.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.390
Or phone like $15 or $10 or free.

07:48.650 --> 07:49.040
OK.

07:49.140 --> 07:55.230
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to go down here and now here I have to just come here to

07:55.230 --> 07:56.640
the persons.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.140
So here is the cost.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.090
We don't have to mention anything because you will be charging on the person type if you just check

08:03.090 --> 08:03.990
this on.

08:04.020 --> 08:06.400
Then we have to remove the cost from here.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.110
OK I will show you why I mean this.

08:09.120 --> 08:09.580
OK.

08:09.650 --> 08:14.030
I'm just going to come here and I'm not going to multiply all caused by the person count.

08:14.230 --> 08:15.090
No I I'm not.

08:15.150 --> 08:18.710
I'm not going to multiply because I'm charging on the person type.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.500
I'm not charging on the cost.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.400
Since we have two cost that is why I'm just going to come here.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.380
I'm just going to remove it and make sure that you don't check this one.

08:26.490 --> 08:26.930
OK.

08:26.970 --> 08:29.090
And then we have the Enable person types.

08:29.100 --> 08:29.300
OK.

08:29.310 --> 08:32.010
I just come here and I just want to add a person died.

08:32.130 --> 08:36.810
So I just one two person died basically I'm just going at it one more so you can see I have person type

08:36.810 --> 08:43.740
you know and person type 1 so type zero is going to be like adult.

08:43.800 --> 08:48.170
So if it's an adult then you'll charge him $50.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.060
OK $50 Filby per block cost.

08:51.090 --> 08:51.570
OK.

08:51.720 --> 08:59.190
And if that guy is basically a child then we will charge him $25.

08:59.650 --> 09:00.140
OK.

09:00.210 --> 09:10.300
And if that guy is in fact like from one to two years from like a newborn baby to two ears OK.

09:10.350 --> 09:10.830
In fact

09:14.030 --> 09:16.560
charging like $10.

09:16.610 --> 09:19.560
So now we have to give the description.

09:19.720 --> 09:27.910
See here we can right here 18 plus people OK and in here I want to add like

09:31.800 --> 09:39.910
from 2 to 17 years age old people.

09:40.180 --> 09:40.530
OK.

09:40.660 --> 09:43.410
So you can just describe it how you want it to be okay.

09:43.420 --> 09:53.610
And then we have the infant so infant mean newborn to two years.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.500
OK.

09:54.680 --> 10:00.410
And now we're going to go ahead an I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit a date right now

10:00.500 --> 10:05.390
so you can see that we are charging them on the basis of this person type only.

10:05.390 --> 10:08.360
OK we are not charging them on the cost.

10:08.690 --> 10:08.990
OK.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.740
The cost is zero by default.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.990
OK.

10:11.990 --> 10:16.230
The person is increasing the price will increase the cost will be seen.

10:16.370 --> 10:18.950
OK let's give here and let's just the first page

10:22.100 --> 10:26.530
now you can see heritage is adult so we have 18 plus people so you can research.

10:26.560 --> 10:31.610
18 plus and from two years to do this in newborn to two years.

10:31.610 --> 10:38.270
So for adults so let's suppose that I have fun single adult OK and the child that are staying in my

10:38.270 --> 10:39.840
home are less.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.710
Let's suppose that I have just one adult.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.310
And I'm just staying in the room.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.790
So I just select a first date to my first date is 22.

10:47.030 --> 10:47.520
OK.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.480
And my second date is also 22.

10:49.490 --> 10:52.610
I just want to book the room for just a single day.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.120
Then this is charging me for just like $50.

10:56.120 --> 11:02.270
The reason is that if you just go to person and then we go to adult then I can see that if adult is

11:02.270 --> 11:07.220
set to one and then we have the block cost per block cost per block cost.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.560
This is set to 1.

11:08.570 --> 11:15.500
This is why this is charging me $50 if I just increase it and if I just take it too you can see it will

11:15.500 --> 11:17.990
charge me double because this is charging me to block cost.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.680
OK let's just come here and let's just make it one single.

11:20.890 --> 11:21.600
OK.

11:22.130 --> 11:27.990
And if I just increase the adult reading and see two adults who are here and single blocks of two adults.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.710
Cost is being multiplied.

11:30.010 --> 11:30.770
OK.

11:30.860 --> 11:34.650
And if the child is increased.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.330
OK.

11:35.450 --> 11:40.820
If there is only one single child who is from 2 to 17 years then will charge him $25.

11:41.000 --> 11:41.560
OK.

11:41.900 --> 11:48.680
And if there isn't in fact OK he is just coming to stay in our hotel you can see in fact cannot come

11:48.680 --> 11:49.320
itself back.

11:49.340 --> 11:49.960
OK.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.430
Then they'll charge him $10.

11:51.440 --> 11:57.590
But since only adults will also be coming from him that I will select adults so you can see it's all

11:57.590 --> 11:57.970
charge.

11:57.980 --> 12:01.340
It all costs like in fans plus adult.

12:01.610 --> 12:03.140
And then it is given the total amount.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.500
So this is how it works basically.

12:04.530 --> 12:07.380
Guys we don't have any of the child right here with us.

12:07.850 --> 12:09.590
So this is aardvarks.

12:09.620 --> 12:16.280
Now what I'm going to do right now if if if and if if I just add the block cost here as well.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.550
It should be zero guys.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.630
I'm telling you why you need to enter a deal.

12:19.790 --> 12:26.470
If you enter the block cost here as well 50 OK and then you just come here and then you just set a date

12:27.890 --> 12:35.690
and on just refreshing you will see that the door is a room booking basically the room cost $50.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.940
And if there is an infant then we will just add him in here.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.200
So this is just dumb.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.020
I don't think so.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.400
If it is good for you so you have to select the adult and the adults will be added into here.

12:47.530 --> 12:52.690
And the Geiser like this reasoning can see this is costing him just $100.

12:52.690 --> 13:01.630
The reason is that the base prices this OK this is the block cost and also the cost is also being added

13:01.730 --> 13:02.550
Weimann by.

13:02.560 --> 13:08.170
We just want to charge them on the basis of the people those who are trying to stay in the hotel.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.980
So we want to charge them on that.

13:09.980 --> 13:15.910
So I'm just going to go ahead and if you don't want to charge them on the bases of the people those

13:15.910 --> 13:17.010
who want to stay in.

13:17.390 --> 13:17.880
OK.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.490
If you want to charge them on the basis of that just a single room.

13:21.490 --> 13:27.650
So if you are just buying a single room OK then you have to pay only $50 for one single light.

13:27.670 --> 13:28.770
We don't care about theirs.

13:28.780 --> 13:33.910
We don't care about they don't care about this but we want to know that how many people are saying OK

13:34.210 --> 13:38.530
then if this is the condition then you have to come here and have to come here and you have to just

13:38.530 --> 13:39.470
like this.

13:39.880 --> 13:40.320
OK.

13:41.870 --> 13:46.010
You have to go down you have to come here and you have to remove it and you have to come here.

13:46.080 --> 13:51.680
You have to remove it so you can see that maximum person are alive three that I come here and I just

13:51.680 --> 13:52.380
sit a day.

13:52.550 --> 13:56.200
This is also the policy of some of the hotels like you just booked to.

13:56.390 --> 13:56.920
OK.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.380
And then you have to pay for a room.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.440
They don't care about that.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.450
How many people are staying in here.

14:01.610 --> 14:02.530
They just care about you.

14:02.570 --> 14:03.050
OK.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.230
So if I just increase the adult like three adults are coming in here.

14:06.330 --> 14:06.670
OK.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.950
And I want to charge Dan like this one.

14:08.960 --> 14:14.160
So they will just charge $50 just for a single room that you are buying grade.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.440
This is what I mean guys.

14:16.490 --> 14:16.910
OK.

14:17.090 --> 14:22.250
And now let's come here and let's come here to the person.

14:22.550 --> 14:28.180
So if he disliked multiply all cost by person and then it would be multiplied to three.

14:28.580 --> 14:28.990
OK.

14:29.120 --> 14:35.470
And if he selected this kown person as booking and a discount to each person as a booking unit the max

14:35.470 --> 14:36.160
booking per account.

14:36.170 --> 14:42.350
This will be applied to that if we select tree then there will be three bookings counted.

14:42.470 --> 14:45.410
Only one single people can stay in our room.

14:45.440 --> 14:50.840
So if I just come here and I just refresh it you can see I just added like three.

14:51.060 --> 14:57.640
And I just come here and I just saw like this and I just enter this there is a maximum of one place

14:57.680 --> 15:03.690
remaining on December of this so you can see it is just showing an error because we have the availability.

15:04.100 --> 15:04.690
OK.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.280
We have said that maximum booking per days is set to 1.

15:07.280 --> 15:12.290
If I just come here and I just increase it to three that three bookings can be done on this.

15:12.290 --> 15:19.760
So if he just selected like three adults three person and then he can see that the booking will be raised

15:19.760 --> 15:21.650
separately for that for them.

15:21.650 --> 15:25.610
So if I just come here and I just selected and I just selected again that he can see the booking cost

15:25.670 --> 15:30.580
is this but the booking separate template tepid booking three bookings are being done here.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.360
So I have to multiply the cost.

15:32.390 --> 15:40.430
If I am choosing this one because there are three bookings being done here that everybody will be given

15:40.550 --> 15:46.420
a separate room fee if if we need this type of functionality in this specific form.

15:46.610 --> 15:50.880
So I I hope that you don't have any of that confusion here.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.030
Let me explain you guys.

15:52.040 --> 15:52.500
OK.

15:52.670 --> 15:56.240
So we have chosen that count person as booking.

15:56.420 --> 16:01.970
How many person they have that will be counted as bookings so far booking the booking means the room

16:02.560 --> 16:06.030
since we are giving Jim just a single room for one person.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.890
If there are two person then we are giving him two rooms.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.440
So we have to multiply the cost because we are giving them two rooms OK.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.260
And then I just come here and I just refresh and I just set a date

16:21.060 --> 16:29.430
to come here and it's just refreshed this so you can see on increasing this and why I'm here and I just

16:29.480 --> 16:35.250
like this and I want to like this so I can see cause disease.

16:35.430 --> 16:36.190
I just come here.

16:36.360 --> 16:41.730
I just read book now and it is right here and it's going to come here and in the view Cardigan's can

16:41.730 --> 16:47.320
see adultery and every adult will be given a specific crew.

16:47.640 --> 16:55.080
OK so this will be deducted from our availability things that we are giving only to the blog for Max

16:55.080 --> 17:02.160
booking but a block like we have three rooms then we want three people to just come into our hotel on

17:02.220 --> 17:03.340
a single day.

17:03.380 --> 17:03.820
OK.

17:03.930 --> 17:04.960
We can not go beyond that.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.720
So everybody is fed and no one can.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.980
Come into here.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.060
This is what I mean.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.810
I hope I'm clear to you guys.

17:11.880 --> 17:17.560
You can just come here you can just bring your out here you can do this and just read it here and there.

17:17.690 --> 17:19.230
And I hope it will be clear to you.

17:19.250 --> 17:29.530
But I will be going up Fifth and mostly hotels do have the policy that they charge damn on this one.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.580
OK they don't charge the cost OK.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.160
We come here to the person we come here two days.

17:36.170 --> 17:42.320
Then they charge them for adults so if it is like a plane booking OK then you want it to be like Koun

17:42.320 --> 17:43.780
person as booking.

17:44.030 --> 17:44.570
OK.

17:44.570 --> 17:50.090
So then you want it to be like kown versus booking that if a guy is coming in here they want to charge

17:50.090 --> 17:50.960
them as a booking.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.970
So a person can just come here and then the blockbuster will be like this so we will be creating a new

17:55.970 --> 17:57.200
product for that plane.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.990
OK but first we want to go with this one.

18:00.100 --> 18:00.520
OK.

18:00.620 --> 18:06.380
I want to come here and I want the type to be homeless come here and let's go to the cost and we are

18:06.380 --> 18:09.710
charging them for just $100 per single room.

18:09.830 --> 18:13.990
Whether they are child whether they are whatever or we don't care ok.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.500
We just want to charge them about the single room and.

18:16.580 --> 18:24.900
And in one single room they are given three max person OK they can not go beyond that.

18:25.090 --> 18:25.980
Then we have the cost.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.810
So the cost is selected on this.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.430
OK.

18:28.430 --> 18:32.300
And then we have a dealing product so we don't want to link any product you guys already know about

18:32.300 --> 18:35.110
this up sales and cross-sell and then we have the availability.

18:35.540 --> 18:39.650
Okay so we have since we have three Doomsville are just selecting three tunes but we have hundred rooms

18:39.650 --> 18:40.450
Let's suppose.

18:40.610 --> 18:42.460
Okay let's just check it to be like one.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.280
We have just only one single room so that we can also test it.

18:45.600 --> 18:45.890
Okay.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.660
And minimum block booking should be one.

18:48.840 --> 18:49.100
OK.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.570
And this should be like six months or so.

18:50.570 --> 18:54.140
So a person can book anything.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.740
Book our room six month before.

18:56.810 --> 18:57.050
OK.

18:57.050 --> 18:58.320
He cannot go beyond that.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.110
OK.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.760
And then we have all dates are available by default.

19:01.890 --> 19:02.350
OK.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.020
We don't want to add anything.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.490
So we don't want to add anything.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.740
Obviously this is a whole deal and everything should be available.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.900
OK.

19:11.100 --> 19:18.610
So then we have a the restrict days we don't want to restrict these dates.

19:18.610 --> 19:18.860
OK.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.630
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to get the costs right now and I'm going to remove this because

19:22.630 --> 19:24.690
I don't want to charge them on the basis of that.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.220
And then I have the availability.

19:27.360 --> 19:27.880
OK.

19:27.910 --> 19:30.490
This means that Max booking per block.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.790
This is like how many blocks he wanted to be.

19:33.790 --> 19:36.280
So availability will be like set to 30.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.670
Since you have 30 to we just want to check this one.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.160
The minimum log book cable and you guys already know about it.

19:42.160 --> 19:48.110
So now what we want to do is that we have to just switch Resources tab on.

19:48.240 --> 19:48.700
OK.

19:48.820 --> 19:54.800
So in the resources how we want to type so the type will be a room type.

19:54.910 --> 20:00.690
I'm just going into a room type in the resources Volbeat customers selected already automatically assigned

20:00.700 --> 20:06.430
so I'm going to select the customer we can select it and add link resource and this will be a basic

20:06.490 --> 20:10.750
room OK I'm going to hit enter.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.930
I'm going to hit addling free sors and this will be

20:16.600 --> 20:17.030
luxury

20:20.060 --> 20:24.920
our pro room.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.780
And then this will be business room

20:30.690 --> 20:31.270
OK.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.990
And so let's just go ahead and let it.

20:33.010 --> 20:34.000
OK.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.190
So this is right here.

20:35.320 --> 20:35.890
OK.

20:35.890 --> 20:39.990
And then here I won the basic room to cost like nothing.

20:40.090 --> 20:43.410
So the basic room will cost you only the price of the room.

20:43.420 --> 20:49.960
Only the price of that room that you pay if you are looking for proof room that then playroom will cost

20:49.960 --> 20:51.880
you extra extra.

20:51.910 --> 20:58.900
I'm talking about the extras like if you're charging basic room for like 100 bucks which is already

20:58.900 --> 20:59.340
here.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.090
OK.

21:00.290 --> 21:04.600
Then for the room we want to charge them on the basis of like

21:07.800 --> 21:11.220
100 more so we will charge $200 for pro rooms.

21:11.250 --> 21:11.740
OK.

21:11.910 --> 21:18.210
And if he wants that business room right there would be like around bill that so many things and also

21:18.210 --> 21:24.280
a lobby will be given to him and so much stuffs to charge him like thousand dollars for one single day.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.020
OK.

21:25.020 --> 21:26.660
So this will be the business room.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.990
So I'm just going to go ahead and I am going to go ahead and I'm going to date this right now so unclogging

21:30.990 --> 21:31.730
the update.

21:31.860 --> 21:35.640
Let's just view the product and you're going to see how amazing it's going to look.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.770
This is out as blue collar hotel.

21:40.790 --> 21:42.160
It is from hundred dollars.

21:42.190 --> 21:42.590
OK.

21:42.610 --> 21:45.190
And then it pays adult child this.

21:45.730 --> 21:51.270
So we can also change it to be like person because we don't want to get any of that thing.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.020
So it's going to come here.

21:52.030 --> 21:59.750
I'm just going to make it like this and the person can be 28 29 30 OK I'm going to come here and I'm

21:59.750 --> 22:01.150
going to hit a beach right now.

22:01.430 --> 22:02.320
So I'll come here.

22:02.510 --> 22:05.280
And let's just refer to seek and see.

22:05.390 --> 22:09.990
It's just going to ask for person how many persons we want and then I'm going to ask for the room type.

22:09.990 --> 22:17.420
So I just want to be like BASIC from basic room will cost him only 100 bucks OK and prove to him will

22:17.420 --> 22:19.730
cost him like hundred dollars more.

22:19.790 --> 22:25.430
So if you just select twenty three and the end date is also 23 then even then it will cost him a hundred

22:25.430 --> 22:26.480
dollars more.

22:26.480 --> 22:31.220
OK so this is how the program works if you select basic rule number then basically it will be like BASIC.

22:31.220 --> 22:34.850
He has just he just says pay a hundred dollars and that's all.

22:35.300 --> 22:40.300
But if he go for like business room then it will cost in like $2000 more.

22:40.310 --> 22:44.150
And it's going to cost him like one thousand one hundred dollars.

22:44.150 --> 22:47.180
So this is how it basically works.

22:47.180 --> 22:54.600
OK so now here if you want to just charge damn on the basis of the room they select.

22:54.600 --> 22:59.750
Like if you want to charge them if you want to edit the resource like how many rooms you have for business

22:59.780 --> 23:03.460
for how many produ you have how many basic room you have.

23:03.510 --> 23:09.130
Then what you have to do you have to just come here to the basic room and you have to hit at a resource.

23:10.140 --> 23:15.490
And this will be like the quantity of this source available at any given time.

23:15.510 --> 23:22.500
This means that like if someone is going to buy this business through them how much how what will be

23:22.500 --> 23:25.250
the range and what will be the quantity.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.230
So it feels like like we have just three business room.

23:28.440 --> 23:28.950
Okay.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.980
And then we just come here and we just should update Okay.

23:33.100 --> 23:36.210
And then we come here and we will be first this.

23:36.590 --> 23:38.030
So then this will be

23:41.290 --> 23:45.280
this will be like for three business Strohm okay like only three dimes.

23:45.430 --> 23:52.440
This room can be booked okay like we just have three if someone comes and buy it for just one more this

23:52.450 --> 23:53.140
will be visible.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.470
And if someone comes in buy it for the second time this will be visible.

23:56.470 --> 24:00.650
Let me just show you if I just come here and I just said to just hit one.

24:00.800 --> 24:01.280
OK.

24:01.390 --> 24:02.690
And now let's sit and let's hit up the

24:05.560 --> 24:11.120
let's come here let's just refresh this and again see that we have only one business room so business

24:11.120 --> 24:14.780
room can be bought only one time by a specific date.

24:14.780 --> 24:18.950
If I just come here and I just pre-trade this business room OK and then I just go ahead and I just hit

24:18.950 --> 24:19.690
book now.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.280
But let's come here and let's make the change here.

24:22.310 --> 24:25.300
I'm going to go to availability and I'm going to choose it to be like two.

24:25.310 --> 24:28.110
So we have Max booking is set to 300.

24:28.340 --> 24:34.040
But if you just buy our business room then for business when we just have only one single business room

24:34.070 --> 24:34.870
and that's all.

24:35.050 --> 24:35.470
OK.

24:35.570 --> 24:36.970
So I'm going to come here I'm just going to go ahead.

24:36.980 --> 24:38.440
I'm going to go to the condo.

24:38.570 --> 24:39.110
Sorry.

24:39.110 --> 24:45.330
The view right here and this is said to like business room it's six six days pay.

24:45.410 --> 24:48.710
And so let's suppose that I am buying the business rule and it's going to go ahead I'm going to proceed

24:48.710 --> 24:49.890
to check out right now.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.740
And now here I have to just buy it.

24:51.740 --> 24:56.930
So I'm just going to go and I'm going to place her daughter's going to be placed and you can see that

24:56.930 --> 24:58.400
I have protégées this right now.

24:58.460 --> 25:04.070
And if I just come here and I just see it like view my bookings you can see this is the Boockvar hotel

25:04.080 --> 25:05.120
this is right here.

25:05.120 --> 25:09.020
And if I just come here and then I try to book this room again.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.850
OK we have 30 available guys.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.750
If I just come here and I just try to book it.

25:13.070 --> 25:13.790
OK.

25:13.790 --> 25:14.550
This is right here.

25:14.600 --> 25:19.760
But if I just come here and I just select this business room you can see this business room can not

25:19.760 --> 25:24.390
be selected because we have just this room is one single available.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.580
This is what I mean.

25:25.580 --> 25:32.240
So obviously a business room is just so big room OK with that a lot of tables and a lot of things that

25:32.300 --> 25:34.600
people hire that people buy.

25:34.790 --> 25:39.080
So since this is already bogged we cannot have so many business room.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.740
So this is what they mean.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.160
OK.

25:41.360 --> 25:47.180
So now you can see that this is how it works and I hope that you can understand it pretty well that

25:47.180 --> 25:54.280
how everything works can at a range as well like there would be a day Tran's and it'd be like bookable

25:54.320 --> 25:54.710
or not.

25:54.740 --> 26:00.380
Buckyballs so you can also have the range like if you want to be like Sunday on Sunday the business

26:00.380 --> 26:01.070
is off.

26:01.100 --> 26:05.460
So we don't want be we don't want that room will not be bookable.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.600
So on Sunday the room cannot be bookable So this is how you can work.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.300
This is how you can manage everything.

26:10.370 --> 26:14.210
And this is how you can apply these resources ranges.

26:14.350 --> 26:14.850
Okay.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.800
So this is outrageous.

26:16.880 --> 26:24.140
So now I'm going to go ahead and I am going to just go to the products and then all products analysts

26:24.190 --> 26:25.250
added to our product.

26:25.260 --> 26:25.880
This is our product.

26:25.900 --> 26:26.430
Okay.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.330
So I can see that this is how the resources work.

26:29.360 --> 26:34.700
You can charge them on the basis of resources you can charge them on the basis of cost you can charge

26:34.700 --> 26:39.530
them on the basis of person and you can charge and because of the resources everything you can charge

26:39.530 --> 26:41.830
them on the basis of anything.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.260
So this will not be so confusing.

26:44.270 --> 26:48.950
I seriously seriously this will be so confusing when you opted to just install this plug in and then

26:48.980 --> 26:53.900
apply to it then mess around with it then do these types of things.

26:53.930 --> 26:55.030
OK.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.130
And then you will understand it easily.

26:57.190 --> 27:03.560
But I just first started this plug in I just was like oh my god this is seriously guys this happens

27:03.560 --> 27:05.740
this happens or if this is this is happening.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.550
It is totally OK this is normal guy is this is normal it will happen.

27:09.590 --> 27:10.550
So do not worry.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.040
OK.

27:11.210 --> 27:13.400
So thanks guys for watching this.

27:13.400 --> 27:19.280
