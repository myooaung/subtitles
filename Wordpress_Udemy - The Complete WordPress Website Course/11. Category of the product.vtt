you should be adding categories before adding posed before adding products before adding the portfolio

00:33.320 --> 00:34.910

00:34.910 --> 00:39.970
Make sure you add the category because it is really very important you should be assigning the category.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.060
OK so let's just go to the products right now.
