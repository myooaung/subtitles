WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:04.680
Here what is it guys and what KMAX and how you can see that we have design our social networking site

00:04.710 --> 00:05.610
and everything.

00:05.610 --> 00:08.880
And now I want to show you that how can you market your brand.

00:09.060 --> 00:14.940
Email marketing so you can see that we have designed every Web site and we just left in the email marketing

00:14.940 --> 00:19.950
very that people can just go ahead and then they can just leave their email addresses and then they

00:19.950 --> 00:25.760
can get future emails when the Post something we want to notify our users via e-mail.

00:25.770 --> 00:28.070
So basically there is just software to do that.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.360
You don't have to just open up your e-mail account and then you have to send emails directly to different

00:33.360 --> 00:35.160
types of people that you want to send.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.500
You don't have to do that guys.

00:36.660 --> 00:40.320
There is software you have to just enter the subject.

00:40.320 --> 00:45.090
You have to just enter that what you want to add and then after that you have to just enter that e-mail

00:45.090 --> 00:49.860
address and it will be automatically sent to your subscribers for your subscribers.

00:49.860 --> 00:56.120
So you can see that if we go to any of the Web site they just use this email marketing from Saudi even

00:56.550 --> 00:57.750
to the enemy uses it.

00:57.780 --> 01:06.540
OK because when they do send the e-mail the e-mail just turns a lot you just like email marketing is

01:06.540 --> 01:12.300
so vast is so vast because everybody reads the e-mail OK and they read it.

01:12.310 --> 01:17.810
They just like open it up in a neighbor like oh Cray's this is you can see this is by drop shipping.

01:17.850 --> 01:20.130
E-commerce site making annual rent revenue.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.820
So this is the email marketing from them OK.

01:22.830 --> 01:29.070
I am basically in the e-mail marketing you can see this e-mail helps you keeps you update with the latest

01:29.070 --> 01:30.020
news from flipper.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.370
You were receiving this e-mail because you are a user.

01:32.490 --> 01:39.780
I can unsubscribe by just clicking here and if I just click here you can see that it says you have been

01:39.780 --> 01:43.870
successfully removed from the subscriber list you will no longer hear from us.

01:43.890 --> 01:44.320
OK.

01:44.430 --> 01:51.570
I didn't see that I have just opted out from this right here and I won't receive any future e-mail from

01:51.570 --> 01:51.750
that.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.700
So this is how this e-mail marketing works.

01:53.700 --> 01:54.630
OK guys.

01:54.780 --> 02:00.360
Now here let me show you what is this Saphir how that software works and what software you should go

02:00.360 --> 02:00.770
with.

02:00.900 --> 02:01.310
OK.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.370
So there is not a software I can just call it like a web app.

02:04.680 --> 02:10.050
Ok so we have two softwares that I personally recommend the one is the MailChimp and the other one is

02:10.320 --> 02:12.080
ever ever is the best.

02:12.210 --> 02:18.420
But Ebere do make one mistake is that they didn't give free e-mail accounts OK they give free trial

02:18.670 --> 02:21.910
OK for just 30 days 30 days or less.

02:21.970 --> 02:25.580
And you want to start your own business it takes approximately six months.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.670
They just do the number one mistake.

02:27.840 --> 02:35.020
Email Marketing from the MailChimp is they gave like 2000 free.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.470
Create beautiful professional designs like free and you can just go ahead or you can just learn more

02:40.470 --> 02:40.830
about it.

02:40.830 --> 02:46.380
So this is the price you can see up to do thousands of Schreiber's and 12000 e-mail per month you can

02:46.380 --> 02:46.790
send.

02:46.860 --> 02:47.330
OK.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.680
So this is I think this is more than enough.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.330
You just have to started right now.

02:51.330 --> 02:55.200
And then when your plan will increase you can just go and increase it.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.600
So like in this you can just grow more.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.210
So here you would be having more Strieber is like four if you have more than that subscribers than it

03:03.210 --> 03:04.010
would charge you more.

03:04.020 --> 03:06.840
So like zero to do thousands of Schreiber's this is free.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.560
OK.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.860
And then we have two thousand five hundred thirty five per month.

03:12.050 --> 03:12.500
Okay.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.050
So this is outrageous.

03:14.100 --> 03:21.660
So now here what I want to do is that I want to just go with the site and sign up for this because everybody

03:21.660 --> 03:25.550
wants to sign up for the free version to the guys there is not a big difference between them.

03:25.590 --> 03:25.820
OK.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.360
They are the e-mail marketing tools that sends that e-mail.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.510
And mostly people do use this instead of this only professional guys use this.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.210
So it is not much recommended.

03:34.230 --> 03:34.510
OK.

03:34.530 --> 03:38.780
You want to go with the professional way you want to go with the more easy to use way.

03:38.820 --> 03:39.960
This is right here.

03:40.260 --> 03:45.000
But I'll be just going up in the MailChimp because MailChimp is supported by so many Web site even that

03:45.030 --> 03:49.400
element or even some of them say like David Davis supports both.

03:49.410 --> 03:55.620
Like if Ebere and the MailChimp as well so you can just decide which one you want to go with if you

03:55.620 --> 03:58.290
want to go with my opinion then go with this MailChimp.

03:58.450 --> 03:58.910
OK.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.850
Has MailChimp vild suit you.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.730
OK so seriously guys you have just go to MailChimp dot com and then you have to just go ahead and make

04:05.730 --> 04:08.280
sure that you go ahead and sign yourself up.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.830
So you have to just sign up for free

04:13.450 --> 04:18.090
you know in here you have to enter the email address you have to enter your name and then you have to

04:18.090 --> 04:19.290
enter your password.

04:19.290 --> 04:23.490
So once you just enter everything here your account will be set up.

04:23.490 --> 04:28.180
Since I am already a user here I am just going to go ahead and I'm going to log in.

04:28.230 --> 04:32.390
So it's going to log myself in and you're going to enter the password and I'm going to hit logons So

04:32.940 --> 04:34.140
it is going to log myself.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.160
You can see I'm here in it.

04:36.330 --> 04:42.930
And here I am and this right here is good afternoon and zeal and I have welcome back to your account

04:42.930 --> 04:43.490

04:43.500 --> 04:48.970
Check out these performances statistics the personal life gets tips from MailChimp so you can see that

04:49.010 --> 04:53.700
we have successfully created our account at MailChimp in the next video I'm going to show you can you

04:53.700 --> 05:00.930
just build a sign up form or just people can interact with your self video sign up form they can just

05:00.960 --> 05:05.760
enter their email address and then they can just get access to your list.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.980
And then when you release something you want to send anything to your Streiber.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.350
Or you can send it by campaign by just running a campaign.

05:13.460 --> 05:18.120
So in the next video you'll be working up to that stadium guys and goodbye and after also that we'll
