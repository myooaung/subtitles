02:07.920 --> 02:11.070
I cannot search the ID because I have to search for it.

02:11.170 --> 02:12.000

02:12.010 --> 02:16.480
I'm going to have T-shirt trade now because I have to add that to keyword three word OK.

02:16.540 --> 02:19.990

02:20.050 --> 02:22.510
And that will be the T-shirt.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.540
So this will be fifty seven OK.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.430
And then you can see that everything is right here.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.690
Everything is coming here.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.660
And we have the vinter whole packet.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.290
So if someone buys this everything will be added from them.

02:38.290 --> 02:43.900
So here what I can do I can search for like teeshirt here in the main category or just search for the

02:43.980 --> 02:45.480
men under the T-shirt.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.530
And then I also on the product made so my product image will be a complete bulk of teachers.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.600
I'm just going to go to big dot com so on Splash basically is used for the background images and picks

02:57.600 --> 03:01.500
eBay is used for the normal images so make sure to keep that in mind.

03:01.500 --> 03:07.720
So if you need a background image go to splash dot com and if you need a normal image then we go to

03:07.860 --> 03:14.090
Bixby dot com dot com is kind of slow right now and it's just waiting meeting meeting and meeting so

03:16.310 --> 03:19.730
hey here I need clothing

03:23.950 --> 03:24.400
so

03:28.190 --> 03:38.910
well just search for shirts OK let's just search for wardrobe.

03:38.940 --> 03:42.000
So this is the one where I'm just going to add this one I'm going to come here.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.150
I mean this am going to sew like this.

03:44.380 --> 03:45.890
Let's just sit down.

03:46.540 --> 03:46.920
OK.

03:46.950 --> 03:47.720
I'm going to come here.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.160
I'm going to come here to new products and then I'm going to drag and drop it right here.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.970
So if you do not find the image make sure that you change your keywords you just search for it and you

03:57.030 --> 04:00.420
will find your image so you can see this is that image right here.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.380
And if you don't want to search you can just create your own for Illustrator Photoshop.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.690
If you are a designer.

04:06.690 --> 04:10.220
So here I'm going to add some short description.

04:10.320 --> 04:16.150
This package is best for you OK.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.710
And then here I need some larm.

04:17.710 --> 04:25.170
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to drag and drop the tree copy and then come and paste.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.760
I want to come here and I'm going to hit publish right now and you can see that a product has been added

04:30.780 --> 04:34.800
so if I just open this up he'll see how this is going to look.

04:35.370 --> 04:35.880
OK.

04:35.940 --> 04:41.280
This is what it's looking so you can see we have zipper hoodies we have T-shirts from men by Levey's

04:41.670 --> 04:43.440
and then we have this teacher.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.830
So this is our this is looking OK.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.010
You can see that this is a group product.

04:48.030 --> 04:53.400
This is a complete package and it is Hoodie's and has T-shirt for men by the advice and T-shirt for

04:53.400 --> 04:54.330
men by Nike.

04:54.330 --> 04:59.580
So these three airheads if I just come here I just liked it from select options you can see that this

04:59.580 --> 05:00.980
is here and it's going to come here.

05:00.980 --> 05:06.140
I'm going to hit Krien and I'm going to hit two cart so you can see this is now added to my cart.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.230
This is it is looking.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.320
If I just go back

05:11.600 --> 05:17.630
so you can see this is since a variable product that is why it is creating some mess it is taking us

05:17.630 --> 05:18.860
to the package itself.

05:19.070 --> 05:24.440
But if we just come here and we just just let's just remove it from here at the Karthikeyan.

05:24.650 --> 05:30.980
And if I just click on the Khandi since if this is not the variable product then this is also the symbol

05:30.980 --> 05:31.380
products.

05:31.380 --> 05:35.030
Let's just come here let's just come here to the package and let's from here to the link products so

05:35.060 --> 05:38.550
I just want to remove the super Hoodie's I just come here.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.830
Super hoodies and T-shirt from and by Nike.

05:40.850 --> 05:41.930
Let's just move it.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.660
ZUBER hoodies and T-shirt from in by Nike.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.350
OK.

05:45.350 --> 05:53.240
And instead a T-Shirt T-Shirt one more and that is that that will be issued from it.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.000
OK.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.800
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hate update.

05:56.070 --> 05:56.560
OK.

05:56.640 --> 06:04.140
And then let's come here and let's refresh this so you can see that this is our winter package 2017.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.170
And we have $10 to $25.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.120
We have t shirt for men by Levice t shirt for men.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.600
These are the products that we have in this product.

06:12.770 --> 06:16.250
OK if I just like that I need this one quantity and I need this one.

06:16.380 --> 06:16.870
OK.

06:16.890 --> 06:20.260
And then I hit add two cards and you can see these bought two.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.150
They will be added to my card automatically.

06:23.220 --> 06:24.510
How this going to work.

06:24.630 --> 06:24.920
OK.

06:24.930 --> 06:30.570
And what are the uses and why you should use this like this so I just gave you an option that you can

06:30.570 --> 06:35.500
create a specific package and then you can look to customers like choose that what they want.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.020
OK.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.050
See I'm like this.

06:37.140 --> 06:41.600
You can create a product for like if you have an online shop for books.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.080
OK.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.050
And then you can create an online shop for like I'm Class 7 or for Class 7.

06:46.050 --> 06:50.650
It will have all the books like Class 7 English class 7 mats.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.140
So.

06:51.170 --> 06:57.780
So the person has to like that I need one class 7 English and 8 to 1 class 7 math and I have the other

06:57.780 --> 07:04.950
one is like science or by biology or physics so I have the physics at my home.

07:04.950 --> 07:08.010
My brother has used that physics so I don't want to buy it.

07:08.020 --> 07:08.970
I'll just shoot zero.

07:09.050 --> 07:13.330
OK so if he'll choose zero and then the package will be automatically added to his card.

07:13.470 --> 07:16.470
OK and all the books will be added to the card and then he can check it out.

07:16.530 --> 07:22.020
If you are a school and you want to create an online shop for that you can create a product so this

07:22.020 --> 07:23.890
is the perfect example OK.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.800
If you wanted I can also show you you just have to go to the polls you have to create a product for

07:28.800 --> 07:31.950
like Class 7 English how to create a tree for products.

07:31.950 --> 07:32.460
OK.

07:32.550 --> 07:38.400
And then you have to assign a product and then you have to add them simultaneously so this is how basically

07:38.400 --> 07:43.440
the products work and if I just come here to pray here knitting and see everything is coming.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.300
Even we have the vinter package itself that is coming so you can just if you have an online shop.

07:49.350 --> 07:56.250
And so I like Class 7 whole course for the city school or feel like the Beacon House or something like

07:56.250 --> 08:03.360
that so you can just do very very day more first in Michael's school St. Paul's School or St. Patrick's

08:03.360 --> 08:07.860
school so you can just bury them if you have an online shop for books.

08:07.890 --> 08:13.410
So I just gave you a perfect example for the products so this is how the product works.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.890
And now we have the basic understanding of every product that we can add so we can add a simple product

08:19.920 --> 08:25.710
we can add a variable product can we also add a crop products you can see that they're saying select

08:25.710 --> 08:27.550
options select options.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.860
This is at two cart and this is the new products that we have in here.

08:32.430 --> 08:36.290
So thanks a lot guys for watching this and in the next video we'll be learning about the affiliated

08:36.290 --> 08:39.510
products I'm going to show you how affiliated products work.

08:39.720 --> 08:45.750
And then we'll be working with the customization designer home page and we'll move forward to Stadion

08:45.750 --> 08:47.450
guys and goodbye.
