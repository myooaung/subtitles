08:44.980 --> 08:46.300
I can hide the logo image.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.520
I can just do it himself.

08:48.550 --> 08:55.190

to be more of a white in a gray

09:28.770 --> 09:29.250

09:29.320 --> 09:32.780
You can see the differences are actively in color and these are not the active.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.700

11:22.290 --> 11:23.000
important.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.090

11:37.360 --> 11:38.380
This one right here.

11:38.630 --> 11:43.560
But I would just recommend this one Etim examples and devious layouts out Stockholm.

11:43.610 --> 11:48.310
OK so make sure you go ahead and divvies just famous for the pre-made layout as well.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.840
This is the top number one rated team this is because of the Premier League.

11:51.860 --> 11:56.450
You don't have to do anything you just have to upload the layout and that's all your Web site is totally

11:56.450 --> 11:56.920
up and running.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.040
You just have to change it.

11:58.340 --> 12:03.930
OK so that is why mostly people do also use the DV theme and they're just super awesome guys.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.230
Just let me show you.

12:05.240 --> 12:12.210

So you just have to click any of the blorb.

19:50.310 --> 19:55.650

19:55.650 --> 19:55.830
this.

19:55.830 --> 20:00.120

Ok so this is a text.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.050
What is this phrase here.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.000
This is applied to the full roll.

20:10.060 --> 20:17.850
I'm just going to click this right now and this is the dividers so divider background.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.780
So we don't have any Bactrim right here.

20:19.940 --> 20:20.280
OK.

20:20.340 --> 20:26.610
If it is still not if it is still confusing to you you can just click there and unclogging this you

20:26.610 --> 20:29.060
can see that we have just a divider right here.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.070
We have a hero tag here.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.800
So the hero you can see we have the back room right here.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.950
This is a whole row basically.

20:36.990 --> 20:46.280
OK and we just have the background here and in the background they have just given the speed the background

20:46.370 --> 20:53.540
image blend is normal and the column on column one is this column one Bactrian is this and column two

20:53.540 --> 20:54.250
back krones.

20:54.270 --> 20:56.760
So you can see that they have designed this like this.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.430
So if I just click here you can see this is the BND mange.

21:00.430 --> 21:00.700
OK.

21:00.710 --> 21:01.940
This is a P and G major.

21:02.030 --> 21:04.110
This hole is transparent.

21:04.400 --> 21:04.690
OK.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.160
And the rest of this is discolors.

21:07.190 --> 21:13.820
So how this will work is that once we just open it up you can see that we have two columns right here.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.530
OK you can see that we have two columns.

21:15.530 --> 21:23.010
If I just come here and I just click here and I just like the view OK and then I click here.

21:27.010 --> 21:32.000
OK let's just come here let's just close it and you can see that we have to call them right here.

21:32.030 --> 21:37.160
This is the column one back Honyman that is coming and this is the column to background image.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.020
This hole is transparent.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.860
And this hole is basically the colored one.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.970
So I hope you understand what I'm saying.

21:44.150 --> 21:44.630
OK.

21:44.660 --> 21:47.560
And then we go down we have four rows right here.

21:47.570 --> 21:47.950
OK.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.180
And in the rows we have this right here.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.310

21:51.320 --> 21:56.660
OK this is the blurb we have freedom durndest tidal we have fittedness for 30 days is description.

21:56.810 --> 22:03.380
And then we have the image in icon and the icon is this and the icon color is said to Brown so that

22:03.380 --> 22:09.270
it matches this color and you guys can now understand that how they have focused on the color scheme.

22:09.330 --> 22:14.400
And this is why that is why the Web site is looking so sexy and amazing.

22:14.500 --> 22:14.900
OK.

22:14.990 --> 22:20.510
So you can see that this is how we basically go ahead and create a DV layouts.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.320
DV is just famous for the premier lay out ok.

22:23.450 --> 22:28.760
Seriously guys most of the people just go ahead they just upload the DV a premade lay out and then they

22:28.760 --> 22:32.780
go ahead and then the edited so you can see so many of them say they just do it like this and you can

22:32.780 --> 22:36.070
see how perfect it is looking guys.

22:36.110 --> 22:38.160
So we're just going to work.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.310
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to focus on this as well.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.900
Mean just going to go ahead and I'm going to change the color of this and I'm just going to try to make

22:44.900 --> 22:49.340
sure that I change it to brown so that it focus this background color.

22:49.510 --> 22:49.980
OK.

22:50.030 --> 22:56.090
And just getting away I'm going to hit individual builder and here you can see this is how my home page

22:56.090 --> 22:56.580
is looking.

22:56.580 --> 23:01.500
Everything looks pretty create and amazing and this is called the animation you guys already know about

23:01.500 --> 23:04.110
the animations so you can vary this as well.

23:04.110 --> 23:05.580
I'm just going to come here.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.270
I'm going to go ahead.

23:06.270 --> 23:09.320
I'm going to hit the DV theme customize her.

23:09.330 --> 23:09.730
OK.

23:09.810 --> 23:12.520
So now here I want to design this right here.

23:12.540 --> 23:13.640
I want to make it full brown.

23:13.650 --> 23:16.170
I want to make it light brown and then we're going to move forward.

23:16.170 --> 23:19.730
So first let's just go ahead and let's grab that color picture of that.

23:22.030 --> 23:25.880
Hedren navigation primary menu bar and this is right here.

23:27.060 --> 23:27.950
OK.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.890
The background color so we have the background color right here.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.680
I am going to make it to brown

23:39.620 --> 23:40.550
it is the brown and

23:47.000 --> 23:47.350
ok.

23:47.360 --> 23:54.240
I just want to go ahead and I want to crop the color picker for this so color Zilla.

23:54.620 --> 23:55.200
OK.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.290
I want to grab this color.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.290
So this is right here.

23:57.290 --> 23:59.830
This is copied to make dash clipboard.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.870
But I don't know where to put this filter.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.660
I think I have to update my DVT.

24:04.670 --> 24:07.390
So what I have to do I have to just come here.

24:07.400 --> 24:14.300
I have to just go to the right here and I have to go to the team option so any here I have to just update

24:14.300 --> 24:20.180
my team so that I can move forward to make sure that you keep your DVT updated so that everything works

24:20.180 --> 24:20.660
pretty well.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.370
So here I have to enter my username

24:26.080 --> 24:31.610
and then here would be the APHC have to go to the elegant diems OK and then you have to go to your API

24:31.780 --> 24:32.260
key.

24:32.380 --> 24:32.610
OK.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.810
I'm just pausing video and I'm going to paste my APHC from there.

24:36.190 --> 24:39.480
So I've copied my APHC and then I have to paste it right now.

24:39.490 --> 24:40.030
OK.

24:40.030 --> 24:45.340
And then I have to have the saved changes so once the changes are saved you can see an update will be

24:45.340 --> 24:50.320
automatically available in here because I know that I have applauded the previous version of DVH and

24:50.320 --> 24:54.880
that is so Privets version OK here this is the new version available.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.600
Are to have date I'm just going to go to a trade now and then here I have to update it.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.390
So let's wait till this is on.

25:03.490 --> 25:07.450
Make sure you upload that you add that API key and then you can update it only.

25:07.450 --> 25:11.480
OK so I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to select all I'm going to hit update themes.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.790
OK.

25:12.790 --> 25:15.280
So now here you can see this should be updated.

25:15.310 --> 25:16.380
And once it is updated.

25:16.390 --> 25:19.970
I can just work with that and you can see that the Customize your will be changed.

25:19.990 --> 25:23.170
And I would have the access to enter the code for that.

25:23.170 --> 25:24.910
So I just basically need that code.

25:24.910 --> 25:26.320
So in order to work with this.

25:26.380 --> 25:30.880
So this is just evading the team disabling the maintenance mode and this is done and is going to go

25:30.880 --> 25:36.270
ahead I'm going to return to WordPress updates and I'm also going to update the Wordpress builder what

25:36.380 --> 25:43.700
is which is this I'm going to go hit I'm going to update plugins and so you can see this is also just

25:43.700 --> 25:46.900
debating the maintenance mode is also enabled.

25:47.000 --> 25:47.890
So what does it contain.

25:47.970 --> 25:53.540
If I just go ahead and once this is maintenance mode is right here and I just open up my website OK.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.640
Then you will see that it'll show that WordPress is currently under maintainance.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.130
OK.

25:58.220 --> 26:01.040
This is hard to learn but this is now this has now disable transport.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.680
Obviously even plug in as is being updated.

26:03.680 --> 26:08.400
And someone just go ahead and visit your shop or say then it could be a mess for him.

26:08.550 --> 26:09.040
OK.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.230
So I think that this is also looking great.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.130
Cool but I want to go here.

26:13.190 --> 26:13.960
I want to change this.

26:13.970 --> 26:18.630
I want to go to the team customize your here again and you will see that team customized would be changed

26:18.640 --> 26:20.430
and it must be changed.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.910
Hope so I've just updated my team.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.530
Yes I know it would be great.

26:24.530 --> 26:28.570
I'm going to go to the and navigation and the primary manual bar.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.520
So here you can see this is change totally

26:35.870 --> 26:36.230
ok.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.640
I'm just come here and let's me get the fade.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.940
I don't know why this is not coming.

26:40.940 --> 26:44.690
This used to be like so great when we have to enter the Goerge for the.

26:44.990 --> 26:47.800
And it works like a charm but it is not working that way.

26:47.810 --> 26:48.320
So

26:51.610 --> 26:54.660
header and navigation the primary menu bar.

26:55.170 --> 26:58.490
And this is coming like this has happened to this DVD.

26:58.570 --> 26:59.260
Or this.

26:59.340 --> 27:00.550
This will be here.

27:00.550 --> 27:02.440
Just be prepared for it.

27:02.640 --> 27:08.040
There will be some problem and only some there will be so many problems that will cause you so much

27:08.490 --> 27:11.180
thing and you'll be like no I don't want to build any website.

27:11.190 --> 27:12.310
So don't just.

27:12.420 --> 27:12.990
OK.

27:13.110 --> 27:14.140
Don't just be like that.

27:14.220 --> 27:19.170
Just always try to make sure that you do face to face everything and to work with it so you can see

27:19.950 --> 27:21.120
I've changed this till now.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.030
And this looks pretty cool right here still here.

27:24.030 --> 27:27.450
I'm also going to go ahead and I'm here and I'm going to change the menu bar as well so I'm going to

27:27.450 --> 27:29.480
go to secondary menu bar right now.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.140
Which is this.

27:31.340 --> 27:35.210
And I'm going to go to the background color so the background color is going to be

27:37.960 --> 27:39.300
this way.

27:39.410 --> 27:44.790
And see how this is looking so we have changed this and this and this looks totally OK.

27:44.800 --> 27:49.710
And it is matching everything seemed like this you can also move on with the footer and do it like that.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.290
But I would recommend you to go with this and do it right now.

27:52.420 --> 28:01.130
So you're going to go to the footer and footer layout of the layout Yes the layout the background color

28:01.130 --> 28:02.750
is going to be

28:08.290 --> 28:12.010
so you can see this is matching totally OK with this.

28:12.010 --> 28:13.180
Now we're totally done with this.

28:13.180 --> 28:14.090
I'm just going to go back.

28:14.150 --> 28:21.860
When I go to the bottom bar and here I'm going to add something so I mean add Hello world OK.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.490
This is my copyright credit.

28:23.510 --> 28:25.410
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to publish right now.

28:25.550 --> 28:29.220

28:29.300 --> 28:33.180
OK you can see how great and amazing it is looking.

28:33.290 --> 28:33.930
OK.

28:33.950 --> 28:39.500
I'm just very disappointed with that thing that I cannot add that thing that cord here.

28:39.530 --> 28:40.260
But no problem.

28:40.260 --> 28:40.710
OK.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.620
You can see everything is totally up and running.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.520
We have designed our home page.

28:44.570 --> 28:50.620
I know I just did not design it myself right now just because I wanted to show you how the premier layout

28:50.630 --> 28:51.390
works OK.

28:51.500 --> 28:55.700
So I'm just going to add it to about page and the contact us page and then we're going to design the

29:01.430 --> 29:04.500
We'll just use the same technology that we used.

29:04.510 --> 29:04.810
OK.

29:04.820 --> 29:09.380
And that was the pre-made layouts which is going to install the premium out and about and contact us
