WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.030
HEAR WHAT DOES IT guys involve.

00:02.080 --> 00:08.750
So now in this video I am going to be showing you that how can you basically work with the blog.

00:08.940 --> 00:09.330
OK.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.430
What is a blog.

00:10.620 --> 00:15.500
Why is it necessary for a site to have it can see that this is our simple basic web site.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.010
OK.

00:16.050 --> 00:21.150
There's our introductory Web site we have our home and this is that content we have about us page and

00:21.150 --> 00:22.510
this is all about content.

00:22.600 --> 00:22.910
Okay.

00:22.910 --> 00:24.560
And then we have the Contact Us page.

00:24.570 --> 00:24.980
OK.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.130
So now you know how to create page.

00:27.220 --> 00:27.520
OK.

00:27.540 --> 00:28.040
That's all.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.580
You haven't learned anything about WordPress you just know how to create pages.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.640
And that's all that's all this is our simple basic website.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.070
OK so page creation is very easy guys.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.420
Everyone can do it.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.140
The main part is the design the mean part is the understanding the main part is the functionality the

00:43.140 --> 00:44.790
mean part is everything.

00:45.030 --> 00:49.950
So don't just go ahead and just leave this just leave this course and just be like OK I know the word

00:49.950 --> 00:54.930
Bresse so don't be like that because there are so many customizations that you do not even know that

00:54.930 --> 00:55.820
they are possible.

00:55.940 --> 00:56.310
OK.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.830
So just stick to the scores.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.330
Do not miss any video.

00:59.340 --> 00:59.650
OK.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.450
So any here are going to be talking about the blog.

01:02.490 --> 01:07.590
What is a blog and why is it necessary for a website to have.

01:07.740 --> 01:12.660
So it depends what you want to add the blog functionality to your website or not.

01:12.660 --> 01:19.870
But I want to explain you and I am telling you to please guys listen to this because this is very important.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.870
Let's just go ahead and let's take an example from the website.

01:22.910 --> 01:23.260
OK.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.950
I'm going to go ahead and I am going to open the apple dot com.

01:27.260 --> 01:27.480
OK.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.710
This is the iPhone company that is Apple.

01:31.110 --> 01:38.030
And now here you can see that it says Mac iPad iPhone watch TV music sport and everything.

01:38.350 --> 01:38.600
OK.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.770
This is the Apple website.

01:41.120 --> 01:41.610
OK.

01:41.850 --> 01:48.270
And if I just go to the down section you can see it is news room.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.730
OK here you can see it here is Newsroom.

01:50.730 --> 01:57.770
If I just open it up it can see press release and it says Apple Store cakes and everything.

01:57.770 --> 02:05.720
So here they just add a lot of posts about their company that what is happening in their company and

02:06.030 --> 02:12.320
the is relieved and something like that so you can see this is the category of the press release and

02:12.320 --> 02:20.240
this is as the category of a feature and you can see how Apple and this are transforming the future

02:20.270 --> 02:21.520
of Texas down.

02:21.710 --> 02:22.230
OK.

02:22.250 --> 02:27.590
We have this and this and this and so there are so many thing we have this category as the updates like

02:27.620 --> 02:33.950
Apple reveals 2007s most popular apps and music and more let's suppose that I like this post.

02:34.100 --> 02:39.380
And I just opened this up in a need to see like how this post for it's ok you can see everything is

02:39.380 --> 02:40.070
here.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.120
It is the update.

02:41.150 --> 02:47.240
It is the post that when it was published and we have the Apple release this we have this whole post

02:47.240 --> 02:47.530
coming

02:51.220 --> 02:56.590
he has also added the video here and everything about this post coming you can see that there are different

02:56.590 --> 02:58.210
things that you can add to your website.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.850
So don't feel like that that you know everything OK.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.570
You just know how to create a page and you can see how creative this looking.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.770
So this is how it is looking.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.490
This is basically called the Apple NEWSROOM.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.270
OK so some of the Web sites do have this like.

03:13.470 --> 03:19.780
It is the Amazon prime video arrives on Apple TV over and everything and there are so many if I just

03:19.780 --> 03:25.950
go down down down and it says a few more if I just click here I can see it loads more post.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.590
OK.

03:28.300 --> 03:37.420
You can see we have two here like at bulgy partner to pring predicts industrial apps to iOS.

03:37.470 --> 03:43.550
OK so they just blog about their company is blog about tech fear of releasing this.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.210
And like the future is your iPhone 10.

03:46.400 --> 03:53.690
OK so if I just open it up and this post was hit OK this post had so many views guys like I mean I just

03:53.690 --> 03:54.870
posted this.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.200
It just went viral.

03:56.330 --> 03:59.080
Everyone was like OK what does the iPhone 10.

03:59.210 --> 04:00.680
How does it work again.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.400
What is it.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.880
And then there's this and this.

04:02.910 --> 04:09.590
So this had so many views I don't know they have added a fuse into here but it has so it had so many

04:09.590 --> 04:09.910
views.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.280
OK.

04:10.370 --> 04:17.650
So we have taken the example from here and let's just add it to be like Android.

04:17.930 --> 04:18.280
OK.

04:18.460 --> 04:24.300
On the Android but what's just targeting a big company called Microsoft Android users.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.630
Please don't tell me that Android is not a big company.

04:26.760 --> 04:34.480
OK I'm not just telling you that but Microsoft's blog so here you can see these blogs start Microsoft

04:34.480 --> 04:35.070
dot com.

04:35.180 --> 04:40.970
If I just open it up and then let's see how does they have the blog so it can see that they have this

04:40.970 --> 04:43.490
blog you can see they have the first post.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.790
This is the post that is a featured post.

04:45.830 --> 04:51.560
We go down they have this post this post and you can see that it was posted on this this this and they

04:51.560 --> 04:56.590
just tell us about their company that how their company is growing and everything and we have this.

04:56.600 --> 05:02.570
And if I just click view more is going to view me more and he can see it as more news and we have the

05:02.570 --> 05:03.990
page nation right here.

05:04.010 --> 05:07.630
So if I just go to the page 3 you can see that we have more news here.

05:07.630 --> 05:09.500
So let's suppose that I just like this one.

05:09.590 --> 05:09.800
OK.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.730
I just opened this up and I see OK.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.870
They have a blog post here.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.550
And let's open it.

05:15.860 --> 05:23.990
OK can see that they have the rule about this that how the celebration was in the content and everything.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.510
So this was posted by this corporate vice president Microsoft cloud.

05:28.520 --> 05:32.990
If I just opened it to this blog author like who is the blog Autor this and you can see it.

05:33.030 --> 05:37.070
It's going to show the posts that were posted by this guy.

05:37.070 --> 05:41.690
So let's suppose that I want to search about some incident that happened in the Microsoft like

05:45.630 --> 05:49.680
update or a thief.

05:49.850 --> 05:56.860
So let's suppose that an incident happened and a thief just got arrested.

05:56.880 --> 06:01.520
So I'm just going be searching for a thief so let's see how many they have for his TV so you can see

06:01.520 --> 06:03.170
that we have three results for you.

06:03.170 --> 06:09.680
So let's suppose that this is the update about how the walking dead creator showcases Spierer of Internet

06:09.680 --> 06:11.480
Explorer 10.

06:11.710 --> 06:15.190
And so you can see that it had the word Thief of Thieves.

06:15.190 --> 06:17.590
That is why it described that thief.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.760
Key word from here and it's gay and it gave me here.

06:20.920 --> 06:27.100
So this is how the blog for ex-gays because blogs are so important for a web site and wordpress thinks

06:27.240 --> 06:28.610
of every web site.

06:28.740 --> 06:29.210
OK.

06:29.230 --> 06:31.160
Like you must not need the blog.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.430
Ok you must be like OK I just need to home about.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.320
Contact us.

06:34.390 --> 06:40.420
I want to learn designing part by telling this blog but please understand this guys because in future

06:40.450 --> 06:41.800
you might need it.

06:41.940 --> 06:42.260
OK.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.680
So there's nothing you can say.

06:45.880 --> 06:50.840
So let's just go ahead and let's just work that the blog of our website.

06:50.980 --> 06:53.870
OK let's just see how can we add posts to our website.

06:54.010 --> 06:56.180
And how can we just work with it.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.790
So I'm going to go to my dashboard right now quickly.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.980
OK this is my dashboard here I am logged in.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.550
OK and I am going to close this.

07:06.580 --> 07:13.650

07:13.840 --> 07:16.210
OK how we add that.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.790
So let's suppose that I want to add a new post.

07:18.790 --> 07:19.340
OK.

07:19.390 --> 07:24.910
Like an incident happened at iTunes yelled out come like a thief got arrested.

07:24.920 --> 07:39.040
So it says a T got arrested by the CEO OK CEO is the CBI.

07:39.210 --> 07:39.550
OK.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.810

07:41.830 --> 07:45.410
Copy this and so let's put it this is my content for this year.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.130
OK.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.360
And I'm going to paste it.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.540
So let's just add it here.

07:49.540 --> 07:54.760

08:16.960 --> 08:17.320
OK.

08:17.470 --> 08:22.940
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit insert into post.

08:23.020 --> 08:23.570
That's all.

08:23.710 --> 08:24.190
OK.

08:24.190 --> 08:25.360
So this will be added here.

08:26.350 --> 08:30.800
I can resize it that how good size I want here and I can do pretty well anything with that.

That right is not working.

08:35.980 --> 08:36.350

So do not worry about this.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.320
People understand this about this.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.390
OK so I can see how people can just go ahead.

09:36.550 --> 09:39.140
They can just add to your blog post.

09:39.250 --> 09:39.600

09:58.180 --> 10:01.480
This is the post that was added by word press.

10:01.480 --> 10:08.530
If I just go to my dashboard and then I go to the post and then I go to a post you can see we have.

And it has no common trade here so it just displays that it has no comments but it has.

10:19.660 --> 10:25.600
If I just go ahead and I just open up this post then you can see this is also a post that was created

10:25.600 --> 10:29.110
by Wordpress and it says a WordPress commenter.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.160

10:56.530 --> 11:03.910
How can you create a page that basically displays all your latest news like you can see that Apple had

11:03.970 --> 11:05.240

11:05.350 --> 11:08.130
OK if you just go to like Apple dot com.

If you just go to deer you can see that we go down we go down and have this news room right here.

11:14.500 --> 11:20.790
So Apple created this newsroom page that to show all the recent posts that attack.

11:20.810 --> 11:25.390

11:28.570 --> 11:30.510
So we're going to create that.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.580
