00:09.260 --> 00:13.490
you can see that we are here and now in this video we're going to be moving on with the header image

00:13.520 --> 00:16.750
so we will be covering the slider later on.

00:16.820 --> 00:22.820
First I think we should discuss the hetter image OK.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.180
So what you have to do you just have to come here and you have to click this guy right here.

00:27.190 --> 00:27.510
OK.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.900
First you have to add a new section and then we can delete the premise one section you can not delete

00:31.900 --> 00:32.770
it right now.

00:32.890 --> 00:33.530
OK.

00:33.530 --> 00:34.410
Hey we'll be here.

00:34.570 --> 00:36.740
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to click this guy right here.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.290
OK.

00:37.390 --> 00:39.570
And this is saying insert section.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.260
What I'm going to do.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.260
I'm just going to click this a full.

00:42.450 --> 00:42.880
OK.

00:42.970 --> 00:45.600
And then I won the full fit header.

00:45.780 --> 00:46.670
OK.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.390
This is done.

00:47.470 --> 00:50.960
I'm just going to click here and you can see this is right here.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.210
So I'm just going to come here.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.320
I'm going to come here to the back row here and I want to select the image.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.880
So here you can see that.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.220
Let me just close it right now again.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.890
Let me do it from start again so that you may understand it.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.180
OK.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.670
I'm just going to delete this section.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.700
We just entered the visual builder.

01:06.940 --> 01:11.300
We came here we clicked this section OK and then I click this full of red.

01:11.430 --> 01:11.910
OK.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.640
And then after looking for that it is giving me some modules that I can add.

01:15.640 --> 01:21.850
So in the DVH what we say divi language we basically call these Madill.

01:21.850 --> 01:22.330
OK.

01:22.450 --> 01:28.530
So if I want to add I can add full width code I can add the full at map image for that menu portfolio.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.670
Post-Labor post-Idol for its.

01:30.910 --> 01:31.420
Anything.

01:31.500 --> 01:31.920
OK.

01:32.140 --> 01:35.210
But I will be moving on for the full vid Hetter.

01:35.230 --> 01:35.780
OK.

01:35.950 --> 01:39.510
I'm just going to click here and it can see a new thing is right here.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.160
OK here we can manage this.

01:42.190 --> 01:46.030
So you have two options three options that how you want this to appear.

01:46.030 --> 01:50.020
So if you want it to just add on sidebar You can also work with this.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.890
If I just click here you can see that it is right here on the sidebar.

01:53.020 --> 02:02.600
And I think that it makes it easy to use because if we have all of your also shifted in turn OK an element

02:02.630 --> 02:05.070
Tor is also like this.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.640
So if you want if you want to be like this you can also click here and if you don't want it you'll just

02:09.640 --> 02:11.700
click here and see it is now like this.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.500
So you can just pretty old track it.

02:13.540 --> 02:17.220
Any fear you want if you want to look at the full screen basically.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.180
OK.

02:18.460 --> 02:19.780
So I'm just going to clicking.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.680
I'm just going click here so that it is right here and I can see exactly what I am doing.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.950
So if I want to just put it here I can also do it like this as well.

02:29.070 --> 02:29.700
OK.

02:29.950 --> 02:35.620
I'm just going to bring this to the foresight that I have a screen right here where I can manage everything.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.140
OK so first of all you need a background image because that is important.

02:39.250 --> 02:39.600
OK.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.760
And for background image we need to go to and splashed out.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.370
OK.

02:43.450 --> 02:48.730
And here we have to basically download the image we have to resize that image and then we have to move

02:48.730 --> 02:49.090
forward.

02:49.090 --> 02:53.560
So since I'm making an event management based website I'm just going to come here I'm going to search

02:53.560 --> 02:59.050
for Evy E.A. and I'm going to hit enter and again see it is exploring these images.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.950
I'm just going to grab an image that attracts people

03:08.390 --> 03:14.740
to a thing like this one I can move on with this one right here or let's just search for a marriage

03:18.270 --> 03:18.930
so

03:24.390 --> 03:25.270
I don't know.

03:25.560 --> 03:25.820
OK.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.150
Always go back to the event one.

03:28.300 --> 03:28.530
OK.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.640
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to shoot for event.

03:30.660 --> 03:34.020
And then you'll search it into an issue some more like here.

03:34.020 --> 03:40.120
OK so it's going to be a celebration audience crowd or something like that.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.420
So I'm just going to go with

03:47.320 --> 03:48.380
this image right here.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.250
OK.

03:49.570 --> 03:50.340
This is right here.

03:50.350 --> 03:51.200
And I want to download this.

03:51.220 --> 03:51.760
OK.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.550
This is right here and now I have to go to the Photoshop pray here.

03:54.550 --> 03:56.930
I want to open up the Photoshop and then I have to resize it.

03:56.930 --> 04:01.830
So if you don't have the Photoshop grab it because this is really important to resize the images and

04:01.830 --> 04:02.910
we've all been resizing it.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.750
What you have to do you have just come here to the file way here.

04:06.170 --> 04:06.700

right here.

04:43.940 --> 04:47.000
So now I have to hit enter.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.780
You have to hit enter and that's all.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.240

05:07.290 --> 05:08.960
I'm going to go with s still pray here.

05:09.060 --> 05:17.500
And I want to save it as you know I'm PNB And let's just create a new folder.

05:18.510 --> 05:19.080
OK.

05:19.430 --> 05:22.060
I'm going to create a new folder here.

05:22.340 --> 05:30.420
Let's click this guy and I'm going to name it as a complete blue P course I can open it up.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.540
I'm just going to add it and it should be.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.260
We can name it as as tree head.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.540
Viji PNB.

05:40.550 --> 05:43.940

OK and now we have to hit save and we have to hit OK.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.860
And I can see that this image should be saved right now.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.000
So I'm just going to come here.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.750
I'm just going to come here right here again.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.380
I'm going to click Vikrant right here.

05:53.420 --> 05:53.810
OK.

05:53.900 --> 05:59.050
And now I have to select these so you can see this is basically used for color.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.860
This is used for Ingredion if I want to add a creating an effect we will discuss it if I want to use

06:04.940 --> 06:05.510
an image.

06:05.550 --> 06:08.750
I have to use this and if I want to add a video I can add this.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.780
OK so we will be discussing all of them in detail.

06:11.850 --> 06:15.860
OK I have to just click this image because I want to add image and you can see that how professional

06:15.860 --> 06:17.040
website it's going to look.

06:17.250 --> 06:17.580
OK.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.040
You guys yourself will decide it.

06:19.050 --> 06:19.930
OK.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.690
I'm just going to go I'm here to upload file.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.100
I'm going to go to select File.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.040
I'm going to go to the saw pray here and see the PC and I'm going to grab this and you can see that

06:28.040 --> 06:29.990
it should be uploaded right here so you can go.

06:30.110 --> 06:35.090
So you can make pretty well any type of website since I'm creating a website for event management or

06:35.090 --> 06:36.080
something like that.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.820
That is why I want to create a website for that so you can see this is being uploaded.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.320
Here we go.

06:41.330 --> 06:45.680
I'm just going to click here upload an image and here should be the image in here should be the background

06:45.710 --> 06:46.040
images.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.300
Well here we go.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.210
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit enter.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.300
So you can see this is right here.

06:52.550 --> 06:57.110
And what I'm going to do I'm just going to bring my mouse to right here so that I can delay this action.

06:57.140 --> 06:57.660
OK.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.390
On deleting this it is right.

06:59.390 --> 06:59.940
Gone.

07:00.110 --> 07:00.380
OK.

07:00.380 --> 07:05.360
And now here is my background image that is coming and we will now be working up for this.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.080
I'm just going to come here to the gear icon.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.630
You can see I can add anything right here.

07:09.770 --> 07:10.900
OK in the module.

07:11.030 --> 07:16.730
OK I can just click here you can see I can eat anything I can add a full width header.

07:16.730 --> 07:21.180
I can either for that image I can have a full menu portfolio or anything.

07:21.320 --> 07:26.180
Ok but what I have to do I basically need to just work this one that is already here.

07:26.180 --> 07:31.340
So if you have any confusions that are your modules what you can do you can just click here and then

07:31.340 --> 07:32.310
you can click here.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.090
So it's going to tell you that we have a new section right here.

07:35.090 --> 07:37.510
And then inside this we have a full head.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.150
So then you can edit it easily and if you want to see it then you can click here and you can see this

07:42.150 --> 07:42.940
is right now.

07:43.190 --> 07:44.170
So this is how it works.

07:44.180 --> 07:44.770
OK.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.050
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to click this guy right here because I'm going to work for this

07:48.050 --> 07:50.050
Hetter the Madill settings.

07:50.090 --> 07:50.380
OK.

07:50.390 --> 07:53.540
And here are the settings right here show I want to I want to add the title.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.250
So for a title I want to add

07:59.070 --> 08:01.460
so here would be next.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.040
Door events.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.320
OK.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.530
This is my Basically the name.

08:10.830 --> 08:11.180
OK.

08:11.190 --> 08:20.120
And then I have the subheading the best the best event

08:23.370 --> 08:24.210
management

08:28.320 --> 08:28.820
company

08:33.510 --> 08:34.820
ok cool.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.880
Now I want to make it light.

08:36.930 --> 08:41.710
So I'm just going to come here to the design right here and I want to go to the text right here.

08:41.790 --> 08:42.170
OK.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.580
And then I have to choose the text color and it is going to be light.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.400
OK so you can see this is now visible.

08:47.700 --> 08:47.970
OK.

08:47.970 --> 08:51.060
And you can see this is already looking a bit good.

08:51.210 --> 08:51.510
OK.

08:51.510 --> 08:54.190
Not very good but somehow a bit good.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.680
OK what I'm going to do right now I am just going to go to the concentrate here again and you can see

08:58.680 --> 08:58.860
that.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.950
Here are the things that we can worry about.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.250
So we have text right here.

09:02.280 --> 09:06.060
We have the bird and Ray here and then we have to put into it so we can add to it and right here if

09:06.060 --> 09:10.330
I just add Hello and a will and Hello.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.050
So you can add two buttons right here.

09:12.080 --> 09:12.820
OK.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.700
I'm just going to come here.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.560
I'm just going to like.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.140
So we need just one button.

09:17.160 --> 09:17.510
OK.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.160
And that is going to be or should you we can add two words if you want to.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.130
So this is going to be about us

09:26.790 --> 09:27.630
contact us

09:30.620 --> 09:30.910
right.

09:30.910 --> 09:35.320
These two are coming right here and then we can put it anywhere we can design it where we want it to

09:35.320 --> 09:35.730
be.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.520
OK.

09:36.520 --> 09:42.250
So we can also add them with our own thing that we can also add a new section we can assign a background

09:42.250 --> 09:47.030
event background image and then we can add the modules so we can also do it.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.290
The data will also show you that that mattered.

09:49.300 --> 09:56.310
But you can see that DV has a great look and feel but Elementary does not have.

09:56.350 --> 10:01.900
I don't know why I'm in love for this so I'm just going to go to the lengths so we can at it but you

10:01.900 --> 10:03.020
are already here.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.600
So for about us it's going to take us to the About page you can add a slash Ray here and then you can

10:07.600 --> 10:08.540
read about.

10:08.530 --> 10:12.620
So how it is going to work it's going to work like this as 3D complete of course.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.730
Now slash.

10:13.840 --> 10:18.830
And then this you know and it's going to be slash contact.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.780
So let's go ahead and save.

10:21.340 --> 10:24.100
And here we are done with our website like this.

10:24.100 --> 10:30.010
I can and just try it and drop it tray here so you can see this is increasing but this is not ok.

10:30.010 --> 10:33.030
The reason behind this is we have to worry Connett how we'll do that.

10:33.040 --> 10:39.000
We have to just click the gear icon OK and then we have to move to the design.

10:39.160 --> 10:39.640
OK.

10:39.730 --> 10:42.460
And then we have to go down and sees the spacing.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.390
So I'm just gonna add the batting right here spatting is basically inside this.

10:46.420 --> 10:46.930
OK.

10:46.990 --> 10:52.180
And the margin is basically out so I guess if I just add any padding right here you can see this is

10:52.180 --> 10:53.190
increasing like this.

10:53.190 --> 10:57.320
So so so we have to add the padding to the top and the bottom right here.

10:57.310 --> 11:05.650
So I'm just going to add I think 200 pixels from the top and I have to add 200 pixels from the bottom.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.430
So this is how it is looking.

11:07.970 --> 11:08.910
OK.

11:08.950 --> 11:14.150
What I want to do I want an overlay array here and that is going to be a background overlay color.

11:14.320 --> 11:22.210
So the backroad overly color is going to be.

11:22.630 --> 11:26.460
So we need to focus on the black and the golden OK.

11:27.070 --> 11:27.880
If I choose this

11:31.020 --> 11:34.300
choose to block I think black looks good

11:37.420 --> 11:39.370
let's increase it more increase it more.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.290
And that we go.

11:41.290 --> 11:43.510
So this is looking like the backroom overlay.

11:43.630 --> 11:48.840
OK you can see this is how it's looking next door events the best of it management company about us

11:48.850 --> 11:49.760
contact us.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.460
OK.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.870
And now we have to design this.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.970
So how will design this feel just where you could the design of the title text title text.

11:56.110 --> 12:01.000
Conduct's decks are getting decks but I'm not into using spacing waterparks shade of filters and any

12:01.050 --> 12:03.090
animation as well.

12:03.140 --> 12:03.500
Right.

12:03.550 --> 12:10.400
So what we're going to do right now is if we just come here and then we try to add a background right

12:10.450 --> 12:11.620
here with this

12:24.920 --> 12:31.970
OK I'm going to come here and I'm going to come here and I'm going to just decrease the transparency

12:31.970 --> 12:35.060
so you can also add accreting effect if you want to.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.590
OK let's come here to the design.

12:36.860 --> 12:41.390
Let's get here to the overlay and let's just make it fully transparent.

12:41.420 --> 12:41.720
OK.

12:41.720 --> 12:46.440
And you can see how this is looking so you can add pretty well the combination of two colors right here.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.320
You just have to remove the background overlay.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.920
You don't have to add any background overly You just have to go to the content and then you have to

12:51.920 --> 12:54.660
go to the back.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.310
And then you have to work with a color right here.

12:57.350 --> 12:57.810
OK.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.460
So then you can see you have to click here.

13:00.470 --> 13:01.990
This is the image basically.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.890
And this is the gradient so you have to select it.

13:04.910 --> 13:10.280
OK this will be said to know you have to come here to Creedon and then you have to select a place gradient

13:10.370 --> 13:11.150
above the image.

13:11.150 --> 13:14.300
So we want to add that gradient above the image.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.900
And here we can work on it.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.290
OK.

13:16.310 --> 13:19.320
How how how it will look.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.900
I think we want to focus on the gold and in the black.

13:23.030 --> 13:26.510
So I'm going to stick with the black first OK.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.460
And this would be golden.

13:29.540 --> 13:29.970
Cool.

13:30.110 --> 13:30.590
OK.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.690
And I want to decrease it more.

13:35.180 --> 13:35.510
OK.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.420
Let's make it a full color.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.860
What I'm going to do right now I want to just go with this to be linear.

13:41.930 --> 13:45.910
So linear is like a line and radial is basically a circle.

13:46.010 --> 13:46.490
OK.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.680
So we'll be working up to this later on.

13:48.690 --> 13:53.460
Or have we just work with the leadership basically we focusing on the design of the head.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.210
Right now the reason is that because the header catches everything.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.410
OK.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.800
Yes the red the header catches everything.

14:02.860 --> 14:03.400
OK.

14:03.410 --> 14:08.780
Because this is your first impression of say the person.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.350
Can I see.

14:09.490 --> 14:09.900
OK.

14:09.910 --> 14:15.240
And then we have the indirection so you can change the direction how we want the Korean to be on degree.

14:15.260 --> 14:22.110
So I'm just going to choose them to be this this tard position is going to be like this as well.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.750
And the and position

14:35.900 --> 14:36.300
OK.

14:36.340 --> 14:41.950
I want to increase it decrease it till here and decrease it till here.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.860
So you can see this effect.

14:44.150 --> 14:49.270
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here and I'm going to increase decrease this opacity.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.190
So this is now gaining it.

14:51.420 --> 14:57.090
Hey I'm just going to increase it more from say OK cool.

14:57.210 --> 14:57.510
OK.

14:57.510 --> 15:02.130
You can see how this is looking so you can pretty well change it to be like how you want it to be.

15:02.160 --> 15:07.080
You won this direction you can also choose it to be on 90 degree which is straight.

15:07.080 --> 15:12.250
If I just choose it to be 90 you can see it is trade right now.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.980
And if I just match these positions

15:20.280 --> 15:25.960
you can see now this position is right here so you can also pretty well do it like this that we did

15:25.990 --> 15:30.780
in the module if that OK if I just click here and can see how this is.

15:30.790 --> 15:33.840
So you can't add anything right here as well if you want to add.

15:34.030 --> 15:34.570
OK.

15:34.570 --> 15:35.820
You can have that.

15:35.890 --> 15:39.030
So I'm just going to click here again and I'm going to manage this.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.350
I'm just going to double click it.

15:40.630 --> 15:46.610
And here we want to go to town and then back home we have to work on it.

15:46.780 --> 15:53.250
OK I'm just gonna click here and I want to click here to the Korean direction.

15:53.270 --> 15:54.500
This looks cool as well.

15:55.990 --> 16:01.910
If I just press enter.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.280
This looks cool I think.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.280
OK.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.090
Now what I'm going to do.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.430
I'm just going to double click here.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.550
And I want to go to the design we need to basically design this.

16:11.550 --> 16:13.230
I'm just going to go to the concentrate here.

16:13.350 --> 16:18.780
And I want to make it not the full line but I want to make it a little bit of blurry so that it doesn't

16:18.900 --> 16:19.540
look bad.

16:19.590 --> 16:19.860
OK.

16:19.860 --> 16:24.900
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go to discovery here and I want to choose the end position

16:24.900 --> 16:31.420
to be increased.

16:31.510 --> 16:35.580
So now you can see this is giving the effect right here

16:39.710 --> 16:48.110
I want to increase this to that it goes above and I want it to be 100 percent CT.

16:48.300 --> 16:48.650
OK.

16:48.720 --> 16:54.750
Now I want to go to the design right here and I want to go to the title text so title text is going

16:54.750 --> 16:55.050
to be.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.280
Let's bring the whole text to be in the center.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.890
So we're going to do this.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.470
OK.

17:01.470 --> 17:02.880
Let's go to the title text first.

17:02.910 --> 17:07.230
Let's bring this to the center and I want to increase the size of it.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.900
Ok cool.

17:13.910 --> 17:16.740
Now here we can manage with the color stuff.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.740
And Van so I'm going to choose the golden OK.

17:21.980 --> 17:23.530
The full golden right here.

17:25.050 --> 17:25.580
Court.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.560
OK.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.360
What I'm going to do.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.620
I'm just going to work this case right here that is to some but we first want to work with the title

17:32.620 --> 17:36.510
font so it is going to be a light full light to that.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.800
It is not very bold.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.290
OK.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.650
And that will work with this.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.350
I want to use open hands.

17:44.570 --> 17:46.530
Ok cool.

17:46.570 --> 17:52.300
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to go down and I want to give some spacing so that it looks

17:52.300 --> 17:52.800
great.

17:53.780 --> 17:54.860
That we go OK.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.720
And I want to go down.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.290
And here we have the context.

17:59.390 --> 18:01.170
So I think this is the content text.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.180
No this is not the Kundan text.

18:03.230 --> 18:06.480
I'm just going to go to the subhead text and I want to bring this to center as well.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.900
So you can see disarray here.

18:09.110 --> 18:14.020
I think it looks create a video right color and then we have to work good these buttons.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.010
OK.

18:16.060 --> 18:19.030
Or if I just may get the full the normal color.

18:19.370 --> 18:22.420
This one this one looks cool as well.

18:22.450 --> 18:24.130
So I'm just going to make it

18:31.310 --> 18:31.870
cool.

18:32.180 --> 18:32.510
OK.

18:32.530 --> 18:35.020
I wanted to bring these to the center as well.

18:35.020 --> 18:42.950
So let's go to the button one and use custom tiles for button 1 and use custom sales for it too as well.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.050
Let's go down let's go to the button to

18:51.860 --> 18:52.340
it.

18:52.490 --> 18:53.490
I'm just going to bring it.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.630
I'm just going to bring this used custom sales.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.480
OK.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.430
Now I want to work for the button one first.

18:58.430 --> 19:02.580
I want to I want it to be in the center so it should be.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.240
It can be all right or left

19:10.700 --> 19:11.660
OK.

19:18.810 --> 19:20.640
Put into subheadings.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.410
So I want to bring this to Centuri here.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.600
Let's go to let's go to this guy right here.

19:25.610 --> 19:30.560
Let's go to the text and let's see if we have some things for the button so we cannot allow scientists

19:30.560 --> 19:31.730
to send from here.

19:31.800 --> 19:37.040
We have to work to lay out and logo and text orientation should be the center so everything is center

19:37.040 --> 19:39.170
so we can go with the layout and make it do that.

19:39.260 --> 19:41.140
So we can also make it the full screen.

19:41.260 --> 19:41.560
OK.

19:41.570 --> 19:42.910
How does full screen is going to work.

19:42.920 --> 19:51.170
Is that will work for you or it will get it will get the size of your LCD or the LCD that you have and

19:51.170 --> 19:51.930
it'll work with that.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.890
I'm just going to know so that because I want that custom.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.630
And then we have the about us and contact us.

19:58.150 --> 19:58.730
OK.

19:58.910 --> 20:02.180
Now we have to go with this one.

20:02.590 --> 20:08.930
I want to go with it use custom Syal and the button text color symbol and text color is going to be

20:08.930 --> 20:09.410
Plack

20:12.640 --> 20:13.050
this

20:23.590 --> 20:24.620
ok cool.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.480
And now I want to go with the button to color.

20:27.490 --> 20:38.580
So but in one font would be open Sans.

20:38.620 --> 20:39.570
This also looks good.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.370
Let's apply to this guy right here.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.060
OK.

20:42.250 --> 20:48.520
I'm going to go to the design right here and I want to go to the Title X ray here.

20:48.550 --> 20:55.290
I want to go to the open sands and let's just go with this any use your telescope next door events.

20:55.300 --> 20:55.560
OK.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.770
This looks amazing.

20:56.770 --> 21:01.560
So I'm going to go to discovery here because the burden should be the normal.

21:01.570 --> 21:02.830
So I'm just going to go down.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.500
And here we want to use the default one.

21:05.500 --> 21:10.780
So let's go to the button to Ray here and let's go to Customs dials.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.690
So I'm but I'm.

21:12.790 --> 21:18.960
Sorry but anyone right here and let's go to the phone tray here and let's use the open sense

21:22.430 --> 21:22.990

21:23.000 --> 21:27.030
We have about us and then we have the contact us next door events.

21:27.170 --> 21:28.120
OK.

21:28.130 --> 21:29.960
The best event management company.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.460
So here now we have to worry about an icon.

21:33.460 --> 21:39.380
So if you want to use any of the icon for about us I think here should be a person or person icon.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.190
So

21:42.960 --> 21:54.190
a personal profile or something like that so this can be good as well about us or this can work well

21:54.490 --> 21:54.930
about us.

21:54.940 --> 21:55.330
I think

22:08.330 --> 22:08.590
yes.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.050
I think for about us it is looking good.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.550
I'm just going to go to the button Turei here.

22:14.270 --> 22:14.870
OK.

22:14.870 --> 22:23.250
And then I have to go down and I want to change the font of this sorry the icon.

22:23.270 --> 22:28.510
So for this I'm going to choose contact for contact

22:33.170 --> 22:33.660
cool.

22:33.750 --> 22:39.230
So we have this guy here next door event the best event management company.

22:39.360 --> 22:44.950
And then we have about us and the contact us so you can see that we are totally done with the header

22:44.970 --> 22:49.140
section and this is how our header is looking.

22:49.930 --> 22:52.770
I think it is good as it is looking good.

22:52.830 --> 22:57.220
OK we can also give some speccing from the button because I think it is recommended.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.780
So I'm just gonna come here.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.630
I'm going to go from here to the design Ray here.

23:00.630 --> 23:03.600
I'm going to go to the button one right here and

23:17.110 --> 23:20.740
OK I want to give the some spacing to the.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.800
And right here.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.360
So I'm going to go to.

23:23.500 --> 23:23.930
OK.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.740
Let's go to the subhead text.

23:25.750 --> 23:26.170
OK.

23:26.350 --> 23:30.010
And let's just give some light height to the subhead next.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.220
OK.

23:31.270 --> 23:32.240
Let's increase it.

23:36.580 --> 23:37.720
And there we go.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.470
It looks cool.

23:38.680 --> 23:44.450
Hey I'm just going to click here and this is how it is looking next door events about us contact us.

23:44.450 --> 23:44.870
Cool.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.730
So you can see that this is how our header is looking right now.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.500
OK.

23:49.630 --> 23:50.740
We can work for this.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.510
We can change it.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.120
We can change it design.

23:53.140 --> 23:53.480
OK.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.620
You have to just come here.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.570
You have to just manage.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.480
Just lay out OK.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.530
You have to click this guy.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.500
And then here you can manage it so you can see this is looking pretty amazing.

24:04.690 --> 24:09.560
This DVH is basically really really really really complicated.

24:09.670 --> 24:10.740
OK.

24:11.470 --> 24:15.710
And it will just take a lot of time for you to understand.

24:15.870 --> 24:16.790
OK.

24:16.930 --> 24:21.650
I'm just going to come here and you can also add a color if you want to before it.

24:21.790 --> 24:22.080
OK.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.570
But since we have added the fact that is why we're here.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.260
We're just taking the creating defect right now.

24:27.400 --> 24:27.700
OK.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.770
You can also manage this with this if you want to.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.350
So it will be like this.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.990
And it is now 180 degree.

24:34.190 --> 24:35.910
OK let me add one.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.090
OK.

24:38.180 --> 24:41.890
And you can move on with this that how you want to create an effect to be.

24:41.910 --> 24:45.400
So you can add it right here on the button section.

24:45.570 --> 24:47.940
OK so this is how you can manage it.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.950
You can also do it like this if you want to and this is full sharp.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.760
You can see this is fully sharp so you can work with this as well.

24:57.890 --> 25:01.730
So it is going to increase it because I want it to be normal.

25:01.940 --> 25:05.870
So now I think we're done with our Hetter section right here.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.650
We can pretty well do anything.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.070
If you want to duplicate this section we can also duplicate it.

25:10.070 --> 25:14.530
So let's just move on and create some other effects with this header.

25:14.530 --> 25:14.990
OK.

25:15.080 --> 25:20.090
I'm just going to come here to the Madill say things and I'm going to go to down below and here in the

25:20.220 --> 25:25.440
background I have to just work with this gradient and I'm going to choose the radial so you can see

25:25.510 --> 25:26.930
radial is like this.

25:26.930 --> 25:32.800
And I can just work for the position right here so you can see now how is this looking.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.380
And let's just move it and position a bit

25:49.130 --> 25:50.200
OK.

25:50.370 --> 25:52.750
You can see yourself that how it is.

25:52.770 --> 25:57.230
If I just choose a 0 percent OK.

25:57.250 --> 26:02.030
This is looking like a son so I can just make this hard position to be more like this.

26:02.890 --> 26:09.130
OK you can move on this as well if you want to you can increase the end position to make it look much

26:09.130 --> 26:09.620
better.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.220
OK.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.540
This is also looking cool.

26:11.590 --> 26:14.020
So you can pretty well do anything with this.

26:14.150 --> 26:14.520
OK.

26:14.590 --> 26:15.520
Let's just go ahead.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.500
Let's hit enter.

26:16.570 --> 26:17.940
Let's get this section.

26:17.950 --> 26:18.290
OK.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.900
This is Fred just click it.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.330
You can see the section is going to be duplicated.

26:22.390 --> 26:24.540
So it's just work with more.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.230
OK.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.140
I'm just going to go with the module settings.

26:29.250 --> 26:29.880
OK.

26:29.930 --> 26:43.220
And let's just go to the content tray here and instead of as a background image I will add all the looking

26:43.220 --> 26:43.640
great.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.440
OK.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.180
So you can see you can also move on this if you want them here.

26:47.210 --> 26:51.410
And here is the image that is coming I'm just going to go to the sitting tray here and I'm going to

26:51.410 --> 26:56.310
go to the background and I'm going to use the parallax effect.

26:56.350 --> 26:56.800
OK.

26:56.870 --> 26:58.870
I'm just going to go do the C assessment.

26:59.110 --> 26:59.410
OK.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.490
So this is how the parallax is working.

27:01.530 --> 27:05.270
I you have to just come here and I have to use user created and above the image.

27:05.450 --> 27:09.730
OK so if you're using the parallax you can see this is not working.

27:09.740 --> 27:11.800
So on parallax it will not work.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.830
You have to make sure that you disable the parallax and it will only work with that.

27:15.830 --> 27:22.100
So this is how it is looking and I think you have to decide that which suits you which slider should

27:22.460 --> 27:27.250
say OK we have this type of Fedder and we have this type of header and we have this type of header.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.270
So you can decide which letters suits you.

27:29.270 --> 27:30.650
And then you can move on with this.

27:30.800 --> 27:36.060
So I think I like this one so I'll be just moving on this.

27:36.080 --> 27:36.920
I'm just going to come here.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.340
I'm going to hit each section.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.460
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit delete section so this is coming right here.

27:42.470 --> 27:43.870
So this is my Web site OK.

27:43.940 --> 27:49.060
And if you just did it and anything from mistake here to just press controls Z and it will be back.

27:49.130 --> 27:54.580
And if I just think that I like this one then I'll just come here and I'll delete this one.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.070
OK.

27:55.190 --> 27:57.470
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit save.

27:57.570 --> 28:02.840
I'm using this because I think it looks much professional and I want to build a business professional

28:02.900 --> 28:03.140
site.

28:03.170 --> 28:03.720
OK.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.310
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit save and you can see that my slider is safe.

28:07.400 --> 28:12.780
So thanks a lot guys who are watching this in the next video we'll be working on with our services section

28:12.920 --> 28:14.550
about Section and more.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.530
So by.
