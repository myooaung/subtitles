00:00.440 --> 00:02.240
Was a guy so it's been a week.

00:02.340 --> 00:02.690
OK.

00:02.700 --> 00:05.990
And you can see that my SSL has been delivered to me.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.230
OK.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.440
So it's been like more than 10 days.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.820
OK you can see this is right here.

00:10.890 --> 00:14.700
Actually I was busy so I did not have much time to record the video.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.110
Mentality if we have got the SSL or not so usually it will take more.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.310
It will take more than 24 hours.

00:21.360 --> 00:21.740
OK.

00:21.780 --> 00:28.620
And you can see that this is Krien padlock that is coming in and takes HTP as they say is that my SSL

00:28.620 --> 00:32.290
has been delivered and this hollowed out aged female is now in here.

00:32.290 --> 00:37.890
So if you just come here and then you add a sheet and Ethans yelled or calm and then you go to this

00:38.210 --> 00:43.940
then you will see that in the general settings you will see this word press you are l and the site address.

00:43.950 --> 00:48.670
So you have to come here and you have to add the s here and also the s here.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.120
OK.

00:49.260 --> 00:54.540
That's all you have to do in the settings and the general you have to come here and then you have to

00:54.540 --> 00:59.350
hit save changes so once you do that you have to wait.

00:59.370 --> 01:01.650
OK you can see that the settings has been saved.

01:01.650 --> 01:09.270
Now let's go to our site on clicking here you can see that I am in my website and if I just track this

01:09.270 --> 01:16.830
I just drop it right here you can see that this is the images are also secured and everything is totally

01:16.830 --> 01:17.930
secured right now.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.600
So you can see that my HDD is finally working.

01:21.720 --> 01:27.460
OK so this might happen that your shitty CPS may not load or it may give you an error.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.380
So what you can do.

01:28.500 --> 01:35.700
You can just go ahead to force the SSL what the plug in or you can just go to the CloudFlare and then

01:35.700 --> 01:43.380
you can go down and you can choose the always use HTP as here and you can go down down and you can select

01:43.500 --> 01:45.460
HTB as read right.

01:45.660 --> 01:46.090
OK.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.340
So that's all you have to do.

01:47.340 --> 01:52.990
You have to just come here and then you have to refresh and then you will see that the HTC B.S. will

01:52.990 --> 01:54.630
be totally up and running.

01:54.930 --> 01:58.530
So now you can see that we're totally done with the DBMS.

01:58.560 --> 02:04.350
If the ACBL doesn't load in your website that what you can do you can just go ahead to plug ins and

02:04.350 --> 02:06.430
then you can go to Add me on.

02:07.060 --> 02:07.700
OK.

02:07.770 --> 02:14.050
And then you have to go to S S L and you have to quit this let's just see.

02:14.570 --> 02:17.230
So I'm going to be going up with the plug in.

02:17.420 --> 02:17.950
OK.

02:18.170 --> 02:25.530
And that is going to be really simple a cell going to be clicking install this is installing the plug

02:25.530 --> 02:25.920
in.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.670
And now here you can see that this is right here.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.940
Going to activate this plug in and that's all.

02:32.240 --> 02:38.000
So after this is activated you just have to go ahead activate SSL that's all.

02:38.120 --> 02:38.560
OK.

02:38.690 --> 02:47.360
So now you'll see that the SSL must be activated so I'm telling you in case if your SSL is not working.

02:47.590 --> 02:48.110
OK.

02:48.260 --> 02:51.010
So now we are totally done with this.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.180
OK so in the next video I'll tell you more.

02:54.220 --> 02:55.360
So goodbye guys.
