WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:01.750
What is up guys.

00:01.780 --> 00:02.300
Welcome back.

00:02.300 --> 00:06.260
So now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you create pages.

00:06.290 --> 00:06.790
OK.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.750
Because we want to create pages and we want to set our website up to not get yourself confused with

00:11.840 --> 00:12.740
any other thing.

00:12.830 --> 00:17.640
You can see we have this design we don't like this it means we don't like this title and everything.

00:17.660 --> 00:18.560
So I get confused.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.350
We are just here for just understanding how WordPress works and maybe you will understand we learn how

00:24.350 --> 00:25.670
to customize it.

00:25.730 --> 00:32.360
So let's just go ahead and let's quickly add a page you can see that if I just go to Home Page a normal

00:32.360 --> 00:37.790
page appears in that it has the hello world and the stuff in it is paused and I know it might be so

00:37.790 --> 00:43.330
confusing you might know about it and you or you might not know about it but just leave it as it is.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.880
Just keep that aside.

00:45.050 --> 00:45.450
OK.

00:45.510 --> 00:48.550
You will understand it later on when we learn everything.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.100
So let's just go ahead and let's quickly add a page.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.270
I'm going to go to this ad Neal.

00:54.400 --> 00:54.840
OK.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.690
This is the button in the dashboard.

00:56.690 --> 01:01.760
You can see that you must be in the dashboard home page and here you must be seeing this pages you have

01:01.760 --> 01:06.460
to just click here and then you have to hit add new and you will be taken to a new page and it says

01:06.620 --> 01:08.240
add a new page.

01:08.390 --> 01:11.700
Ok so I'm going to be naming my this page as the home page.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.290
Ok so I'm going to be naming it as home.

01:14.780 --> 01:15.160
OK.

01:15.260 --> 01:21.020
And then here I'm going to add the content so the content can be anything like you can add something

01:21.800 --> 01:26.210
like hello world or something like that but I'm going to be adding a dummy content for the dummy content.

01:26.300 --> 01:31.480
You can use a Web site called Lipp some lip some lip some dot com.

01:31.580 --> 01:37.790
OK so they give the dummy condom that you can just put on your website and then it will not be a copyright

01:37.850 --> 01:38.120
issue.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.790
So we're just creating a normal based Web site like we are using for testing purposes.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.100
We're not just creating a business based Web site.

01:45.170 --> 01:49.730
That is why I would recommend you to when you are learning everything and actually just copy the content

01:49.970 --> 01:50.500
and paste.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.720
And that should be dummy.

01:51.750 --> 01:56.300
And I'm just going to click generate Lorem Ipsum and this is right here so I'm going to go ahead and

01:56.300 --> 01:58.670
I'm going to quickly copy this.

01:58.670 --> 01:59.990
OK.

02:00.470 --> 02:01.270
Told us.

02:01.400 --> 02:06.320
And I am going to copy and I'm going to come here and I am going to paste it right here so you can see

02:06.620 --> 02:08.960
this is the content that has been pasted.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.660
And this is my whole area.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.490
I can manage everything.

02:13.660 --> 02:14.110
OK.

02:14.150 --> 02:16.530
Like I can make any of the content bold.

02:16.550 --> 02:18.770
I can make any of the conduct in a bullet to the list.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.450
Let's suppose that I going to add this to be like bulled.

02:21.540 --> 02:21.990
OK.

02:22.070 --> 02:22.880
Like this.

02:22.880 --> 02:23.960
And I want to make it bold.

02:24.050 --> 02:29.060
You can see this is what I want to make it the headings so I'm going to make it down and I'm going to

02:29.060 --> 02:34.190
select this and I'm going to make select here and I'm going to change it to be like headings so you

02:34.190 --> 02:40.040
can play with this if you know Microsoft Word how Microsoft Word works then you must know how everything

02:40.040 --> 02:45.740
works you guys should know how the bulleted list works and how everything works and you can just play

02:45.740 --> 02:46.280
around with it.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.660
Let's just go ahead and let's add a bulleted list.

02:49.790 --> 02:50.130
OK.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.700
That can be like an ordered list or something like that.

02:52.730 --> 02:56.780
So I'm just going to add one two three.

02:56.870 --> 03:01.410
And so this is how you can see on pressing enter a new ball it comes.

03:01.430 --> 03:04.090
And if I just double press enter this will be gone.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.190
So this is outworks.

03:05.210 --> 03:05.720
OK.

03:05.720 --> 03:12.170
Now let's just go ahead and let's just publish this so I'm just clicking the Publish you'll see that

03:12.170 --> 03:17.110
my page will be published so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to make it publish.

03:17.320 --> 03:17.740
OK.

03:17.900 --> 03:24.250
And he can see that we have designed our first home page and let's just go ahead and let's open it up

03:24.260 --> 03:29.030
so I'm just clicking here you can see that it says it NZL dot com slash home.

03:29.030 --> 03:32.300
And this is my homepage that is coming so it stays home.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.020
And here is a condo and everything.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.740
I know this the look doesn't look good.

03:36.770 --> 03:40.820
I'm telling you once again guys do not worry about the styling.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.120
Just learn WordPress right now.

03:43.310 --> 03:48.690
Understand that you'll see how amazing Web sites are created we will create every type of apps.

03:48.740 --> 03:49.210
OK.

03:49.220 --> 03:53.840
So do not get confused and do not just rush into it like I want to know everything.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.960
OK so now you can see how crazy this is looking.

03:56.960 --> 04:02.570
We have got the we know now how to create pages and this is how our page is looking.

04:02.690 --> 04:03.070
OK.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.150
So let's just quickly add the About page and the contact page as well.

04:08.360 --> 04:15.730
So I'm going to go ahead and I am going to click here add new OK and let's just go ahead and let's add

04:15.820 --> 04:17.990

04:18.020 --> 04:26.600
OK and let's come here and let's copy this trade here copy and let's paste it so you have to copy the

04:26.600 --> 04:29.440
content that is the Lorem Ipsum from Lipscombe dot com.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.130
OK.

04:30.140 --> 04:35.540
And then what you have to do you have to just hit publish so you can see that now we have created our

04:35.540 --> 04:36.920
about this page as well.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.010
Let's quickly go ahead and open this up in New Tab and you can see how it is looking so this is about

04:43.010 --> 04:43.550
us.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.570
We also have created the home and now we have to create the conduct of spades.

04:47.570 --> 04:51.490
I'm just going to click add new right here again and let's name it.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.260
Contact us.

04:54.340 --> 05:00.150
So I'm just going be telling you a different design here so that you get you guys can play with it here.

05:00.150 --> 05:04.060
OK let's just click here and you can see a new bar is coming up here.

05:04.230 --> 05:05.800
So you can pretty well manage for that.

05:05.940 --> 05:06.340
OK.

05:06.510 --> 05:12.620
And now here I want to make it like phone number OK.

05:12.770 --> 05:22.540
And then here I want to add the phone numbers so they can be like plus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.420
OK.

05:23.510 --> 05:26.910
And then let's just go ahead and let's add an email address.

05:29.050 --> 05:29.430
OK.

05:29.560 --> 05:36.010
And that can be like info at the rate Aitan Ziel dot com.

05:37.180 --> 05:37.820
OK.

05:37.890 --> 05:39.990
And then we have the next one.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.400
So don't worry about this e-mail.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.040
I'll show you how can you create a domain based email.

05:44.100 --> 05:44.580
OK.

05:45.440 --> 05:56.170
Now let's quickly just go ahead and add one more thing and that is the address so address area number

05:56.950 --> 05:57.430
two

06:00.940 --> 06:12.010
block seven US and then here I'm going to be adding the zip code so I can see that this is my phone

06:12.010 --> 06:12.400
number.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.340
This is my email address and this is my address.

06:15.340 --> 06:15.790
OK.

06:15.880 --> 06:21.610
Now let's see we want to design this so for a phone number let's suppose that I want to make a different

06:21.610 --> 06:22.220
color.

06:22.350 --> 06:22.700
OK.

06:22.810 --> 06:27.620
I want to make it like blue OK.

06:28.080 --> 06:28.900
This is blue.

06:28.950 --> 06:38.440
And for the e-mail address let's make it bold as well OK so that it is bold and just easy to view.

06:38.510 --> 06:41.110
We want to just work the e-mail address as well.

06:41.320 --> 06:41.700
OK.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.050
Let's just select it.

06:43.280 --> 06:49.330
Let's keep it bold and let's choose a different color here so that that is a light blue.

06:49.460 --> 06:49.820
OK.

06:49.940 --> 06:54.310
And for the address I want it to be bold.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.050
OK.

06:55.220 --> 07:01.790
And I also want it to be of more light blue and I want to make it italic and the underline.

07:01.790 --> 07:05.400
So where does underline OK we don't have underlined.

07:05.410 --> 07:09.040
I'm going to press control you OK.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.920
We don't have underlined right here.

07:11.010 --> 07:11.250
OK.

07:11.250 --> 07:11.680
Yes.

07:11.710 --> 07:17.760
On pressing the control you you can basically underline an element so you have to press control and

07:17.760 --> 07:21.500
then you have to add a pit you and the underline will come.

07:21.630 --> 07:22.000
OK.

07:22.140 --> 07:26.870
Now what I have to do I have to just go ahead and I have to hit publish.

07:26.970 --> 07:27.540
OK.

07:27.660 --> 07:31.770
And you can pretty well just work with these as well if you want to make some changes.

07:31.770 --> 07:36.030
Let's just go ahead and let's publish it and let's have a look at this so I'm going to go ahead and

07:36.030 --> 07:38.290
I'm going to view my this page as well.

07:38.810 --> 07:39.240
OK.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.600
So you can see how it is looking we have this phone number.

07:42.690 --> 07:45.200
We have this email address and we have this address.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.930
And this is our just a basic web site like we have the phone number.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.540
We have the e-mail address and we have the address.

07:51.540 --> 07:51.860
OK.

07:52.050 --> 07:56.270
So now we basically know how to add pages.

07:56.280 --> 07:56.720
OK.

07:56.910 --> 08:02.340
So if you just go to the all pages you're going to see all the pages that we have on our Web site so

08:02.340 --> 08:03.840
we have our home page.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.460
We have her about us and we have her contact.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.620
So these three are very important.

08:08.820 --> 08:13.590
And this is the sample page so let's just go ahead and let's quickly delete the sample because this

08:13.590 --> 08:14.720
is not.

08:15.270 --> 08:15.570
Sorry.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.580
I just viewed this.

08:16.680 --> 08:21.270
Let's just go out and let's click trash and let's still be displayed so this page is going to be deleted

08:21.270 --> 08:22.780
and it's going to be in the trash.

08:22.790 --> 08:26.180
So like if you have accidentally deleted you can restore it.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.920
But I'm going to delete it permanently because I don't want this.

08:28.950 --> 08:29.360
OK.

08:29.550 --> 08:36.000
So I'm going to go to the all pages and here I have the main pages which is the home the about S and

08:36.000 --> 08:36.820
the contractors.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.210
OK.

08:37.380 --> 08:44.730
So now when we go to our website home page you can see that this home page is not coming the post this

08:44.730 --> 08:46.930
coming which is confusing yourself.

08:46.980 --> 08:54.120
So how to make our home page to be the actual home page so that if someone visits either NZL dot com

08:54.480 --> 08:56.210
he should see this home page.

08:56.370 --> 08:56.760
OK.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.400
So how to do that.

08:58.410 --> 08:59.180
How do you do that.

08:59.310 --> 08:59.810
OK.

08:59.850 --> 09:03.610
So for that you have to watch the next lecture.

09:03.660 --> 09:09.720
And in that lecture I also show you that how can you work with the many succeeding guys and by.
