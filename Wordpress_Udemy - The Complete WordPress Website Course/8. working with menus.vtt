00:00.390 --> 00:03.920
What does a guy using Malcolm X and you can see that we're totally done with the website.

00:04.050 --> 00:06.130
This is our home page for a blog post.

00:06.150 --> 00:06.750
OK.

00:06.810 --> 00:13.250
And let's go here let's go to dashboard and let's just compare the normal blog with this blog case.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.780
I'm going to go here I'm going to slash blog.

00:16.080 --> 00:16.630
OK.

00:16.720 --> 00:21.060
And now you can see let's just compare both of this the vote of the thing.

00:21.150 --> 00:32.390
So we have this blog right here and we have this blog KHRAIS here which plug you like the most I'm sure.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.650
I'm pretty sure that you're like sorry this one.

00:35.650 --> 00:41.100
This this blog obviously obviously no one everyone would say that you write like this plug because this

00:41.100 --> 00:43.610
blog is amazing not this blog.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.490
So this plug is the simple block.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.320
That is why I always recommend to go with this elementary theme.

00:48.510 --> 00:55.230
So you now also know how to build a blog base to say OK what you have to do right now is that you have

00:55.230 --> 01:02.120
to go to the dashboard right here and let's delete that let's delete that post and leave that page.

01:02.130 --> 01:06.940
Let's go to the page and let's delete that post-paid because we don't want that piece post-paid.

01:07.020 --> 01:07.870
I'm just going to come here.

01:07.890 --> 01:11.970
I'm going to hit trash and you can see that it should be sent to trash.

01:11.970 --> 01:17.490
Let me go and I'm going to open up my website and he can see that I just have the one single page.

01:17.490 --> 01:18.910
That is the blog page.

01:18.930 --> 01:22.880
So what I'm going to do right now I will be just moving up the menu right here.

01:22.890 --> 01:23.440
I'll show you that.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.380
How can you create a menu for all the categories as well and for specific categories because we need

01:28.380 --> 01:30.070
so many of the specific categories.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.590
If you're running a blog page OK.

01:32.610 --> 01:37.020
We also want to work with the sidebar right here and we also want to work for the full array here and

01:37.020 --> 01:37.690
this as well.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.270
So we will be doing this right now.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.470
Let's go to the manual with first so will first rate for the menu right here.

01:46.650 --> 01:48.210
And then we will be working up with this.

01:48.210 --> 01:48.610
OK.

01:48.780 --> 01:50.490
Let's go to this guy right here.

01:50.550 --> 01:51.960
Let's go to the dashboard.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.440
And then here we want to work with this.

01:54.510 --> 01:58.740
So what we want to do we want to go to the appearance and then we want to go to the menus right here

01:58.770 --> 02:01.380
and we want to add some links here.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.380
So first of all we want to add the page of the home page.

02:04.380 --> 02:05.140
There we go.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.170
This is added right here.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.560
And I want to display to location to be the main menu.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.240
So let's go ahead and let's save and let's have a look at our blog page right here.

02:16.810 --> 02:17.270
OK.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.950
So this is the home button.

02:18.950 --> 02:22.770
This is coming right here where we will be editing this later on.

02:22.770 --> 02:26.600
Or just let's end this first so that we can work.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.030
I want to go test to this and then I want to change the color of my menu.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.990
So here we are in the Customize section.

02:33.990 --> 02:34.900
This is being loaded.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.460
Let's wait

02:38.260 --> 02:41.040
and now here we want to go to the header here

02:44.230 --> 02:45.710
and then we have to go to the menu.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.870
So we have to change the color of the menu.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.730
So my menu link color is going to be white.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.700
OK.

02:53.770 --> 02:55.360
This is for white.

02:55.600 --> 03:03.520
And my link color on Hoover should turn to full black cool.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.230
OK.

03:04.310 --> 03:08.390
What I want to do right now is OK let's use the full black one.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.550
And let's use the full white here.

03:14.850 --> 03:15.200
OK.

03:15.210 --> 03:21.210
And then we have the link color the current menu item so current menu item should be

03:26.650 --> 03:29.010
just choose the black one because I think so.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.710
OK so this is our current menu item.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.130
This is turned to black.

03:33.140 --> 03:37.250
And then we have the link Macron So if you need if you need any of the link back from me you can also

03:37.250 --> 03:40.650
go with us choosing the right looks pretty villa.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.930
But I think you choose to be the default one the clear one.

03:44.090 --> 03:44.420
OK.

03:44.420 --> 03:49.530
And then we have the link back grown on whoever I link back current any way to nothing.

03:49.580 --> 03:49.920
OK.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.460
That what we have to do we have to work with the category as well.

03:53.690 --> 03:54.370
I'm going to come here.

03:54.380 --> 04:00.100
I'm going to hit publish and I want to add some categories right here.

04:00.110 --> 04:05.000
So let's go to the category and you can see this is how these categories are coming I'm going to click

04:05.000 --> 04:10.910
View all and you can see all the categories are coming so I'm going to add basically a category section

04:10.910 --> 04:16.580
you can add a category section or you can just add the categories to be aneroid or this one vote I'm

04:16.580 --> 04:16.970
going to do.

04:16.970 --> 04:19.790
I'm just going to select all and I'm going to add too many.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.740
So you can see these categories must be added.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.350
So these are coming right here.

04:25.580 --> 04:30.780
In the end really it should be the subcategory it should be the subcategory of HTC and Samsung.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.220
And then we have the Apple Watch this.

04:33.380 --> 04:34.970
And let's bring in tray here.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.260
Let's bring in tray here.

04:36.260 --> 04:41.470
Then we have the windows the windows we have the Dell is the subcategory and computer is just south

04:41.610 --> 04:42.490
of Dell.

04:42.530 --> 04:44.190
This is the some of Dell and this is it.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.310
So we have these categories right here.

04:46.310 --> 04:49.930
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save menu and now here.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.540
Let's go ahead and let's refresh.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.260
So this is being refreshed.

04:54.260 --> 04:59.080
You can see here should be all the categories that we have added right here.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.590
So let's wait

05:03.600 --> 05:03.980
OK.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.680
Here we go.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.040
You can see this is how it is looking.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.280
We have Android and then we have the HTC LG and Samsung we have US.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.940
So in the U.S. We have Apple Watch.

05:11.950 --> 05:13.570
I'm an iPhone in the windows.

05:13.570 --> 05:14.980
We have the Dell.

05:14.980 --> 05:19.050
So this is the description of the category that is also coming.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.700
So we want to change this later on.

05:20.890 --> 05:24.910
OK what we have to do right now is that we need to go to the head array here and we want to go to the

05:24.910 --> 05:26.070
menu.

05:26.230 --> 05:28.720
Now we have to go down and we have the drop down styling.

05:28.720 --> 05:34.160
So for the job down styling the background color should be as same as this.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.800
So I want to choose the dropper.

05:35.800 --> 05:40.720
I want to come here I want a hit page color and I want to track this so I just need the color of this.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.130
I'm going to come here and the link color copy.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.700
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit paste.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.850
So now it should be same like this.

05:48.970 --> 05:49.300
OK.

05:49.330 --> 05:52.130
I want to just remove a hash right here.

05:52.330 --> 05:55.240
So this should be of the same color you can see.

05:55.240 --> 05:59.140
Then we have the top border color which is this the blue.

05:59.140 --> 06:04.720
This is coming I want it to be full black OK.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.550
This looks cool.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.640
And then we have the borders color show I don't want any border.

06:08.660 --> 06:15.580
So I'm going to choose the transparency to be low flow so you can see we have no borders right here.

06:15.660 --> 06:25.060
And what I want now is that I want the link color so my link color is going to be a white OK.

06:25.550 --> 06:25.910
Now what.

06:25.910 --> 06:31.150

06:31.160 --> 06:33.370
We have the background on Hoeber.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.090
We want this to be normal.

06:35.270 --> 06:42.320
Dilling color current menu item should be turned to full black so you can see how this is looking.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.380
We also have the link color on Hoover.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.300
So in color.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.590
Always changing to this.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.940
