00:00.500 --> 00:04.750
What does it guys I want KMAX now in this video we will be working at The View commerce settings.

00:04.760 --> 00:08.570
Let's just go ahead and let's hit settings and you can see that we are in the settings.

00:08.570 --> 00:08.980
OK.

00:08.990 --> 00:13.880
We have overview of this already and these are not much necessary right now.

00:13.950 --> 00:18.650
Mean we will be working in the reviewing of our site be able just give some fake orders then we will

00:18.650 --> 00:21.200
be working up with the orders coupons and everything OK.

00:21.260 --> 00:25.490
So let's just go ahead and let's just come here in the general settings we have the address line you

00:25.490 --> 00:28.200
guys already know about this right here.

00:28.280 --> 00:28.710
Okay.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.440
And then we have the general options.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.390
These are basically very important.

00:32.390 --> 00:32.880
Okay.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.670
This is like cell location.

00:34.670 --> 00:38.800
So if you want to just very you want to sell your product.

00:38.810 --> 00:39.330
OK.

00:39.380 --> 00:44.960
So Mike someone is from Russia or someone is from America or somebody from London.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.010
So you just select for sell to all countries except for.

00:49.010 --> 00:56.000
So if I don't want to sell to like Russia I'll just select here Russia that I don't want to sell to

00:56.000 --> 01:01.390
Russia or if I don't want to sell in America I'll just select America.

01:01.580 --> 01:02.270
OK.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.890
United States basically United States.

01:05.910 --> 01:06.360
OK.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.650
If I don't want to sell them.

01:07.770 --> 01:08.260
OK.

01:08.290 --> 01:08.940
See I'm like this.

01:08.940 --> 01:13.740
I can just add the United Kingdom you don't sell to the United Kingdom you don't sell to United Arab

01:13.740 --> 01:15.350
Emirates and something like that.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.880
OK so if you don't want to sell to these countries you have to select this option.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.520
OK.

01:20.550 --> 01:27.090
If you want to just select a specific cell to specific countries OK then you can so like that like we

01:27.090 --> 01:32.730
just want to sell it to Pakistan and no one else we don't care about them and we just want to sell to

01:32.790 --> 01:38.870
our country and then I'll just hit save changes and then I will sell sell to only this country.

01:38.880 --> 01:44.280
So there are online stores like that like if we just open up some of them say they just sell to their

01:44.280 --> 01:49.340
country only because of the shipping charges and the custom and something like that.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.170
So you can also build your own country based online store.

01:53.370 --> 01:53.840
OK.

01:53.970 --> 01:58.330
So then you have to use your country domain name because I would recommend you to go over this otherwise

01:58.330 --> 01:59.560
you will be good.

01:59.560 --> 02:04.220
OK so let's just go ahead let's just come here and be Vaun to sell to all countries.

02:04.230 --> 02:05.270
OK.

02:06.030 --> 02:09.410
Like the billing address can be on any country.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.700
And then we have shipped to all countries you sell to.

02:12.990 --> 02:13.430
OK.

02:13.560 --> 02:19.890
This is like we ship to all the countries we ship to specific countries only.

02:19.890 --> 02:20.690
OK.

02:22.360 --> 02:28.630
This is like ship to specific countries so I can say like you know like we ship to a select all you

02:28.630 --> 02:31.060
can see every country has been selected.

02:31.370 --> 02:31.950
OK.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.340
And then if I want to remove any in any country I can just remove it from here.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.010
OK.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Again does it select none and he can see that I can select only one country so if I wanted to create

02:43.060 --> 02:51.560
a gift selling based Web site like anyone from anywhere can send some products gift products to Pakistan.

02:51.790 --> 02:52.340
OK.

02:52.450 --> 03:01.310
So if a guy is in America and her fiance is in Pakistan OK and that guy wants to send a gift to that.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.130
So his billing address would be America.

03:04.170 --> 03:08.060
We are selling there in America but we are all shipping in Pakistan.

03:08.070 --> 03:09.560
So this is what I mean.

03:09.670 --> 03:12.710
OK so there is a difference between selling and the shipping.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.250
OK.

03:13.330 --> 03:19.270
So the billing address would be in America and the product is going to be shipped from us to Pakistan

03:20.430 --> 03:22.790
to the lady who is living in Pakistan.

03:22.810 --> 03:23.140
OK.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.300
So this is what I'm telling you.

03:24.300 --> 03:24.890
Exactly.

03:24.970 --> 03:30.370
OK so what I'm going to do I'm just going to slight ship to all countries you sell to because I want

03:30.370 --> 03:31.720
to ship to all of the countries.

03:31.750 --> 03:32.300
OK.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.160
And then we have the default customer locations.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.550
It's going to geo locate how.

03:36.590 --> 03:37.110
What is that.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.170
What is the meaning of this.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.840
It means that it is going to get the IP.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.660
If we just go to what is my IP.

03:43.750 --> 03:44.200
OK.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.080
And then I go back.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.030
So what is my IP.

03:48.250 --> 03:54.270
OK then on my IP on May on the basis of my IP it's going to grab my location.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.810
It's going to grab application.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.340
You can see this is coming like this.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.230
The country is this and the ISP is this.

04:00.250 --> 04:00.740
OK.

04:00.820 --> 04:05.720
So my country is this is going to grab the IP from the geolocation.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.230
Hey it's going to be located and then we have the Enable taxes and the store notice.

04:11.350 --> 04:17.890
What does this is that you want to enable the taxes and calculations like if you want to sell to other

04:17.890 --> 04:22.180
countries you probably charging them their tax because you have to pay to the government.

04:22.370 --> 04:22.770
OK.

04:22.780 --> 04:31.350
And if you want to add the price inclusive of tax like you will at the price you will just.

04:31.450 --> 04:36.790
So let's suppose that this is the price of my shirt but just $25 and I am already charging them the

04:36.790 --> 04:46.180
tax so if my actual price is twenty three point five then I am charging 1.5 the tax So this is costing

04:46.180 --> 04:47.090
me 25.

04:47.100 --> 04:53.270
So if you are already adding the tax in your products then and then just to not check it.

04:53.290 --> 04:53.810
Okay.

04:53.890 --> 05:01.570
And if you want to the tax to be added Okay automatically on the basis of price on the basis of country

05:01.600 --> 05:04.460
and everything then you have to select it.

05:04.510 --> 05:05.010
Okay.

05:05.140 --> 05:12.400
So on selecting the tax will be added on the price and everything on the Persian database's Okay.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.380
So I will be entering I will be adding the tax.

05:15.380 --> 05:15.860
Okay.

05:15.890 --> 05:19.460
And then we have the store notice if you don't want to add the tax just uncheck it.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.010
Okay.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.230
And then we have the store notice what is this.

05:22.430 --> 05:27.340
It will just add the store notice on the store that if you want to add anything.

05:27.340 --> 05:33.330
So if you want to add a store notice about 50 percent of all products use the coupon good 50 percent.

05:33.380 --> 05:33.830
Okay.

05:33.860 --> 05:39.500
And then they go to card when they check out you have to enter the coupon code and then this product

05:39.530 --> 05:41.080
will be on 50 percent off.

05:41.090 --> 05:41.640
Okay.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.920
So this is what I mean exactly.

05:43.970 --> 05:49.850
Now lets just come here and let's just add a store notice if I check it you can see this is coming here.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.350
This is a demo store for testing purposes.

05:52.440 --> 05:58.270
No orders shall be fulfilled so make sure that you add it because we are creating a demo store right

05:58.300 --> 05:58.450
now.

05:58.490 --> 06:01.680
This is not our online store.

06:01.840 --> 06:08.000
If if if someone buy the product and you are not able to ship it he'll just open that he will just open

06:08.000 --> 06:13.070
that in the Pay-Pal that this guy unship the product and that there would be a problem you have to refund

06:13.070 --> 06:14.880
them the amount and something like that.

06:14.900 --> 06:20.060
So just add this text and did not configure your Pay-Pal are not going up the bill.

06:20.170 --> 06:24.290
OK so if you want to add it you just have to come here and then you have to go down.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.870
And then we have the currency option OK.

06:26.890 --> 06:31.840
It says the following options affect how prices are displayed on the front end.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.440
OK.

06:32.480 --> 06:39.950
So the currency is the dollar is the currency position is this currency position is left like if I just

06:39.950 --> 06:43.120
come here you can see that I can add the currency symbol to the right.

06:43.130 --> 06:47.330
I can add this space 3 year I can add the space here in the left section.

06:47.330 --> 06:50.000
So I'm just going to be going up at the left because I like this one.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.400
And then we have thousands of separators some most countries.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.940
They use d'arte 40000 spritzers.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.440
OK.

06:56.570 --> 07:00.260
And for decimal they use dot com for NSM OK.

07:00.350 --> 07:05.930
So you can decide that for thousands of Prader you have to use a comma and four decimals or traders

07:05.930 --> 07:09.640
you have to use dot or full stop or a decimal.

07:09.650 --> 07:14.930
You can see this is what we call and then we have the number of decimals so it is to max it will not

07:15.020 --> 07:16.090
go beyond that.

07:16.090 --> 07:16.580
OK.

07:16.670 --> 07:21.560
So let's just go ahead and let's say save and you can see that we're done with the general settings

07:21.610 --> 07:26.760
for commerce 681 guys in in the next video will be working up the product setting.

07:26.790 --> 07:27.270
Goodbye.
