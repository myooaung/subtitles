00:19.500 --> 00:22.490
So now here you can see that I have a whole section.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.200
Let me just delete it and show you everything from scratch.

00:25.240 --> 00:31.120
You can see I have a whole section and inside this I have a row and inside this I can add anything.

00:31.320 --> 00:31.670
OK.

00:31.710 --> 00:32.820
Let me just delete it.

00:32.970 --> 00:34.170

00:41.880 --> 00:44.630
The first full that is now totally done.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.100
And now we need a regular.

00:46.170 --> 00:47.130
I'm just going to click here.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.190
You can see this is coming off like this.

00:49.230 --> 00:53.380
I'm just going to click discard here because I need a normal section.

00:57.530 --> 00:57.990
OK.

00:58.020 --> 01:06.110
And the first thing what I'm going to add is should be a text a text heading or anything like this.

01:06.270 --> 01:13.370
OK so instead of text I basically use a call to action because the call to action has a heading.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.060
So let's see if we have a heading right here.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.300
So you can see that we don't have a heading.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.230
So I want to add a heading basically.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.370
How will I add this.

01:21.390 --> 01:24.140
I'll just come your I'll just click call to action.

01:24.270 --> 01:24.700
OK.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.430
And on clicking this you'll see a heading appear.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.180
You can also move with the text ok.

01:32.220 --> 01:37.320
You can see this is a text that is coming you can click here in this text is coming right here.

01:37.350 --> 01:38.320
So I'm just going to come here.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.150
I'm just going to pay.

01:39.180 --> 01:42.580
I'm just going to enter my heading.

01:42.630 --> 01:46.940
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to click text and here I have to enter the headings.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.640
I'm just going to enter this H-1.

01:49.860 --> 01:50.300
OK.

01:50.430 --> 01:56.240
And then this and then slash one and then this And here I can enter any of the heading.

01:56.280 --> 02:05.440
So I'm just gonna enter my heading and my heading is going to be our services.

02:05.490 --> 02:09.390
OK so you can pretty well go to the visual tab and you can see this has now changed to heading right

02:09.420 --> 02:09.640
here.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.360
So if I click here you can see this is Heading 1.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.880
Or you can just come here and entered this code right here.

02:14.910 --> 02:15.340
OK.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.850
And then what I'm going to do I'm just going to go with the design right here.

02:19.140 --> 02:24.570
I'm going to go to the text and I want to bring this to center so I'm going to go down so I find this

02:24.570 --> 02:28.380
text orientation and this is now add to Centuri here.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.630
So I'm just going to increase the text size.

02:30.690 --> 02:33.020
I'm just going increase increase it a bit.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.230
Heading text.

02:45.470 --> 02:46.460
Let's increase it.

02:46.790 --> 02:47.160
OK.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.230
So we have to wait for the heading text not the text.

02:49.230 --> 02:49.670
OK.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.110
I'm just going to get you the hitting text.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.150
Let's increase it.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.330
Anything till here.

02:56.490 --> 02:57.450
Ok cool.

02:57.450 --> 03:00.520
And now here we can change it to be open.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.690
And so the default heading font is open tense.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.570
OK you can see and then we can go with the font made.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.740
So you can make it all trouble if you want to you can move with the ball if you want to.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.380
And will be going up a the regular run word light.

03:17.460 --> 03:21.180
So I think the symbol looks cool.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.710
Well just go with the regular.

03:25.850 --> 03:26.170
OK.

03:26.210 --> 03:29.240
So you can see this is looking totally ok.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.670
I'm going to go ahead and I am just going to change this.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.970
So I'm going to change the color of this.

03:34.970 --> 03:39.860
I'm going to click OK right here and I'm going to come here and now I have to change the color of yes.

03:39.900 --> 03:44.280
So you can change it you can just print it right here and then you can change it.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.320
I'm going to change it to Golden Rule here.

03:46.460 --> 03:46.960
OK.

03:47.030 --> 03:51.410
And I'm going to change this to gold and right here so you can see.

03:51.520 --> 03:51.800
All right.

03:51.830 --> 04:02.400
I'm going to select it and then Golden select in.

04:02.650 --> 04:03.810
I want to select it.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.650
Come here.

04:05.650 --> 04:07.680
Golden.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.450
OK.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.860
I don't know why it is not working like this.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.190
I just choose it to be black.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.850
Let's come here let's come here.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.560
I choose it to be golden.

04:19.570 --> 04:20.260
Let's see him here.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.900
I choose it to be bold in blue yellow anything.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.630
So if everything is working right isn't it.

04:26.670 --> 04:27.010
Yeah.

04:27.070 --> 04:27.520
OK.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.600
This is working now.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.020
You can see we have our services section right here.

04:32.050 --> 04:38.070
I'm going to go to all you are right here and I'm going to go to the font size.

04:38.110 --> 04:41.170
So I'm just going to decrease the française of where you are

04:44.440 --> 04:45.630
increase it a bit

04:50.980 --> 04:51.470
OK.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.650
I'm going to come here and I'm going to decrease the française of this as well.

05:02.830 --> 05:03.130
OK.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.540
You can see how this is looking.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.300
We have our services section right here.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.830
So here now we're going to add some services.

05:09.830 --> 05:11.790
So this is how you can edit it basically.

05:11.940 --> 05:12.660
OK.

05:12.710 --> 05:15.850
You can edit everything from here.

05:15.860 --> 05:20.780
We're going to add some more and we're going to add our services right here how we're going to add it.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.660
We basically need one more thing and that is

05:27.770 --> 05:28.410
a divider.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.320
So I needed to write it right here.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.940
You can see that this divider is coming.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.830
I'm going to hit show divider and I'm going to go to design right here.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.890
I'm going to go to the color so when I select the color and it should be this golden color.

05:40.940 --> 05:41.490
OK.

05:41.510 --> 05:46.010
And then I have to go to this diagram here and I'm going to slide the solid color.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.410
I'm going to go to the divider position.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.950
It should be top.

05:48.970 --> 05:52.790
I get to go to the sizing and divider should be a think

05:56.170 --> 06:00.540
2 pixel and then I'm going to decrease the height a bit.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.870
I mean I need to center and I'm going to decrease it.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.690
So you can see how this is looking

06:10.730 --> 06:11.670
ok cool.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.110
So you can see how this is looking.

06:13.190 --> 06:13.800
OK.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.740
I want to bring this to top so a bit top.

06:16.850 --> 06:17.060
OK.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.430
I'm going to go to advance right here.

06:18.430 --> 06:23.010
I'm going to go to the design and then I'm going to go to the spacing.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.110
So in the spacing I have to decrease the margin.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.490
OK I'm going to am here minus 30 pixels.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.430
I mean increase it a bit OK.

06:33.460 --> 06:38.980
Let's add it to B minus 20 is trending no minus 10.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.940
So minus 10 looks totally perfect.

06:41.950 --> 06:45.750
So you can see how this is looking how our services section right here.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.540
And then we're going to add more.

06:47.620 --> 06:55.130
So what we have to do is that we need to add the some services right here.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.360
So we need to bring this to fold down.

06:57.360 --> 06:57.760
OK.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.130
You can see how this is.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.180
And then we want to click this because we need to add a new rule.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.490
And then here in that role we want to add something.

07:05.490 --> 07:10.800
So I'm just going to click here to add a new row and in that row I won four services.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.450
So a for services.

07:12.450 --> 07:14.400
Or you can show three if you want to.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.930
So it totally depends upon you.

07:16.050 --> 07:16.420
OK.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.590
Now here I want to go to the blurb right here.

07:19.590 --> 07:22.490
The blurb is like here it would be an icon.

07:22.500 --> 07:27.870
And then here would be the description and the call to action is basically a button and a call to action

07:27.870 --> 07:28.290
heading.

07:28.410 --> 07:31.890
OK so it totally depends which thing you want to add.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.570
You can also add a text editor and then you can add it.

07:34.650 --> 07:40.260
You can also add a toggle You can also add a testimonial or anything but I'm going to come here I'm

07:40.260 --> 07:45.150
going to add a blurb right here so you can see this will come right here.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.180
I have to enter the title right here and my title is going to be

07:53.180 --> 07:54.070
I think

07:56.280 --> 07:57.180
photography

08:02.700 --> 08:05.230
OK I want to go to the image and icon.

08:05.290 --> 08:09.250
I'm going to use an icon right here and I need a camera here.

08:09.280 --> 08:09.940
So

08:16.600 --> 08:19.030
let's go down let's go down till we find the camera

08:36.610 --> 08:39.270
OK let's choose this one for photography.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.360
OK.

08:40.510 --> 08:43.030
Because I guess I cannot find a camera.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.120
It is so hard for me to find it.

08:46.210 --> 08:50.080
You know they have it they have it in there but I cannot see it.

08:57.590 --> 08:58.300
OK.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.720
Now here what I'm going to do.

08:59.740 --> 09:04.240
I'm just going to go to the text right here and here I want to add something.

09:04.300 --> 09:11.380
So that is going to be normal text so you can add larger ipsum Lorem Ipsum that Dimi content.

09:11.390 --> 09:11.760
OK.

09:11.890 --> 09:12.630
I'm going to come here.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.850
I'm going to open the dummy content.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.600
OK.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.140
I'm going to come here.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.890
And here we have the Lorem Ipsum right here.

09:21.910 --> 09:26.540
I'm going to go I'm here and I'm going to copy.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.460
So I'm going to hit general generate lorem ipsum.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.560
And here I have the Lorem it's since I'm going to come here.

09:31.580 --> 09:35.870
I'm going to copy this ray here and let's see that how much still how much we want it.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.260
So I'm going to paste it right here.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.540
So this is basically used for demo purposes.

09:39.570 --> 09:44.660
That way when you want to create a demo based to say OK I'm going to come here I'm going to create a

09:44.660 --> 09:45.040
bed.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.720
I'm going to remove till they're still here.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.000
And

09:53.430 --> 09:55.940
I think just remove this still here.

09:59.110 --> 09:59.510
Cool.

09:59.600 --> 09:59.930
OK.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.490
You can see this is coming right here exactly as we wanted.

10:03.740 --> 10:04.280
OK.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.520
I'm going to go to the design right here and I'm going to go to the image and icons.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.140
I'm going to choose the icon to be the golden one.

10:11.150 --> 10:11.570
OK.

10:11.630 --> 10:13.770
Because my theme is this Colin.

10:13.940 --> 10:14.290
OK.

10:14.300 --> 10:17.230
I can just make it a little bit more.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.640
Prader OK.

10:19.700 --> 10:26.180
And then I have the circle icon I can also use the circle icon if I want to but I want to I don't want

10:26.180 --> 10:27.500
to choose the circle icon.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.380
I'm going to go to the text tray here.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.290
The text should be aligned to center.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.810
She can see how this is.

10:32.840 --> 10:37.090
You can also just use this just to fight if you want to.

10:37.430 --> 10:40.060
OK I'm going to choose that justified right now.

10:41.870 --> 10:42.300
OK.

10:42.310 --> 10:45.910
I'm going to go to the titled x ray here and my table takes should be

10:49.700 --> 10:50.550
this much.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.110
OK.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.660
And then I have this whole content tray here.

10:53.840 --> 10:58.820
So I want to go to the body x ray here and nobody should be just divide right here.

10:59.010 --> 10:59.690
I don't think so.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.590
If I was looking cool.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.040
So I'm going to choose this one.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.700
OK.

11:03.890 --> 11:04.630
This is looking cool.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.280
I'm going to come here and I'm going to decrease it from here.

11:07.490 --> 11:11.560
So let's just click this and you can see this is how it is looking.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.360
We have our services right here.

11:13.430 --> 11:19.460
We have the photography on top Ok what I want to do right now

So we have three right here.

11:43.550 --> 11:46.570
I'm just going to drag it and drop it here in this column.

11:47.450 --> 11:53.170
And it and drop it here in this column OK cool.

11:53.230 --> 12:04.370
I want to change this to be so we have photography album editing video

12:08.540 --> 12:09.090
now.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.780
I think here should be decorations.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.260
Decorations.

12:19.180 --> 12:20.070
In riped

12:25.300 --> 12:26.730
in my designs.

12:28.630 --> 12:29.640
So here we have this.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.660
I'm going to choose a new color right here.

12:31.820 --> 12:32.140
OK.

12:32.140 --> 12:32.880
I'm going to come here.

12:32.890 --> 12:37.270
I'm going to choose that design and then I'm going to do the image and icon and I'm going to choose

12:37.630 --> 12:38.180
the icons.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.470
I'm going to go to the Condon's right here I'm going to go to that image and icon and I'm going to choose

12:41.470 --> 12:42.680
a new design right here.

12:42.700 --> 12:46.340
So let's go down till we find a design a bit of design.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.830
OK.

12:53.140 --> 12:53.710
OK.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.240
And then here I'm going to edit this guy right here.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.190
OK.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.870
So let's just double click it.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.110
I hope this is the one.

13:01.120 --> 13:01.840
Let's go to the text.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.280
OK.

13:02.350 --> 13:06.320
This is the decorations I'm going to go to the image and icon again and I'm going to choose one icon.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.090
So for this decoration we need to choose

13:17.090 --> 13:18.650
OK good photography one.

13:18.650 --> 13:19.150
Here we go.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.970
I'm going to use this one and the photography's coming right here.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.230
This is the camera.

13:23.660 --> 13:24.610
I was just finding it up.

13:24.710 --> 13:24.920
OK.

13:24.920 --> 13:32.420
I'm going to come here to the decorations right here and for the decorations I think this one looks

13:32.420 --> 13:32.790
cool.

13:32.900 --> 13:33.160
OK.

13:33.230 --> 13:39.310
So let's have a look at a Web site you can see that we have our history here that these next door events

13:39.320 --> 13:44.350
the best management company and then we have the contractors and then we have our services right here.

13:44.360 --> 13:49.390
So this looks really amazing I think because we want to focus on just one thing.

13:49.400 --> 13:56.480
So if my client has said that his business card design is basically a black and gold or I don't want

13:56.480 --> 13:59.160
to go with that then you can see how this is looking.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.540
So we have our services sections.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.740
OK see him like this.

14:03.970 --> 14:08.510
I want six designs basically So I'm going to come here I'm going to just to placate it one more time

14:08.510 --> 14:09.910
so that I can change it.

14:09.980 --> 14:10.630
I'm going to come here.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.500
I'm going to click here.

14:11.540 --> 14:14.330
And then for this I want it to be

14:19.800 --> 14:20.100
OK.

14:20.130 --> 14:20.630
Just leave it.

14:20.700 --> 14:20.920
OK.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.670
So you can see that we have these right here.

14:22.680 --> 14:28.620
I'm just going to make it multiply it so that it doesn't look much doesn't look bad.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.160
OK.

14:29.180 --> 14:33.100
Here this should be here and it should be here.

14:38.890 --> 14:41.120
So I think now this is looking a bit cool.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.330
I think I should change the section color so I'm going to come here.

14:44.330 --> 14:48.840
I'm going to go to the image and I can I'm going to choose the icon for this.

14:48.850 --> 14:51.070
It should be like a video shoot.

14:51.070 --> 14:54.530
We can change it to be video shoot.

14:54.830 --> 14:55.370
OK.

14:55.370 --> 15:01.670
And then here I want to choose a different icon to make sure that you full time keep your focus on this

15:01.730 --> 15:06.500
after the header because people focus on this after the pattern.

15:06.650 --> 15:09.940
And they should be perfect clean and amazing.

15:10.220 --> 15:10.580
OK.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.960
I'm going to choose something that looks a better video.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.520
So I'm going to go down go down.

15:16.550 --> 15:20.440
And here we have the Veals see.

15:20.650 --> 15:21.380
I don't think so.

15:21.490 --> 15:23.930
If it matches it I'm going to go down.

15:33.500 --> 15:33.940
OK.

15:34.130 --> 15:35.830
This one video shoot.

15:35.830 --> 15:36.360
Cool.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.710
I'm going to come here to the decorations right here and they should be

15:44.060 --> 15:45.750
event planning.

15:49.030 --> 15:50.020
Event marketing

15:54.400 --> 15:54.830
OK.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.460
And then here I'm going to choose for marketing.

15:57.460 --> 16:01.160
I think I should go up with

16:08.550 --> 16:12.540
this one and this is the last one so this can be

16:15.640 --> 16:16.530
the catering.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.830
They think so catering OK.

16:20.840 --> 16:25.780
And then here I need a bit about food table or something like that.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.830
So let's go down till the

16:43.310 --> 16:59.380
animal control the click here catering Ari Angie click here again and we want to select this OK.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.390
Everything looks cool from here.

17:01.610 --> 17:03.940
This perspective you can see how this is.

17:03.950 --> 17:06.330
We have our services section right here.

17:06.350 --> 17:12.380
We have these three services that are coming and I want to increase the batting a bit so that we have

17:12.500 --> 17:14.710
equal distance from here.

17:15.500 --> 17:15.940
OK.

17:16.070 --> 17:16.600
There we go.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.140
You can see everything looks cool.

17:18.140 --> 17:24.170
We have our Hetter and then we have our services section and you can see how this is so if you want

17:24.170 --> 17:26.310
to make it full if you can also make it full.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.140
How you're going to do this you're going to just come here to the Rose setting.

17:29.180 --> 17:33.980
You have to go to the design and then you have to go to the sizing so you can make it full if you want

17:33.980 --> 17:34.420
to.

17:34.580 --> 17:34.870
OK.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.270
And this will be full with and they'll come here and you can see how this is looking.

17:39.510 --> 17:41.100
If you want to make it full of it.

17:41.180 --> 17:46.190
Otherwise I would not recommend you to make it full because otherwise it will not look much better until

17:46.190 --> 17:49.350
you have four columns if you want to add four columns you can make it full.

17:49.510 --> 17:51.680
But you can also move that custom.

17:51.690 --> 17:57.080
God forbid what is this is that it means the spacing between these these rows so you can just come here

17:57.470 --> 18:03.230
and then you can just come here you can see how this is you can manage the spacing how we want the spacing

18:03.230 --> 18:03.690
to be.

18:03.740 --> 18:11.790
But I think Toul looks Corbat or twe to talk school I'm going to get here.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.080
Same thing I'm going to do with this guy right here.

18:14.150 --> 18:19.480
I'm going to go do the design and I'm going to go to the spacing of these racing.

18:19.610 --> 18:26.870
So using the custom got to read and I'm going to choose to read here I said ENTRAR that's come here

18:27.110 --> 18:33.720
and they say it's safe.

18:33.790 --> 18:34.390
Here we go.

18:34.410 --> 18:34.950
We're done.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.600
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.330
And Buh-Bye.
