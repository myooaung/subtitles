00:00.690 --> 00:05.590
What is have guys in Malcolm X so before adding the slider I think that we should understand this Dimi

00:05.670 --> 00:06.710
Bilour OK.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.500
So I'm just going to click close and you can see that we have two sections right here.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.680
This is the default one that is created.

00:12.900 --> 00:13.350
OK.

00:13.380 --> 00:17.400
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to delete this so that I have only one section and here you

00:17.400 --> 00:19.470
can see I have a slight array here.

00:19.470 --> 00:22.650
Since we haven't added anything that is why this is coming right here.

00:22.930 --> 00:23.280
OK.

00:23.310 --> 00:26.170
If I just click this button you can see I can save it.

00:26.430 --> 00:29.610
I can just click my and it just portability.

00:29.610 --> 00:30.000
OK.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.680
You'll understand this later on.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.480
OK.

00:32.520 --> 00:39.170
And then we have the history that the editing history that when we did some changes so if you're going

00:39.180 --> 00:41.340
to reverted back we can reverted back.

00:41.490 --> 00:41.930
OK.

00:42.070 --> 00:48.180
And then we have this gear icon we can change the whole baid settings from here.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.240
OK we can change the color or we can change the spacing.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.460
We can go with the advance.

00:52.470 --> 00:53.730
We can go to the performance.

00:53.730 --> 00:54.260
OK.

00:54.330 --> 00:55.660
So this is how it's going to work.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.630
And then we have the cross section so it's going to take us to the bottom right here and then we have

01:00.630 --> 01:02.130
to delete.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.820
It's going to clear the whole layout.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.210
OK you just click here.

01:05.290 --> 01:11.430
Can see all your current page content will be lost if I just click here you can see every data is deleted

01:12.270 --> 01:14.160
and everything is from start.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.070
So this is how it works.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.790
OK then we have this.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.680
This is the save library function.

01:19.680 --> 01:25.040
This is exactly like elementary if you want to create anything any more and you want to call it anywhere.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.860
We can call it and then we have this guy right here Lord from library.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.990
So if you want to call anything you can call it from library.

01:32.130 --> 01:36.240
And then we have this thing right here so we can change the view of the page by clicking here.

01:36.480 --> 01:42.580
OK zoom out and make the full of it again change the tablet mode and change the Mumbai mode.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.220
And then we have this guy right here.

01:44.220 --> 01:50.400
This is going to show us a normal mode that how everything is we have this section right here so we

01:50.400 --> 01:54.290
can add any one section right here if we add full width you can see this is how it's going to appear.

01:54.540 --> 01:59.320
And this is basically if you just click here again it's going to take it to the visual tab right here.

01:59.580 --> 02:04.650
OK so we have this one right here and it's going to show you the builder settings.

02:04.650 --> 02:10.230
OK builder default interaction mode history and table level builder interface and everything and then

02:10.230 --> 02:11.770
we have this guy right here.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.730
This and this.

02:12.750 --> 02:17.960
If you just come here if you just click here you can see how desists to lead to action.

02:17.990 --> 02:18.260
OK.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.410
This is the grid mode.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.970
OK so how this is going to work if I just click here you can see this is not coming if I just click

02:23.970 --> 02:24.620
here again.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.970
Then you can see these lines are coming.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.810
That is separating every section.

02:28.890 --> 02:29.320
OK.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.560
If I just click here.

02:30.690 --> 02:36.150
This is basically called the clock mode if I just click here you can see everything is coming right

02:36.180 --> 02:36.460
here.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.370
If I click here again this is gone.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.140
So you can work with that.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.880
And then we have the Hoover mode.

02:41.940 --> 02:46.100
So how this whole Ramona's is going to work if you bring your mouse over here you can see this is coming.

02:46.430 --> 02:46.890
OK.

02:46.980 --> 02:51.180
And if you go to the click more than if you bring your mouse over here nothing is happening until you

02:51.180 --> 02:52.030
click here.

02:52.030 --> 02:55.070
And if you click here then these sections are going to appear.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.840
So you can pretty well very this as well.

02:57.900 --> 02:58.670
OK.

02:58.860 --> 03:01.300
I'm just going to come here and just you know use the whole remote.

03:01.500 --> 03:08.680
And then let's come here and move on to uncheck this ok cool.

03:08.730 --> 03:14.940
And now we're done with the DV builder we have now create knowledge of the rebuilder be in the next

03:14.940 --> 03:16.480

03:16.500 --> 03:17.910
So stadium Guyse and.
