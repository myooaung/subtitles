00:10.500 --> 00:12.290

00:12.300 --> 00:18.260
How can you add a currency converter so that if someone is from different currency he can convert to

00:18.300 --> 00:19.740
different currency if you want to.

00:19.740 --> 00:21.620
So we'll also be working up to that.

00:21.630 --> 00:25.130
So as this started first of fall we have to just close all the tabs.

00:25.260 --> 00:32.770
OK let's just come in here and let's just click this guy right here.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.230
So this is leave OK leave.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.080
I'm going to go to the team customize right here.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.050
Let's open up the shop page so that we can just edit our shop page sidebar right now.

00:42.210 --> 00:46.110
So here now you can see that we have two options to edit the sidebar.

00:46.320 --> 00:54.860
OK we can just set it to directly from here or just we can move up with this one right here.

00:54.930 --> 00:59.880
If you go to Detroit now open this up in a new tab and then we can also edit it from here as well.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.910
So let's open up the theme.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.170
Customize and let's work for the sidebar right now.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.220
OK.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.350
Let's wait till this is loaded.

01:06.570 --> 01:11.550
OK so I know you guys know about the footer so you can work the footer you can create your own footer

01:12.210 --> 01:15.790
so I don't have to show you about that but I'm just going to show you this one sidebar.

01:15.860 --> 01:16.250
OK.

01:16.330 --> 01:18.080
And that we're going to be working at it right now.

01:18.270 --> 01:22.920
So here is a search recent most recent Commons archives categories and Metta I'm just going to come

01:22.920 --> 01:23.150

01:23.160 --> 01:26.510
I'm going to delete this one let's just delete all of them.

01:29.350 --> 01:35.590
Answer The first one that I always like always used to decide that it is the price FELTER of filler

01:35.590 --> 01:36.580
products by price.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.870
I just always use it so I'm just going to be using this one.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.220
You can see it is right here and let's have a look at it.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.790
I'm going to click here this guy right here so that we can just see it.

01:45.850 --> 01:46.800
How is it looking so

01:49.980 --> 01:51.130
filled up that price.

01:51.130 --> 01:52.870
Let's just come here and let's refresh

01:58.000 --> 01:59.070
to be here.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.970
Filter products by price.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.460
Ok done.

02:03.780 --> 02:06.410
Let's add one more thing and there will be categories.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.380
Product categories.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.150
I'm going to add this.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.190
Let's hit and widget.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.140
So this is also here and this is here.

02:13.170 --> 02:18.260
I'm just going to click here again and let's see if it appears right now.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.180
So this is coming right here.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.150
OK.

02:21.550 --> 02:25.770
This is not coming filter products by price is not coming.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.690
I don't know why it is not working here.

02:27.850 --> 02:31.000
Yes I think the reason is that this is our normal shop base.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.070
This is our page and we are showing this products right here.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.500
That is why it is not working.

02:37.020 --> 02:37.460
Well let's.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.610
That's OK.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.580
OK.

02:39.700 --> 02:48.610
So let's just come here and if you want to move that card we can also show our shopping cart too if

02:48.610 --> 02:50.310
anything is added to the card.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.740
We can also show that shopping cart.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.270
So let's just add this as well.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.310
OK.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.480
This should be right above.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.840
So if the card is empty then leave on to hide the card.

02:59.950 --> 03:00.480
OK.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.440
And then we have

03:04.340 --> 03:09.260
the products so let's show that list of products so there's going to be adding products and number of

03:09.260 --> 03:13.880
products to show should be five and it should show the on sale products only.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.920
So let's just save it and let's have a look at our sites or how it is looking so you can see then we

03:17.930 --> 03:20.150
have the product categories right now.

03:20.150 --> 03:25.700
We have products trade here and these are on sale products so if I just add any of the product into

03:25.700 --> 03:26.450
my cart.

03:26.580 --> 03:31.930
OK let's suppose that I add this to my cart you can see the shopping cart Villa appear here.

03:31.990 --> 03:32.510
OK.

03:32.660 --> 03:37.850
This is the shopping cart is looking we have to check card and check out and everything and we can now

03:37.850 --> 03:42.560
check out to our site and and see that it will take us to the checkout page.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.270
And now here we can check out.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.090
And here we have to enter details and everything and then we can check out.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.250
So this is how it works.

03:50.510 --> 03:56.990
So now you can see that we're totally done with this or this card page and now we're going to design

03:56.990 --> 04:00.760
our card page because you can see that if I open up any of the product.

04:00.950 --> 04:01.620
OK.

04:01.820 --> 04:07.890
Then you can see that this is blue and this is brown So this is not looking cool.

04:08.150 --> 04:08.950
I just hate it.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.580
So I want to design this.

04:10.670 --> 04:14.960
OK let's just come here and let's just go to theme customize her to just work for that.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.330
And now here we have to work for the common steps so

04:27.800 --> 04:32.920
let's just come here to general settings the header and navigation for buttons

04:35.510 --> 04:41.620
buttons and style buttons over style so we have the Burton background color OK.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.250
And the indexed colors Feltz.

04:43.290 --> 04:47.070
I'm just going to go with the Burton background color and I'm going to change this to

04:54.980 --> 04:56.850
brown ok.

04:57.270 --> 05:00.310
The text color is going to be right away.

05:00.390 --> 05:01.840
You can see how it is looking.

05:02.310 --> 05:06.470
And the bourbon watercolor that Burton Bartter color should be nothing.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.610
So I don't want to show any of the border color.

05:08.620 --> 05:12.530
Hey you can see the burden should be changed.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.620
OK.

05:13.870 --> 05:15.140
I'm going to go down.

05:15.330 --> 05:16.340
And here's the icon.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.470
So I don't want the bird an icon no icon please.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.280
OK.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.520
You can see everything looks cool here you can see

05:26.350 --> 05:28.520
so we have to change the text color cells.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.540
I'm going to change this to white.

05:29.540 --> 05:29.830
So

05:33.920 --> 05:36.020
and now we have to design the whole style.

05:36.030 --> 05:39.650
So let's come here and the background color should we turn to black

05:42.700 --> 05:42.940
OK.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.110
Let's just make it full in Hoover's style.

05:49.780 --> 05:50.040
OK.

05:50.060 --> 05:52.170
This will be totally same for us.

05:52.190 --> 05:52.750
OK.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.550
Does the background color and the border color.

05:54.550 --> 06:00.110
We don't want any of the borders for this so I can see how it's looking and it's going to go back and

06:00.110 --> 06:01.910
we have everything ready.

06:01.910 --> 06:06.620
We have the color scheme so we have that color scheme default we can choose it to be green so this will

06:06.620 --> 06:08.260
be the color scheme you'll be green.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.480
I'm going to use the default line.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.080
OK.

06:10.130 --> 06:17.840
I'm just going to go back and we have the fidgets and the menus and the homepage settings so everything

06:17.840 --> 06:19.440
is totally coming here.

06:21.090 --> 06:25.020
The blog we have as well and in the post we can manage it.

06:25.390 --> 06:30.730
OK so everything is totally up and running now you can see that we have designed our buttons tab and

06:31.150 --> 06:32.540
everything looks pretty cool.

06:37.050 --> 06:39.060
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

06:39.060 --> 06:44.560
And in the next video you'll be working up the currency converter so stadium guys and Babai.
