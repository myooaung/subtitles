05:00.780 --> 05:09.600
So from top I want to give 20 pixels so 30 pixels has been given from top and you can see 30 is not

05:09.600 --> 05:10.360
enough.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.190
I want to try one more.

05:12.210 --> 05:17.350
So it is now I think 50 50 looks cool.

05:17.450 --> 05:17.860
OK.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.110
I also want to give some betting to the bottom.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.190
So let's head to put him right here.

05:22.460 --> 05:24.890
And this is mine 28 29.

05:25.130 --> 05:25.720
OK.

05:25.730 --> 05:26.940
Now this is school ok.

05:26.990 --> 05:32.780
I want to come here to this guy right here and now here I want to go to the shape so its shape can be

05:32.780 --> 05:37.190
their square shape can be rounded or a ship can be circle as well.

05:37.190 --> 05:38.980
So I like the circle one.

05:39.050 --> 05:44.480
And then I want to come here and I want to add these things so you can add these links later on.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.340
I want to come here to the instagram one and

05:52.110 --> 05:57.630
let's just give here to style and official color or just choose the custom color.

05:57.630 --> 06:03.300
So I want to go with a custom color I don't want so many colors so let's go ahead and the primary color

06:03.330 --> 06:04.770
is going to be white.

06:05.130 --> 06:05.810
OK.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.500
And or sorry we can go with the primary colors to be below this one that we have right here.

06:12.510 --> 06:13.240
So this looks great.

06:13.260 --> 06:13.680
OK.

06:13.710 --> 06:16.600
So make sure that you follow the team of your website.

06:16.860 --> 06:20.290
So I'm just going to go on here I'm just going to just increase it a bit.

06:20.310 --> 06:22.590
So there we go it looks cool.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.030
OK.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.830
Now we want to go ahead and I want to increase the size a bit.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.320
OK.

06:27.440 --> 06:34.050
I want to give some batting.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.270
I think this much better.

06:35.280 --> 06:41.540
So how great is that this is the icon right here and this is the overall covering so you can give batting

06:41.540 --> 06:47.180
to these covering you can see that icon is remaining same but the batting is being increased.

06:47.180 --> 06:50.900
This is how the betting where it's OK so it totally depends on how much padding you want to give.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.630
I think padding should be like this.

06:52.790 --> 06:58.800
And the size should be smaller and batting should be more cool.

06:59.020 --> 06:59.530
OK.

07:01.080 --> 07:10.110
Now what I want to do I want to go with the spacing so I want to give some more spacing right here.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.280
Ok cool.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.680
There's much spacing is fine.

07:13.820 --> 07:14.890
And now I'm done.

07:14.890 --> 07:15.860
Totally totally done.

07:15.860 --> 07:18.730
You can see that my full me on is coming perfect.

07:18.800 --> 07:24.560
I'm just going to come here to I hole where an icon an icon over the this should be turned to block

07:24.710 --> 07:28.810
so that we go you can see how my web site is looking.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.810
I'm just going to come here.

07:29.830 --> 07:35.830
And here we go you can see Chase follow me on Facebook Twitter Google Plus Instagram.

07:35.890 --> 07:43.720
And then I have the link then and then I have this YouTube YouTube so everything looks cool.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.520
Then I also have the animations.

07:45.550 --> 07:49.450
If you want any mation to be I think it should be cool.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.750
So if I click it it is growing.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.420
So I had the crowing effect is good.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.150
You can also go with a shrink so if you click it it's going to shrink down.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.340
So it totally depends.

08:01.420 --> 08:02.260
I think

08:05.060 --> 08:12.080
Groll Krulak school because you because I want to keep my web site as simple and decent it can be OK.

08:12.110 --> 08:15.890

08:15.890 --> 08:17.950
So let's go and follow the team color.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.110
So I'm going to come here.

08:19.130 --> 08:26.750

We don't have to edit this so I'm just going to come here.

08:51.870 --> 08:56.000
The dividers should be black and that should be blind as well.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.300
And

09:05.490 --> 09:09.000
what I want to give I want to give some more padding to the below section.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.750
So when I come here to advance and the bottom section I want to give some back to the bottom.
