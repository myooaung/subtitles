So this is the domain name that we registered.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.970
And this is how it is looking.

00:08.970 --> 00:09.560
OK.

00:09.690 --> 00:12.960
So now in this video we're going to be installing WordPress in it.

00:12.960 --> 00:13.860

Let's go here and let's see where it is.

00:40.580 --> 00:44.150
So this is the one the housekeeper info.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.320
What I'm going to do I'm just going to copy this password.

00:59.660 --> 01:04.630
So this is basically the thing where all your Web site is control.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.370
You can control your website completely from here and there is no note needed.

01:10.370 --> 01:14.160
You don't have to log into your account because everything is done.

01:14.210 --> 01:17.070
You just have to enter the main server from here and that's it.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.770
You can close this.

01:18.770 --> 01:22.740
And now you can manage your site completely from here.

01:22.910 --> 01:26.500
This is basically your control battle.

01:26.570 --> 01:26.930
OK.

01:27.020 --> 01:33.580
So what we want is the we need to change our password for this host get our control back.

01:33.590 --> 01:39.390
What I'm going to do I'm going to go down.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.300

01:45.010 --> 01:46.170
are to go.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.480
And I need to pass the password.

01:48.620 --> 01:51.370
And now they have to enter the password that is new.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.630
So the password would be

02:01.300 --> 02:02.160
OK.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.850
The new password would be again here.

02:07.950 --> 02:11.280
And now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to change your password now.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.790
So here you go.

02:17.330 --> 02:19.290
You can see that it has logged me.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.380
It has locked me out.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.190
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to enter this and now I'm going to enter the password again.

You can see that we are now taken to our WordPress dashboard.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.960
You can see Ram.

06:10.120 --> 06:10.900
Now here it is.

06:10.900 --> 06:11.890
Welcome to WordPress.

06:11.890 --> 06:16.420
What kind of site can we help you set up so you don't have to choose anything here you just have to

06:16.420 --> 06:16.730
hit.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.950
I don't need help because I am here to help you.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.370
OK let's just say it.

06:21.430 --> 06:23.610
And here we go.

06:23.710 --> 06:26.390
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go head I'm going to close this.

06:26.450 --> 06:31.960
And the first thing what you have to do is that you have to just go to the plug ins just go to install

06:32.050 --> 06:34.290
plugins OK.

06:34.370 --> 06:37.830
Just go to install plugins and let's go down.

06:38.090 --> 06:40.720
And here you can see that the blue line scum's.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.650
So in virtue of the plug in that blue lens you have to check this.

06:44.780 --> 06:45.600
Check this.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.270
Check this and check this.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.320
And what you're having Do you have to go to the bulk actions you have just said de-activate and then

06:51.320 --> 06:52.480
you have to apply.

06:52.630 --> 06:53.020
OK.

06:53.060 --> 06:59.060
So when everything is applied what do you have to select all and then go ahead and delete every plug

06:59.060 --> 06:59.340
in.

06:59.430 --> 07:00.880
Let's go ahead and apply.

07:01.030 --> 07:01.380
OK.

07:01.460 --> 07:02.400
Let's go ahead and lotted.

07:02.420 --> 07:02.920
OK.

07:02.930 --> 07:06.080
So you can see that every plug in is going to be deleted.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.720
And of say it would be fully fresh.

07:08.710 --> 07:12.890
These were the plug ins that were basically fully installed by word press.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.070
And how was Twitter.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.390
So we don't need these plug ins.

07:15.410 --> 07:18.610
I'm going to show you each and everything from A to Z.

07:18.710 --> 07:19.090
OK.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.570
So now you can see that this is how our dashboard is looking.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.660
Now the second thing what we have to do is that we need to go and change your password so you can see

07:26.660 --> 07:28.390
where it takes your name.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.710
You have to just go to Edit and edit my profile and then you have to go down red tape generate password.

07:33.770 --> 07:37.440
You have to just sit there and then you have to enter your own name and password.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.030
And that is going to be OK what I'm going to do.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.410
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit update profile.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.630
And there we go.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.710
You can see their profile has been updated.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.570
You can save your password if you want to.

07:49.630 --> 07:57.940
And you can see that this is my whole website which is running wide press completely.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.830
So thanks all guys for watching this.

07:59.830 --> 08:02.050

08:02.070 --> 08:02.850
Goodbye.
