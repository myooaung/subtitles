And this is coming and everything is coming I can rate it as well and the reading will be applied here.

05:31.360 --> 05:36.160
So let's just go ahead and let's have a look at a Web site.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.810
So this is how the Web site is looking.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.400
You can see this post is already published this.

05:41.410 --> 05:43.590
These are the posts that are coming right here.

05:44.330 --> 05:51.680
I have all popular post all Topfield post and then I if I just go to authors right here then are you're

05:51.680 --> 05:54.270
going to see that I have these right here.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.980
He's the author and he has one single post.

05:56.990 --> 05:57.440
OK.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.880
This is I was just looking I since I already have added the social links.

06:00.880 --> 06:05.460
That is why they are also coming so you can pretty well create these type of pages.

06:05.600 --> 06:11.020
I'm going to go to discovery here and let's try to add a new post as well our sorry page.

06:11.030 --> 06:15.260
I'm going to go to all pages and let's choose another theme right now.

06:15.350 --> 06:17.990
So let's go to the default instead of default template.

06:17.990 --> 06:20.000
I'm going to go to the blog feed.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.710
So how does blog feed is going to look at a show.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.000
All the blog posts that you have published.

06:25.010 --> 06:32.270
I'm going to go to blog feed pay or you can just name it as all post or something like that so I'm going

06:32.270 --> 06:34.870
to go to blog feed.

06:35.150 --> 06:40.700
OK then let's go down and we have the standard one so it's going to select all the categories because

06:40.730 --> 06:44.130
I want to add all the categories right here and the Post page.

06:44.300 --> 06:50.960
So the Post Burbidge is going to be it's going to show 6 post per page and the sword ordering is going

06:50.960 --> 06:54.440
to be descending so that it's going to show the most recent on the top.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.540
And there we go.

06:55.580 --> 07:00.380
And then we have the don't show the author because we don't want to show turn the display of each post

07:00.480 --> 07:06.130
author on or off so we can also show the author if you want to and then we have show categories show

07:06.150 --> 07:11.930
featured image so show ratings show her show date and the date format and everything is also coming

07:11.930 --> 07:12.540
right here.

07:12.560 --> 07:17.270
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit paste publish right now and let's just go ahead and let's

07:17.270 --> 07:21.070
have a look at her pace page without wasting any time.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.910
So here we go.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.040
You can see this is how the page is looking.

07:26.090 --> 07:26.860
OK.

07:26.990 --> 07:31.400
Everything is looking totally cool to me is the best online teaching platform.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.240
Read more.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.890
And this is coming right here and this is coming right here and everything is coming right here.

07:36.900 --> 07:43.820
So even on these on the posts there we have added the reading the readings are also being applied.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.610
So you can see how this is looking OK.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.070
And then we have this read more.

07:48.110 --> 07:48.690
OK.

07:48.740 --> 07:52.810
So this is showing six post 1 2 3 4 5 6.

07:52.820 --> 07:56.020
If I just come here and I just edit this page OK.

07:56.090 --> 07:59.720
And then I add that it should show some like

08:02.960 --> 08:04.000
two posts per page.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.220
So I know it will look a bit much.

08:06.220 --> 08:12.130
Funny you should many of them choose 10 polls to show at least but to post.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.520
I know really not good.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.150
But let's just come here and let's test it.

08:17.150 --> 08:24.690
Basically OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit the page right now and you can see this.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.040
This is the page nation that is coming right here.

08:27.190 --> 08:32.710
And it is showing all the blog posts that I have for you now so you can pretty well make this your home

08:32.710 --> 08:38.590
page if you want to make it home page because some people do not like so much on the blog feed on her

08:38.680 --> 08:39.800
on their home page.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.720
So if you wanted to be normal you can also be normal.

08:42.730 --> 08:47.590
And then a little to show you that how can you basically delete everything from here how can you make

08:47.590 --> 08:48.780
it look like this.

08:48.790 --> 08:54.790
How can you add a feature slider right here above and everything is included it said don't worry.

08:54.790 --> 08:58.090
OK so now you can see that we're totally done with this.

08:58.090 --> 08:58.740
I'm going to go ahead.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.530
I'm going to add a new page right here.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.870
Let's add a new page.

09:01.890 --> 09:04.460
OK.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.980
So right now I'm going to go to the contact page so I'm going to come here and in the contact you can

09:09.980 --> 09:15.770
have the contact form title and the send email to and then you have to enter the conduct from AP Ickey.

09:15.800 --> 09:22.040
You have to enter your Google API key to the map address so you guys already know about it because we

09:22.040 --> 09:25.980
have used a degree already so I'm going to go to contacts right here.

09:26.090 --> 09:31.550
And then here I have to enter the contact form title and the send email to send the emails would be

09:31.550 --> 09:36.650
sent to this and the Mappin address is this so you don't want to add any of the map.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.090
OK I'm going to come here to conduct Phumzile and this is going to be contact form so let's just go

09:44.090 --> 09:50.090
ahead and let's just hit publish and he can see this is going to be published you can also use the D.V.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.980
builder to this space.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.990
If you do not want to go ahead.

09:53.990 --> 09:59.660
So I'm just going to go to discourage here and let's have a look at this page to how this page is going

09:59.660 --> 10:00.800
to look.

10:00.860 --> 10:01.520
OK.

10:01.790 --> 10:02.210
Here we go.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.610
You can see this is how it is.

10:03.640 --> 10:09.500
Can name email subject and send and everything is coming so if you do not want it to appear it can just

10:09.500 --> 10:10.100
come here.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.100
You can just delete it.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.900
You can just the latest from here.

10:13.400 --> 10:13.840
OK.

10:13.850 --> 10:19.250
And you can use the rebuilder itself so you can insert anything you can insert columns you can insert

10:19.310 --> 10:25.430
one column to column so if I want to insert one column you can see that I have the column inserted and

10:25.430 --> 10:29.960
I can insert module so I can insert a cardy on audio bar counters and everything.

10:29.960 --> 10:36.320
And you guys already know about all of these so we don't have to add any.

10:36.320 --> 10:36.650
OK.

10:36.740 --> 10:42.710
You can see we can add person number Kountry map posts navigation post Leider post title and every thing

10:42.710 --> 10:43.520
that we want to add.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.610
So we don't have to add them again but can we be.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.820
I just wanted to show you that how it's going to look.

10:49.880 --> 10:55.580
So I'm just going to go ahead and I don't want to update it because the contact form is looking totally

10:55.580 --> 10:55.900
ok.

10:55.910 --> 11:00.050
I'm just going to show you basically how these pages are created.

11:00.170 --> 11:02.180
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go to page.

11:02.330 --> 11:05.230
Let's create another page that we have right now.

11:05.270 --> 11:08.070
So I'm going to go to a default template instead.

11:08.090 --> 11:11.120
I want to go with the full that you guys already know about the full length.

11:11.120 --> 11:16.580
Ok then we have the member log in so you can create a member log in page if you want to create a page

11:16.580 --> 11:23.750
where people can basically assigning to your Web site you can just create a page and then you can enter

11:23.940 --> 11:24.650
a log in.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.050
So it is going to be like this.

11:26.050 --> 11:31.750
So if I just publish it and then you can create it create an account here and then you can tell all

11:31.750 --> 11:37.610
the people who are your subscriber or users where people can basically log into or say to if I just

11:42.370 --> 11:43.730
Am already logged in.

11:43.730 --> 11:48.140
So if I just logged myself out and then I'm going to see how it's going to look.

11:48.140 --> 11:53.770
So I'm just going to go to this page right here and let's go to log in OK.

12:36.370 --> 12:36.850
OK.

12:37.020 --> 12:37.400
Here we go.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.930
This is how it is looking so it is showing this December post that when these post-war were published

12:42.980 --> 12:49.290
if I just go to Hello World right here and then I just basically added this post OK.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.220
And I want to change the post of the published date.

12:52.300 --> 12:57.960
So I'm going to go to this right here and I'm going to change the Publish state to be 12th December.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.760
I'm going to choose November and I'm going to hit update right now.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.290
OK.

13:02.500 --> 13:06.350
And then I go back

13:09.820 --> 13:13.700
and then I go to the timeline right here.

13:13.910 --> 13:19.880
Then you can see this post is coming right here in November so you can see if I just quoted the November

13:19.880 --> 13:25.220
a here this November will be selected and I can even just click here and I can see this is down and

13:25.220 --> 13:27.930
see if I click here it's going to take me down to November.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.360
So it is just the Facebook style.

13:30.450 --> 13:35.200
Like if we open up anyone's profile it's going to show like that.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.100
So this is how this timeline works.

13:37.100 --> 13:43.550

13:43.550 --> 13:44.940
