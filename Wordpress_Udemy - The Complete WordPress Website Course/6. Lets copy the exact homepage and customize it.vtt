00:06.930 --> 00:07.460
OK.

00:07.470 --> 00:11.440
So first of all what we have to do is that we have to keep this page as a reference open.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.320
And then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.030
Use to be builder to make sure we check this out.

00:34.140 --> 00:34.700

00:43.710 --> 00:44.570
OK.

00:44.730 --> 00:49.430
I want to go ahead and I'm going to hit used visual builder or I can just choose anything.

I'm just going to go hey I'm going to hit settings right now.

00:51.630 --> 00:56.900
And first of all I need to just go read the section about Chrome color.

00:56.940 --> 00:57.270
OK.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.710
So I need to grab this color.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.570

00:59.580 --> 01:02.670
I'm going to choose the color picture and I'm going to choose this color.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.980
OK so this will be my section background color and then I'm going to go here and I'm going to paste

01:11.430 --> 01:13.280
Let's go ahead and let it update.

01:13.390 --> 01:16.040
Ellis didn't choose to use visual builder.

01:16.050 --> 01:16.430
OK.

01:16.530 --> 01:19.200
So you see that are about Krown Filby does.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.230
Dale this is Don go.

01:24.260 --> 01:30.280
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hate use visual builder and now you can see that it is redirecting

01:30.280 --> 01:33.460
us to there and then we can design this our whole page

01:37.380 --> 01:37.660
OK.

01:37.660 --> 01:41.550
You can see that we have the whole section background color is set to this.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.040
OK.

01:42.190 --> 01:45.040
So first of all what we need is that we need a call to action.

01:45.190 --> 01:45.720
OK.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.270
So we have to see what is used hidden here.

01:48.320 --> 01:55.260
OK but on if you look if you just you can think about this and we have a hole to call them right here.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.900
And then we have the background.

01:56.950 --> 02:02.710
OK sorry I'm just going to come here and you can see that we have a rule here.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.540
I'm just going to go ahead.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.590
This is zero here.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.110
OK.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.370
This is the row here.

02:06.370 --> 02:07.930
I'm going to select two column row.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.200
So this is set to two columns right now and first thing we have is this right here.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.450
OK this is the bouchal they have text we have text and then we have a button.

02:17.620 --> 02:18.040
OK.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.560
So let's see if I am right.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.260
Yes this is exactly same.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.260
I'm just going to go ahead.

02:24.260 --> 02:28.580
I need first text ok.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.710
Text.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.630
This is going to be the headings so I'm just going to go ahead.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.970
I'm going to add that bu shot.

02:39.190 --> 02:39.580
OK.

02:39.730 --> 02:41.620
And I want to make it the heading.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.320
So you can see this is now set to heading and then I want one more text so I'm going to click here and

02:47.350 --> 02:53.280
I'm going to add one more text and this is going to be delirium of some conduct that we have.

02:53.290 --> 02:59.710
I'm going to copy this first I just copy this from space so you can see this right here.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.320
And then we have the burden.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.270
So I'm just going to come here I'm going to click here.

03:03.310 --> 03:05.800
And I am just going to search for Britain right here.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.390
So this is the burden right now.

03:07.390 --> 03:08.560
I'm going to click here.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.290
And the burden text is going to be shot now.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.670
OK.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.910
I want the links to link is going to be a hash so that this is the normal thing.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.210
You can align it to your shop if you want to.

03:22.290 --> 03:23.700
Unless it's a line into our shop.

03:23.700 --> 03:28.700
So if someone clicks your He'll be redirected to our shop and then he will be redirected to our product

03:28.700 --> 03:30.250
page so you can see that is out.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.100
This is looking right now.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.820
Now we have to design this so how I'm going to design this.

03:34.820 --> 03:38.040
I'm just going to come here and I want the background image.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.930
So I'm just going to select the background image and it's going to come here.

03:40.940 --> 03:46.010
I'm going to select the background image the background image that I want right now is going to be

03:51.470 --> 03:52.160
this image.

03:52.450 --> 03:52.950
OK.

03:53.030 --> 03:57.720
Or.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.930
OK let's see which I mean they have chosen so that they're using the image with scissor.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.880
I think this is one.

04:03.890 --> 04:05.090
I think this is the one.

04:05.280 --> 04:10.000
So I'm just going to upload it and you can see this is the image that is coming this is coming.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.240
Totally cool.

04:11.240 --> 04:19.560
I'm just going to go down and I'm going to select it to be like covered.

04:19.710 --> 04:22.040
So this is now set to cover.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.680
OK let's see how it is looking.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.150
OK.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.110
It is looking like this.

04:25.110 --> 04:29.120
OK we can this just make it much much more bigger if you want to.

04:29.340 --> 04:29.810
OK.

04:29.940 --> 04:34.650
But first what we have to do is that we need to come here and we need to just change the size of this

04:34.660 --> 04:35.150
roll.

04:35.430 --> 04:40.410
So when I go to design I'm going to go to alignment the sizing and I want to make this real custom it

04:40.500 --> 04:42.630
I'm just going to increase that bit of this a bit.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.280
So let's see how much of it they have.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.530
So I think they have used

04:51.100 --> 04:55.330
Ok I should be more.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.220
I think this much is fine.

04:57.870 --> 04:59.100
This is totally cool.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.670
Stamp is coming right here.

05:00.690 --> 05:01.300
OK.

05:01.700 --> 05:01.920
OK.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.190
This is going a very much bigger so I'm going to change it.

05:04.200 --> 05:12.490
I'm going to make it a little bit more smaller so I'm just going to change it to be tell here OK this

05:12.490 --> 05:13.230
looks cool.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.380
Now what I wanted to do now.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.400
OK.

05:16.570 --> 05:22.120
I want to add the background color here and the background image here is that it looks much better.

05:22.120 --> 05:22.840
So I'm just going to share.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.540
First of all make it the size the same size of this so what I'm going to do I am going to just come

05:28.540 --> 05:29.830
here to this text.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.390
OK.

05:30.460 --> 05:34.320
I'm going to selected and I'm going to change the color of this lesson colors to be the brown.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.120
So I'm going to change that color.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.980
I'm going to make it like here OK.

05:38.020 --> 05:41.690
And I want to just work with the settings right now first.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.400
Let's come here let's just at it.

05:43.780 --> 05:50.370
Let's just go to this design and let's just go to text the title text.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.850
This one OK.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.600
And now what I have to do I have to just slide into center and I want to just increase the size of this.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.230
This is set to the bouchal.

06:02.570 --> 06:02.990
OK.

06:03.150 --> 06:09.090
I need some spacing to the top So what I'm going to do right now I am just going to the spacing and

06:09.090 --> 06:13.860
I'm going to go to the margins so I need to give the margin to the 25 pixel 25 because it is not cool.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.210
I'm going to align 50 pixel

06:21.370 --> 06:27.250
they have given some more so I'm just going to add more I am going to give on like hundred pixels

06:30.990 --> 06:34.080
150 150 is totally OK.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.190
All this used to be 120.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.990
OK 120 looks cool.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.250
Now what I want it looks totally cool.

06:43.370 --> 06:43.850
OK.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.640
What I have to do I have to just work that this sticks right now.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.650
So this text is of black color.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.120
OK.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.290
I'm just going to come here.

06:51.290 --> 06:53.630
This black color I want to change the color of this.

06:53.660 --> 06:58.350
I just first of all this text is said to justified.

06:58.670 --> 07:02.900
So I'm just going to go to the text I'm going to align this to

07:06.950 --> 07:10.580
just if I create all this the line is descender.

07:10.650 --> 07:12.220
So let's make it's just divide.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.830
OK this is we have.

07:14.880 --> 07:23.610
And now here I have to change the text colors and Technicolor is going to be black.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.750
I want to give some padding to the left so

07:29.850 --> 07:30.460
OK.

07:31.410 --> 07:34.840
Let's just come here and let's just give some betting to the list.

07:34.860 --> 07:35.550
OK.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.850
This much I think now it looks cool.

07:38.160 --> 07:38.830
OK.

07:38.910 --> 07:41.010
I have to just wait for the button right now.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.900
And the burden text design is going to be brown.

07:44.940 --> 07:49.610
So I'm going to go to the bird and right now and I need the use custom styles for button.

07:49.830 --> 07:55.170
So we don't want to burden the icon because if you just hold your mouse you can see no icon is right

07:55.170 --> 07:55.370
here.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.510
So no icon should be here.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.360
And I want the bird done next color.

08:01.670 --> 08:06.600
The background color so the background color is going to be brown yellow

08:09.840 --> 08:10.270
brown too.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.510
I am not just exactly copying the color.

08:12.660 --> 08:17.820
Let's just come here and let's copy the colors so this is right here.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.530
I'm just going to go from here and I'm going to paste it.

08:19.560 --> 08:25.490
So let's select and paste.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.140
I haven't copied the exact color

08:29.890 --> 08:36.230
ok copy copy to clipboard come here and paste.

08:36.790 --> 08:45.030
OK this is right now and then I want the text colors the text color is going to be white cool.

08:45.050 --> 08:50.150
I wanted the borders so waterbed is going to be nothing red there's no water right here.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.100
Now it looks cool.

08:51.290 --> 08:51.680
OK.

08:51.830 --> 08:55.010
We have this right here so we can change it to be like

08:58.880 --> 09:03.620
let's come here to content let's get here to text and this should be Shop now.

09:04.070 --> 09:04.440
OK.

09:04.610 --> 09:10.150
I want to go ahead to design right now and I want to go to the button and I want to do is it increases

09:10.240 --> 09:11.030
or decreases.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.730
Is it OK.

09:17.510 --> 09:18.160
Let's go down.

09:18.200 --> 09:24.520
And we have the button letters spacing so I'm going to increase this a bit and just make it to normal.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.470
So let's just make it model OK.

09:26.540 --> 09:27.520
We have the British foreign.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.180
I'm going to choose the open zens

09:38.490 --> 09:40.470
open sands.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.880
OK I have this right now.

09:45.470 --> 09:49.110
So now I can see everything looks pretty cool right now.

09:49.550 --> 09:50.960
OK.

09:50.960 --> 09:56.150
Here I want to just now applying this to senders So I want to go here on TO GO TO alignment and I want

09:56.150 --> 09:57.040
Atlantis to her.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.240
She can see disagree here.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.140
So this is how this is coming.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.690
I just want to give some padding to the down below.

10:02.690 --> 10:04.640
So let's just bring this down.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.020
Hope it looks fine.

10:11.470 --> 10:12.410
Yes.

10:12.430 --> 10:13.750
Now the main part starts.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.590
OK.

10:14.620 --> 10:17.850
And that is we want to just give some styling that that this.

10:17.860 --> 10:22.030
OK so what I want to do right now I want to just come here I'm going to go to Bactrim and then the column

10:22.090 --> 10:29.080
one which is this I want to give some columns so I want to click here and I want to just give a color

10:29.080 --> 10:31.420
right here so the color can be anything

10:34.800 --> 10:36.780
OK we have to work on it later on.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.000
OK.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.630
The color that we have is that we need to copy it.

10:43.640 --> 10:48.920
So let's just come here and paste it so we have got the color copied and I'm going to come here and

10:48.920 --> 10:49.960
I'm going to paste that color.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.190
So I just said this is here.

10:52.400 --> 10:52.850
OK.

10:53.060 --> 10:57.440
What I have to do now I want to just come here and I wanted to create it from here and I don't want

10:57.440 --> 10:59.030
to decrease it from here as well.

10:59.230 --> 11:03.260
Let's give him here and let's decrease it from here as well so you can see everything is decreased from

11:03.290 --> 11:03.560
here.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.100
OK.

11:04.190 --> 11:06.860
Now I have to design this so how I will design.

11:06.860 --> 11:11.650
I will just give him here to speccing and I want to give the margin.

11:11.810 --> 11:16.380
And from the left side I want to give some padding so great.

11:16.460 --> 11:17.600
OK this is right.

11:17.690 --> 11:18.850
This is like this is right.

11:18.950 --> 11:19.300
OK.

11:19.430 --> 11:29.190
I want to give some padding to the left side to less let's say 25 only this is being aligned OK.

11:29.190 --> 11:35.390
This is changing the whole text so I just want to just work that this whole column that we have

11:40.810 --> 11:47.020
let's just come here and what we want to do is that we need to give some padding to the top so padding

11:47.020 --> 11:48.790
is totally OK from here.

11:48.790 --> 11:53.350
I want to give some padding from the Burton side to I'm going to go down to the design of the burden

11:53.410 --> 11:54.650
and I want to go to spacing.

11:54.730 --> 11:55.120
OK.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.290
And then in this spacing I need to give some board them spacing so Bartrum spacing is going to be like

11:59.310 --> 12:00.420
55 pixels.

12:00.490 --> 12:01.950
You can see this is increasing.

12:01.990 --> 12:05.810
If I just give it to be like 155 this is now increased.

12:05.940 --> 12:06.370
OK.

12:06.490 --> 12:09.600
So you can see how this has changed what I want right now.

12:09.610 --> 12:12.490
I want to just work for this layout right now.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.120
OK.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.380
I'm going to come here.

12:14.400 --> 12:20.270
I a click here and this is going to be let's just come here.

12:20.290 --> 12:20.820
Sorry.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.050
I want to come here and I want to design this roll.

12:23.070 --> 12:29.170
So I want to go T-Bag trone and I want to just come here and that column to background color is going

12:29.170 --> 12:31.210
to be a different one which is this one.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.000
OK.

12:32.110 --> 12:36.820
And when you upload the image so you can see this image is right here this image color is totally different

12:37.170 --> 12:38.380
I think.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.360
Yes this image color is different.

12:40.510 --> 12:47.050
So I just want to grab the image that color is not like this so I want the image that color is

12:51.020 --> 12:51.830
this one I think

12:55.020 --> 12:56.180
yes this is the one.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.790
OK.

13:04.890 --> 13:10.150
Now what I have to do I have to just come here to the design rate here.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.570
I want to go to the sizing.

13:12.640 --> 13:17.850
So in the sizing I have to just come here to use custom that are red and change it to one so you can

13:17.850 --> 13:21.100
see this is now mixed OK.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.450
You can see how it is looking.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.510
So this is the design that is coming.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.990
I want to change the image right now.

13:25.990 --> 13:33.490
But first I want to click here to the macro and I want to come here and the image is going to be the

13:33.580 --> 13:34.290
actual size

13:37.630 --> 13:41.540
and it should be the left.

13:41.560 --> 13:47.470
So bottom left centered left center left so you can see how this is looking OK.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.280
This is how this image is looking.

13:49.290 --> 13:53.370
This image is basically for Speeding's so I have to change the rebidding option as well.

13:53.770 --> 13:54.280
OK.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.110
Repeat.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.410
It should be said to Notebaert.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.230
Now let's see.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.880
You can see we have this effect right here.

14:02.170 --> 14:02.770
OK.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.680
That is coming but this is a.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.530
This is the.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.230
Also showing some background.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.980
I don't know we have chosen the wrong image I think we haven't chosen the right image.

14:10.990 --> 14:12.890
That is exactly the same.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.400
Let's come here and let's see if we.

14:14.410 --> 14:15.780
Yes we have chosen the wrong image.

14:15.790 --> 14:16.780
Let's just delete it.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.410
Let's just come here and let's choose the right image.

14:19.420 --> 14:24.580
So this is that I mean I think most probably yes.

14:25.240 --> 14:25.990
OK.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.470
Take one is that I think I could.

14:28.610 --> 14:30.200
This is confusing.

14:30.210 --> 14:32.900
I'm going to click here and you can see this is the image I think.

14:36.650 --> 14:37.390
Yes OK.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.800
So you can see this is the effect that we have given right now.

14:40.970 --> 14:42.760
And this is going to come here to this text size.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.890
And I want to come here to the design.

14:44.900 --> 14:50.710
I want to decrease the video of this so that this makes this comes in the center.

14:50.760 --> 14:56.370
So this is coming in the center right now.

14:56.830 --> 14:57.530
OK.

14:57.660 --> 15:02.620
I want to give some spacing to the top and the boredom Semoga come here to the design.

15:02.880 --> 15:08.730
And I want to go to speccing and I want to give some margin to the top so 10 pixels from the top and

15:08.730 --> 15:12.700
10 pixels from the bottom so you can see pretty well.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.360
We have now copied this whole thing.

15:15.510 --> 15:16.060
The bouchal.

15:16.110 --> 15:16.470
OK.

15:16.560 --> 15:21.060
We haven't copied this whole charade here that Taizz and DiFonzo let's just copy the française.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.310
What is the fun text.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.920
This is set to default.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.280
No OK let's me.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.220
Let me just come here.

15:28.230 --> 15:33.610
Let me just align this to left right center.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.550
I want to just break it a bit.

15:38.580 --> 15:42.940
I want to change the font to a it to be easy.

15:48.950 --> 15:49.850
Advento.

15:51.060 --> 15:56.610
OK so I'm not just copying it exactly but I'm just showing you that how can we design it so you can

15:56.610 --> 16:02.810
see that we have designed this header pretty Vell OK I'm just going to go read the next function right

16:02.810 --> 16:04.860
now and that is this right here.

16:04.940 --> 16:07.250
So this is called the blurb.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.560
These are the blurb right here.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.950
And we have four columns.

16:09.950 --> 16:10.390
Hope so.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.040
Yes.

16:11.270 --> 16:11.930
I'm going to come here.

16:11.960 --> 16:16.340
I'm just going to click here and I need a regular row and that will be for real.

16:16.430 --> 16:22.980
So we have this I need blurb so blurb is here and I want to just come here and click here.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.330
So the title is going to be free shipping.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.030
OK.

16:26.180 --> 16:30.450
I want to come here I want to add free shipping OK.

16:30.560 --> 16:35.360
And the content is going to be orders on orders over 99

16:40.570 --> 16:41.720
dollar 99.

16:41.920 --> 16:49.100
OK here I want to go with icons so icons should be use icon and I need a truck truck.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.100
Basket.

16:51.610 --> 16:51.940
So

17:02.830 --> 17:07.530
OK I know we will take some time just to look at this because I'm getting a professional web site.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.300
It's kind of like a hard thing.

17:10.450 --> 17:11.960
OK.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.560
I can see it.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.270
I don't know what has happened to me.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.390
Yes this is the one.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.000
Finally this is right here.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.110
So you can see this is exactly the same.

17:20.260 --> 17:20.670
OK.

17:20.710 --> 17:21.730
I have to style it.

17:21.730 --> 17:21.960
OK.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.140
I have to just come here.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.870
I have to go to design right now.

17:24.890 --> 17:27.740
I mean it just an icon icon cologne should be set to Brown.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.890
So and I'm just going to copy this color.

17:29.900 --> 17:36.390
So let's just select the color picker and let's paste.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.360
OK.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.420
I want to come here and I want to beat it.

17:43.200 --> 17:43.500
OK.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.800
Let's just bring it here.

17:44.890 --> 17:49.730
And I want the text to be aligned to center so you can see how this is looking.

17:49.780 --> 17:53.490
This is exactly saying OK they have choose they are choosing different font.

17:53.500 --> 17:57.160
I don't know which form they're choosing but at least the

18:00.510 --> 18:02.330
OK ladies is trained to be

18:06.700 --> 18:07.520
this one.

18:07.900 --> 18:08.830
OK.

18:08.950 --> 18:15.100
Call here you can see this is how we have right now and it's going to come here.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.960
I'm going to duplicate duplicate duplicate.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.220
So we have three more.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.720
I'm just going to drag it and drop a tray here.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.020
I'm going to drag it and or betray here and I'm going to drag it in drop it right here.

18:25.030 --> 18:29.190
So I don't have to just change the icon I just wanted to show you that how the section was created.

18:29.200 --> 18:29.680
OK.

18:29.890 --> 18:30.950
Now we have this.

18:31.060 --> 18:34.330
So this I already showed you guys that how we have how they have created.

18:34.330 --> 18:34.860
OK.

18:34.940 --> 18:39.060
Now choose one single column or a here and then they have in the one column.

18:39.100 --> 18:43.660
OK if I just come here you can see if I just get two bags from then the column one background is set

18:43.660 --> 18:44.500
to this.

18:44.500 --> 18:44.930
OK.

18:45.130 --> 18:48.620
And in that column they have this blurb icon.

18:48.780 --> 18:50.060
OK this is the blurb.

18:50.230 --> 18:50.620
OK.

18:50.620 --> 18:58.020
And the popular product is the title and then the image is an icon the icon is set to this.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.610
OK if you go down here you can see this is icon.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.640
And then they have the burden right here.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.750
OK this is said to view all and the designing is set to on like you can see everything.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.810
Is this like this and burden Bartter is nothing.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.620
So this is all the designing is made.

19:13.770 --> 19:14.300
OK.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.980
And then we go down and we have this.

19:15.980 --> 19:19.470
This is exactly the same as we designed the header.

19:19.470 --> 19:19.900
OK.

19:20.070 --> 19:21.940
So this is exactly the same.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.010
Then we go down this is the shop you guys already know about the shop module and this is the slider

19:26.010 --> 19:26.820
module.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.690
This is the thing that we have to work right now.

19:29.820 --> 19:34.260
Let me just explain it to you so you can see that we have to call them right here if I just come here

19:34.710 --> 19:37.780
to this disrobe you can see that we have two columns.

19:37.860 --> 19:38.280
OK.

19:38.550 --> 19:41.960
And then we have some Gunter's spacing here.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.690
If he could just come here to this setting right now and you can see in the background we have the column

19:46.710 --> 19:49.510
and background he said to this and the column about Chrome.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.800
I said this.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.440
OK.

19:51.660 --> 19:56.400
And then we have we can also choose the parallax effect so if he go down you can see that this image

19:56.400 --> 19:56.850
is moving.

19:56.970 --> 20:02.010
But I don't want to give you I don't want to confuse you more so he can see the image just set to cover

20:02.040 --> 20:07.090
and in the center and note Zapruder said as I'm sorry.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.000
OK.

20:08.040 --> 20:15.410
Now we go down to design then you can see that the spacing sorry the sizing and this Isen they have

20:15.440 --> 20:17.590
chosen the custom to read.

20:17.610 --> 20:22.050
And that is set to do if I just said to one you can see this is now just matching each and everything

20:22.050 --> 20:23.360
and this is the box.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.610
So I just want it to be like two.

20:25.790 --> 20:30.060
All right you can also choose it to be like for some more spacing but I just want it to be two and you

20:30.060 --> 20:30.890
can see how this is.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.900
So we have the whole effect here.

20:32.970 --> 20:37.970
We have this this is a line to left this everything is aligned to left here and it looks pretty well.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.670
This is also exactly the same as this.

20:41.700 --> 20:46.010
Instead they have used a color here and they have used an image here.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.240
So I think that you are getting it now.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.920
And here they have used MailChimp here.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.670
Get news about sales but index subtribe.

20:54.890 --> 20:55.280
OK.

20:55.290 --> 20:59.100
And this and the Bactrim and feel success icon and everything.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.030
So we will be working up with this later on so do not worry guys.

21:02.210 --> 21:02.680
OK.

21:02.690 --> 21:06.270
The MailChimp as the provider and they have also given the API.

21:06.690 --> 21:08.220
So we will be working on this later on.

21:08.220 --> 21:13.680
I'll show you how can you just very good at API to MailChimp and receive substantia e-mail to subscriber

21:13.890 --> 21:14.690
so you can see that.

21:14.690 --> 21:21.520
Now we're totally done with this we guys now know how to build professional based online shops.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.350
OK.

21:22.410 --> 21:26.370
And you guys should be proud of this seriously guys and no one can design this type of apps.

21:26.380 --> 21:31.200
Seriously guys seriously guys trust me no one can design this type of say these type of Upsetter really

21:31.200 --> 21:34.010
professional biz and now you guys have to do this.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.140
This is so amazing.

21:35.340 --> 21:38.960
So let's just go to the shop module and see how amazing it looks.

21:45.580 --> 21:49.590
And mean can see how created this looking.

21:49.660 --> 21:52.670
So now we're totally done with our Web site.

21:52.890 --> 21:54.250
OK.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.570
I didn't think so if we have to learn more about this.

21:57.610 --> 22:02.980
So in the next video you will be learning that how can we build a forum how can we build a social networking

22:03.070 --> 22:08.070
site like Facebook and then we'll learn how to build a home based booking website.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.790
There would be bookings and some stuff so that would be so much fun.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.010
So stadium guys for that.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.210
And good.
