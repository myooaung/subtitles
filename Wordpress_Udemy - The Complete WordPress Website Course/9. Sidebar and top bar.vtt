00:00.800 --> 00:02.630
What is it guys and what Mark said.

00:02.630 --> 00:05.120
Now in this video we're going to be making some edits.

00:05.150 --> 00:05.480
OK.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.370
We're going to be working up at the sidebar because we want me to make sure that our Sidebar looks amazing

00:10.380 --> 00:12.300
and then we want to work for as well.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.050
OK so let's get started.

00:14.060 --> 00:20.210
You can just click here to the Customize here or there's two options to customize as widgets and the

00:20.220 --> 00:22.880
footer so you can just come here directly.

00:22.900 --> 00:23.290
OK.

00:23.300 --> 00:27.140
I need to log in first because this is the second them recording the video.

00:27.140 --> 00:31.890
You can see it from my get up that I have changed my clothes.

00:31.910 --> 00:32.560
OK.

00:32.720 --> 00:40.800
So basically I am now logged into this and I also want to open up this is to complete a course dot.

00:40.940 --> 00:48.770
And there we want to just go to the dock dashboard right here and then you can see that we have two

00:48.860 --> 00:52.930
options to customize this whole sidebar and the for.

00:53.150 --> 00:53.490
OK.

00:53.510 --> 00:58.850
Let this be loaded and let this be loaded and you can see that the uploading is also going on in the

00:58.850 --> 00:59.740
background.

00:59.820 --> 01:10.810
So Kate I just want to click close and you can see this is where I can edit this complete sidebar.

01:11.010 --> 01:11.460
OK.

01:11.490 --> 01:17.460
And I can also just click the appearance and then I can go to the vigil tray here and I can completely

01:17.490 --> 01:20.030
edit my whole sidebar from this as well.

01:20.490 --> 01:20.970
OK.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.300
So you feel like you can see it right sidebar.

01:23.310 --> 01:29.820
And we have search recent posts recent Commons archives categories and Meda which is right here exactly

01:30.060 --> 01:30.540
the same.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.040
OK.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.260
So I want to I want to change this up.

01:33.270 --> 01:39.570
So I think it will be much easier for me if I just directly edited from here instead of here.

01:39.690 --> 01:40.030
OK.

01:40.110 --> 01:43.580
So I'm going to come here and then here I'm going to make some changes.

01:43.740 --> 01:51.360
So I want to go to the side break here and here it says the customization where I can discuss it if

01:51.360 --> 01:52.870
I want to.

01:52.910 --> 01:56.530
This is not customizing because this is added by a mentor.

01:56.630 --> 01:57.050
OK.

01:57.140 --> 02:04.010
This is not the actual sidebar the actual sidebar would be on the HTC category page or any category

02:04.010 --> 02:05.680
page where I am.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.400
OK so if I just load this you can see it is going to take me here.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.100
And then if I manage it it's going to work here.

02:11.300 --> 02:17.980
It is not going to work on the main page because we have added this sidebar from the elementary.

02:17.990 --> 02:18.350
OK.

02:18.410 --> 02:22.280
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to come here to the visit's basically.

02:22.370 --> 02:29.000
And in the video section I have this right sidebar I have this for one two three four and this is basically

02:29.150 --> 02:29.900
talking about this.

02:29.930 --> 02:30.400
OK.

02:30.470 --> 02:32.110
So we're going to edit this.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.690
I'm going to just come here to the Rite-Aid bar in here.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.030
I can manage everything.

02:36.350 --> 02:42.940
So search I think search is not needed right here because we already have a search stop here.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.790
So I will just tell you.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.530
You can see it is removed.

02:46.550 --> 02:52.840
I have the recent boast I can show the recent post if I want to I can display the post-date as well.

02:53.180 --> 02:53.580
OK.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.010
So there we go.

02:55.010 --> 02:59.770
It's going to show that post-date that on which date the post was published.

02:59.930 --> 03:00.340
OK.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.940
And then I have the recent comments.

03:01.940 --> 03:08.060
I don't think so if recent comment is necessary and then I have the archives then it's going to show

03:08.060 --> 03:14.720
the dates of the books that when it was published when it was posted here on this blog and then I have

03:14.720 --> 03:17.300
the category so I think categories is really important.

03:17.310 --> 03:22.310
I'm going to just bring it to the top right here so that the category should be here about the post

03:22.430 --> 03:24.940
that we have posted and then we have them add up.

03:25.040 --> 03:31.460
So I don't think so if Amidah is necessary and we have three and we're left with three sidebar things

03:32.360 --> 03:36.290
I want to add a veggie tray here and here it is about me.

03:36.290 --> 03:39.570
So if you want to add about me vigin I think.

03:39.620 --> 03:45.260
Because if you are blogging if you have a personal blog and you want to add about me ventured into right

03:45.260 --> 03:50.960
here because you can see that I am the only user to this blog and every post is published by me you

03:50.960 --> 03:52.660
can see my name right here.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.660
So if you want to add about me section you can add it.

03:55.670 --> 04:00.200
You just have to click here you just have to come here we have to enter your name and then you have

04:00.200 --> 04:06.890
to enter your description your name your color social scale and then you have to also enter these your

04:06.890 --> 04:12.120
social links so you can do that but you will not be adding this cause this is not my personal blog.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.280
A Anyone can come here.

04:14.380 --> 04:14.800
OK.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.580
And then and then you have the custom header navigation custom things because so many Facebook like

04:19.580 --> 04:25.530
box this is important because I want to add the Facebook like box here so I'll just come here.

04:25.550 --> 04:28.940
I'll just click here and you can see it is right here.

04:28.940 --> 04:37.110
I want to add a Facebook title so I'm just going to be entering find us on Facebook.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.480
OK.

04:38.570 --> 04:44.230
And on should be the first letter should be capital.

04:44.380 --> 04:51.800
And then here have the Facebook or else I'm going to enter the phrase mercurial DTP as Cohen's last.

04:52.490 --> 04:58.630
You dot Facebook dot com and you basically need to Krabbe that you are out of any of the page that you

04:58.630 --> 04:58.970
have.

04:59.080 --> 05:05.220
So I'm going to go to the Facebook dot com and see which page I need to just embed right here.

05:05.290 --> 05:18.970
So I can get I can just skim here and go you can see this is the you are el I'm just going to copy to

05:18.970 --> 05:19.460
you.

05:22.830 --> 05:23.540
OK.

05:24.030 --> 05:29.280
And then what I have to do I have to just come here and I have to paste it so you can see that after

05:29.280 --> 05:35.010
piecing it here should be a Facebook page find us on Facebook where anyone can like my Facebook page

05:35.280 --> 05:41.160
my Facebook page sured if he wants to and then I have to vet the height and how I'm on I can also go

05:41.160 --> 05:45.450
with the color scheme so if I want to add it in the footer right here I can go with the dark colors.

05:45.450 --> 05:47.200
It would be dark colors.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.200
OK.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.430
So you can see it.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.560
This is what it's looking.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.910
So I think I like this one.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.390
And then I have to show faces if I want to show the faces of the people that those who have like this

05:59.810 --> 06:03.530
I have the show stream I have the show vaule if I want to show the ball.

06:03.560 --> 06:09.300
So if I just check it out you can see that it here would be a ball coming up here.

06:11.690 --> 06:16.470
Show stream everything would be getting right here.

06:19.410 --> 06:19.760
OK.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.440
But I don't think so if it looks cool.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.110
I'm just going and check this.

06:23.260 --> 06:26.600
And also this unchecked because I don't want to show the ball right here.

06:34.250 --> 06:34.980
OK.

06:35.170 --> 06:38.260
And now I think we are totally done with the Facebook page.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.600
Now what I want we want one more visit.

06:40.710 --> 06:45.660
So I'm just going to go down and you can also display the Instagram photos if you want to.

06:45.810 --> 06:50.680
And you have the displays MailChimp subscription form I think this is also really very important for

06:50.680 --> 06:51.270
a blog.

06:51.430 --> 06:51.690
OK.

06:51.690 --> 06:54.840
We will be discussing later on about the e-mail marketing.

06:54.950 --> 06:58.150
So it's not really much recommended right now.

06:58.150 --> 07:03.200
We will be discussing there will be another section for email marketing that how e-mail marketing works.

07:03.220 --> 07:09.490
OK so you can add that e-mail Chim here should be the subscribe form for that if anyone wants to enter

07:09.490 --> 07:11.490
his e-mail address he can Sandra.

07:11.510 --> 07:12.470
So let's just add it.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.790
But we will be just working with this later on.

07:16.930 --> 07:17.360
OK.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.980
We will be looking at that email marketing there will be a separate section.

07:21.220 --> 07:26.820
So get all the Condren drive to your e-mail in a few months about categories and you'll send it to you.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.640
OK.

07:29.470 --> 07:33.780
Then you have the farm action so you can go over the phone and you can see this is how the newsletter

07:33.790 --> 07:34.650
is working.

07:35.140 --> 07:35.700
OK.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.230
The person will come here.

07:37.240 --> 07:42.250
He will just enter his email and then he will go and his e-mail will be added to our newsletter and

07:42.250 --> 07:46.950
we send him every time e-mail and every post is submitted.

07:47.170 --> 07:49.060
So this is how it works basically.

07:49.180 --> 07:49.560
OK.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.420
We will integrate later on.

07:52.540 --> 08:02.320
Let me come here and I want to just decrease the height of this to 200.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.830
Right now I think it looks pretty good.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.100
I'll just go with the 180

08:17.110 --> 08:19.440
so show water

08:25.060 --> 08:25.800
call.

08:26.370 --> 08:26.700
Okay.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.790
I think it should be 250

08:32.160 --> 08:34.060
because there's no share but Henri.

08:34.170 --> 08:35.720
Okay now we think it looks cool.

08:35.870 --> 08:36.230
Okay.

08:36.270 --> 08:38.390
I have the emails section right here and everything.

08:38.430 --> 08:43.680
I want to add one more I'm going to go back and then sorry I'm going to go down.

08:43.800 --> 08:48.540
I'm going to hit this so that it goes above right here and I want to add a new widget right here so

08:48.570 --> 08:54.390
I can show display recent boast so social icons Staggs cloud Tex cloud is also a great thing.

08:54.540 --> 08:54.890
Okay.

08:54.900 --> 09:03.060
Because if you use some topics here in your post like I showed you about the your post how you can use

09:03.060 --> 09:05.360
the hashtags to your Facebook.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.340
So this is how the tags cloud are going to appear.

09:07.350 --> 09:08.530
I'm going to show you right now.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.030
OK let's just go ahead let's add this right here.

09:11.210 --> 09:11.640
OK.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.180
So it's going to show the tags that we have right here.

09:14.340 --> 09:21.920
So taxonomy would be tags you can also show the categories instead of the tags that the categories will

09:22.070 --> 09:28.030
appear in a cloud so you can see how this is coming category's Android app will watch their HD CMAC

09:28.080 --> 09:33.170
that this is how instead of this it will show all the DAG's that you have used so you can show the tags

09:33.500 --> 09:36.890
because since we don't have any of the tags that is why it is not appearing.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.760
But let's head to.

09:38.770 --> 09:39.080
OK.

09:39.110 --> 09:45.470
I'm just going to hit publish and I'm going to go to my blog right here and let's him let's edit some

09:45.470 --> 09:46.430
of the images.

09:46.430 --> 09:47.750
This is the deal.

09:47.750 --> 09:48.170
OK.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.000
I want to come here.

09:49.010 --> 09:50.790
I'm just going to go here and I'm going to hit it.

09:50.840 --> 09:56.570
So since this post is related to D.L. I'm just going to add a tag that would be Dill that can mean news

09:56.660 --> 10:01.580
or OK I'm just going to add Dell.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.340
No Deal.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.240
Dell.

10:03.630 --> 10:04.650
OK.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.560
News.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.210
Amazing.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.200
Best Company.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.270
So this is how you can add some dogs if you want to.

10:16.270 --> 10:16.830
OK.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.980
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit a date.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.000
Now you can see that this is going to be appearing right here.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.190
If I just come here.

10:24.510 --> 10:34.870
And I basically just refreshed this el.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.710
Then you will see the tags will appear.

10:36.740 --> 10:39.460
If I just go to the visit here as well.

10:39.550 --> 10:42.950
And then you can see that I go down and you can see tags are coming right here.

10:42.950 --> 10:46.970
So tags basically it's going to show the most recent and most food tags.

10:47.030 --> 10:51.120
And if I just click yes it's going to show the post that has the tags assigned.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.780
So best company in tag is assigned to this post.

10:53.780 --> 10:57.230
That is why this was disgusting so I'm just going to come here and I'm going to open this up.

10:57.490 --> 10:57.670
OK.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.920
This is outrageous basically.

10:59.150 --> 11:00.110
OK.

11:00.710 --> 11:02.320
I'm just going to come here.

11:02.450 --> 11:05.780
I'm going to click this guy right here and it's going to take me right here.

11:06.440 --> 11:06.910
OK.

11:06.950 --> 11:12.110
Now I want I want I want to add a new visit so if I want to add any one more of it I can show a video.

11:12.110 --> 11:19.320
I can chart it caves they control Kolender Kasimir elementary library and many are saved elements.

11:19.340 --> 11:19.850
OK.

11:19.910 --> 11:25.820
And then you have the image so you can also show the image a list of pages you have and text and everything.

11:26.030 --> 11:31.730
So I think now we are totally done with the sideboard here so I think we don't need it pretty well what

11:31.940 --> 11:37.310
is the one more thing that we want to add is that we want to add about the section and these menus to

11:37.310 --> 11:44.300
right here because since we are in a blog page and blogs about a section is either in the Tabari here

11:44.720 --> 11:45.480
or in the footer.

11:45.500 --> 11:51.200
So you have two options if you are creating a blog or about contact us and these links either to the

11:51.200 --> 11:54.420
top prais here or just right here.

11:54.490 --> 12:00.590
Now an added here because here should be here only should there should be the categories or the tags

12:00.710 --> 12:07.930
if you want to add any to not add about the section of stuff otherwise your blog will look messy.

12:07.940 --> 12:08.600
OK.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.030
I'm just going to come here.

12:10.070 --> 12:15.010
I am going to just add a tray here and then we're going to move further.

12:15.170 --> 12:18.200
So I'm going to go to the menus right here

12:21.490 --> 12:23.050
and let's see how many pages we have.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.640
So I want to create these pages.

12:24.700 --> 12:30.340
I just want to create one in the other.

12:30.610 --> 12:31.970
So I want to create two pages.

12:31.990 --> 12:37.540
The first one is going to be about OK and I want to hit publish.

12:37.850 --> 12:43.150
I want to come here and this one is going to be contact us OK.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.180
And I want to published right here.

12:45.570 --> 12:46.500
So there we go.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.860
We have added this.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.800
Now what I'm going to do.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.330
I just want to add a new menu.
