WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:04.490
Hey what is it guys I want to now and this video of you will be designing this whole website.

00:04.490 --> 00:05.480
OK so let's get started.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.070
First of all what we have to do is that we need to go to dashboard right now and then we have to work

00:10.070 --> 00:10.340
with it.

00:10.330 --> 00:16.200
So if we go read the pages and then all pages then we need to set our home page to be our home page.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.010
We have these pages right here.

00:18.020 --> 00:21.860
I'm just going to trash this one and this one just because we don't need them.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.850
So I'm just going to trash it.

00:23.960 --> 00:24.590
OK.

00:24.650 --> 00:30.990
Now the first page that I want to be shown can be like a register page or something.

00:31.240 --> 00:31.510
OK.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.120
If I just go to register.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.070
OK so I can not view this page since I am already in here.

00:41.110 --> 00:41.740
OK.

00:41.740 --> 00:47.770
Since I am already registered that is why I cannot view the register page but this is how the register

00:47.770 --> 00:49.210
page will be looking.

00:49.210 --> 00:49.940
OK.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.030
This is how the page will be looking.

00:52.030 --> 00:56.520
We have the contently outside bar margins and everything we can manage OK.

00:56.560 --> 01:06.200
So what we have to do is that we need to make our activity which is the Facebook style based activity

01:06.200 --> 01:06.920
our home page.

01:06.920 --> 01:13.310
So this is how our home page will be so that if anyone wants to come here he can just join us and this

01:13.310 --> 01:17.300
is the basically the home page for Facebook for Twitter and for any website.

01:17.300 --> 01:21.560
So I think we should be moving up in the activity and making up this our home page.

01:21.560 --> 01:27.470
So I'm just going to go to the settings right now and then I'm going to go to Reading and then I want

01:27.470 --> 01:31.540
to basically choose the static page and then it would be the activity.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.570
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to save changes right now and you can see the changes would

01:35.570 --> 01:36.040
be saved.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.660
So now let's have a look at her side.

01:37.790 --> 01:42.590
And if I just go to the home page you can see this is how the activity is looking and everything is

01:42.680 --> 01:43.390
looking like this.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.810
I can just rename the page.

01:46.820 --> 01:47.660
OK.

01:47.750 --> 01:52.530
I'm going to rename this as feed or the home.

01:52.830 --> 01:53.220
OK.

01:53.340 --> 01:58.340
And now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit a date right now so on clicking the update you vild

01:58.340 --> 02:00.400
see this will be the title.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.890
That would say the home page.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.880
So here you can see how it is looking.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.540
Everything looks pretty cool.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.150
Awesome and amazing.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.530
OK and now we have the sidebar right here.

02:10.530 --> 02:15.840
So we also want to design a sidebar but first let's just customize or say let's just integrate the menu

02:16.110 --> 02:16.740
and then move on.

02:16.740 --> 02:20.250
So first of all we have to integrate the menu because that is really very important.

02:20.250 --> 02:23.150
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to create two menus right now.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.830
OK so I'm just going to name it as many are.

02:26.070 --> 02:26.790
OK.

02:26.870 --> 02:29.080
One and that should be right here.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.780
And you can see this is right here.

02:33.820 --> 02:41.950
I am just going to come here and I'm going to select the body press the forms and the format.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.250
And what is the format.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.190
No format.

02:45.220 --> 02:45.790
OK.

02:45.970 --> 02:46.720
I can see him anyway.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.900
Con settings and everything is going great here.

02:48.970 --> 02:49.400
Cool.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.100
OK.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.810
So you can see that we can add them.

02:51.810 --> 02:57.400
So first of all I want to add the home page which is this in the home page basically is going to show

02:57.610 --> 02:59.840
the activity that we have on our site.

02:59.980 --> 03:00.390
OK.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.250
And then we have somebody press logged in.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.990
Links are related to the current users OK and logged out.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.130
Legs are not visible to the users who are logged in.

03:14.140 --> 03:18.370
So if anyone is logged in then log in and register will not be a parable.

03:18.480 --> 03:24.300
OK and if anyone is not log in if anyone is logged then basically OK then this will appear.

03:24.460 --> 03:31.360
So basically I want to just add this activity but this is already here so I don't want to add it.

03:31.480 --> 03:31.960
OK.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.060
You know what we can do is that you can design a custom home page and that will be like registered to

03:37.060 --> 03:38.520
our site or something like that.

03:38.530 --> 03:42.940
And this is our social networking and you can meet a custom homepage like Facebook where people can

03:42.940 --> 03:44.670
register and do some stuff.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.100
So if you want to do that you can also do that.

03:47.110 --> 03:49.680
But I just want my homepage to be the activity.

03:49.780 --> 03:53.530
So if you want to do that how you can do that.

03:53.610 --> 03:58.670
So you guys already know that how can you create a home page a custom home page for your buddy press.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.280
OK.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.670
And then you can just created the Elementary and then in that you can add that like sign up to a Web

04:04.660 --> 04:09.360
site to get into that or just in the home page you can just introduce yourself.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.610
So like if I am creating a website for a school ok that I want to use the school right here.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.060
OK.

04:16.200 --> 04:21.630
So this is basically the whole school based Web site there is about section every section.

04:21.630 --> 04:27.240
But if someone logs and he's a student then he can see this stuff so you can just add it if you want

04:27.240 --> 04:27.690
to.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.280
OK I think I want to show you because I'm.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.470
I just want to show you OK.

04:32.550 --> 04:34.670
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to add new right now.

04:34.770 --> 04:35.200
OK.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.590
And then I'm going to add the home page.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.950
OK so this will be my home page right now.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.310
Now here I want to just come here to the Condon's play out.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.200
And then the Condon's lay out I want to select a hundred percent full.

04:46.270 --> 04:50.610
Disable the title title should be disable as well.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.910
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right now and I'm going to make my desk page

04:54.090 --> 04:56.100
as the home page I'm going to go to reading right now.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.760
And I want to select that home as my home page.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.160
OK.

05:00.270 --> 05:04.620
And that that the activity activity will be the home as well.

05:04.710 --> 05:09.770
OK so I will rename that activity as the activity.

05:09.870 --> 05:10.290
OK.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.860
So this is the home that we changed that.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.190
I'm just going to come here to the home and I'm going to rename it as activity OK.

05:16.230 --> 05:24.460
Activity go I'm going to enter Oh sorry I have to just debate it so you can see this is being updated

05:24.460 --> 05:25.030
right now.

05:26.520 --> 05:31.740
And read here and let's just open this page up and let's see how is looking so this is looking pretty

05:31.740 --> 05:32.380
cool.

05:32.670 --> 05:32.990
OK.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.090
What we have to do is that we need to go to or say OK and then we have to design our home page so let's

05:39.090 --> 05:45.530
suppose that I am running a school and this is a school and then we have the forum for mass inside that.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.780
So I'm just gonna click Edit elements are OK.

05:48.870 --> 05:53.820
And you can see the edit to the mentor is right here instead of creating this whole page and going to

05:53.820 --> 05:54.750
use a template.

05:54.810 --> 06:00.500
Obviously a guy is going to use a template to just I just wanted to show you how we can you design and

06:00.570 --> 06:04.530
I'm just going to click add template and you can see that a template will be here.

06:04.530 --> 06:08.550
So I am just going to be using

06:13.360 --> 06:13.880
this template.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.450
OK.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.320
I'm just going to use this template and this is being uploaded.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.020
So once this is uploaded it will be here and then we have to work with the menu.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.230
So you can see this is right here.

06:25.230 --> 06:26.160
So this is right here.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.830
Design your Wordpress how to make a web site start your free trial.

06:28.830 --> 06:33.550
So since Let's suppose that this is our school a school based Web site OK.

06:33.690 --> 06:36.020
And this right here this is everything is here.

06:36.300 --> 06:42.410
And so here we would be showing a log in and register option as well just for if someone is a student.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.220
OK.

06:43.230 --> 06:48.740
And he wants to register to us to just interact with other students then we want to add that functionality

06:48.750 --> 06:49.710
so this will be our home base.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.180
Basically I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say right now.

06:52.290 --> 06:52.810
OK.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.890
And you can see this my home page is totally saved.

06:56.100 --> 07:02.110
Now here I am going to just come here to Main you and I'm going to save it.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.690
So just sitting safe you can see it is right here.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.980
Let's see which is this.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.780
This is the navigation page and the original is activity.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.340
I'm just going to remove it.

07:11.340 --> 07:12.780
I need the homepage basically.

07:12.780 --> 07:13.280
OK.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.820
I want to just add it so the home page will be there.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.470
And let's just select it to be mean and let's select menu.

07:19.500 --> 07:26.930
So now I'm just coming here and just being a web site you're going to see how my website looks OK.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.330
So the template is right here.

07:29.370 --> 07:29.830
OK.

07:29.910 --> 07:30.630
This is right here.

07:30.630 --> 07:33.960
So let's suppose that I am running a coaching trial or something like that.

07:34.110 --> 07:35.680
And this is my coaching team and everything.

07:35.760 --> 07:40.770
And if students wanted to basically log in then I want to show register and log in.

07:40.770 --> 07:44.050
So this will be only visible for students and those.

07:44.160 --> 07:49.750
So I'm going to log in and register and I'm going to add too many CDs are now added to the menu.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.010
And now if I just said save money.

07:52.140 --> 07:52.690
OK.

07:52.740 --> 07:57.630
And then I come here and I just refresh this on refreshing this you will see I won't be able to see

07:57.630 --> 07:58.130
that.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.870
The reason is that I'm already logged in.

08:00.960 --> 08:06.720
OK so this will not be appearing for the logged in users but if someone is logged in someone is logged

08:06.720 --> 08:11.460
into our website then we want to show him activity.

08:11.610 --> 08:17.640
We want to show him profile I want to show him the messages the friends Krups groups and forums and

08:17.640 --> 08:18.650
that's all OK.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.190
We don't want to show him anything else.

08:20.190 --> 08:25.120
And now let's save settings and he can see I have to just add that to the menu.

08:25.140 --> 08:25.730
I forget that.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.330
I'm sorry guys I'm not going to come here.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.010
I'm going to get activity profile.

08:29.010 --> 08:33.130
Messages of friends groups verb's forums.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.820
That's all I'm going to add too many.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.630
And you can see these will be read here.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.540
I'm just going to bring them here.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.190
The registering they're registering should be done.

08:42.210 --> 08:43.140
Hello.

08:43.140 --> 08:52.610
So the profile groups should be built before it and the forums should be coming here.

08:53.250 --> 08:58.140
So you can just change your forum navigation label to like support or something like that or test or

08:58.140 --> 09:02.640
help or something like that so you can just name it anything like if you if you if you are building

09:03.450 --> 09:07.830
a company then you can just create your forms and then you can name it as support.

09:07.980 --> 09:13.850
And people can just interact with each other like if you are a big company you want everyone to be tracked.

09:13.860 --> 09:19.560
You can see that I'm logged in and this is how it is looking I have activity forums groups and profiles

09:19.560 --> 09:23.130
so if I just get a profile you're going to see this is my profile like this.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.010
OK.

09:24.210 --> 09:29.200
And if I go to Krups you are going to see I'm hearing the crops and here I mean this group.

09:29.540 --> 09:29.920
OK.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.850
So I can also just remove it if I do one because I also have the menu right here.

09:35.010 --> 09:38.650
Militated because it adds the core to your website and it looks good so.

09:38.780 --> 09:45.420
And the forum I have the forums topic started and the activity and activity I have the activity that

09:45.420 --> 09:45.780
we have.

09:45.780 --> 09:52.490
So this is the activity of myself so you can see how this is looking.

09:52.710 --> 09:56.970
So now you can see that everything is totally done here.

09:56.990 --> 10:02.970
OK what I have to do right now is that I need to design the Tabari now and then we're going to move

10:02.970 --> 10:03.360
forward.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.450
So let's come here.

10:04.650 --> 10:08.430
And we also have the forums right here in the forums.

10:08.550 --> 10:12.930
You can just add the forums that you have created so you can have the all forums right here.

10:12.930 --> 10:16.690
So in all forms Howard Howard will look if that if I just add it.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.340
OK.

10:17.430 --> 10:21.930
And then I just bring it trate below right above here and I just remove it so because I don't want to

10:21.930 --> 10:28.410
add the buddy press for him I just want to add the beamy press for him.

10:28.410 --> 10:33.990
So in this show all the forums instead of this if I just go to forums right now you can see it it's

10:33.990 --> 10:36.570
taking me two members and deals slash forms.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.100
OK.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.650
And then I just save it and now just then I just refresh it.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.260
OK.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.770
And then I just refresh it and open this up in the new year you will see how the forums looks at it

10:46.770 --> 10:49.670
is taking me to like forums and then it just taking me here.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.500
And then it is showing me all the forums that we have in all our reps to just bring this all forums

10:55.500 --> 10:56.990
into that tall bar right here.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.940
And then you can design it.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.370
OK.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.580
So this is what's going to work.

10:59.850 --> 11:06.000
What I'm going to do right now one more thing and that is let me show you how the website is going to

11:06.000 --> 11:07.920
look for and non-registered users.

11:07.920 --> 11:13.320
So if he just comes here to a website and then you can see that it's it's going to be shown like register

11:13.350 --> 11:15.030
and log and log in and register.

11:15.150 --> 11:17.070
And that is that thing is not true.

11:17.070 --> 11:21.220
So if he just go to the register page and you can register to have him say OK.

11:21.240 --> 11:26.250
And if he just goes to the log in page and he can log himself into a room say so this is I was going

11:26.250 --> 11:29.990
to look OK and if he just logs and then a tall bar will appear.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.380
Otherwise the top bar will not appear.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.740
So you can see we're done still here.

11:34.740 --> 11:39.360
Now what we have to do is that Vieni to design this whole site so I'm going to go to customize right

11:39.360 --> 11:41.470
now and I'm going to design this so let's get started.

11:41.490 --> 11:45.630
So first thing we have to do is that we need to change the colors a bit.

11:45.780 --> 11:50.050
And then we're going to make it look much better because the white is not looking so cool.

11:50.370 --> 11:56.010
So we can design it like a Facebook style VIF you can choose the Facebook color exact same or we can

11:56.010 --> 11:56.760
choose any different.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.770
So all it takes.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.810
The first thing that we have here

12:09.200 --> 12:12.770
is going to be the general option.

12:12.770 --> 12:17.460
So we have general styling we have primary color water color and everything right here.

12:17.630 --> 12:22.520
So you can change it if you want to you can change your primary color and your background color and

12:22.520 --> 12:28.130
everything and you have general settings so we can also make it like Bhag sleigh out if we wanted to.

12:28.130 --> 12:30.090
And this will be like totally bogs.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.880
So let's see how does this look so you can see how it is looking.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.690
OK our social networking website is totally Bogstad.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.200
OK.

12:38.390 --> 12:42.870
So I'm just going to use the vide one because Boggs is now not used many.

12:42.970 --> 12:48.670
So because Marg's was used before the days before the olden days older days OK.

12:48.770 --> 12:51.090
So the source is going to be on page types.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.440
I'm going to go back where I have the page title right now.

12:53.610 --> 12:53.890
OK.

12:53.900 --> 12:59.210
This is basically the page title if I just go to activity and then you can see that this is the page

12:59.210 --> 12:59.700
titled.

12:59.720 --> 13:08.860
So I'm just going to design this so or you can just to read the style it should be centered or it should

13:08.860 --> 13:15.730
be in a background made so if you need a background image you can just move on to the background image

13:15.960 --> 13:16.340
OK.

13:16.350 --> 13:18.770
You have to select any image and this will be the title.

13:18.770 --> 13:21.890
So this is also it looks good.

13:21.990 --> 13:29.240
I am just going to go fed the dissenters so I just go to style and let's just go to Center.

13:29.280 --> 13:34.450
So on Centuri Let's see how does it look so this is it is looking.

13:34.450 --> 13:35.410
It looks pretty cool.

13:35.610 --> 13:36.300
OK.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.350
I'm going to go ahead.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.810
I'm going to change the background colors some background colors.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.900
Kind of be like

13:44.850 --> 13:45.430
let's go.

13:45.510 --> 13:46.980
Let's just follow the team.

13:47.010 --> 13:47.390
OK.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.980
So my next caller is going to be white.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.330
So this is how it's looking.

13:50.410 --> 13:50.810
OK.

13:50.850 --> 13:53.090
You have the whole title right here.

13:53.910 --> 13:56.480
The position is going to be under the title.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.140
So this is the bread crumbs.

13:59.150 --> 14:03.440
This is called a bread crumb so I don't think so if you want to add the breadcrumbs bread crumbs doesn't

14:03.440 --> 14:03.830
look good.

14:03.830 --> 14:07.090
So I'm just going to remove the product from there should be only the title.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.340
The title looks straight amazing.

14:09.410 --> 14:09.720
OK.

14:09.740 --> 14:13.120
If you want the bread crumbs you can obviously totally depends upon you.

14:13.130 --> 14:17.830
The breadcrumbs will help your users to like go into the back page that very they want to go.

14:17.930 --> 14:19.640
But I don't want that.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.800
I just don't want this.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.820
It's just this just doesn't look good.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.780
It looks ugly.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.660
I'm going to go back and you can see that we have this crawl to top so shredded up should be here no

14:29.660 --> 14:30.200
problem.

14:30.200 --> 14:35.500
We have the page nation and then we have their farms team buttons in for year for error page.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.230
OK.

14:36.230 --> 14:39.820
Now we have the topography the top bar.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.830
We have to work with the top bar right now.

14:41.930 --> 14:45.110
I'm just going to come here to the general and I'm going to disable it right now.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.940
So yes OK let's just disable the top where we.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.180
We don't want it right here.

14:49.240 --> 14:49.910
OK.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.050
This is cool.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.340
And just going to go back right now.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.050
I'm going to go back.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.240
And now here to go to the general tab of the header.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.710
So this is the header right now.

14:58.100 --> 14:58.540
OK.

14:58.640 --> 15:04.460
The header that I need is going to be the top menu

15:08.540 --> 15:12.840
the top menu top in you looks kind of cool.

15:13.320 --> 15:17.590
And I think the medium

15:25.410 --> 15:27.520

15:27.600 --> 15:31.190
I just go with the word tickle the word should be like here or here.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.790

15:55.990 --> 15:58.460
I'm just going to stick with the minimal minimal.

There's no next color.

16:20.010 --> 16:20.320
OK.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.410
I need to go back.

16:21.490 --> 16:22.580
I need to go to the head of media.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.180
So not in the head of media I need to go to the logo.

16:25.330 --> 16:28.960

16:44.540 --> 16:45.010
OK.

16:45.060 --> 16:45.640
This is right here.

16:45.650 --> 16:49.550
I'm just going to make it look like this so it should be like this logo only.
