00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.300
Welcome back to the interview today the science course.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.810
And today we're going to talk about a brand new concept that we're introducing to the world called the

3
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.250
six week data scientists we have seen lots of success stories we've been through the journey ourselves

4
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.800
in some cases several times and we know what it takes to become a data scientist and our statement here

5
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.030
is that you can become a did a scientist in six weeks you can become a starting date and not promising

6
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.780
that you can become a super successful best there are scientists in the world.

7
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.040
No but you can become a data scientist that can add value to businesses that can apply machine learning

8
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.340
visualization understand statistical concepts and use Python and other programming languages and apply

9
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.930
machine learning concepts within six weeks.

10
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.510
And to prove that we've got a specific timeline set out for a specific path we have a timeline attached

11
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.270
to it.

12
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.300
So we're going to go through it now and we'll show you exactly what you need to study and in what order

13
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.820
and how much time you spend on each topic in order to get there.

14
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.740
You ready.

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.470
Let's dive straight into it.

16
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.990
All right.

17
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:29.920
So you start here on Day Zero and the first thing that we suggest looking at is statistics and oh all

18
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.420
of these topics that we're going to cover of here this is going to be 10 steps to get to the finish.

19
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.840
We're going to talk about them in more detail in this section of the course and you will get to know

20
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.500
them a bit better.

21
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.650
So don't worry if you feel a bit like you don't really understand why something is important or why

22
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.110
something is this or what it constitutes.

23
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.430
That's OK because first of all we'll talk about it in this section of the course.

24
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.420
And then moreover we will cover up this whole map again in the conclusion of the course.

25
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.510
Just to reiterate everything once you have a different perspective once you know what these topics are

26
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.420
about so statistics we suggest spending six days of mistakes.

27
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.950
And the reason so we're going to mention in this trial we're going to mention why the reason why we

28
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.800
think these things are important and the reason why for statistics is to avoid costly mistakes.

29
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.480
I'm a firm believer that you don't really need to know all of these things in the world to be successful

30
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.130
there are scientists but you do need a core foundation in order to avoid mistakes and in order to avoid

31
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.460
misrepresenting results misinterpreting insights.

32
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.200
And in this course will tell you exactly what statistics to focus on.

33
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.620
It should.

34
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.060
It's should be sufficient for you to be able to grasp those concepts in six days.

35
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.090
Next step is to learn the data science process.

36
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.560
Don't worry we've got you covered here.

37
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.230
We will actually walk through the data science process in one of the tutorials in this course so that

38
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.870
part we've got covered for you and you can always reference back to it if you need a refresher.

39
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.040
It's got five steps and the Dennison's process is the process that pretty much any data assigns project

40
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.820
goes through.

41
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.950
It's important to kind of distinguish what we are talking about here is your roadmap to becoming a data

42
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.450
scientist whereas the design process is the process.

43
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.430
A day a science project goes through contains five steps and it's good to be aware of it so that you

44
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.260
know the bigger picture.

45
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.240
But once again we've got you covered on this.

46
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.170
And so let's proceed further.

47
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.840
The next step is viz. learning about facilitation and picking a tool and learning how to apply the tool

48
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.730
to create successful and insightful visualization.

49
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.780
It should be sufficient.

50
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.720
Ten days should be sufficient to get you going on the way.

51
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.660
There are some very powerful and the simple to use tools that allow dragon Drogin drag and drop interface

52
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.950
some examples at Tablo click View and power VI.

53
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.400
So those are just three tools I can name off the top of my head that it takes like two or three days

54
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.650
to get your head around and be able to use and in 10 days you can create by then you can read like five

55
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.800
very powerful Weasel's missions and you will know 60 percent of that or you will know how to use it

56
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.890
in how to leverage its power for your work.

57
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.100
So we're allocating 10 days to it so that you can get to get to know it and actually practice in that

58
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.390
time.

59
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.720
We actually expect that you fulfill the next checkpoint.

60
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:36.220
So these orange all these brown boxes identify checkpoints and we expect that or we suggest in those

61
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.070
10 days you attempt you first did a science project.

62
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.680
So what we're saying here is that those ten days are enough to learn isolation and practice some pro-law

63
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.760
long kind projects.

64
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.670
We have instructors whether you're taking these courses on line in person reading books or watching

65
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.910
videos.

66
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.790
But what we're saying with the checkpoint is like trying to attempt your first day at a science project

67
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.300
using visualization techniques that you learned in those 10 days.

68
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.840
And see that it is actually not as difficult as you think you might not be able to complete the project

69
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.660
end to end.

70
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.540
Not yet but you will already be able to get some insights and get some value information from the data.

71
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.540
Next from there the next step is databases.

72
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:28.730
So the reason why behind databases is so that you expand your reach of data so that you can have access

73
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.690
to more data.

74
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.870
So up until this point you're probably looking at data well in this process that this is an election

75
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.290
year you will be probably looking at data in CACP files or Excel files whereas if you learn the basics

76
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.520
of Asgill databases you'll be able to get more data access to more data and therefore for more analytics.

77
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.050
And again we are allocate five days to this simply because to get the basics of working with databases.

78
00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:02.120
Five days is well more than enough to understand simple concepts like a select statement in a school

79
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:10.610
that takes just a couple of days and in five days you should be able to know the basics of how to extract

80
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.780
some data from a database.

81
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.250
The next step in our path is statistical learning.

82
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.100
And so this is the tutorial in this section of the course where you will get to meet at lunch.

83
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.480
And if you haven't met him yet then for the first time I'd love to but the rest is the second instructor

84
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.100
on the course and with great lots and lots of courses together and how he'll be telling your boss to

85
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.000
just learning the reason why we're allocating only two days to discoloring is not because it's a simple

86
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.720
concept but because we want to make sure that you don't get bogged down as the disco learning or we

87
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.680
don't get too carried away with it.

88
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:54.020
Those are two extremes that are not going to create hurdles for you progressing to becoming a data scientist

89
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.670
in order to be a data scientists you don't really need to know all the ins and outs of every single

90
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.430
algorithm that you might need if you want to do research in this space and this is what some call some

91
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.760
basic statistical learning principles are going to be sufficient in order to just give you an example

92
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.780
of what it's all about.

93
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.470
So the ha the why here is in order to get a feel for what's a disco learning is and to see that if you

94
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.320
want to delve deeper into CERN machine learning all you can because of the discoloring.

95
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.620
And then finally the next step and probably the largest step in our journey is machine learning.

96
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:37.970
We're allocating 12 days to this because understanding how to apply machine learning algorithms and

97
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.590
when to apply which one is very important.

98
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.840
It is one of the most used.

99
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.470
In fact it is the most used concept in the whole data size.

100
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:54.350
You will see that a lot of business pros or industry problems or health problems or all sorts of the

101
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.830
types of problems are actually sold using machine learning and that's why it's such an important concept

102
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.630
and such an important space.

103
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:09.920
And the idea here is that you take those 12 days to learn several algorithms between three and five

104
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.850
different core machine learning algorithms that you will look into something from regression something

105
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.470
for classification something clustering.

106
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.540
Those are just branches of machine learning each one of them has like at least three to seven different

107
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.280
algorithms.

108
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.880
But if you learn at least one algorithm from every single one of those branches one from regression

109
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.330
one from clustering about justification and maybe one or two other ones just get to practice them if

110
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:41.520
you spend two days per algorithm that should be totally enough to give you an understanding of First

111
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.340
of all that you can do it.

112
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.740
And second the types of problems that they solve so that in the future when you come across a problem

113
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.600
you know I've seen this somewhere or it feels like I need to use this algorithm and I'm going to go

114
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.670
do that.

115
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.080
So that's machine learning.

116
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.470
After that we've got another checkpoint attempt and advanced data center project.

117
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.330
In fact that checkpoint is actually included in those 12 days.

118
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.850
So as you spend the 12 days learning three to five different algorithms give it a shot to take on an

119
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.560
Advanced Science Challenge and you'll be surprised at how far we can progress.

120
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.030
All right then we will then we allocate five days to learning more about Python.

121
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:30.190
So Aro in this case we were suggesting to apply machine learning using Python and therefore learning

122
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.800
more about Python is going to help you speed up your process.

123
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.020
So the how behind learning are the why behind learning Python is to increase the agility with which

124
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.370
you can solve these machine learning challenges.

125
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.480
Five days should be enough to learn the basic principle of python and get enough hands on practice so

126
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.160
that you are more comfortable using by them.

127
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.170
And finally at their journey we're allocating two days to deep learning.

128
00:09:54.170 --> 00:10:01.130
Again it's not because it's a simple concept it's rather to get a feel for deep learning to understand

129
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.740
what is possible in the world of deep learning other opportunities it opens up.

130
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.560
So you always know that there's this alternative to your visual analytics and your machine learning

131
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.010
analytics this is something even more advanced which is called deep learning.

132
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.250
And then one day when you do decide to dive into it you know that's it's there.

133
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.220
And you know where approximately which direction to go.

134
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.280
So it's a good good to have that.

135
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.920
And so after that 42 days you made it.

136
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.690
If you follow this process and you diligently put in the hours every single one of these days that he

137
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:46.270
specified here at the end by day 42 you will be ready to go out there and to tell the world that a new

138
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.800
data scientist has arrived.

139
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.700
And you can go on Kaggle and start looking at different competitions where you can participate.

140
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.990
You can go on work and create your data science profile and say that you're studying all data scientists

141
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:07.760
then start bidding for jobs and Janks hands on experience that way and maybe if you're studying odds

142
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.990
you're on your own then you can approach your first client.

143
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:18.430
It might be scary but based on all the work you've done and all the hours that you've put in by this

144
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.810
stage you are ready to start into the real world.

145
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.140
So that's that's our journey.

146
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.730
And in fact in this course we've got two extra features for you.

147
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.600
We'll give you a feel for what it's like to be a data scientist will you get a feel for what it's like

148
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.680
to apply visualization.

149
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:42.310
We'll be talking about these issues for data mining so we have a whole section on where you can get

150
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:48.500
to play around with Tablo and solve a real world challenge step by step together with us.

151
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.490
And also same thing for machine learning.

152
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:57.400
We have a whole section where you actually sold two challenges together with us in machine learning

153
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.870
using Python.

154
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.850
So we're very excited about this course.

155
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.000
We hope you're excited about this journey.

156
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:09.480
As excited as we are we've just come up with this concept and we were just introducing it to the world

157
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:17.200
so you are going to be our first subjects that are going to go through this and we're very confident

158
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:23.950
