00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,410
Come back to the intro to today's science course I hope you enjoy this section on visualization and

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,630
how it can be used in data centers.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,890
And today what I wanted to point out is that visualization can use can be used in many different ways.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,710
We only use it in one specific application which is visualization for data mining.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,610
And as you can see we could we did come up with some very interesting insights and some valuable like

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,730
recommendations we're going to make some valuable recommendations from these insights.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,650
However it did feel very repetitive like mundane.

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,270
And we just doing the same thing same colors same type of charts.

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,630
So it wasn't like it was fun from the point of view of the insides and finding them but it wasn't really

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:59,150
fun from the point of view of realisation and I wanted to use this tutorial to showcase that.

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,490
It's not always like this that in data science the other side of insulation creating beautiful stunning

12
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:12,780
images and dashboards is also very important and it is possible even with tools like tabel and and beyond

13
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,620
of course.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,090
And so I want to start by showing this I remember how quickly we created how just by dragging dropping

15
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,390
a couple of things we created a chart which talks about the distribution of our customers across different

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,350
age groups.

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,550
Well you can trade more in tabel and here if you go to my profile on Paul Tuttle pub. I've got some

18
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:43,100
examples from one of our other courses on Tablo and they talk about different problems as well.

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,650
And here's a few illustrations from there.

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:54,960
So for instance this visualization as a challenge in the course actually created a time I was timing

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,970
myself when I created it and took me less than five minutes to create it with.

22
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,300
And it shows the profitability always a store across different states in the U.S..

23
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,890
And so again it's all just drag and drop and you have a map of the states.

24
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,290
Here's a chart which illustrates long term unemployment in the U.S. between 2005 and 2015.

25
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
And long term unemployment is 27 weeks or longer and you can see how it's changed.

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:32,610
You can see the huge spike after the GFC after the crisis or when the crisis was under way the spike

27
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,830
started this trend started we can actually see that and also it's split by age groups and this type

28
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,460
of charter school and area charter.

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:49,140
Then we've got an example of a dashboard is interactive and this is showing us different things like

30
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:57,450
information about a store so you know the ability of a store is in different parts of Europe so the

31
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:04,230
profit margin is shown here in color and the sales are shown as the size and then you get the customers

32
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,780
and so when you click it will highlight the different customers relevant to that store and then you

33
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,250
can find more information about them if you like.

34
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,950
So that's this position.

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,710
And finally here we've got another exhiliration a dashboard or actually a storyline which we've touched

36
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,300
on a little bit but we didn't explore it further so a storyline is like a dashboard you can also click

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,040
around here and things will will be interactive.

38
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,270
The storyline has raised some pre set informational preset insights here so you can just scroll through

39
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:44,040
it and you'll see different insights that have been outlined for the person reading it so you can see

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
different comments about the different parts of the UK and what's going on there.

41
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,510
So there we go.

42
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,810
Hopefully this illustrates that visualization and especially Tablo are not just as boring as just getting

43
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,630
like repeating the same visual all the time.

44
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,100
All of this all of these charts were also creating Tablo it's all possible it's all drag and drop and

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,150
these don't take that long.

46
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,620
So you can have a lot of power in your hands not just through an analytical sense but also from a visceral

47
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,010
zation standpoint and creating beautiful insides with tools like tabel and there's a couple of other

48
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,140
tools that are available on the market as well.

49
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,270
So there you go.

50
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,710
Hope you enjoy the section and I look forward to seeing them.

51
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,150
Until then enjoy design's.
