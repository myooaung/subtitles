00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.490
Hello and welcome to this final world on the cloud in previous Statoil I walked you through the process

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.990
of getting started with my best recommendation of all these platforms which is Amazon Web Services.

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.230
And now as promised I would like to explain why AWOS is to me the best choice to build run and train

4
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.370
your machinery e-mails on the cloud.

5
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.430
Well first of all it's because he too has great benefits.

6
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.850
Recently they changed their policy from Per howre billing to per second billing.

7
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.070
So basically what this means is that before if you used it for one minute while you would pay for an

8
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.840
hour and now if you use it for one minute while you will pay for 60 seconds.

9
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:56.300
So the per second billing is a new great benefit of easy to then a second benefit is the flexibility

10
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.550
when using an easy to instance you can change basically the power of your virtual server.

11
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.970
You know you can change the power of your virtual machine because indeed you can change the memory.

12
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.270
You know you can add some gigabytes if you need to.

13
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.990
You know if you're a model or machinery model is requesting more resources more computing resources.

14
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.700
You can also change the number of this abuse and you can change some other you know components of a

15
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.430
virtual machine that are responsible for its power.

16
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.180
OK so this flexibility is amazing because you don't have to start with a super powerful virtual machine

17
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.740
if you're actually not sure of how compute intensive you know how compute demanding your machine earning

18
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.340
or amoral will be.

19
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.800
And so you know you can just start with a certain number of VCP use a certain amount of gigabytes and

20
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.180
then if it's not enough.

21
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.940
Thanks to this flexibility benefit from easy to you can just increase the power by increasing the number

22
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.400
of visible use or the amount of gigabyte or other components of the power.

23
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.280
So that's a huge benefit which makes it very practical.

24
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.600
All right then another great benefit is actually the cost.

25
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.010
You know Amazon for being the cheapest place where you can get some books or some products.

26
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.880
Well that's the same for cloud platforms getting a virtual machine to run your models is actually really

27
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.560
cheap.

28
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.170
I'll give you an example.

29
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.180
If you connect to a virtual machine with two VCP use and four gigabytes of memory Well right now at

30
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.090
the time I'm speaking it will cost you five cents a dollar per hour.

31
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.660
So that's quite cheap right.

32
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.600
And to VCP use and four gigabytes of memory is already quite powerful.

33
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.010
You will probably need more especially if you're doing some AI but you can definitely do something with

34
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.330
it.

35
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.540
And that's what we for five dollars cents per hour.

36
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.670
And then remember thanks to its flexibility you can increase the power.

37
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.200
And so if you need to increase the power to let's say for VCP use and 16 gigabytes Well it will cost

38
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.260
you around between 18 to 20 cents of dollars per hour which is still very cheap.

39
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.840
And here we have a much more powerful computer.

40
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.680
And then eventually that final benefit I must highlight are the ABS systems elastic Blug store systems

41
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.850
which are used by you see two instances and these abs systems allow you to actually keep your data even

42
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.290
if you're not using your easy to instance so it's not like you know you have to keep your data in the

43
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.590
server and pay for as long as you keep it because then even if it's only a couple of cents per hour.

44
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.210
Well if you have to pay to keep your data it could be costly.

45
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.950
But thanks to this elastic bookstore systems you will not pay the regular price of the two instance

46
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.370
that you will pay $10 cents per gigabyte per month.

47
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.600
And so if you want to do that there is something you must absolutely understand.

48
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.130
It's the difference between stopping an instance and terminating an instance.

49
00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.850
So if you stop the instance you will keep your data in the system and you will pay $10 cents per gigabyte

50
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.660
per month.

51
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.630
But if you terminate your instance while you will pay nothing but your data will be gone it will no

52
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.820
longer be your data on the instance you're connected to the system.

53
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.680
So make sure to get this if you want to keep your data on the ABS system in case you need to retrain

54
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.920
your machinery model or your amoral Well when you're not doing the training.

55
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.810
Make sure to stop the instance instead of terminating it.

56
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.150
And if you start the instance you will just pay $10 cents per you buy per month and you will keep your

57
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.730
data.

58
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.030
And then once you're absolutely done with the training you won't do some further training at least in

59
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.110
this instance.

60
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.520
Well you can terminate it.

61
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.860
You will lose your data.

62
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.980
The data on the ABS system will be removed and you won't be paying anymore.

63
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.780
So make sure you get this.

64
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.960
This is a great benefit but it's of course important to be aware of this however and that will be my

65
00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.130
final recommendation or explanation on this cloud essential tool if you're not sure of what to do between

66
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.700
the two.

67
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.810
Just in your instance or terminating your instance well you have another solution.

68
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.110
The solution is called as three.

69
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.570
And this is one other amazing cloud product.

70
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.610
So S3 is like taking a big snapshot of your data which you can transfer later on to another easy to

71
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.920
instance with another ABS system and therefore it's not like it's totally removed.

72
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.370
It will be removed from your current ABS system but then you can transfer it thanks to the snapshot

73
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.850
to another CBS.

74
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.380
And what is the cost of doing that.

75
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.110
Well that's half the price of the solution.

76
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.010
You know keeping your data on the ABS system which was 10 cents Brighid you buy per month.

77
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.640
We're here doing this.

78
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.330
This alternatve solution it's going to be five cents per gigabytes per month which can be a great solution

79
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.370
for you.

80
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.780
All right so here we go.

81
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.070
That's all the great benefits of AWOS.

82
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.870
That's my favorite.

83
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.150
If you want to know about my second favorite That would be paper space because it is user friendly it

84
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.540
is quite innovative.

85
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.780
And then is mostly focused on machinery and data science.

86
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.390
So that's my second favorite but it's great if you can check out all of them because maybe you'll prefer

87
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.480
one different from AWOS or paper space.

88
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.990
Again that depends on your constraint your goal and the type of problem solving the twain The previous

89
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.420
to toile I insisted on giving you the top five.

90
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.080
So there we go.

91
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.810
That's it for the cloud in the next article.

92
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.410
You'll find the bonus which is PTF report it will help you even more.

93
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.990
Set up your AWOS instance.

94
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.220
I just remind that you don't have to use the cloud.

95
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.760
If you have a powerful computer you can do it on your computer especially if it has a GP you and that

96
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.570
allows you to run and train some powerful machinery or Emile's on your local computer.

97
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.270
So you have a lot of options.

98
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.000
But now at least thanks to this introductory course you know the options.

99
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.620
And you can know which one suits best your situation.

100
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.570
And on that note I'll wish you a great Dave science journey.

101
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.510
I hope you like this cause I hope this was useful for you and I'm highly confident this will help you

102
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.990
make a successful entrance in this fantastic world of data science.
