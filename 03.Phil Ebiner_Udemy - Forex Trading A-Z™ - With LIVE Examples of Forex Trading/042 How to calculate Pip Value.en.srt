00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,930
And welcome back to the course and for extruding in today's tutorial we will be talking about paper

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,410
value.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,830
Now we really know what a pip is.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,450
It represents a unit of change in the quotation of a currency.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,590
Value will allow us to translate pips into dollars.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,590
It will help us understand how a certain number of pips means a certain amount of profit on her account

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:31,920
.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,180
It will allow us to calculate these profits losses and ultimately Forex risks.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:47,580
So as you can imagine today's tutorial and the next tutorial are very important for us to continue and

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,220
pursue with this course and proceed to live real trading.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,380
So to start with let's imagine an example let's imagine that we entered into a trade and the market

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,270
has moved a certain number of pips which is represented by the pips variable here on the left.

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,040
Also we know that we had a specific WM of options action which is represented by the Lotts variable

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,940
on the right.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,520
So together these two variables combined will determine p value for this transaction.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,700
So this is important to understand that people value is not just a function of the currency pair that

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,190
you are looking at value depends on the number of pips the currency pair has moved.

19
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,050
And also on the volume of the transaction.

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:47,640
So if you enter into a transaction with a higher number of lots then your value will be higher if you

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,200
enter for a lower number of loss.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,520
Your value will be lower.

23
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,940
Let's have a look at this in a basic conceptual example.

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,590
So here we have the Eurodollar chart on the right.

25
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,930
The price is 1.2 3 2 to 8.

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,120
Price moves up a bit and goes to one point 2 3 4 7 8.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,960
There's approximately movement of 25 pips.

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,280
So now let's imagine that we had entered into the market with a buy order at the low level and exited

29
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,680
the market at the higher level.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,240
So if our buying order had a volume of 0.1 lots then we got a certain amount of profit from this transaction

31
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,740
.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,980
If our buy order was 1.0 lots then we got much more profit.

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,610
In fact ten times more profit from this transaction if our buy order was five lots then we got even

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,160
more profit from this transaction 50 times more than in their original case.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
So that is exactly what we mean when we say that value is both a function of how much the currency pair

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,560
has moved and how much you have invested into this particular trade.

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,940
Those are the basic concepts around pick value and if you understand that then that will be well and

38
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,830
truly enough for you to grasp the concepts of live real trading.

39
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,380
When are we going to do now in this tutorial is we going to look at this particular example of the euro

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:25,530
dollar in more detail and actually go through the calculations that will tell us the how to translate

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:32,800
pips into dollars and then we will proceed further to derive a general formula for value.

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,850
So if you don't want to get into the mathematics then by all means keep the rest of this tutorial and

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,160
move onto the next one.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,890
At the beginning of the next tutorial I will bring up the result that we'll get in the current tutorial

45
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,770
and you'll be able to just move forward with the result.

46
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,540
However if you do want to participate in the maths then feel free to stick around.

47
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,970
We're going to dive into it right now.

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,610
So let's look at this example that we talked about just now in more detail.

49
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,220
There is our chart on the right and the price moved up 25 pips.

50
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,650
So let's calculate the value of the Euros that we bought at the moment when we entered into the transaction

51
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,930
the value of the euro so we bought it calculate as the number of Lotts times 100000 units of base currency

52
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,190
times the price at point 1.

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,530
So if we replace those that will be a one lot we'll look at an example where we bought one lot.

54
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,320
So one lot tons â‚¬100000 times 1.2 three two to eight dollars per year.

55
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,570
And that gives us a hundred twenty three thousand two hundred and twenty eight dollars.

56
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:54,270
Now let's calculate the value at Point two at the top value point 2 is calculated in a very similar

57
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,020
fashion.

58
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,270
One lot times 100000 euros times one point two three four seven eight dollars per year.

59
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,300
So here we are using the new price and the new value is one hundred and twenty three thousand four hundred

60
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,430
seventy eight dollars.

61
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,750
Now let's calculate the change in value.

62
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,980
The change of value is equal to value to minus value 1.

63
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,720
And in this case it's $250.

64
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,460
And obviously the value is going to be equal to the change in value divided by the change in pips.

65
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:33,060
And in our case it's $250 divided by 25 pips because as you can recall the price moved up by 25 pips

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,110
and then gives us a pick value of $10 per Pip.

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,170
That is quite simple and straightforward.

68
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,600
All we had to do was take the difference in values which we calculate separately and divide by the difference

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,060
in pips.

70
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,270
Let's look at a general form of this calculation.

71
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,820
So to start off with we calculate the change which is value to minus value one value too is lots times

72
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:05,010
100000 units of base currency times price to value one is lots times 100000 units of base currency times

73
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:12,810
price one. We can bring in the brackets and live price to minus price one within the brackets and take

74
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,820
lots times 100000.

75
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,900
A based currency outside of the brackets.

76
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,530
Next we can replace price to minus price one with Delta pips and we know that regardless of whether

77
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,340
we're using a four digit or five digit broker pips is always 0.00 0 1.

78
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:42,810
So here we are replacing price tumor's Press one of Delta pips times 0.00 0 1 and next we get rid of

79
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,560
the 100000 tons 0.00 0 1 which gives us 10.

80
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:56,190
So the change in value is always equal to lots times ten times Delta pips and is measured in the units

81
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,190
of quoted currency.

82
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,670
So now if we proceed to Kalvik value we need to take the change and divided by the number of pips that

83
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,160
the currency has moved.

84
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:14,190
So if we plug in the previous results into this formula we'll get lots times 10 times Delta pips divided

85
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:21,360
by Delta pips and if we simplify this 4000000 further it will get lots times 10.

86
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:29,850
So this gives us a result that Pipp value is always equal to lots times 10 and is measured in units

87
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,500
of quoted currency.

88
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:38,270
So this is a very important formula to remember and we'll talk about it further in the next tutorial
