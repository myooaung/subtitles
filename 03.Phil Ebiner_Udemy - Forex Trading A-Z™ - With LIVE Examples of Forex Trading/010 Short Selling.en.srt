00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello this is Kirill from for ex-beau dot com.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,580
And welcome back to the course and for X-Trace in today's tutorial we will discuss in great detail the

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,700
topic of short selling.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,330
Many traders especially beginners on the market find short selling rather confusing and that is why

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,970
I will specifically try to walk in your shoes today and be as explicit as I can when talking about short

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,590
selling.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,780
So let's jump straight into it as we've already established there are two types of traders on the market

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,970
bulls traders who invest into the grove 4 x currency and bears who invest into the decline of a 4 x

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,740
currency.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,410
So today we're talking about short selling and that is applicable to bears.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,340
Let's look at our.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,180
Euro used dollar example in more detail.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,290
So here's a chart.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,950
And how would a bearish type of trader profit from this downward trend.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,280
Well there's a trend and bearish trader would enter somewhere over there where the where we see the

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,030
X on the top left.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,590
He would sell at about one point three one for all.

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:23,670
And there's a recall that means that every one euro is worth 1.3 one for all U.S. dollars.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:33,600
And then he would cause a transaction at about 1.2 4 8 0 meaning that in that point in time every euro

20
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,220
is worth only one point 2 4 8 0 0 U.S. dollars.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,260
So as we did previously Let's simplify this example by talking about apples.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,320
And now let's look at the mechanics of how all this comes together.

23
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,620
Well first of all we don't have apples.

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,010
We know that on our account we have American dollars but we don't have apples.

25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,840
How can we sell something that we don't have.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,960
So how how does that work.

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:12,210
Well this is why this transaction is called not just selling but the proper name for it is short selling

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,320
it's because you are selling something that you don't actually own.

29
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:25,290
And the way it works in the forex market is you as a trader you approach your broker and all of this

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,980
is done automatically so you don't have to think about it at all.

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,310
But this is what happens in the background when you click that sell button in your trading platform

32
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:35,490
.

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:44,280
So you as a broker use a trader approach your broker and you borrow apples from your broker.

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,990
So let's say for instance you borrowed five hundred apples the amount of apples you can borrow is underpinned

35
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:59,040
by the actual amount of money you have on your account because you have to guarantee that you will return

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,780
these apples no matter what.

37
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:10,950
So you borrow 500 apples from your broker and you then take these apples to the Forex market and you

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:22,050
sell them at one point 3 1 4 0 0 dollars per apple and then gives you in return for 657 U.S. dollars

39
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,400
.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:30,150
So now you have that money and you decide to hold onto the 657 US dollars because you've predicted that

41
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,580
the price of your apples will drop and you wait for that to happen as per hour chart which we looked

42
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,610
at earlier.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:45,120
So once the price for apples drops and it hits about one point 2 4 8 0 0 American dollars per apple

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,380
guess what.

45
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,310
You still have those $657 that you got in exchange for your apples.

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,250
Couple of days or weeks earlier.

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,770
So what are you going to do with these $657 now.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,040
Well are you going to go and you're going to buyback apples.

49
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,120
Now if you're $657 you can buy 526 apples.

50
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:14,280
So as you remember you still have to return 500 apples to your broker.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,950
And that's exactly what you do.

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:24,190
You return 500 to a broker and that means you still have 26 outpolls of profit in your hands.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,090
Because of this transaction.

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,180
You left off an extra 26 apples and now what you do with these 26 apples is you convert them back into

55
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,990
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate at the time.

56
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,960
And that basically means that now you have a profit of thirty two U.S. dollars.

57
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:50,730
Now if we replace apples with Euros as we did previously you'll see that nothing changes that this whole

58
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,710
scheme works.

59
00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:00,080
Also for Euros just as it did for apples you go to a broker you borrow 500 euros you sell them at 1.3

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,470
1 4 0 4 6 157 U.S. dollars.

61
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,310
You hold onto hundred fifty seven dollars until the price for Euros drops.

62
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:16,660
You use those $657 to buy back euros at the new lower price of one point 2 4 8 0.

63
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:23,720
You get 526 years in return you return 500 years to your broker.

64
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,790
Your profit is 26 euros because your account is in U.S. dollars.

65
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,930
You convert your euros back in to years dollars and you have thirty two years dollars of profit.

66
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:41,400
So that's in a nutshell how short selling works you may find slightly varying explanations for the stock

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,940
market and that's because you're dealing with stocks and ownership rights to a company.

68
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:59,580
But in the Forex market these are actual transactions with actual money and this is how short selling

69
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,970
works in the Forex market.

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,110
Also as we discussed previously the first transaction over there is called selling.

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,520
It's short for short selling but and everybody is so used to just saying selling on the forex market

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,070
that they no longer use the combination of short selling so we'll just stick to selling from now on

73
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,300
.

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,650
And the last transaction over there is called closings.

75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,820
So as you can see it's not that complicated.

76
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:34,860
The concept itself is a bit different to buying but the Forex market has been around for so long and

77
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:45,510
the procedures in place in any brokerage company are so standardized that you will not even see a difference

78
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,060
.

79
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,590
The mechanics are different but the way you conduct them by transaction is I am tickled to the way you

80
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,760
conduct the sell transaction and the way these things work in the background they don't even charge

81
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,390
an extra commission for boring those 500 euros.

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,900
And finally before we finish this tutorial I would like to point out that just as with buying selling

83
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,290
you can use leverage to achieve much better results from traits.

84
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,670
And this is something that we will discuss in the future tutorial when we talk more about leverage.

85
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
And thank you for our attention.

86
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,820
I look forward to seeing you next time.

87
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,110
Until then happy trading
