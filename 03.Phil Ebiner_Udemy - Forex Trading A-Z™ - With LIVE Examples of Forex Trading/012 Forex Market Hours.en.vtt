Hello this is Kirill from frigs polka dot com.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.190
And welcome back to the course and for extruding in today's tutorial we will talk about Forex market

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.110
hours.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.280
We will see in which time zones of forex market operates and how it so happens that the Forex market

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.090
is so different to any stock market in the way that it works 24 hours a day.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.990
For this tutorial I really wanted to show you a global map of the world with the forex sessions visualized

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.380
on it.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.520
And because I couldn't find a decent one on the net I went ahead and made one of my own and this is

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.650
what it looks like and I'll definitely share of you by giving you the link to download it at the end

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.740
of this tutorial.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.120
So on this map at the bottom we've got a time axes and the way to read it is from right to left because

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.520
the sun rises from east to west.

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.690
That axes is in GMT time and then we've got the four main four accessions starting from bottom to top

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.140
as they commence through a new day.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.000
So the first one is a signee session then it's a Tokyo session then its a London session and then it's

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.010
the New York session.

17
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.560
So what can we see from this visit session on the forex market hours and how can we use this in our

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.400
trading.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.630
Let's have a closer look at the sessions one by one and see what exactly happens over 24 hour period

20
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.140
on the forex market.

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.250
So this trading session you will notice that the very first session to open during any given day is

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.330
the Sydney Forex market session and the Australians are the first nation to wake up into a new day.

23
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.400
It's still twenty two hours so 10 PM of the previous day in London when Sydney banks open up.

24
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.420
So this means that if you live in Europe or in the US and it's Tuesday then you can already trade the

25
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.500
Wednesday Sydney Forex market session and that's just a mind blowing fact that I was very interested

26
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.650
to learn when I first got into forex.

27
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.290
Also you may ask what about the new zealand session and that's a fair point.

28
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.320
New Zealand is located even more to the right from Australia and the New Zealand session starts about

29
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.580
two hours before the Sydney session.

30
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.660
However we've followed the Australian session the liquidity on the New Zealand market is very low.

31
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.860
And so that's why people focus on the Sydney session rather than the New Zealand session.

32
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.100
Moving on the next session is a Tokyo session which follows shortly after this session is also called

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.070
the Asian session because right off the Tokyo large economic hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong start

34
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.220
waking up the Asian session starts around midnight GMT when most of Europe is still in a deep sleep

35
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.460
.

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.520
And this is why you often hear European traders talking about waking up at 3:00 a.m. just to try the

37
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.610
Asian session before going back to bed.

38
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.080
Also you may have already noticed that some of the four exceptions overlap quite significantly.

39
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.530
For example the Australian section Asian sessions overlap for the majority of the Forex market hours

40
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.780
.

41
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.430
And the good news is that you can use this knowledge to your advantage.

42
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.510
Naturally when these two sessions overlap currency pairs like this trillion dollar Japanese yen and

43
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.930
the New Zealand dollar Japanese yen will have their highest volatility the next session that follows

44
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.880
the Tokyo session is the London session.

45
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.630
Undoubtedly London is the economic center of Europe and it's essential that the European session is

46
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.470
also called the London session.

47
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.150
Moreover by the time banks open up in Great Britain other major economic hubs like Frankfurt Luxembourg

48
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.120
and Zurich have already started into their Forex market hours for the day.

49
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.800
An interesting observation is that the 4 x hours of the Tokyo and London sessions overlap for approximately

50
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.740
one hour and this varies a little bit for other European countries.

51
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.390
And you can and you probably should use this fact to your advantage.

52
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.520
This slide overlap means that all of the crosses of European currencies and the Japanese yen will have

53
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.680
their highest volatility at the start of the European session.

54
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.770
So if you're trading the British pound Japanese yen for instance you can simply carry out a few very

55
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.990
powerful trades between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. GMT and then you're free for the day.

56
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.810
And some traders actually do that.

57
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.330
They capitalized on this narrow window of time when both sessions are open.

58
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.820
They take the most out of the movements of volatile currency pairs like the British pound Japanese yen

59
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.330
and then they've finished their trading very early on in the day.

60
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.430
And they have the rest of the day for themselves.

61
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.000
And finally last session to open up is the new york session for X market hours in the U.S. start with

62
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.510
New York.

63
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.280
And this is because New York is one of the biggest financial centers in the world.

64
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.820
And it is the east most major city in America.

65
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.710
The American section also includes other major economic hubs like Chicago which is the world's largest

66
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.630
market.

67
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.960
And let's not forget about Toronto which is a major Canadian financial hub.

68
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.380
So what happens when you put more firewood into fire.

69
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.020
That's right.

70
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.610
It burns even harder.

71
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.530
And same thing happened here New York and London are the two of the world's biggest financial centers

72
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.950
.

73
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.830
And the American session starts when the European sessions only halfway through.

74
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.200
And of course you're going to get an extremely fast paced and volatile market during that overlap.

75
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.200
And once again you can profit from this.

76
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.350
A lot of the major pairings like the euro dollar pound dollar and the Dulles was Frank experienced massive

77
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.540
movements and specific patterns during this time.

78
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.160
In fact I created a holistic trading strategy for the British pound dollar just based on this one fact

79
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.310
.

80
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.040
The strategy is called simple system version 6.00 and you can find it in my Forex robots.

81
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.020
Course it is an extremely profitable pattern that I discovered for the British pound dollar.

82
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.170
And in that course I give it away for you to for free so if you're interested definitely check out that

83
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.570
course.

84
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.210
And finally to sum up the Forex market hours.

85
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.220
Let's have a look at the end of the New York session.

86
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.790
As you can see even though the Sydney session and the New York session do not overlap they follow each

87
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.260
other back to back.

88
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.060
And this illustrates why the Forex market is open 24 hours a day.

89
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.760
If you take any time zone on this map at least one for accession will always be open.

90
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.600
And in the end I'd like to say that what ever your trading strategy is it is always beneficial to keep

91
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.980
in mind the Forex market hours of the four four sessions.

92
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.250
This is because different sessions are dominated by different types of traders banks governments and

93
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.190
as we discussed different types of currency pairs and taking this into account will certainly give you

94
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.730
a competitive advantage over other Forex traders.

95
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.040
So that brings us to the end of this tutorial.

96
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.290

And that is very handy to always have it in front of your eyes so you can quickly reference in which

103
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.900
Forex market session you're currently trading.

104
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.110
