00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,770
It has been a day since we opened our Eurodollar sell order and today we're going to look at the result

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,290
.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,330
So right away let's look at the bottom left corner of trend for terminal in the trade tab.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,920
We can see that our current account balance is five hundred fifty six dollars and 19 cents.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,160
And that's great news.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,700
That means that our sell order was close at a profit and we earned $56 in that trade.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:37,170
So just quickly open the account history tab and here we can see that our order is up at the top here

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:46,020
and on the take profit is highlighted in green meaning that the order was closed at take profit and

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,370
you can see the profit is specified so after subtracting swap it's $56 and 19 cents.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:01,920
So can on that it's it's a really amazing feeling when you see a profitable order on your real Forex

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
trading account.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,430
So let's look at how everything progressed as you can see here.

14
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,220
I've marked the time where we entered the trade with a vertical red line and that was on the 25th of

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:23,150
November 2014 at around 12:00 p.m. server time and we entered a sell order.

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,570
So what happened after that.

17
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,690
I'll just zoom in a little bit out Stop-Loss.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,420
Was it over there or taper off was set here.

19
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,930
So before we continue what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this order I'll drag it onto the chart

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
and you'll see what will happen.

21
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,980
So as you can see that order got drawn on the chart so you can always do that.

22
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,480
And if you want to see multiple orders and just cold shift and you drag the order and your order onto

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,160
the chart and you'll see all the orders for that currency pair.

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,500
But this is a handy trick to help analyze orders.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,960
So as you can see the order was open there then the price went back up towards the top of the channel

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:10,170
and it exactly happened to hit the top part of the channel where the channel border crossed the very

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,220
strong resistance line of one point twenty five 0 0 0.

28
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,370
Meaning that as we discussed it there was a lot of pressure from traders to drive the price down.

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,220
So as you can see the price is zoomed in a bit more.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,620
The price did go over the channel border a bit but it went right back in before hitting a stop loss

31
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,320
and that's that's a good thing.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,190
We set our Stop a bit away from the bore of the channel giving it this leeway given the prices the way

33
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,060
then the price went back down and then it tried to test this level again but it was a very strong psychological

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,420
level.

35
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,520
Plus we're in a overall downward trend on the daily chart.

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:02,760
So the price was driven down and it actually went right down to the middle of the middle line of the

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,070
channel so if you extend this line you'll see that that's exactly where the price bounced back off.

38
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,910
So it was also a good thing that we've set a quite a conservative stop law.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,300
Take profit rather than setting at the very bottom line of the channel we set it around the middle of

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,420
the channel that's exactly where the order closed.

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,830
As you can see as the order closed the price went back up and that's like a very ideal situation meaning

42
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:38,470
that you took most of them momentum of the market that you could so you couldn't place take profit any

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,690
lower than that.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,970
And that's just very precise tech profit placing.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,010
So that's something you should aim for in your trades to make the most out of the movements that you're

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,990
forecasting on the market.

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,970
So that's how it all played out.

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,200
And that was all very first a euro dollar trade.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Once again congratulations on that.

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,210
And I look forward to seeing you on the next story as well.

51
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:12,150
We will conduct more trades on this Forex real account.

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,230
And until then happy trading.
