1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,300
Pips and points.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,880
So this is going to be quite important to Tauriel because a lot of people get these things confused

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,540
and are really like to help you get started in the Forex market.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,990
Knowing these things right away so there's no question about it.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,660
So let's look at the four digit system to start with the forged digit system.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,850
Any currency pair has four digits after the decimal point.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,470
So except for Japanese based kind of spares with Japan Japanese yen is a quarter currency.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,940
But we'll talk about that later.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:46,050
So the four digit system four digits after the point the decimal point and the last digit is the minimum

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,770
change.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,460
So the last digit is the fourth digit.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,490
And that means the minimum change that in any currency pair can experience is zero point zero zero zero

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,710
one units of the quoted currency.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,610
So the minimum change is always called one point and this value on the right zero point zero zero zero

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,860
one is called one pip.

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,610
And that's important to keep these things in your mind separately.

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,150
The minimum change is one point and one paper is zero point zero zero zero one.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,790
So in this case the minimum change is equal to zero point zero zero zero one.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:33,630
And that means one point is exactly equal to one pick and that's going to be the case for every single

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,750
currency pair.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,830
If it is quoted in the four digit coding system.

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,790
So let's go back to our example of the spread we calculate the spread is ask minus bid for Australian

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,770
dollar and was zero point 0 0 0 7 Astroland dollars.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:59,190
So let's Express's now in points and pips this is equal to 7 points because it's seven seven times the

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,010
minimum change.

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:07,530
This kind of support can experience and so equal to 7 pips because this is equal to seven times 0.00

27
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,550
0 1
