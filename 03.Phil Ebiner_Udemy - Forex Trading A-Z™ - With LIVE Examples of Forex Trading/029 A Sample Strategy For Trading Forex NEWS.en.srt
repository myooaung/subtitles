00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,260
Hello and welcome back to the course and Forex trading in today's tutorial we will discuss how to trade

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,900
fundamental news.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:16,470
Now we're going to look at an example of what we saw for the non-farm and unemployment news that came

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,300
out on the first Friday of December 2014.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,440
So I've got a snapshot of the chart that we were looking at in the previous tutorial.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,870
Right in front of me here.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,180
And as you can see we saw a huge drop in the Euros dollar currency pair.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,850
Once the news was released at 8:30 a.m. New York time.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:49,020
And so this massive spike how would we go about trading it if we're waiting for it and we're watching

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,250
the news well.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,660
Generally speaking all conceptually speaking the method is quite simple.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,730
So what you would do first of all is you would obviously look at the news you would figure out when

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,250
your important piece of news is coming out or a piece of news that you think will be important and then

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,540
if you have some sort of predictions on whether it's going to be beneficial or detrimental for the currency

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,330
then you would open a buy or sell order just before the news comes out so somewhere over here.

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,670
But in most cases you cannot predict what the news will be.

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:39,180
A lot of the time we don't know if the news is going to be beneficial or detrimental for the currency

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,180
pair and therefore there isn't.

19
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,160
Actually actually there's a strategy that allows you to make a profit in either case.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,360
So what the strategy implies is you wait for just before when the news comes out.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,560
So maybe one or two minutes before.

22
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:04,020
And normally if it is important news and the markets will consolidate and there won't be any sporadic

23
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,900
movement in the markets so everybody will be like quieting down and waiting for the big rush that's

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,130
going to come just now.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,130
And so one or two minutes before the news comes out you should set to stop orders so a Buy Stop order

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,220
somewhere over here above the current price and they sell stop order below the current price.

27
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,400
And so what that will do is as soon as the news comes out currency parable jump either up or down.

28
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:41,480
And as you saw in the previous tutorial it just goes that way without moving backwards.

29
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:50,640
So it just there's no retracement in that movement just keeps going for that one minute or two minutes

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,090
in that one direction.

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,370
So that means that your Buy Stop order or sell stock order will be triggered and the currency will just

32
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,170
go plowing straight through it and keep going in that same direction.

33
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:15,480
And that way it will actually reach your take profit which should be maybe 10 20 30 or 40 or whatever

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,790
number of pips that you think the currency pair will travel in that movement.

35
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:30,090
And so that in essence is a very reliable way or quite a reliable way to trade currency pairs because

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,020
you will pick up the movement whichever way it goes.

37
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,450
So just waiting for an impulse up or down doesn't matter and you're setting it take profits like a conservative

38
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,880
50 Pipp take profit and you're very likely to get it.

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,100
So that's in theory but in practice there is one major drawback.

40
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:57,540
When news like this happens and the markets are going crazy Most brokers will have trouble actually

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,760
executing your order so even though the prices reach the sell stop or bust or pull in this case it would

42
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,580
have been the sell stop over here.

43
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:15,880
So because the markets are going crazy and the prices change so quickly your broker might not even execute

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,240
it and even though the price has reached a sell stop and even past the sell stuff you sell stock might

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,750
not even be opened yet.

46
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,910
And more so when the price reaches your take profit the order might have problems closing.

47
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:40,830
And so in order to implement the strategies you do have to find a reliable broker that can guarantee

48
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,090
you execution of your orders and their respective stop losses or take profits.

49
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,450
So basically that means that the choice of broker is a very important part of trading especially if

50
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,690
you're planning on trading fundamental signals.

51
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,790
Be careful that choose your broker wisely.

52
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,750
What I can do is recommend my review of brokers which is a www dot forex boat dot com slash brokers

53
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,860
.

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,020
Those are the brokers that are used predominantly for algorithmic trading but they have proved to be

55
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:22,320
reliable through my experience and maybe that's a good point for you to start investigating what is

56
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,820
a good broker for your trading.

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,610
But otherwise I wish you good luck with your trading if you are trading fundamental trading.

58
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,530
You can be very profitable and hopefully you'll be able to master it.

59
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,480
I look forward to seeing on the next tutorial.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,720
And until then happy trading
