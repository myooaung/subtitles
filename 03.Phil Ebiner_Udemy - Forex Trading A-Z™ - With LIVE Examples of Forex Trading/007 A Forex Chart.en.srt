00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,570
Hello this is Carol from for ex-beau dot com.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,550
And welcome back to the course on forex trading.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,920
So there's going to be a very fun story and we're going to talk about Forex charts very often when you

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,220
hear about Fricks charts so you hear the abbreviation o h l c.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,280
So what does it even stand for and what does it mean.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,820
Oh Etchells see stands for open high low and close.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:30,130
And to get to know the situation a bit better we're going to start by throwing two axes.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,950
The horizontal axis will be time and the vertical axes will be price.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:43,200
Now these are four blue lines represent each one of them represents the start of a new day on our timeline

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,410
.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,810
So right now on our chart we have three days.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,720
Day one day two and day three.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,900
Now let's for a second forget about day one and day three and just focus on day two we're going to use

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,730
this chart to represent how the price of a certain currency pair changed through time.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,660
So let's assume for instance that we're looking at the Euro use dollar currency peg when Day 2 started

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,760
this currency has already had a price a certain price.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,260
So at midnight of day two there was a certain price.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,380
Let's Martis price move for simple dash at the correct price level.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,210
Also when the day finished at midnight between Day two and day three the Euros dollar currency pair

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,890
also had a price.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,630
Let's mark that as well.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,910
So the first dash the one on the left is called the Open price because the day they two opened with

23
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:41,520
that price and the second dash the one on the right is called the close price because they too closed

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,670
with that price.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,880
And also throughout day two the price naturally moved up and down and somewhere there there was a minimum

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
price of that day.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,180
So let's start at minimum price of an X on the other hand there was also a maximum price throughout

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,460
the day.

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,590
Let's mark that one for next as well.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,030
If we now connect the x's on the vertical bar and forget about the Xs themselves then we have now created

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,780
a complete bar for the euro used all currency pair for that day for day two.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,950
And as we saw through the creation process and Ubar has four price points the open price which is the

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,820
Dashon the left the low price which is the bottom of the vertical bar the high price which is the top

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,100
of the vertical bar and the close price which is the dash on the right.

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:40,060
So to quickly sum up every bar has an open a low a high and a close price and that's where the abreviation

36
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,570
o h l c comes from.

37
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,860
Now we put multiple of these bars together.

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,230
Then we will get a 4 X bar chart.

39
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,540
As you can see the closing price of one day is actually the opening price of the next day.

40
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,000
There are some exceptions to this rule especially if you're looking at a Friday on Monday because something

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,740
might have happened over the weekend and the opening price on Monday might be different to the closing

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,900
price on Friday.

43
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,700
But generally speaking in most cases bars flow on from each other.

44
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,330
Now sometimes these bar charts can be colored into red and green rather than just black to help traders

45
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,290
see right away which bars are going down and which bars are going up.

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,380
Bars that are going down are called Barish bars and bars that are going up are called bullish bars.

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,190
But we'll talk more about bears and bulls in one of the upcoming tutorials.

48
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:42,640
Now this is a bar chart and for us there are actually two more other types of charts that are very popular

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,700
with traders.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,310
So the next type of chart and perhaps you've even heard about this one.

51
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,820
But if you haven't doesn't matter.

52
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,910
It's called the candle chart and I'm just going to transition this bar chart into a candle chart and

53
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,000
watch how this transition happens in front of us.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,320
We have the same chart but now it looks different.

55
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,800
Instead of vertical bars and horizontal dashes we've got these rectangles with lines sticking out of

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,660
them at the top at the bottom and some of the rectangles a hollow and some of them are filled.

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,490
In essence this chart carries the same information that just visually presented differently.

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,870
First thing we can notice is that because of these vertical lines some of the rectangles actually do

59
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,300
look like candles and that's why it's called the candle chart.

60
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,050
Now every one of these candles has three elements to it.

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,430
It's got a body and it's got two shadows.

62
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,430
Sometimes the shadows are also called tails.

63
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,390
The shadows are very easy to understand because they're the same as what we had with a bar chart.

64
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:46,050
The top of the top shadow represent the maximum price or the high price and the bottom of the bottom

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,550
Sharrow represents the minimum price or the low price.

66
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,350
The body is a bit trickier than with the bar chart.

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,720
The bottom of the body can represent either the open price or the close price and the top of the body

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,530
can represent the close price or the open price as well.

69
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,890
So how do you understand which one is which.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Well there's a general convention that hollow candles a bullish candles meaning the ones going up and

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,510
filled candles are the ones that are going down or Barish candles.

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,980
And here a all means the same color as the background filled means a different color the way to remember

73
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,290
this is that hollow are lighter than FILDES because filled have more paint in them or color they're

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,130
heavier so they're going down on the whole the ones are larger So they're going up.

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
That's the way I personally remember it.

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,110
So knowing whether a candle is going up or down it's very easy to understand whether open prices and

77
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,120
where the clothes prices this is because for a bullish candle the bottom edge will always be the open

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,410
price and the top edge will be the close price.

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,570
Whereas for a bearish candle the top edge will be the open price and the bottom edge will be the close

80
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,440
price.

81
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,770
Also candle charts can sometimes be colored just as we sort of bar charts and that helps traders see

82
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,910
patterns quicker.

83
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,500
In this case Red means bearish candles green means bullish candles.

84
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:21,220
And finally this brings us to the last type of forex chart which is a line chart a line chart basically

85
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,890
simplifies this whole process by representing only one single price.

86
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,260
It only represents the close price.

87
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,700
So instead of looking at open high low and close luncher will only look at the close price so if we

88
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:44,740
now take the close prices of every single day and we connect them then we will get a line chart.

89
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,270
As you can see it's much simpler and carries less information but sometimes it can be very convenient

90
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:56,400
to make rough estimations and see overall patterns and then further after this analysis go into more

91
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,760
detail.

92
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,060
Nullus have a look at a couple of real Forex charts.

93
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,960
Here is the year is dollar daily line chart.

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,470
So as you can see this is just what we talked about only the clothes prices for every single day at

95
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,220
the bottom you can see the days on the rise you can see the prices.

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,770
But most importantly we can see the line chart which is showing us that currently the euro is dollar

97
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,730
seems to be falling down.

98
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,740
Now let's look at the same chart but represented by a bar chart.

99
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,020
As you can see now how much more information might be a bit more cluttered.

100
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:43,700
But we can see where the highs and lows were and exactly how this progression or this trend is developing

101
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,090
.

102
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,660
And now I'll change this bar chart into a candle chart and you should decide for itself which one you

103
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,020
like more.

104
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,710
So there is a candle chart.

105
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,330
The field bars are the beverage bars.

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:03,250
Bars are the bullish bars and it's actually a matter of personal preference whether you like the bar

107
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,580
charts or the candle charts more.

108
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,610
Some people use candle charts some people use bar charts.

109
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,420
It all depends which one is visually more plausible to you.

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,450
And finally I wanted to show you the same bar chart but in a different color scheme because we will

111
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,620
be working with military force and you'll notice that by default the color scheme is different.

112
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,760
It is green on black so I'm just going to transform this now.

113
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,910
And as you can see here this is the typical metal Treader for bar chart.

114
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,440
It's got a black background and it's got black and white bars.

115
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:47,680
This might be a bit confusing at first because here the black bars are bullish and the white bars are

116
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,600
bearish as opposed to what we had on the previous slide.

117
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,230
But the way to remember is is not black and white but hollow and filled.

118
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,040
In this case the background of the charred is black so hollow will be black and therefore the bullish

119
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,180
bars are black.

120
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:10,740
In this instance and whereas white is the opposite of black and therefore the Barish bars are white

121
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,210
and they're filled with color in this case.

122
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,730
And before we finish up this tutorial I'd like to mention that forex charts are available not only at

123
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,510
the deli level but at many different timeframes so you could have one minute charge so you can have

124
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,300
10 minute shots you can have 15 minute chance 30 minute charge weekly charts monthly charts and you

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,630
can actually have any kind of chart in between because there are special tools to create those charts

126
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,310
for you.

127
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,250
But we'll go into more detail on this in further tutorials and you'll see how we naturally will work

128
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,860
with 15 minute time frames and already time frames all of the concepts stay the same.

129
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,470
On that note we'll wrap up today's tutorial.

130
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,170
Thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you next time.

131
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,490
Until then happy trading
