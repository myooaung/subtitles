1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,810
Calculating risk.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,310
So this tutorial flows on directly from the previous one.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,890
And if you skipped the mathematics at the end of the previous tutorial then not a worry because right

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,610
now I will show you the result that we got in the first tutorial and will pick up from there.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,650
So the result that we got was a pip value is always equal to last times 10 and is measured in units

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,350
of quoted currency.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,600
What this means is that if your currency moves a certain number of pips and you have a transaction in

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,110
the market the time which is which has a volume of equal two lots were lots is the variable in our equation

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,440
then the value of every single Pip will be equal to the number of loss in your transaction times 10

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,750
.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
And it will be measured in units of course currency.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,050
So if you're trading the euro dollar and you're in the market with one lot then every time the currency

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:06,030
moves one pip in your favor you're earning 1 times 10 equals to 10 units of quoted currency.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,670
And in this case the quoted currency is dollars.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,830
So every time the currency moves in your favour you're earning ten dollars.

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,450
If you're in the market with a transaction with a volume of ten lots that every time the currency moves

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,690
in your favour you're earning $100.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,480
So that's a very simple concept.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,290
And this is a very powerful formula for you to remember and for you to use in your trading you can always

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,910
very quickly look at the chart.

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:46,770
Look at the number of lots that's a trader is currently in the market with and you can very quickly

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,530
say how much he's earning or losing at every single movement of the currency.

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,990
And let's remember here this is Pipp value so not points but pips and it's not going to change whether

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,160
it's a four digit or five digit broker.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,030
It's always point 0 0 0 1.

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:14,900
Ok so now we're going to create an even more powerful formula out of this and will be very simple.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,080
We're going to create a formula to calculate our risks on the forex market.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,870
So let's look at a very intuitive formula.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,320
This one this read formula is very straightforward and easy to understand.

30
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:40,750
So the risk which is on the left or the amount of money that we can lose in one transaction on a four

31
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,970
on the forex market is equal to the stop loss measured in pips.

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:53,940
So for example it's 50 pips that you have a stop loss times a pip value so the amount of money you lose

33
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,320
per every Pip.

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,210
So for example it's like in a previous case $10 per pill.

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:08,850
So if you stop losses 50 pips and Pip value is equal to $10 per Pip then you will potentially can potentially

36
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,580
lose $500 on this transaction if you stop losses triggered.

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,240
And that means in Forex that means that your risk is equal to $500.

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,440
So basically in this case risk is the maximum amount of money you can lose on this particular transaction

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,930
.

40
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,620
And let's remember here that this is all still in the units of code currency.

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,450
So that is a very simple formula that does not require derivation because it's just intuitive.

42
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,460
Now how about we put these two to four months ago we know that p values lots times 10.

43
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,380
And we also know that risk is stop loss and pips times value.

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,860
So let's take value from the first formula plugged into the second one let's see what we get we get

45
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,080
risk is equal to stop loss in pips times lots times 10.

46
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,950
That's quite interesting isn't it.

47
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,490
And now let's take it a step forward.

48
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,760
Let's from this formula derive what a lot.

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,770
Would equal to if we know a risk and stop loss and pips and that case loss is equal to risk divided

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,170
by the stop loss in pips times 10.

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,770
And all of this is measured in what risk in this case is measured in units of quarried currents.

52
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:36,900
So this is a formula that I'd like to stop our attention on or draw our attention to because this is

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:45,780
a very very important formula and we will be using throughout our life Forex trading in the further

54
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,070
tutorials.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,540
What this formula tells us is if we know how much we can risk on a particular transaction we know that

56
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,120
we are.

57
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,100
We have a certain level of confidence in the market in our signals in our decision to buy or sell and

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,090
we know that in this particular transaction we would like or we're prepared to risk say for instance

59
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,850
$50.

60
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,660
And we also know where we want to sell our stop loss.

61
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,990
We know that based on our signals our supply just has to be set at the Senate level then from that we

62
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,380
can derive the amount of lots that we have to enter the market with.

63
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,190
So you only have to do is you take your risk the amount of money that you prepared to lose in a particular

64
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,840
transaction.

65
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,000
If if the market goes against you and you divide that by the number of Stop-Loss number of people in

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,420
your Stop-Loss multiplied by 10 and that will give you the amount of loss you should enter the market

67
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,220
with.

68
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,830
And that's very powerful because that's the way you control your risks.

69
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,590
It's wrong.

70
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,900
One trader first things aren't going to enter the market with one lot or ten lots or 0.5 lots.

71
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,330
You can't possibly think that way.

72
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,720
You should always first think how much you're prepared to lose if the market does go against you.

73
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,500
And that should be a function of your confidence and your trade confidence in your signals whether you're

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,930
trading with the trend or against trend and so on.

75
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,950
And then you have to also know where your trading system is telling you to set your stop loss.

76
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,710
And that's the exact order in which these things done.

77
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,540
A lot of traders get it wrong and the first think of all Also I'll trade with this amount of lots and

78
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,250
wish rest at my stop loss.

79
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:45,120
No you should first think of how much you you're willing to lose if everything goes against you then

80
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,780
where you're setting a Stop-Loss and then you'll get your loss using this for.

81
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,650
Now an important thing to remember is that risk in this case is calculated in units of quoted currency

82
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,310
.

83
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,490
So in a lot of cases when the American dollar is the quote currency and your account is in American

84
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,680
dollars then the quote currency will be the currency on your account and will be American dollars.

85
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,090
But if you're trading a currency pair where the quote currency is not American dollars remember that

86
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,600
you've you also have to convert your thinking you have to convert.

87
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,380
You'll be thinking of how much you're prepared to lose in your account balance currency which is most

88
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,760
likely American dollars.

89
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,920
And then you'll need to convert that to the quoted currency and then plug it into the formula.

90
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,660
I do have to admit that sometimes I forget it myself.

91
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,110
And further down in these tutorials you'll notice that when we're trading the Australian dollar the

92
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,740
Canadian dollar I did make that mistake and I didn't convert American dollars into Canadian dollars

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,490
before plugging to formula.

94
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,320
So maybe you can pick up on that mistake and see what the proper calculation should have been.

95
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,870
But it didn't make that much of a difference in that particular case because the Canadian dollar the

96
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,150
American dollar are currently quite close in terms of price.

97
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:14,550
However do remember this for future uses of formula make sure risk is entered in units of the quarter

98
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,620
currency.

99
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,790
So that's it for today's tutorial.

100
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,210
Next time we're going to plunge in straight into live trading and a real account.

101
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,420
I hope you're super excited because I definitely am and I look forward to seeing you then.

102
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,300
Until next time happy trading.
