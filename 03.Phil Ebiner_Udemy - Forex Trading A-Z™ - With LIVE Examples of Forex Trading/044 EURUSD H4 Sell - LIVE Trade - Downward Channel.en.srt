00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello this is Kirill from explode dot com.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,770
And welcome back to the course on forex trading today is going to be a very exciting tutorial because

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,930
we will finally get to open our very own first real Forex order.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,670
That's right.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,470
I will be trading with real money right in front of your eyes.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,360
As you can see here I've got a real Forex account opened with Al Pari and I have 500 U.S. dollars on

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,960
that account.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,240
On the left in the Market Watch we can see that the market is fired up.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,550
The currency pairs are rapidly changing in prices and in the middle here we've got the Eurodollar for

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,490
hourly timeframe.

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,170
We're going to open up very first order on the euro dollar.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,510
I have already outlined some things on this chart and we'll quickly discuss them before we go on to

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,000
opening our very first real Forex order.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,860
As you can see the price on the your adult for our the time frame is currently in a downward sloping

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,530
channel.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,200
So the borders are marked with these outer two yellow lines and middle line marks the middle of the

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,730
channel the price first entered the channel over here at the beginning on the bottom border.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,010
Then it hit the border a couple of time and hit the middle.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,730
The top border went down back to the bottom border crossed the mail went to border.

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,490
Now it's just touched the middle.

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,770
And guess what it's going to go next.

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,480
That's right it's going to go down towards the bottom border of the channel.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,690
So a couple of other things right here I've got some prices marked out.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,390
The green price is approximately the current price of the euro dollar.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,140
It's a bit higher than that.

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,290
Currently it's at one point 2 4 3 1 9.

27
00:01:52,290 --> 00:02:00,200
So basically you see two pipes above that the blue and the red are present we would want to set out

28
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,630
take profit and stop loss levels.

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:13,230
So you can see here I've said Stop-Loss just above the yellow top yellow line meaning the top a channel

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,130
border.

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,440
And that's because there's a good chance that the price will butts off and we will give it some extra

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,870
leeway in there because just in case it does cross the border a little bit.

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,840
So we're on the safe side stop loss.

34
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:35,970
Also this red horizontal line represents a very strong psychological level of one point twenty five

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,820
0 0 0 U.S. dollars per euro.

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:48,540
And that means traders will try to sell at that level which will help us drive the price down.

37
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,180
Also we could potentially put the take profit even lower closer to the bottom border.

38
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:02,210
But I didn't want to make to take profit much larger than the stop loss in this case.

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:11,820
Our take profit is approximately 140 pips and our stop loss is about one hundred and thirty pips.

40
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,470
So that's that's about about even.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,620
Not not not exactly but about even.

42
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,400
You could if you wanted to set the stop take profit a bit lower but we'll go a bit conservative and

43
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,250
stick to this take profit of 1.2 to nine hundred.

44
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,720
Also an interesting fact that I noticed is if we go on zoom out a little bit you'll see that we are

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,820
in a downward trend.

46
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,600
So we are trading along with the trend which is good and an interesting thing.

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,970
In fact if we extend this channel line you'll see that the price actually touched this line over here

48
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,220
.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,060
So it is a diagonal resistance line for this trend and that's also a good thing for us that means there's

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,820
even a higher chance of the price bouncing off this line when it gets to it.

51
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,670
That's exactly what we want.

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,290
So now that we've identified the direction of our trade where we want to set out take profit and stop

53
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,740
loss.

54
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,970
The last thing that we have to do is understand what volume we can we can assign to this trade.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,880
And in order to do that I'm going to quickly bring up a slide that we are already familiar with to calculate

56
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,720
volume over trade which is X in this equation.

57
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:41,680
We have to divide the risk in dollar terms by 10 multiplied by the stop loss pips value here the Stop-Loss

58
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:51,690
pips value is at how many Pape's the stop loss has been set and risk in dollar terms is the amount of

59
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,210
money that we are prepared to lose if this is a loss trade.

60
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,720
So in our case let's assume that we won.

61
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,450
We're OK risking 10 percent of our balance.

62
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,000
Ten percent is quite a risky approach.

63
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,590
However in our case we've got a very strong resistance line.

64
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,050
We've got another psychological level on our side.

65
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,500
And so it does look like a good trade and hopefully your dull will go downwards and reach out take profit

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,670
.

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,830
So I'm quite comfortable at setting this risk level at 10 percent.

68
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,800
Our balance is $500 10 percent of $100 is 50.

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,170
So we replace 50 in that equation.

70
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,040
So the last variable that we have to input is our Stop-Loss pips.

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,370
And as we discussed a plus pips is 130 so I'll just put that in right now.

72
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,860
And now I'm just going to bring up the calculator so we can work this out.

73
00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:00,620
So again to 50 divided by 10 times 130.

74
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,680
That gives approximate 0.03 8 4 6.

75
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,290
And of course in volumes in lots we can only use two decimal points about actually depending on your

76
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,320
count but in on this count it's two points.

77
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,600
So we're going around that up to 0.04.

78
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,840
So I'll just type that in here he goes point zero for lots.

79
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,400
Perfect.

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,180
Now we can go ahead and conduct this trade.

81
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:36,900
Now we're going to click this new order button up at the top here and in these boxes we're going to

82
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:44,720
specify all of our parameters so it's 0.04 lots Stop-Loss we're setting at one point to five six all

83
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,380
take profit.

84
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,340
We're sitting at one point two to nine hundred.

85
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,580
That's a blue price over there.

86
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:01,500
The comment is going to be my very first fix order.

87
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,700
Exclamation mark.

88
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,460
And this is going to be a sell order.

89
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:15,480
So we click sell and there you go the order has been sent successfully executed and it's got a ticket

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,050
number.

91
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,980
It's a sell order or a point or a fall last year or Dola.

92
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,660
That's the price at which it was executed.

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,140
Stop Loss and take profit just as we specified.

94
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,510
So that's perfect.

95
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,030
And congratulations on that.

96
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,760
That's a very big step.

97
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,890
Very big first step in your Forex trading career.

98
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,830
So I'm just going to click OK here.

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,860
As you can see we've got new exposure to the euro here.

100
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,780
It is negative because we conducted a sell order here.

101
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,660
We've got some information on margin and what's going on with the equity.

102
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,980
Now if we move to the trade tab you'll see order here.

103
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,930
So that's the ticket number of order.

104
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,760
That's the time when it was open.

105
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:09,870
That's the type of water it's a sell order size volume and lots of points are for Symbol your dollar

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,680
price is one point and that's the price at which the order was opened.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,140
Stop Loss take profit as specified.

108
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,430
The price price is the current price.

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,370
Commission taxes and swap and our current profits a bit negative.

110
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,340
That is because of the spread here you've got information equity margin free margin and balance.

111
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,380
So that sums it up.

112
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,880
Today we're going to leave the order for a few days and then come back and see how it went.

113
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,760
Hopefully it would have close a take profit by then.

114
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,070
Thank you very much for your attention today.

115
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,600
I look forward to seeing you next time.

116
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,180
And until then happy trading
