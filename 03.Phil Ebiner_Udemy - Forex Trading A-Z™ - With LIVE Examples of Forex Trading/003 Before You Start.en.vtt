Hello and welcome back to this sports training course.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.570
This is Cuellar America and I'm super excited super pumped to have you inside this class.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.790
We're going to have lots of exciting and interesting videos ahead and we're going to learn a lot together

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.660
and this quick video I wanted to give you a heads up heads up that in order to successfully complete

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.100
this class you will need a 4 forex demo trading account.

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.960
Now you will need a demo account to practice the things that we talk about.

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.110
Try them out on your own.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.170
And in general solidify that knowledge that you will get from these tutorials.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.960
Now you're welcome to open a demo account with absolutely any broker out there.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.210
There's millions of them.

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.910
However we do have a recommended broker which we would like to make you aware of because we've been

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.900
working with them for quite some time now.

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.350
We are comfortable and confident to send our students there because we trust in the way that they conduct

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130
business and our students love working with them.

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.460
So we will share the links I'll broker in the next tutorial.

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.310
Feel free to click the link and go and open a demo account with them.

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.990
That way they will know that you were before export and they will take good care of you.

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.300
And also that way you will have a demo account that will replicate the things that we do in the course

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.940
almost identically.

20
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.440
And that will allow you to feel much better.

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.620
So on that note make sure to open up a demo account very soon so that you can phone along with the rest

22
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.380
of the course.

23
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.800
And I look forward to seeing you throughout the tutorials.

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.180
Until then happy trading.
