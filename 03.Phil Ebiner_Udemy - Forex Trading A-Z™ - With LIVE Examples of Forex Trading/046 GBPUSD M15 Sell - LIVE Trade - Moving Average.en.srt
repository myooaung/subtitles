00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,690
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,540
And welcome back to the course of forex trading today a good opportunity presented itself and we will

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,030
be conducting our second trade on our real live Forex account if we look down here in the current history

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,780
tab.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,140
You can see the result of our previous trade which was a Eurodollar sell order which was a take profit

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,810
and brought us a total of 56 dollars and 19 cents profit.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,360
So now if we move onto the trade tab you'll see that the current balance on the account is five hundred

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:46,080
fifty six dollars and 19 cents of real money which we will be using today to conduct our second real

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,660
Forex order.

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:55,710
So as you can see in the middle here I've got British pound dollar and 15 chart open and I've already

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:04,500
got some markings on this chart which will help us conduct our trade today.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,060
So what I have here is first of all and most importantly is this moving average it's a simple moving

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,870
average.

14
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,800
And the period is 96.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,300
So I'm just going to double click that and you can see here that the period is 96.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:30,630
And the reason why I chose 96 is because there's 24 hours in a day and there's four and 15 bars in an

17
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,180
hour.

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,270
So if we take 24 and we multiplied by four we'll get 96.

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:48,090
So that means 96 of these bars of these 15 bars actually represent one full day and it's always good

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,140
to have these reference points.

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,230
So you could use a 100 and it would look pretty much similar but 96 has an actual meaning behind it

22
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,310
.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:13,170
It means that you're averaging your price at a daily kind of a rolling rate for daily rolling average

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,130
and that that's a good thing to just keep in mind so that you use it you use multiples for your moving

25
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,170
averages next.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,440
So what we can see here is that back over here a couple of days ago the price crossed the moving average

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,270
downwards and this is something that using the moving average in trading is something we discussed previously

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,510
in the previous section of the course.

29
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,710
And just to give you a quick refresh what we see here is that the price crossed the moving average downwards

30
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,020
and it just kept tumbling down.

31
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,590
Then the price crossed the moving average upwards.

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:00,660
It was concern for a while but then it shut up and went really high and there's a significant movement

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,770
.

34
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,520
So that's exactly what we'll be expecting this time.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,660
The price has just crossed the moving average downwards.

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,710
And there's a bit of movement downwards and there's now there's a bit of uncertainty but hopefully because

37
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,120
the prices below the moving average it will continue tumbling down.

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,070
Of course a situation like this can occur where there's a lot of uncertainty and the price just keeps

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,320
moving around moving average and this is a flat flat market.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:38,160
However there are other factors on our side that kind of say that's probably the price will actually

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,340
move downwards that confirm our point of view.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:53,340
So and those factors are one of the main factors is that if we zoom out and we go to for instance the

43
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,920
hourly chart you will see that the price is in a downward trend.

44
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,780
The British pound dollar is in overall downward trend so we're actually going to go to the daily chart

45
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,520
over here.

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,330
If I zoom in a bit back zoom back in.

47
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,340
You can see that the British pound dollars and downward trend and I've even highlighted this channel

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,500
over here so just ignore the moving average for now because it's a different moving average now on a

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,970
different time frame.

50
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,140
So on the daily timeframe you can see that the price is in a downward trend.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,000
And I've highlighted this channel that the price is currently in.

52
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,570
And as you can see it's bounced off the borders of the channel a couple of times and now the price has

53
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,150
come to the top border of the channel again.

54
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,420
And that signals to us that probably it's going to bounce backwards.

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,200
So a very good confirmation from a higher timeframe.

56
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:02,820
That means that we are in a downward trend and there is pressure from the market to push this price

57
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,300
further down.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,410
And that's not something that you usually do usually use lower timeframes to confirm higher timeframes

59
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,610
but it's also good to reference these things when you're trading on low timeframes.

60
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,650
It's always good to trend a trade in line with the overall trend and see what else is going on on the

61
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,430
other timeframes as well.

62
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,880
So we've got some good indication that probably the price is going to go down.

63
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,850
I have already chosen the take profit and stop loss and the stop loss.

64
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:46,460
We usually said just above the channel level and we've also got some quite strong resistance levels

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,010
over here as you can see the price was very uncertain around this level around 1.5 7.

66
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,270
Three hundred and 1.5 7 400.

67
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,970
So as long as we said it above over there we should be in the safe zone to take profits.

68
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,110
Well we basically kind of look at a strong level over here.

69
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,820
This looks like a strong area so if the price does get here it's to around one point five six five hundred

70
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,040
.

71
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,480
It might kind of slow down so we'll settle take profit conservatively just above that area and hopefully

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,220
if the price does turn around that it will first hit our take profit.

73
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,650
So that's the main bit.

74
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,770
Also because this isn't a very

75
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,110
solid kind of analysis it is it is in our favor.

76
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,190
We there's a high chance that the price will go down.

77
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:51,620
However it's not as strong as we had in our previous trades so in this case we would want to trade a

78
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,570
bit more conservatively so that we won't risk 10 percent of our.

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,680
Let's say for instance we'll risk 5 percent of our count to be a bit more conservative.

80
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:09,740
And the last thing that we have to do is check the volume or calculate the lots for this trade and for

81
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,150
that we will need pips of the Stop-Loss as you remember.

82
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,740
So currently the Stop-Loss will be set at about 38 pips.

83
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:26,240
So let's remember that when we're calculating the volume now to calculate the volume I'll bring up the

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,440
slides from one of the previous tutorials that we were already familiar with.

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:42,920
All right so not to calculate the volume of loss that we want to trade in this particular instance.

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,590
We've got to take the risk in dollar terms so the amount of money that we're prepared to lose on this

87
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:55,620
one particular trade and divide it by 10 times the number of people in the stop loss.

88
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,090
So the risk as we discussed will be setting at about 5 percent of our balance which is 5 percent of

89
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,200
556 dollars and that equals to twenty eight dollars.

90
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,030
Put that into the equation.

91
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:16,340
Now we've got a last name we got to input is a stop loss in pips and that's about 38 pips.

92
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,440
So let's put that now.

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,530
And so that gives us let's bring up the calculator.

94
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:35,710
Twenty eight divided by loops divided by ten times 30 a.

95
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,680
And you get us about zero point zero seven.

96
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,940
So let's put that in there.

97
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,410
Point 0 7

98
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,070
lots.

99
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,090
All right.

100
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,150
Perfect So now we know what our volume is.

101
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,300
We can go on ahead with our trade.

102
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,930
Click this button up over here.

103
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,800
New Order.

104
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:10,270
We're going to put in our lots right away so 0.07 stop loss as we agreed will be one point five seven

105
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,930
six hundred take.

106
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:20,210
Profit will be 1.5 6 6 5 0 Calment is second order.

107
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,790
Instant execution.

108
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,560
It will be a sell order so.

109
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,380
All set.

110
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:33,840
Everything's entered and we click sell out our sell order has been conducted 0.07 lots.

111
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,310
We can close this now.

112
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,250
And as you can see here our order is in our terminal in the trade tab.

113
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,920
So we're going to leave this order for a couple days and then come back and see how it's going.

114
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,500
Hopefully won't take long because this is a 15 minute timeframe and we're talking about movements of

115
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,230
about 55 people and 38 pips.

116
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,280
So hopefully the market does go downwards.

117
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:10,740
In this case and we'll catch up again in a couple of days to analyze this trade.

118
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,310
I look forward to seeing you then and until next time happy trading
