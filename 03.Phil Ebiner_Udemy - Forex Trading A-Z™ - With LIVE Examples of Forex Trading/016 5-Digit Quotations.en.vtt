00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.420
Five digit quotations.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:11.900
So now we've got a new system in the 4 X market has been around for a couple of years now.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.490
The precision of price quotations is getting better and now most brokers actually supply quotations

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.620
in five in a five digit mode.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.070
So here that quotation we are talking about Australian British pound the Strand dollar 1.8 5:52 now

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.620
is actually more precise and it's 1.8 8 6 6 3.

7
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.150
So now the change the minimum change this currency can experience is actually 0.00 0 1.

8
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.120
So tend to power of negative 5.

9
00:00:49.650 --> 00:01:00.420
Now let's understand how the definitions of pips and points have changed in this particular case when

10
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
the five digits have system has been introduced.

11
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.150
So the change is still called 1.0 change is always called one point.

12
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.560
Now the value on the right is zero point zero zero zero zero one has been labeled with the name pipette

13
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.820
.

14
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.890
Once again let's keep these things separate.

15
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.650
One point is the minimum change and one pet is always equal to zero point zero zero zero zero 1.

16
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.370
In this case it just so happens that minimum change is equal to $0.00 or one.

17
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.920
And that means one point is equal to one pet and that's always the case for five digit price quotations

18
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.840
.

19
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.250
So once again let's calculate the spread here have shown our previous example but I've added the fifth

20
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.200
digit as a smaller number and a lot of brokers do that just to show that it is five digit quotations

21
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.210
because when you have five digits after the decimal point it can be you can get a bit confusing and

22
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.360
like a lot of numbers.

23
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:14.700
So here it's highlights to you that these are in fact pipettes and the end of the current quotations

24
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.960
.

25
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:23.790
So the the difference of the asking price in this case is zero point zero zero zero six five units of

26
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.410
the quoted currency which is trillion dollar and that equals to 65 points.

27
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.160
So let's remember that even in the five digit quotation system a point is the minimum change that the

28
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.700
currency can experience.

29
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.840
In this case the minimum change is 0.0 0 0 0 or 1.

30
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.610
And if you multiply that by at 65 then you will get your spread.

31
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.150
So the spread of 65 points on the other hand the spread is approximately seven Pips you can say six

32
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.430
and a half perhaps you can say seven pips.

33
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.990
Doesn't really matter.

34
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.130
It's approximately sound pips because a pip is still zero point zero zero zero one just as it was in

35
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.520
the four digit system.

36
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.980
It's not going to change because we change the system that we're quoting the currency paper is fixed

37
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.970
the prepared is fixed so this spread is approximately seven pips and that is you can also say that the

38
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.960
spread is 65 pipettes I would advise you not to use the word pads because not many people understand

39
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.440
you.

40
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.910
Like I never use it.

41
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.020
Nobody ever uses it.

42
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.830
It's a it's a very kind of new term or very very little used term it just sounds fun.

43
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.660
To be honest.

44
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.010
So just stick with points and Pips.

45
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.970
So just to sum up we've got the four digit system with the five digit system.

46
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.110
An example is the British pound straight and dollar quotation that we looked at 1.8 8 6 6 in the four

47
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.710
digits one point 8 8 6 6 3 in the five digits.

48
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.890
One point in the four digit.

49
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.910
One point is always the minimum change in the four digits system it's zero point zero zero zero one

50
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:19.920
and the five digits system it's zero point 0 0 0 0 1 a pip never changes a pip is always fixed regardless

51
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.560
of the quotation system and it equals zero point zero zero zero one and a prepared.

52
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.200
There's no such a thing in the four digit system.

53
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.830
And in the five digit system there because there's enough precision you can talk about pipettes and

54
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.320
it's $0.00 or 1.

55
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.290
However you are advised not to use this term because it's not frequently used.

56
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.250
So you will notice that some traders out there get this mixed up and actually some respectable traders

57
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.290
can get this mixed up because this is terminology and it of course depends on the conventions and like

58
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.550
the people well how people agree to talk to each other and use these things.

59
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.170
But most traders will use this system.

60
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:14.790
So if you come across a forum where perhaps even everybody uses them wrong and confuses people point

61
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.190
or something like that well then you either have to re-educate those people or adjust to their kind

62
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.620
of style but just keep in mind that majority of traders around the world will talk about these things

63
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.480
in exactly this way.

64
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.450
And before we finish up a quick note on Japanese currency pairs as promised.

65
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.950
So if a currency pair is quoted in Japanese yen meaning that the Japanese yen is on the right you will

66
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.860
see that everything is shifted by approximately or exactly 100 so there is not a four digit system there's

67
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.590
not four digits but two digits after the decimal point in the five digits is only three digits.

68
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.390
So all everything else stays exactly the same.

69
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.030
Just multiply everything by 100 and that has been associated with the way the Japanese yen has historically

70
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.040
been priced.

71
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.190
For instance right now one American dollar can buy you a 100 in a teen Japanese yen
