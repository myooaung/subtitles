00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.850
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.960
And welcome back to the course in forex trading and today's tutorial.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.990
We will talk about the forex calendar.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:19.170
So to find one of the best first calendars to go to Google and type in Forex factory calendar and as

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.840
you can see it brings up a calendar here and we're going to open up that page forex factory is a forum

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.730
for forex traders and they also provide news and other cool stuff.

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.720
Here you've got a calendar for the week where you can change your time period here if you want to.

8
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.710
But by default it's said to the current week.

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.500
And as you can see the week started with Sunday that there was a previous Sunday November the 30th.

10
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
And for every day all Sunday is not not really the best day to look at.

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.960
So we'll start off with Monday because that's actually a working day.

12
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.920
So for every day they've got the news that is Jew in the world like for example Spanish Spanish manufacturing

13
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.770
PMI or net lending to individuals m slash m or a montri base.

14
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.810
Why why and cash rate and all of these they are specific to a certain country.

15
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.450
So on the left here it will tell you what currency pairs affected and usually and 99 percent of the

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.160
cases it is actually the currency pair that is local or domestic to that country.

17
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.760
So here you've got the Australian dollar and a euro.

18
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.150
The Swiss franc British pound as you can see quite a lot of news is coming out there.

19
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.330
And so the current time is actually shown at the top over here and over here as well.

20
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.970
And here you've got the time when that news will be released in that same time zone.

21
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.520
I'm pretty sure if you log in into their website then you'll be able to change the time zone to your

22
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.690
time zone.

23
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.900
But by default I think it's set to the New York or us tee time zone so you can play around with that

24
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.330
.

25
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.520
What else do we have here.

26
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.610
You've got some details so you can click on the detail if you want and it'll bring up some information

27
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.670
specific to that piece of news.

28
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.380
So for example the manufacturing PMI for Great Britain you can read about it here and you can understand

29
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.900
that Perche PMI sense of Purchasing Managers Index you can see when the next release is some notes some

30
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.060
very useful information basically some related stories from financial reviews the history of how it

31
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.240
changed and so on then you can just close that if you don't want to see it.

32
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.150
And then finally you've got the values over here which are the most important part.

33
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.120
So the first value is the actual This is in fact what the value was when the news was released.

34
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.070
Then you've got the forecasts and you got the previous.

35
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.870
So by reading this manufacturing PMI for great Britain we can see that the previous value was fifty

36
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.500
three point three.

37
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.290
The forecast for this time for this Monday was fifty three point one.

38
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.060
But when the time came and the news was released it was actually fifty three point five.

39
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.400
That's why it's highlighted in green meaning that this outcome was much more favorable than expected

40
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.360
for traders.

41
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.940
That means that apparently the economy's doing well and the British pound is probably going to grow

42
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.890
you have to kind of also gauge how this news affects your currency and that you can see here under usual

43
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.220
effect.

44
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.550
So if actual is greater than forecast it's good for currency.

45
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.270
So in this case it was good for the British pound dollar.

46
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.060
Also you can see that this news is highlighted for red factory.

47
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.550
I can meaning that the impact is a high impact and therefore if you put all of this together the outcome

48
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.690
was more favorable than the forecast.

49
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.560
It's good for the currency it's a high impact so probably the British pound dollar or experienced a

50
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.980
increase in value at this point in time when this news was released.

51
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.040
So if you see something that's red it's fun to read one that's that's high impact.

52
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.910
Here's another one.

53
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:45.360
So the British pound construction PMI was released on Tuesday and the outcome was less than the forecast

54
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.170
of fifty nine point four versus six to one point one.

55
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.580
If you expand this you'll see here that the actual actual is greater than forecast is good for currency

56
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.970
.

57
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.790
In our case actually is less than forecasts meaning it's bad for the British pound dollar.

58
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.830
And we can see a red.

59
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.350
I can hear meaning that it's a high impact piece of news meaning that the British pound probably would

60
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.690
have lost value.

61
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.950
It's not always the case.

62
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.790
Sometimes things happen that you don't expect but in most cases it does stay in line with the recommendations

63
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.530
that are given on Forex Factory.

64
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.550
So we just got to scroll down a bit lower and I'll show you today's news.

65
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.630
So here because we're in Friday December the 5th.

66
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.500
You can see that right now the times around 3:00 a.m. actually just past 3 a.m. It's 3 or 5.

67
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.810
But I opened this page at 3:00 a.m. So at that time this piece of news for the Swiss franc hadn't been

68
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.770
released yet.

69
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.000
And it says here foreign currency reserves.

70
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.230
As you can see the previous value was four hundred sixty point four billion.

71
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.620
There's no expected value sometimes there's nothing that they can specify here.

72
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:07.530
And in order to find out the current value you just have to click the refresh button because we were

73
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.950
we are so close to the release of the news I'm going to click it and see what will come up.

74
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.960
And as you can see that's the current value is literally released like two or three minutes ago into

75
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:28.010
the world news so you can probably find it on the website of the associated central bank and so on.

76
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:35.220
So their foreign currency reserves increased by two billion dollars which is probably a good thing.

77
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.280
You can also check here.

78
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.880
But once again we don't have a forecast so there's nothing to compare it to you can only compare to

79
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.000
the previous value and I don't really know if that's that's a very good thing or should have increased

80
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.590
much more.

81
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.560
So you'd have to find the forecast somehow yourself.

82
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.820
As you can see this news hasn't been released yet and that's because the time hasn't come for it to

83
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.120
be released.

84
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:07.410
Also something that we'll talk about in the further tutorials of this section today is the first Friday

85
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.020
of December.

86
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:16.800
And every first Friday of every month the U.S. releases non-farm employment change and unemployment

87
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.840
rates for the month.

88
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.260
And those are two major pieces of news.

89
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.410
We'll talk about them in the future.

90
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.200
Tauriel I look forward to seeing you then.

91
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.890
And until next time happy trading
