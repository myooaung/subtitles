Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,240
And welcome back to the course on forex trading in today's tutorial we will talk about Forex brokers

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,990
and we will understand why we actually need them in our day to day trading.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,590
So if we imagine the Forex market then has got lost.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:27,390
Different participants such as major banks central banks and governments investment banks and investment

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,620
companies other normal companies that need to conduct foreign exchange transactions and these are all

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,840
the major players of the four exchange market and they constantly transact with each other and they

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,820
always transact in very very large amounts of money we're talking billions of dollars here.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,540
And so together they comprise the Forex market.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,020
So how does a person such as you and me get into this Forex market.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:05,670
We even if we have a deposit on our account of $50000 and more likely than not it's often less than

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,290
that even if such a large deposit is hard to get into a market where an average transaction is several

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,760
billion dollars and the daily WM is measured in trillions of dollars.

14
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,620
So how can we get it there.

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,620
And that's where the broker comes into play a person such as you and me will go to a broker and the

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,810
broker will also work with a lot of other people individual traders who will also go to this broker

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,480
and the broker will then aggregate all these transactions and send them to a bank.

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,730
So a broker has an established relationship with a bank and because it can scale up all of these little

19
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:58,710
transactions that all the clients of the broker conduct then the bank is more willing now to work with

20
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,600
the broker.

21
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,490
There are many different types of brokers and different types of relationships between the broker and

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,960
the bank and they include the market maker brokers S2P brokers the C-n brokers and so on.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,160
However at the end of the day the concept remains the same.

24
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,820
A single individual person cannot gain access to the Forex market and has nobody to transact with but

25
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,660
a broker can facilitate access to the foreign exchange market to each one of us by scaling up our transactions

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,620
over the past decade.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,920
Brokerage services have become very competitive and there are lots and lots of brokers out there and

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
this makes it very important to select the right broker for your trading.

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,250
And if you're new to the foreign exchange market I recommend checking out my review which I did a couple

30
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,460
of weeks ago on my web site.

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,570
So in this review I compared the top three brokers that I've ever worked with in my seven plus years

32
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,280
of foreign exchange experience.

33
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:05,370
You can see here that it says best for its Broca's for algo trading and that's because my trading is

34
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,870
predominantly comprised of algorithmic trading systems and Forex robots.

35
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,010
However this review can help you select a broker even for manual trading because only one of the brokers

36
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:25,680
I talk about is dedicated solely to algorithmic trading and the other two you can both use for X robots

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,970
in them.

38
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,360
Or you can trade manually.

39
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,450
And I've tried and tested them and they are reliable.

40
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,560
So if you want to check out the story you just go to www dot forex boat dot com slash brokers.

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,830
And when you read this review you will notice that for each one of these brokers I specify exactly how

42
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,680
many funds I have held with them at the maximum and how much money I have withdrawn and how they have

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,020
gone about processing those withdrawal requests.

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,550
And so this serves as proof of their trustworthiness.

45
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm pretty sure that this review will be worth your while because it will help you avoid the national

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:10,170
mistake most beginners make when they select an unreliable broker who basically trades against them

47
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,360
and makes them lose because of that.

48
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,740
On that note I'm going to finish today's tutorial.

49
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to seeing you next time.

50
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,050
Until then happy trading
