00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.860
Welcome back to this lecture.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.950
Super excited to have you.

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.710
In today's tutorial today we're going to learn how to download meditator for and open an account of

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.410
my fair broker actually trader.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.970
I wanted to quickly preface this by saying that you don't have to go if actually trader.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.130
This is my fair broker.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.230
If you have your own favorite grow broker you can definitely follow along with their steps of opening

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.380
a demo account and open a demo account with them or you can go and look at other reviews out there online

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.670
and pick a broker up your own.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.910
But if you are interested to see who is my fair broker and why then this is the tutorial where will

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.310
make it all happen and by the end of it you will have a working demo contrary country so far further

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.610
to do.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.710
Let's dive straight into it.

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.530
So the first thing we need to do is open a browser Winder right over here and type in the following

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.910
year l w w w dot for us both dot com slash hack C trader Damo.

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.450
That's three words altogether AKC trade or demo

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.810
and I'll take a couple of seconds to load and then you'll get this beautiful page here displayed and

18
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.150
the first thing I want to point out is that you'll see here that the URL has slightly changed but you

19
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.670
don't need to worry about that because what has happened is actually trader has added here our code

20
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.370
and basically this code will let them know that you're a forex both student and they can give you better

21
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.430
support priority servers and basically take care of you.

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.560
So we have a relationship with active trader where they take good care of our students and you want

23
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.610
to take advantage of that.

24
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.080
So before downloading the moderator for platform there are two things I'd like to show you.

25
00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.980
So if we scroll down here on the page to the very bottom you will see the product disclosure statement

26
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:12.050
or PBS and financial services guide or FSG and actually trader being a regulated broker has to provide

27
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.240
you these two documents as a cloud.

28
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.220
So this is very important and you have these two links and you can check the PBS and FSG at any time

29
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.540
when you want to.

30
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.640
You always have these links to have and check them just scroll down to the bottom of the page.

31
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.260
Now let's scroll back to the top of the page and here I will inputs my information.

32
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.860
So first name surname e mail

33
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.140
and something that I want to mention here is that it's quite important to provide accurate information

34
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.780
to axe the traitor because that way they will be able to contact you and serve you better if you have

35
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.540
a question or you have a technical issue of your account.

36
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.200
They'll be able to help you resolve these problems faster.

37
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:21.020
They're an amazing broker and so I'll proceed to filling in my phone number here and once I verified

38
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.150
this information I'm going to click submit

39
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.320
and it will take a couple of minutes to load.

40
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.340
And don't worry about it.

41
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.360
It will all happen after a couple of seconds you'll get to agree to this page which is a thank you page

42
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.070
and it has all the steps that you will need to follow from here.

43
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.050
Step number one is you'll need to check your e-mail and get your demo log in from there.

44
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.330
And that's actually what we're going to do right now.

45
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.820
So bring up my email account here and here you will see that I received an email from active trader

46
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.740
client services and it contains all the information related to Mr. Trader for demo accounts and how

47
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.470
to get it how to install at the bottom you'll see their card details with the log in and password and

48
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.630
server and so on.

49
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.500
And one of the things that I love with actually trader is that they have an installation package for

50
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.850
Mac users and it's important here to mention that number four is not native actually to Mac.

51
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.050
And so they go this extra step to serve their customers regardless of what's platform from the user.

52
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.510
So they've gone above and beyond to develop the special installation package for Mac users it's not

53
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.990
something you often see with brokers.

54
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.370
Just something to to note it's always nice when a company takes care of their customers.

55
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.180
But however in this course we're using a Windows machine so I'm gonna go ahead and download the Windows

56
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.670
installation package.

57
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.740
It's quite a small file that gives download I'll just serve it here and I'll open it up right away.

58
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.190
So I'll get this Windows message as you can see I'll check.

59
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.200
Yes make sure to read the terms and conditions and that'll start installation.

60
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.770
Once you click next if you have any questions.

61
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.460
Make sure to read a shout out to exit traitor if you're okay with this.

62
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.550
Then check the box and click next and actually trader from here will get installed.

63
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.250
You'll see here that all the rest of the files are being downloaded and it's just going to take a couple

64
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:57.150
seconds then you need to click finish and that and you see here in the desktop that we already have

65
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.550
an icon for the meditative wall for a platform so double click it to open up the platform and you'll

66
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.700
see here that you'll get a window prompt to open up on account but we won't do that because we've already

67
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.180
opened an account through our registration process and now we get a log in window prompt so we just

68
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:26.220
need to enter our details so with a way there where we get them as we go back to the email and see what

69
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.510
active trade centers.

70
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:35.620
And from here we just copy paste our log in password and select our server.

71
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:43.940
So once we've done that click logon and voila you'll hear a boring sound and that means that you are

72
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.090
successfully connected to the server and you'll see here in the trade tab that I have my balance of

73
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.880
fifty thousand demo U.S. dollars and so that means everything's working.

74
00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.800
So in a nutshell that's how you open a demo account to a fact see trader.

75
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.290
And feel free to proceed to the next lecture if you wish but if you want to stick around for a bit I

76
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:17.240
would like to address the question of why I'm choosing axe trader as my preferred broker.

77
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:30.950
So if you go to this following your o w w w dot for export dot com slash brokers you'll find here an

78
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.650
extensive review which basically helps us answer the question of why I'm choosing actually trader as

79
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.850
my favorite broker.

80
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:47.090
So you'll notice here that I did an extensive review of exit trader I tested them for three months and

81
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:55.140
came up with these four priority tests trustworthiness trading conditions customer service and funding.

82
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.040
For example you'll see that actually trader is regulated by a sec which is the Australian Securities

83
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:10.100
and Investments Commission and ASIC has a very stringent regulation one of the most thorough and stringent

84
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.840
regulations in the world.

85
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:18.500
Our own financial markets around financial services and really gives me personally a peace of mind that

86
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:30.410
this broker is regulated by a sec and not often you see that kind of regulation in the broker space.

87
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:38.360
Very often it's either unregulated or regulated by some shady companies or authorities in this case

88
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:46.260
it is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission another interesting thing about actually

89
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.630
trader is that they've placed their servers in the US.

90
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.380
So basically what that means is that they're close to their liquidity providers and that gives them

91
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.680
very fast execution.

92
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.340
And in that way you basically get the best of both worlds.

93
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:10.860
You get the regulation by an Australian authority and you also get the execution speed of the servers

94
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.830
being close to the liquidity provider.

95
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.350
But the thing that stands out probably the most is the customer service.

96
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.660
You can see all the wars that they've won throughout the years and having dealt with active trader for

97
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:32.190
multiple years myself now I can vouch for the fact that they're just great people working there and

98
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.150
that's what you want when you're starting out when you're just learning forex you want somebody to take

99
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.500
you by the hand and guide you through this world and not take advantage of you.

100
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:49.530
And we've had numerous hundreds if not thousands of forex both students go through actually trade and

101
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:56.560
work with facts trader and every time access trader has delivered and taken care of our students.

102
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.800
Here's an example.

103
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:06.900
So for instance the demo trial that you downloaded is a 30 day demo trial and that's just a normal offering

104
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.090
that actually trainer has.

105
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.880
But if you want to extend it all you have to do is just reach out to taxi trader and tell them that

106
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:20.790
you're a for exposed student and they will extend your demo trial for longer to help you practice longer

107
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:30.150
until you're ready until you're confident something to mention is that actually trader accepts live

108
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:38.070
account clients from almost all countries except from the US and maybe some other countries.

109
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:44.880
So that's in a nutshell AXA trader if you want feel free to check out this interesting read and leave

110
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.080
me your comments and questions and that's it for today.

111
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.940
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

112
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.710
And until then Happy trading.
