Hello this is Kirill forum for Expo dot com.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,880
And welcome back to the course on forex trading in desultorily We will talk about currency pairs and

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,440
how to read them.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,810
So let's have a look at a chart.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,390
This is the Eurodollar daily chart and you can see that the current price for the year is dollar is

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,270
one point to five to four.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,880
So what does that mean.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,930
And how do we understand that.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,350
Well let's look at the currency pair at the bottom.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,480
The currency on the left of the pair is called the base currency.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,040
In this case it's the euro and the currency and the right is called the quoted currency in this case

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,520
it's the U.S. dollar.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,450
You may see this price of one point to five to four for the Euros dollar currency pair written the following

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,840
way.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,300
This is equivalent to writing it out as a Euro slash U.S. dollar equals one point to five to four.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,230
Now let's quickly simplify this example to understand it a bit better.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:07,020
Let's replace the euro currency with apples and let's say that we're quoting the price of outpolls in

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,090
U.S. dollars.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,260
Personally I really like this approach because it takes one of the Unknowns out of the equation.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,630
If you think about Euros like any other money is a tangible object you can hold in your hands you can

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,830
measure it.

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,210
You can weigh it up you can counter it.

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,110
It's something that actually physically exists.

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,670
So that means we can easily replace it with something else.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,190
Also physically exists but it is better known to us like apples for example and you can count apples

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,580
you can weigh them up and you can hold them in your hand just like yours.

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,950
So there's no harm in replacing euros with apples just for the sake of this example.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,360
So here you can see that a price of a single apple in American dollars is one point to five to four

29
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:54,490
.

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,250
And that's exactly what this equation means.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,260
And now if we go back to the euro we can quickly understand that the chart in fact represents the price

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,090
of one single euro in terms of U.S. dollars.

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,250
So this means that at the point in time when the snapshot was taken for one euro you would get one point

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,660
to five to four U.S. dollars.

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,990
And conversely to buy one euro you would need 1.2 five to four U.S. dollars.

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,060
And this principle applies to any currency pair.

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:33,870
The charge simply expresses the value of the base currency which is on the left quoted in terms of the

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,750
quoted currency which is on the right.

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,450
So as Paul candle's appear throughout the day and the price changes on your chart you always know that

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,980
this is simply the price of the base currency changing in terms of the quarried currency.

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,390
Now let's look at another example let's take U.S. dollar Canadian dollar for instance and this example

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,530
be a bit more tricky because the U.S. dollar is on the left.

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,130
Now as you can see the U.S. dollar is the base currency in this example and the Canadian dollar is the

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,880
quoted currency.

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,270
How do we read this chart.

46
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,720
Very similar approach.

47
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,430
U.S. dollar Canadian equals one point 1 2 8 7.

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,510
It's the same as putting a slash in between the currencies.

49
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,200
And now we can replace the U.S. dollar with apples.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,370
As you can see here we're replacing the base currency with Apple and it doesn't matter that it's the

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,340
US dollar.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,310
There's nothing special about the U.S. dollar in terms of forex charts.

53
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,530
The dollar can be on the left is dollar can be on the right.

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,880
It doesn't matter what we're looking to do right now is we are looking to replace the base currency

55
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,080
with something that we know quite well.

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,390
In this case Apple's.

57
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:58,680
So in this example we can see that the price of one apple is one point 1 2 8 7 Canadian dollars or approximately

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,890
one Canadian dollar and 13 cents.

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,060
So now going back to U.S. dollars we can see that the price of one U.S. dollar is approximately one

60
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,430
point thirteen Canadian dollars.

61
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:19,020
This means that for one U.S. dollar you will get one Canadian dollar and 13 Canadian cents wore converse

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,720
to buy one U.S. dollar you would need one Canadian dollar and 13 Canadian cents.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,980
And now when we look at the chart we know that the price is simply telling us how much an American dollar

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
is worth in Canadian dollars.

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,740
And as the price goes up and down throughout the day that's simply the price of American dollars expressed

66
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,350
in Canadian dollars also changing throughout the day.

67
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:51,120
There are over one hundred and eighty currencies in the world and you can combine any two of them to

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,780
give you a currency pair.

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,680
Most traders identified two main groups of currency pairs and these are the majors.

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,880
The euro U.S. dollar the dollar yen the British pound dollar the Australian dollar American dollar the

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:14,140
dollar Swiss franc and the dollar Canadian dollar and also the second group is the Krause's crosses

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,290
.

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,650
Or simply put all currency pairs that do not include the American dollar such as the euro.

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,390
British pound British pound yen Australian dollar Canadian dollar and so on.

75
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,700
And of course there are also all other currency pairs.

76
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,500
One more final note before we finish today's tutorial is that the order in which two currencies go into

77
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,790
their currency pair is fixed.

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,780
So for instance you will never see a currency pair called you as dollar euro or a currency pair called

79
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,070
U.S. dollar Australian dollar.

80
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,840
That's because it has historically developed.

81
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,170
In each case how the currency pair is fixed and people just choose not to change it.

82
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,930
So in order to avoid confusion.

83
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,310
So a Euro U.S. dollar chart will always be a euro used dollar chart and therefore you will always know

84
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,320
that it is quoting the price of one euro in terms of American dollars.

85
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,450
On that note we will wrap up today's tutorial.

86
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,440
I look forward to seeing you next time.

87
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,360
And until then happy trading
