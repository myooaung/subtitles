00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello this is Kirill from Fredericksburg dot com.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,340
And welcome back to the course on for X-raying.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,790
Today we will talk about the X market participants.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,170
So here's the farmer's market.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,780
And who are the major players here.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,090
Well first of all of course it's governments.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,020
Governments use the Forex market to meet certain economic goals whether it's to have a lower exchange

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,170
rate compared to a certain currency or a higher exchange rate.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:32,250
It all depends on where the company countries importing or exporting goods and many various other factors

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,600
.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,930
Also the central bank in most cases the central bank is the financial arm of the government but sometimes

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,090
the central bank is more independent.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,220
For some countries and the Central Bank also uses the Forex market to move around its reserve currency

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,910
and monitor the situation and things like inflation interest rates and so on.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:05,490
Next we've got normal banks normal banks trade for X-Mas trade on the forex market to define which exchange

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:12,600
rates should govern the exchange of currencies and those like when you and I we go to a bank and we

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:20,700
do exchanges there or do so in transactions those transactions are minuscule compared to what banks

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,930
deal at an international level.

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,250
They throw around billions if not trillions of dollars just to make sure that they have the right currencies

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,080
that they need for their activities.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,280
Also other financial institutions participate in the Forex market and an example of that would be the

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,950
pension funds in the US.

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:51,000
They have massive massive companies who have lots and lots of money and sometimes they need to make

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,020
transactions on the forex market as well.

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,260
Other players in the market include normal companies such as BMW Coca-Cola General Motors and any other

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,440
multinational company that you can think of.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,660
And that's because these companies have operations across the globe and therefore they are forced to

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,490
convert currencies all the time in order to pay suppliers pay employees and so on.

29
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:24,000
For example Coca-Cola might be paying someone please that it has somewhere in India and have to convert

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,980
dollars into rupees or for instance BMW might be ordering some cars from Japan and that way they have

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,750
to convert euro into yen and pay for those parts.

32
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,500
Another good example is when BMW might order the parts from Japan and get them but they only have to

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,410
pay for them in one year.

34
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,390
So in that situation they have two options they can either create the product sell it and then one year

35
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,160
later pay for the parts but then they will have to convert euros into yens.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:05,970
One year later and the price of Yan's might have gone up by then and that will mean that BMW will lose

37
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:13,890
on this foreign exchange transaction and this loss will eat into its profits from the normal operations

38
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,180
.

39
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,450
So in those cases most companies do something which is called a hedge.

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,460
And what they do is they instead of waiting one year to convert their euros into yen they will actually

41
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:38,970
create a forward contract with a bank saying that they will need yens in one year and they will create

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,010
a fix or agree on a fixed price.

43
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,780
Now with that bank.

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:51,120
But to buy those yens one year from now that activity is called hedging and therefore these companies

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,680
are sometimes referred to as hedgers so not.

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,380
These are instances when they don't need to buy the other currency immediately but when they will need

47
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,390
it later on.

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,660
And so they're called hedgers because they're hedging themselves or protecting themselves from this

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,300
foreign exchange risk.

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,780
Actually a lot of companies across the globe undertake this activity and other type of major players

51
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,450
on the French market is hedge funds.

52
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:30,900
Hedge funds are actually funds that are or organizations that are designed to speculate on the forex

53
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,560
market and bring profits to their investors.

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:43,800
So even though they're called hedge funds they're mostly all now they've kind of developed to become

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,520
very aggressive and profit seeking.

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:58,020
So they take on a large funds from investors and then they try to trade these this money on the market

57
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,100
to make profits and they earn fees.

58
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,730
And plus they earn commissions if they do create profits.

59
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:16,830
And finally the normal traders such as you and I and George Soros just people who speculate on the forex

60
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,430
market to make a profit.

61
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,640
So they're also participants of the Forex market.

62
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:33,150
And for example George Soros was able to make over a billion dollars of profit in one month.

63
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,720
That's that's one of the reasons why what he's famous for.

64
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:45,360
And so all those participants together as you can imagine create massive and massive volumes of money

65
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,770
and to be more precise the volume of the folks market is five trillion dollars.

66
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,320
That is five.

67
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,220
And all those are is behind it.

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,720
And that is her day five trillion dollars goes through the 4 X market.

69
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,660
That's an unbelievable amount of money.

70
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,800
And just to put that into comparison the largest stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock Exchange

71
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,670
and the total market capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange.

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,930
And means if you take all the companies that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and you put all

73
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:31,440
of their values together then you will get only eighteen point seven trillion dollars and that's a total

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,110
capitalization of that exchange.

75
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,430
Whereas on the forks market you have five trillion dollars going through the market per day and that

76
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,950
just shows that the Forex market is by far the biggest financial market in the world.

77
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,370
So that sums it up for today.

78
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,210
I look forward to seeing a next tutorial.

79
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,640
And until then happy trading
