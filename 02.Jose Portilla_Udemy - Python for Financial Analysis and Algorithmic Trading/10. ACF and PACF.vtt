Welcome back everyone to this lecture autocorrelation plots and we'll also discuss partial autocorrelation

2
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:19.590
plots in autocorrelation plot shows the correlation of the time series with itself lag by X amount of

3
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.400
time units so the y axis on this to them and plot is the correlation coefficient value and the x axis

4
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.460
is the number of time units of lag.

5
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.700
Let's explain this idea of correlation with a simple example.

6
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.190
We'll start off by trying to imagine how to calculate the plot value for x equals one.

7
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.360
Imagine taking your time series of length t that you're trying to actually get a autocorrelation plot

8
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.960
for you make a copy of it and then you delete the first observation of copy number 1 and the last observation

9
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.690
of copying number to.

10
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.600
Now you have two Time series of length t minus 1 for which you can then calculate a correlation coefficient

11
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.280
between these two time series.

12
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.680
That is the value of the vertical axis.

13
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.370
X equals 1 in your plot's it represents the correlation of the series lag by one time unit and then

14
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.780
you can go on and on and do this for other lag values of x.

15
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520
You shift by 2.

16
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.220
Next the new shift by 3 next.

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.970
Or basically remove to remove 3 and that would actually end up defining the plot or those y values for

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.070
each of those X like units.

19
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.520
Now let's see some typical examples of what is autocorrelation plots actually look like so typically

20
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240
there's two types of autocorrelation plots.

21
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.890
Their first type is an actual gradual decline.

22
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.210
So we can see here that when we calculate an autocorrelation plot for this time series we see this sort

23
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.410
of gradual decline.

24
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.630
There's a little bit of noise as we go closer and closer in time series but eventually it goes down

25
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.330
to zero.

26
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.060
The other common autocorrelation plot to see is what's known as the sharp drop off.

27
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.840
So you get a large value at first.

28
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.630
Maybe a large negative value and then it goes kind of hovers around 0 until it zeros out.

29
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.790
So again these are the two main types of autocorrelation plots you'll encounter either a gradual decline

30
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.020
or a sharp drop off the actual interpretation and how it relates to Arema models can actually get a

31
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.980
bit complicated but there are some basic common methods we can use for the Arema model our main priority

32
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.430
here is to try to figure out whether we will use the A-R auto regressive or any moving average components

33
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.980
for the Arema model.

34
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.640
Or we could possibly also use both as well as how many lags we should actually use in our Arema model.

35
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.390
That is that differencing step.

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.010
In general you would use either auto or aggressive or moving average using both of these terms is a

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.310
little less common when actually applying the A-R and may terms you'll end up setting values for P and

38
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:59.040
for Q If the autocorrelation plot shows positive autocorrelation at the first lag that is lag time 1.

39
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.640
Then it suggest to use the auto regress of terms in relation to the lag if the autocorrelation plus

40
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.800
shows negative correlation at the first leg that it suggests using moving average or a terms and this

41
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.340
will light the Seidl actual values of P D and q to provide your Arema model P is usually decided by

42
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.130
the number of Laeg observations included in the model D is the number of times that the raw observations

43
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.840
are differenced and Q is the size of the moving average window also called the Order of the moving average.

44
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.930
There are also partial autocorrelation plots and these are even a little more complicated than autocorrelation

45
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.440
plots.

46
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.480
But let's just show you the basics.

47
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.750
In general a partial correlation is a conditional correlation.

48
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.850
It is the correlation between two variables.

49
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.350
Under the assumption that we know and take into account the values of some other set of variables.

50
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.980
For instance consider a regression context in which Y is equal to some sort of response variable.

51
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.990
And then we have x1 x2 and x 3 as predictor variables.

52
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.650
So x 1 x 2 and x 3 are predictive variables trying to predict the response of Y.

53
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.140
The partial correlation between y and x 3 is the correlation between the variables determined taking

54
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.450
into account how both y and x 3 are related themselves to x y and x 2.

55
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.910
That is their conditional correlation.

56
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.860
So let's see an example of what that sort of plot can look like.

57
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.530
So here we see a partial autocorrelation plot and you can kind of tell here that it has a similar view

58
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.110
or visual aspect to that sharp drop off autocorrelation plot.

59
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.770
So often when you do a partial autocorrelation plot it looks something like this.

60
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.890
And typically a sharp drop off after Laeg number k suggests some auto regressive K model should be use

61
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.810
that is that should be your value and there there's a gradual decline in the partial autocorrelation

62
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.420
plot.

63
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.610
It suggests a moving average model.

64
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.350
Now identification of an auto regressive model or a car model is often best done with P A C F or partial

65
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.070
autocorrelation function identification of a moving average model is often best done with the HCF or

66
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.420
autocorrelation function rather than the.

67
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.700
And you can view the notebook and research links for a lot more details.

68
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.480
This is definitely a complex topic and it requires further reading than what we're covering here.

69
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.880
Then finally once you've analyzed your data using HCF and if you're ready to begin applying Arema or

70
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.610
Seasonale or IIM-A depending on your original data and you will be providing the P D and q terms for

71
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.630
the model in Arema model will then take in three terms P and Q and we'll see an example of this in the

72
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.450
coding example for seasonal Arema models.

73
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.990
There's an additional set of P-Q terms that we're going to end up seeing.

74
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.470
And these are usually capitalized OK.

75
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.670
So let's see all of this in action with Python and that's models.

76
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.780
We talked a lot about this kind of higher level overview theory.

77
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.480
I think when you see it in action a lot of it will become a lot more clear.

78
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.950
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

79
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.390
We're going to open up a Jupiter notebook and play around some data and see if we can build an arena

80
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.860
model to predict it.

81
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.650
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
