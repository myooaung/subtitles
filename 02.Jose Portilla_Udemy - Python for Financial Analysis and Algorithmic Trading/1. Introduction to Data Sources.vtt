Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on data sources.

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.850
So in this section of the Course are really just going to discuss two different ways to get financial

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.190
data with Python onto your own computer.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.040
And one of them is Panther's data reader and the other one is quando panderers data reader is a separate

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.910
package from panderers that actually allows you to connect to Google stock API as well as other API

6
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.520
is in grab securities or stock information data and read it in as a data frame theorically quando is

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.380
actually a company that offers a robust Python API as well as an API for other languages such as are.

8
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.450
And it allows you to grab data from a variety of sources and some of them are free some of them were

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.600
paid sources.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.110
QUANDO itself is free to use as far as the python API is concerned.

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.860
However if you want to actually access free data you're going to need to create an API key if you want

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040
to do the access more than 50 times a day.

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.370
So just keep that in mind.

14
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.750
So sometimes the libraries have an issue if you have a firewall or you're based in a certain geographical

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.520
region just in case you have those issues we're always going to provide CSC files for you to use for

16
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.950
exercises and examples just in case.

17
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.260
Typically quando is the one that's more flexible Panas data reader sometimes has issues with certain

18
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.190
geographical regions OK.

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.890
Let's show you how to use these tools.

20
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.360
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
