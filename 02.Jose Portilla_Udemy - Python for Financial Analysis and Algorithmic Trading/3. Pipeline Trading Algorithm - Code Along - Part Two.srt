1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,690
Welcome back everyone to where we left off last time we were going to do now is put all of these sort

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,280
of factors and filters and masks into a nice make pipeline function.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,300
So let's go ahead and we're going to create a couple of new cells to get a lot of this stuff out of

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:27,640
the way and down here we'll say make pipeline and then I'm going to comments the actual steps we're

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,740
going to do.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,780
So the first thing is going to be our universe and that's just going to be those fifteen hundred most

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,430
tradeable stocks.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,370
Then after that we're only going to grab energy sector stocks.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:50,510
Then after that we're going to basically make some sort of masks I will say make a mask of 15:00 us

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,630
an energy so we'll kind of combine those.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:00,170
As we've seen before combining filter's then we'll go ahead and say the following will grab average

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,740
dollar volume and we're just going to grab that information.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:19,240
Offer that will say grab the top 5 percent an average dollar volume and we'll make this dollar volume

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,860
over the past 30 days.

15
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,790
So grab that information using that information will grab the top 5 percent of stocks based off dollar

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,000
volume that those are the ones that are in 15:00 us and then the energy sector dentals go ahead and

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,340
asks just added some more maybe we'll then combine the filters again.

18
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,900
So we'll have a combined filter here a 50 100 U.S. energy.

19
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,080
And then I'll combine that one with this filter that we created here.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,260
So we'll do that again combine the filters then after that we're going to now grab some information

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,750
such as just go ahead and do what we did last time.

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,070
We'll say grab the 10 day I mean close grab the 30 day I mean close.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,470
Let me get some more lines here.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,750
We did this last time we were discussing pipelines and then we got the percent difference between those

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:20,540
two and then we'll make a list of short spaced off that percent difference just like we did last time.

26
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:29,290
And then a list of Longs stocks that go along on and then we'll create some sort of final mask or filter

27
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,250
for anything in shorts or a longs.

28
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,110
That way I don't see everything else.

29
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,930
I only see the list of stocks that are going to short or long and that's going to be based off the percent

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,700
difference just like we did last time.

31
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,000
And then finally I'm going to return this pipeline Okay.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,380
So there are all the steps that we're going to follow.

33
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,770
And let's go through it.

34
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,700
So some of these are going to be easier than others but the very top one is going to be probably easiest

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,450
of all.

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:06,130
We're just going to say my base universe is equal to Q Fifteen hundred us and remember going to have

37
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,180
to import all of this.

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,650
So when we actually go back to the I-T we're going to have to kind of re put in all these imports that

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,250
we did up here.

40
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,670
But right now the snow pack knows they're all imported.

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,770
So we're kind of just go along as if we already know they're all imported.

42
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:25,060
They don't want to make some energy sector filter and that's going to be sector equal to the energy

43
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,830
sector which is three or nine.

44
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,790
Then I'm going to combine these to make some sort of combined filter.

45
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,530
So I will say no to call this base energy.

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,120
So it's my base universe and the energy stocks.

47
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:43,700
So I will say that's going to be stocks that are based universe and energy sector.

48
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,320
So basically combining those two filters and you can see I'm using the term mask and filter a little

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,180
bit interchangeably and that's really because the way you apply filter may make it into a mask.

50
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,890
So just keep that in mind.

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,340
Then we want to grab the 30 days of dollar volume.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,200
So I'll say dollar volume and we already imported average dollar volume and then I'm going to give it

53
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,450
a window length of 30 days.

54
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,500
I want to grab the top 5 percent an average dollar volume.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,700
So I will say give me the high dollar volume.

56
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,670
You also want to be careful of adding in too many filters because if you keep filtering and filtering

57
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,520
and filtering there may not be that many security to trade on.

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,870
If we limit ourselves to fifteen hundred and we limited that to the energy sector and now we're limiting

59
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,810
it to only the top 5 percent an average dollar volume.

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,370
So keep that in mind.

61
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,090
So will be dollar volume and since we won the top 5 percent not the top five or top 10 we're going to

62
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,260
say is percentile between say 95 and 100.

63
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,160
So those are top five percent of stocks.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,700
And now let's combine that with our base energy.

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,100
So we're going to do something like

66
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:15,120
let's say top 5 base energy and all be equal to the base energy filter and the high dollar volume filter.

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,400
So now we have those.

68
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,790
And then we're going to grab the 10 day mean close price and the 30 day mean close price and calculate

69
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,300
the difference.

70
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,990
We've actually done this before.

71
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:31,740
So I mean 10 that's just going to be the simple moving average and we're going to take in U.S. equity

72
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,280
pricing close price as an input.

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,810
We're going to say the window length is equal to the past 10 days and then I'm going to apply the mask.

74
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,380
So instead of calculating the 10 day mean on every single stock in U.S. equity pricing I really want

75
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,300
to grab it on this one the top five based energy stocks.

76
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:58,380
So after this we'll say mask is equal to and top five based energy and we're going do a really similar

77
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,330
thing for the 30 days.

78
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,230
We just changed this with the length to 30.

79
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,830
And that's how we can use kind of these filters as masks so we don't calculate the 10 day I mean clothes

80
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,390
and threw them in clothes for every single US security and said we just do it for the past 10 days past

81
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,510
three days.

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
Then percent difference.

83
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,310
We've actually done this before.

84
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,390
It's just mean 10 ups mean underscore 10 minus.

85
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:33,910
I mean underscore 30 divided by I mean underscore 30 cents per percent difference and then we create

86
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,170
some sort of logic on what we're going to short.

87
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:45,960
So anything that has a negative percent difference wups percent difference.

88
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,720
Anything that's less than zero because I think it's going down.

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,880
And then long as anything that has a growing percent difference because according to my logic I think

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,380
that's good.

91
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,550
Healthy behavior.

92
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,470
Again this maybe not a strategy you want to trade on just some kind of generic logic here.

93
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,330
And then finally let's go ahead and securities to trade

94
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm going to set that equal to shorts or longs.

95
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,340
So at the very end of my pipeline.

96
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,440
I only want to see the ones that I'm actually going to trade.

97
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,220
I don't want to see the top five based energy.

98
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,510
If they didn't happen to go through this.

99
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,570
So I also don't want to see everything in U.S. equity pricing eventually at the end of the day.

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,390
I just want to see what am my shorting and what am I going long on.

101
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,890
So I'm going to return pipeline and was put in some columns here number where you have column this is

102
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,800
an argument with a dictionary.

103
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,520
And I will say Long's sequel to lungs and a lot of times people put this in some sort of context object

104
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,310
will say shorts equal to shorts.

105
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,460
And then I will say perked if is equal to that percent difference that we just made.

106
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,910
And then at the end of all this we have some final screen which is the securities to trade.

107
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,520
And that is our kind of giant pipeline function.

108
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,320
So we're gonna be copying and pasting this into the idea later on but let's go ahead and run the cell

109
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,310
and make sure that we don't have a typo in here.

110
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,690
Make sure it worked well say results run our pipeline and we're just going to call our make pipeline

111
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,540
function and let's kind of put in some years here.

112
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:41,200
So I'll say from May 2015 the 5th of that kind of an arbitrary choice 2015 05.

113
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,420
So I'm just doing this for one day.

114
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,350
That way I don't get some huge data frame and then we'll see the results.

115
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,070
Okay it looks like we have a typo here so global mean 30 is not defined.

116
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,530
Let's come back up here and make sure that's fixed.

117
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:59,410
So it looks like XLE type didn't mean 10 here change it to 30 now run it again results percentile difference

118
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,130
is not the.

119
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,240
Looks like I have an error there.

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,470
What line is this on.

121
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,830
This is on shorts.

122
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,680
So that should be per cent difference in that percentile difference okay.

123
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,030
And that should be let it run.

124
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,010
And here we go.

125
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,010
So now I have longs the percent difference and shorts so I can see anything that has a positive percent

126
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,560
difference has a true go along on it.

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,790
And he falls short on it.

128
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,910
So if we scroll down here we basically just have one of these stocks of a negative value and can see

129
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,180
here.

130
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,740
True I'm going short on it.

131
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,000
And you notice all these stocks if you were to look them up or Google them have something to do with

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,430
the energy sector.

133
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,610
So go ahead and I would recommend you kind of just copy and paste one of these into google search and

134
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,740
then see what the actual stock ticker represents.

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,290
But it should be related to the energy sector somehow.

136
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,880
It should also be a highly traded stock because remember we're basically just asking for the top five

137
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,480
percent of all these stocks.

138
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,170
So these are all really highly traded stocks which means we're going have a lot of liquidity here especially

139
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,960
because we already kind of filtered it by the top 50 or 100 tradable stocks.

140
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,850
So we should never have any issues here of not being able to put our trades that should be a pretty

141
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,950
rare occurrence.

142
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,790
OK so now that we have our make pipeline function.

143
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,480
Let's go ahead and execute this entire strategy in the IDC and see how we can combine this with an initialize

144
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,330
function some sort of before trading start function as well as a rebalancing function.

145
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,690
Make sure you actually reference the notes here because we're going to copy and paste this into the

146
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,340
ID in the next lecture.

147
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,850
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
