00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.810
Hello everyone and welcome to the pantless exercises portion of the section.

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.810
So this exercise is going to test your new skills of pandas and we'll be working with the failed banks

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.670
data set.

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.480
It's going to be provided as a CSP file.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.100
In case you weren't able to connect through HVM.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.560
So you can find this in the panda's exercises subfolder in the general Pandurs folder.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.520
Let's quickly show you how you can find this notebook and go through the exercises.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.770
And then in the next lecture we'll actually go through the solutions.

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.240
I hop over to the folder now.

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.770
OK so him put her notebook under General Pandurs under those exercises you should see two files here

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.200
pensÃ©es exercise solutions and Panas exercises as well as the CSP file you'll be using.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.780
So if you click on pads This exercises Ill open up a notebook and basically we have to do is just answer

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.930
are complete tasks in bold.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.220
However there is a little caveat here.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.660
I want you to do all the tasks in one line of Panda's code so if you get stuck it's no problem.

16
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.360
Check out the solutions lecture.

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.460
You should also note that there are multiple solutions to pretty much every task depending on how you

18
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.800
think about pandas.

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.240
You can do the tasks in multiple ways.

20
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.050
There is lots of one liners you could use.

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.700
So if you did it slightly different than the solutions don't worry as long as you got the same results.

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.420
So to start off with just import pandas and read in the bank the list that CACP file into a data frame

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.970
called Bank.

24
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.300
So for example I'll do this one with you because it's pretty easy you'll just import Pansy's PD and

25
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.700
then read in the CSP file so you'll have a data from it called banks and say PD resee S V and then if

26
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.560
you're in the same directory you can just tab out a complete bank list.

27
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.440
See if we let it read in and you're ready to go then you'll complete the tasks below like showing the

28
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.650
head of the data frame.

29
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.920
Where are the column names.

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.100
How many states are represented in the state of.

31
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.200
Get a list of all the set states in the dataset etc..

32
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500
So you just keep going all along.

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.700
And as a quick note you'll notice that there's two cells one of them says code here and the other one

34
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.530
is blank.

35
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.340
The reason there's two cells is because if you accidentally type something in this cell and then run

36
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.460
it you would overwrite the expected output.

37
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.600
So keep that in mind.

38
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.960
You should actually just code here and then see if your output matches the expected output.

39
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.820
Trying not to write in the cell that is directly above the expected output.

40
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.500
And as a quick now on this question What are the top five acquiring institutions that acquired those

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.730
filled banks.

42
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.200
I listed no acquire as technically one of the top five.

43
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.690
You could kind of skip that one and then show the first top six.

44
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.510
If you actually want institutions that acquired them.

45
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.140
OK.

46
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.110
So if you keep going all the way down youll notice that theres a bonus question how many banks closed

47
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.450
in the year 2008.

48
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.630
This is technically kind of hard because we havent specifically learned how to do the all time series

49
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.660
data with pandas yet so feel free to skip this one.

50
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.010
There is a way you can do it with just pure strings which is what weve learned about so far.

51
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.290
So if you wanted to go for it if not just go ahead and skip it and we'll see when we actually learn

52
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.860
how to deal with Time series of panderers how you can best perform this.

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.650
Okay.

54
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.480
Thanks everyone.

55
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.970
Best of luck on the exercises and the next lecture will go through solutions.

56
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.060
I'll see you there.
