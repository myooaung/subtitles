00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.590
Now let's really dive into learning how did the all time series data time series have special properties

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.060
and a different set of predictive algorithms than most other types of data.

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.930
In this section we'll learn about key components of time series data and also introduce some time series

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.690
specific algorithms such as Arema models.

5
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.300
Not every algorithm introduced in this section will actually be applicable to financial datasets but

6
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.390
it's still important to learn them to understand why they aren't always the best choice for financial

7
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.190
security is time series data.

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.490
All right let's jump in.
