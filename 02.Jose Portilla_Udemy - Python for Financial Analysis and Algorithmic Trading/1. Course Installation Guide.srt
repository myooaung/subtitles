1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,580
Welcome back everyone to the course set up an installation lecture.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,700
In this lecture we'll quickly discuss the following topics.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,750
What is Anaconda and how to download it how to download the notes.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,600
Setting up the Course environment and working with the Jupiter.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,010
So is Anaconda.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,560
Anaconda is a distribution of python and all that distribution means is that it contains various Python

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,650
libraries and it makes sure that they all work well together.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,600
Some of the more complex libraries have certain dependencies in a card that just makes it easy and make

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,350
sure they're all working together well.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,580
If you're an advanced user that is someones already has programming experience with Python you probably

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,220
already have Python installed and you may or may not need to install Anaconda.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,710
If you're an advanced user who already has Python and you're familiar with Pipp install a command line

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,570
in order to follow along this course.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,970
At this stage all you have to do is let your command line your terminal say Pip install Jupiter and

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,840
that will install the Jupiter notebook for you.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,710
Now for everyone else let's go ahead and show you how to download Anaconda and it jumped to my browser

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,390
now OK.

18
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,400
So once you're at the browser go ahead and google search for Anaconda Python download.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,950
You should end up seeing a link that says something like continue.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,650
I o slash downloads go ahead and click on that and it will take you to a page that looks something like

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,130
this.

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,540
Every once in a while they change what the page looks like but somewhere on the page there should be

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,880
a link for actually downloading the Anaconda distribution for your preferred platform.

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,990
You have Windows Mac OS and Linux so go ahead and choose the installer that's for your platform and

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,560
make sure you download the python 3.6 version.

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,960
So we're going to download Python 3.6.

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,200
This is a 64 bit.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,820
If you're on a 32 bit computer they have a valid 32 bit option as well.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,950
And then there's Mac OS and then there's Linux.

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,360
Once you've downloaded that go ahead and come over here it's where it says how to install Anaconda.

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,040
And that will take you to a link for their documentation.

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,580
And there's three separate pages one for installing a Windows one for installing a Mac OS and then one

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,080
for installing on Linux that basically a step by step instructions on what you need to do depending

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
on your operating system.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,110
However I want to give you a quick note.

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,830
If you're on Windows so if you're on Windows essentially.

37
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,580
Quite easy to graphical installer you just click next next next.

38
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,630
But eventually it's going to add you or ask you the following.

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,170
It's going to ask you whether or not you want to add anaconda to your path environment variable.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
If you click on that box it's going to say they don't recommend adding anaconda to your path environment

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,820
variable.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,010
However if this is your first installation of Python on your computer you don't have it yet go ahead

43
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,990
and check that box anyways and make sure that you add anaconda to your path environment variable.

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,080
If you don't check that box what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to call in a condo's

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,080
Python directly from your command line so that may cause issues down the road when you're calling things

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,090
like Jubran output.

47
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,200
So go ahead and make sure that you add anaconda to the path environment variable.

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,000
All right so once you've installed that go ahead and open up your command prompt and let me quickly

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,770
tell you how you can find that.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,350
So if you're looking for how to actually reach the command line if you're a Windows user Go ahead.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,480
After you install Anaconda search your computer for Anaconda prompt.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,730
If for some reason you can't find any on a prompt on your computer just go ahead and search for the

53
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,050
term ACMD.

54
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,210
They'll take you to your Windows command prompt.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,220
If you're on a Mac OS or Linux just search for the term terminal and open up your command line.

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,450
So again Windows users search for on the prompt or ACMD Mac OS and Linux users search for the terminal.

57
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,070
This will bring up your command line.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,200
Let's go ahead and jump to the command line now.

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,650
Once at your command line go ahead and change directory tour ever you have your unzipped note file as

60
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,350
a resource in this lecture.

61
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,690
You can download a zip file containing all the notebooks unzip it to a desired location and then from

62
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,340
your command prompt CD into that location.

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,400
So the way you can do that is to just type CD in the name of the file path that you want to locate to.

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,240
Or you can just go folder by folder.

65
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,420
So for example I can begin typing in a folder name here.

66
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,750
Hit tab to autocomplete and then it will change directory into that folder.

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,900
If I ever need to change the directory back up the directory just see the space two dots and then I

68
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,920
go back up one.

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:28,460
So I'm going to CD to the directory where my information saved so will see the to this and then eventually

70
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,760
you want a CD into your Python for finance repo or wherever you happen to have the unzipped file so

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,450
that unzips file contains a bunch of notebook files.

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,660
But it also contains an environment file the environment file is an environment that you can activate

73
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,790
to actually have the same environment that I used when I was creating this course.

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,680
So the way you do that is once you're actually in the repository with the environment file it's the

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,430
environment.

76
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:08,710
Why M-L you'll say Konda E and vi create dash f environments thought y m l and to make sure the check

77
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,270
that you're actually in the correct directory you should be able to tap autocomplete this environment

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,530
thought why M-L.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,460
If you're not able to tab autocomplete that you're probably not in the right folder.

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,840
Make sure that you're located in the same folder as the unzip notes.

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
Have this environment.

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,930
Thought why an elf file inside of them.

83
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,830
Once you've done that go ahead and create that environment trough this.

84
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,200
You should see a bunch of downloads begin to occur.

85
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:42,250
Once those downloads are finished you can then do is say activate PI finance and once you've activated

86
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,360
PI finance you should see over here on the left hand side that pi finance is now activated if you aren't

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:58,260
on a Mac or Linux computer you're going to need to say Source activates high finance and then use that.

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,990
So again that's for Mac OS or Linux users.

89
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,180
And you can check out the resources for a link on more information about Konda environments.

90
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,190
Once you've done that you should be able just to call Jupiter notebook.

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,490
Hit enter and eventually this will open up your browser.

92
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,680
Now if this is your first time using this make sure to copy and paste this URL so says HTP localhost

93
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,980
8 9 and that it has a token for you.

94
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,980
So if this is your first time using Jupiter notebook go ahead and copy this entire URL with the token.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,060
Otherwise you may go to your browser and it may be requesting your token or password so you'll need

96
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,560
to copy and paste this entire you are.

97
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,680
Once you've had that lets go ahead and bring over a browser and see what it looks like.

98
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,260
You should see something that looks something like this in your browser so to zoom in a little bit and

99
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,350
essentially you have here are the files for the course.

100
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,340
We have the python crash course none apply.

101
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,990
General Pandurs visualization Panas time series etc. and these are more or less aligned with the actual

102
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,300
section titles of the course itself.

103
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,440
So if you go on to me each section has a corresponding folder here.

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,450
So for example if it's time to go into the stock market analysis kept some project you'll just click

105
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:13,210
here and then you'll see the actual CACP files that go if that stock project stock market and Alce project

106
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,400
solutions etc..

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,210
So again all the information you have is here for you.

108
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,980
In order to create a new notebook.

109
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,320
Just come over here.

110
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,180
Select new and you should see Python 3.

111
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,550
Sometimes this says something like Khand the roots are called the default.

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
That's OK as well.

113
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,070
Just click on whatever is underneath.

114
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,460
Notebook.

115
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,610
Once you click that you've gone ahead and created a new Jupiter notebook Jupiter notebooks have cells

116
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,040
where you can type in Python code so you can do something like two plus two.

117
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,730
And if you want to run this just do shift enter and you'll get an output.

118
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,970
Now as a quick note the notebooks can also show you methods and functions.

119
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,840
Then work on which show you all that in the Python crash course.

120
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,000
But as a quick show if you want to check the length for something it's a Eliane And if you do shift

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,940
tab right after this function you'll end up returning the documentation string.

122
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,360
Now keep in mind the function must already be defined in order to see this documentation string.

123
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,250
And if you have an object such as a string it's all say x is equal to my string do shift enter to run

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,810
that I can do X dot tab and I'll see the list of all the methods.

125
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,630
Again this won't show up unless I've already defined string or this x variable in a cell.

126
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,490
And again we'll discuss that more in the Python crash course but hopefully you already have some familiarity

127
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,130
with this before enrolling in this course.

128
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,880
All right.

129
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,350
If you have any questions on the installation process please feel free to post the Kewaunee forums.

130
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
I'm always happy to help out.

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,230
Sometimes the operating systems have a little trouble with the installation process so please feel free

132
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,590
to post any questions you may have over this process.

133
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,190
Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
