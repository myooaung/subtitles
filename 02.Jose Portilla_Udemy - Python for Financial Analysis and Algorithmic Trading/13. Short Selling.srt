Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on short selling We're going to quickly discuss what short

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,940
selling is and we're actually going to be able to do short selling when we deal to Quanto pian platform

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,740
basically short selling allows you to profit if a stock drops in price.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,840
However it does come with a greater risk due to the fact that there's technically no ceiling to the

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,580
amount of money you could possibly lose.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,110
So let's actually go over the way it works.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,370
So let's start with what we'll call step zero.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,660
So before anything actually takes place we'll say that alphabet or Google stock is currently valued

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,820
at five hundred dollars.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,330
But you think it's going to drop in the future.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,550
So we have basically kind of three players here you in blue on the top left someone in red who has 10

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,320
shares of alphabet stock.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,520
And then the current market basically a third party anyone else who buys and shares stock.

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,110
So we start with step point where you end up doing is you borrow Redds shares of alphabet or GOOG.

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,470
So you have 10 shares you borrowed from Brett.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,340
You haven't actually paid for them you're just borrowing them and you promised to return them at a future

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:21,050
date to read and the current price of alphabet is $500 that to you immediately then go and sell these

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,700
10 shares to the market.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,900
So when the current price is $500 that means you have 10 stocks of $500 and you have $5000.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,490
So you went to the market and you sold off those 10 shares.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,970
Now if you were correct in thinking that the share price was going to drop.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's imagine that the price of Google has dropped to $100.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,830
So what you do is once the price has dropped you go out and you buy 10 shares for a thousand dollars

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,710
because a 100 times ten is a thousand dollars.

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:58,200
Then Step 4 you now give back the 10 shares you owe back to red and you've made $4000 technically because

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,080
of the drop in price from five hundred to 100.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,020
So again you just borrow those 10 shares immediately sold them waited for the price to drop.

28
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,790
Then you go ahead and buy those 10 shares back at a profit and you give them back to red so you should

29
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,920
know however that if the price actually goes up instead of down you will lose money buying back the

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,870
stock to give it back to red or whoever we actually borrowed the stock from.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,280
And keep in mind all these transactions would happen through a broker not theorically with someone OK.

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,780
Now let's move on to discussing cap em or the capital asset pricing model.

33
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,820
I'll see you in the next lecture.
