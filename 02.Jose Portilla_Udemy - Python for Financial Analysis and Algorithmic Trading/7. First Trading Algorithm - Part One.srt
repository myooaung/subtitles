00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,410
Hello everyone and welcome to this first trading algorithm.

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,870
So now let's go ahead and apply what we've learned about Antonina research and Quanto paeans idea to

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,960
create our first trading algorithm.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,730
We're going to be conducting a strategy known as pairs trading.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,350
So we're going to implement a simplified approach of the parish trading strategy basically where we

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,960
take two securities we believed to be paired together such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi or two airlines.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,660
And we'll see how we can use that relationship to actually create an algorithm that trades off that

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,730
relationship.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,970
Keep in mind this approach is not something you should actually trade with especially the simplified

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,560
approach that we show here.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,870
Instead we're going to really be focusing on understanding Quanto PIENSO platform.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,380
So make sure to do the additional reading and the resources.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,380
If you're further interested in a more realistic example of pairs trading in our case we're going to

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,750
focus the first part on conducting research getting the stock information seeing how these two securities

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,230
are correlated to each other.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,630
And then the second part is going to focus on actually implementing the strategy against a simplified

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,220
version of Paris trading.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,920
All right let's get started.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,700
I might jump over to Quanto in COM and open up a new notebook there.

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,070
OK here I am at Quanto dot com.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,890
I've gone to research notebooks and I've created a new research notebook.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,980
I'm going to zoom in one more level here and the notebook that's provided for you for this lecture is

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,090
a notebook that you can actually run locally for the first part of it.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,750
That is the research half and it uses Quando.

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,080
We're not going be able to use quando here in the research notebook area but instead we can just use

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,430
get pricing.

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:45,320
So let's go ahead and do a couple of imports here will say important umpires and the import panderers

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,970
as PD and then we'll import plot lib type plots as Piazzi.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,360
So we're going to run that since we're in Quanto it means research notebook we don't need to say map

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,010
Cutlip in line.

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,580
Now it's time to actually get the pricing data.

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,010
So we'll say get pricing and you can do shift tab here to actually get the pricing but remember it just

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,320
takes in the symbol the start and the end date.

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,270
So let's go ahead and do that.

35
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,500
We're going to compare United Airlines to American Airlines.

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,590
So we'll show you how we can start with that.

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,060
We'll say AOL for United Airlines and set this equal to United and we'll set our start dates and end

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,830
dates so let's do that our souls will say Star is equal to.

39
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:44,390
And let's say something like 2015 0 1 0 1 and we'll set the end date to be 2017 0 1 0 1.

40
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,680
So we just have two years of data here.

41
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:55,260
And then let's go ahead and set that as our start date sort of say start date is equal to start and

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,190
then we'll say our end date is equal to end and we're going to copy the same command here and do the

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,590
exact same thing for American Airlines.

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,700
And our basic idea here is if for instance fuel costs go up American Airlines stock should maybe go

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,970
down because the price of airlines going to get more expensive or airline tickets at least.

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,840
And we would expect United to behave the same way.

47
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,090
So let's go ahead and run this and get this pricing information and we're going to save it as to data

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,400
frame's and then let's check out what we get for United.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,010
So we check out the head of United and we get the open high low close price volume and then price and

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,460
by default here we're getting daily data and we can check out the same thing for American and we can

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,710
see their price.

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,090
So let's go ahead and plot both of these out and see how similar they are as far as their behavior is

53
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,050
concerned.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,560
We'll see.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,050
American and will use leadership tap here will tell us that we have close underscore price sources close

56
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,270
underscore price and willing to plot this out and let's give this the label AAA for American Airlines

57
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:13,860
and we'll set the figure size to be something like 12 by 8 so make sure that's an equals the next they're

58
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,060
going to do is say United grabbed the close price of their And they were going to plot this out and

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,430
give it the label for United.

60
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,860
And in fact let's just to make it really clear when you say united

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,040
and then we can say peel the legends so we can actually see the results.

62
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,390
So we'll run that and we can see here American Airlines and United Airlines and I can zoom out just

63
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,220
another bit and it looks like their behavior is highly correlated between each other.

64
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,440
So let's actually try to get these correlation coefficient to see how correlated these two stocks are.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,280
Now remember for more advanced pairs trading We would it just look a correlation we will look at things

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,300
like CO integration which is different than correlation and it's actually a lot harder to find to purchase

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,540
of securities to have good CO integration prepares trading it's easier to find things that have just

68
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,490
a correlation.

69
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,260
So this is why we're using a simplified approach here.

70
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,640
Now one easy way to get correlation is just to call some pie.

71
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,020
We'll zoom back in here and MPI can basically create a correlation coefficient matrix.

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,920
So say c o r r so a correlation coefficient.

73
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,740
And again it just returns that Peerson correlation coefficient and then we passen the two time series

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
we want to check.

75
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,850
So say American clothes price.

76
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:40,250
See how correlated it is with United States United and its close price.

77
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,640
So we'll run that and we basically get this correlation matrix where one in one just represent how correlated

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,540
is American Airlines to itself.

79
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,140
That's one how correlated is United Airlines itself.

80
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,870
That's one.

81
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,630
And then the correlation between each other.

82
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,410
So here you can see there 0.19.

83
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,790
So they're highly correlated.

84
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,960
Now due to the fact they're highly correlated working to do the following assumption for our trading

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,230
strategy we're going to assume that because they're highly correlated that any significance and difference

86
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,730
in the spread of their prices may be a trading opportunity.

87
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,440
So let's actually calculate the spread and then we'll normalize the spread of a z score.

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,640
So first calculate just the normal spread.

89
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:34,410
So I'll say spread is equal to American the close price minus United close price and then we're going

90
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:42,600
to plot this out and we'll say label is equal to spread and let's give this a good fig size maybe something

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,500
like 12 by 8 and if we just run that we can see the spread itself.

92
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,770
So let's actually mark a horizontal line on the average spread so we'll say peel.

93
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,020
And if you ever want to draw just a straight horizontal line you can use X line for axis horizontal

94
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,200
line and then this just takes a single value along the y axis.

95
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,730
So that single value for me is just going to be the average spread.

96
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,820
So what's the average Out of all these values.

97
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,130
So we say spread that mean and then we're going to signify a color here just seasonal to our.

98
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,990
So this should give us a nice red line here.

99
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,760
So here this red line is representing the average spread.

100
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,030
And then over time we can see the real spread.

101
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,420
So let's go ahead and normalize this with the score because the two stock prices are technically different

102
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,050
so we're going to normalize them now.

103
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,610
So let's do that ourselves we'll say DPF z score.

104
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,890
And it takes in stocks and it's going to return the following.

105
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:55,490
We're going to say stocks minus the average of that time series of stocks divided by the standard deviation

106
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:03,350
of the stocks will say that a CD of stocks so that takes a time series of stocks and basically normalizes

107
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,870
it by subtracting the average and then dividing it by the standard deviation.

108
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,020
So let's call it z score on our spread.

109
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,150
Remember spread originally was just the difference between those two close prices.

110
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,940
So we're going to normalize that.

111
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,510
And then we will plot that out.

112
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,330
And I will say Fix size is equal to 14 by 8.

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,780
And this is going to give us something that we can actually trade on.

114
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:40,920
And let's go ahead and create a horizontal line and we'll say the score of spread mean and whip's spread

115
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,440
first needs to be passed and sizzix score and then take them enough for that.

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,230
OK so what I'm doing here is I'm taking that spread passing it through the score first and then taking

117
00:08:51,230 --> 00:09:01,300
the average of it and then let's also give this a color will say color is just give it black then I'm

118
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,090
going to plot another horizontal line and this is going to go at one point zero.

119
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,280
Well first before we actually do that let's just show you what this should look like.

120
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,340
So you noticed that my z score the behavior looks the same as what we have up here.

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,360
But now the actual values have been normalized which means by definition because we're subtracting the

122
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,600
mean and dividing by the standard deviation and normalizing the spread the actual mean should be hovering

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,540
around zero.

124
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,170
And now we have something that we can actually trade on so we can set limits on the top spread.

125
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,170
And the bottom spread and then say something like Hey if it ever goes below this particular normalized

126
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,710
spread score we'll go long on the stock or we'll short the stock and then if ever goes above a particular

127
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,510
spread score we'll let go long and one stock and go short on the other airline stock.

128
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,520
So let's actually add in those horizontal lines

129
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,690
we'll say one point zero for the first one let's say give it the color red and then let's say Ls for

130
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,470
line style and make it kind of a dash line and then we'll cover all do the exact same thing.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,670
And then let's make this one.

132
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,930
Well let's make this first one green.

133
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,950
Second one to read.

134
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,460
Doesn't really matter the color that much.

135
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:23,030
And the next one is going to get negative 1.

136
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,090
Now that we have this nice plot here let's go ahead and discuss it how we can actually use this for

137
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,610
a trading algorithm.

138
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,040
So I have zero being my mean value blue line actually representing the normalized spread.

139
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,540
And then the green and red lines depicting plus or minus one off this average value.

140
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,040
My main strategy is the following.

141
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm going to say that if there's ever a dip either a below the negative one or you know some other arbitrary

142
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,320
value below the mean or there's ever a peak above another value that we can choose maybe 1.

143
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,100
If you want it to be higher like 1.5 that's also OK.

144
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,800
But the main idea being if it ever dips below a particular point here below the normalized score spread

145
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,230
or if it ever peaks above it then I expect there to be what we call a reversion to the mean.

146
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,210
So eventually that spreads should that back down.

147
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,890
And the reason I think that is because in the past I think these stocks are highly correlated which

148
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,530
means our actual spread of value when you normalize it shouldn't be that big of a difference.

149
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,340
Now this may not always be true.

150
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,510
As you can see here Historically it hasn't been true but it does hopefully eventually come back to some

151
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,290
sort of average range.

152
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,490
Now picking this range is a little more complicated and we're not taking it to affect things like integration

153
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,730
which would probably say that these particular stocks are not well-suited for pairs trading but for

154
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,580
the simplified approach this makes sense to us.

155
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,890
So again basic approach is I think these two stocks are highly correlated to each other which means

156
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,510
their spread shouldn't be that significant especially when we normalize it.

157
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,500
So if the spread ever dips below a particular remark or goes above particular remark I'm going to either

158
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,580
go long or short on the stocks the pending home calculating that spread.

159
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,670
Now there is one small problem with this is the fact that I was able to plot out this spread using the

160
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,780
entire time series if were back testing this on Quanto Appian.

161
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,210
We're not going to immediately have the entire time series of our full back test available to us.

162
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,530
Instead what we're going to have to figure out is how to calculate a rolling z score.

163
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,970
So let's show you how we can do that.

164
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,930
So we're going to do is a following we're going to first calculate a one day moving average of the price

165
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,610
spread.

166
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,750
So I'm going to say spread moving average one.

167
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,480
So what does this actually become.

168
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,460
This is the spread going to call rolling off this time series by one day and take the average off of

169
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,510
this.

170
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,240
So that's my one day moving average which is essentially if you kind of think about it.

171
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,900
Today's price almost.

172
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:08,510
And then we're going to do a 30 day moving average so will say spread moving average 30 day spread spread

173
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:16,240
rolling and this is going to be 30 days and then we'll take the average of that that I'm going to take

174
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,620
the rolling 30 day standard deviation.

175
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,200
So I'll say the standard deviation of 30 Krita variable that kind of accounts for that.

176
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,050
Take the spread.

177
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,460
Rolling 30.

178
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,110
But instead of calling me I'm going to call a standard deviation off of this then I'm going to compute

179
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:42,240
the z score for each of these days so I'll say z score let me 30 underscore one is equal to the following.

180
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,320
So it's going to be equal to the spread moving average one.

181
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,270
So this basically accounts for kind of the current spread.

182
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,050
So if we go back up here to where we're calculating the z score number we took the current stock minus

183
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,320
that stock's average and then divided by the standard deviation.

184
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,480
This current stocks were essentially representing it by saying OK just rolling one day moving average

185
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:14,920
then we're going to say the following I'll say that minus the 30 day moving average and then we're going

186
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,540
to divide that by the standard deviation over the 30 days.

187
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,770
So this is essentially a rolling version of the z score function we have a peer.

188
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,420
And the reason we need that rolling method is because we're not going to have access to the entire time

189
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,180
series or actually implementing our algorithm.

190
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,560
We're not going to access future information.

191
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,200
So instead we're going to wait 30 days until our algorithm actually kicks in.

192
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,150
Then once we have 30 days gone past we can begin to calculate that normalized the score and we can see

193
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,610
how the current price whether it's inside or outside the bounds that we happen to indicate.

194
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,160
So now we have a rolling z score we can go ahead and plot it.

195
00:14:52,260 --> 00:15:02,270
So we'll say the score thirty one well plotted out give it a big size of something like 12 by eights

196
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:15,070
and let's go ahead and label this let's say rolling 30 day z score and we'll plot some horizontal axis

197
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,450
line we'll do it.

198
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,340
Zero color all the black

199
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:28,750
and then let's go ahead and just put in one more horizontal line and we'll say one point zero color

200
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,000
is red.

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,940
Now let's make this lifestyle just be dashed.

202
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,350
So we plot that out and we get the following.

203
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,190
Now we have a rolling z score that we can actually execute on.

204
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,050
And you can adjust this one value and we actually go onto implementing this in the next lecture of the

205
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,820
IEEE.

206
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,910
We'll see how adjusting this value here kind of as our cutoff affects the algorithm.

207
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,710
But this is essentially what we need to actually execute the trading algorithm.

208
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,450
So in the next lecture Rexy going to implement this strategy where we use the initialize function and

209
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,770
as well as scheduling functions to have Quanto and execute the strategy.

210
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,780
So at some certain point wants to spread goes beyond an arbitrary mark that we choose We're going to

211
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,290
execute a trading strategy which is either short American Airlines or go long and United etc depending

212
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,980
how you actually calculate the spread.

213
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,670
But that's the basic idea behind this simplified version of Paris trading.

214
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,820
So we're mainly dealing with the spread because we think if they're highly correlated then the spreads

215
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,320
should at some point go down to some sort of average value.

216
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,240
OK.

217
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,820
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

218
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,310
But make sure you do the reading in case you're interested in the heavy mathematics behind Pear's trading

219
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,060
strategy.

220
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,040
Coming up next we're actually going to implement the strategy using the ruling's the score with contrarian's

221
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,050
ID.

222
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,760
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
