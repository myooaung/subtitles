00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,700
Hello everyone and welcome to the first part of the solutions for the stock market analysis project.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,670
Let's hop over to the exercise notebook and get started.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,740
OK here I am at the notebook.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm going to scroll down a little bit and the first part it's just import the various libraries so part

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,410
zero.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,680
We're going to say important umpires and the import pandas is the answer is we know we're going to do

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:35,450
visualisation we'll say import that plot lib pipe plot as PLDT and in order to see the visualizations

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:43,250
inside might you know but I will say that plot lib in line so I'll run that and part 1 is getting the

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,720
data.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,370
So as a quick note in case you were able to use Pandurs data reader you can always just do read cxxviii

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,890
and grab the Tesla stock see as reviles but we're going to walk through it with Pandurs data reader.

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,830
So the first thing I want to do is say import Panda's data reader and then I'm also going to import

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:09,830
date time in order to set the actual dates and then the last thing I want to do is also say imports

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,690
will say import Pancho's data reader data as well.

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,630
OK so let's start off with the start date.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,030
So the start date is going to be January 1st 2012 so we can zoom in one more level here.

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:38,540
So General first starts school say Star is equal to time thought the time and we'll say 2012 one 1 and

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:46,950
then we're going to just copy and paste this for our finish or ending date and then that's going to

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,100
be the exact same thing at the start of 2012.

20
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,390
They'll say 2017.

21
00:01:51,550 --> 00:02:01,100
So once we've done that or we're going to do is set a variable called Tesla equal to web dot data reader

22
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,390
the stock ticker for Tesla is capital T S L A.

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:15,490
We'll use the Google API for this and then we'll give it the start and end dates let it read that and

24
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,160
hopefully we should get the Tesler that head and there it is.

25
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,660
Looks like all our data is matching.

26
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,740
Perfect.

27
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,240
So now I want you to repeat the same steps to grab data for Ford and General Motors is actually pretty

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,920
simple.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,220
We're just going to create two more variables will say Ford said that equal to where the data reader

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:44,780
the ticker for Ford is f just capital F say use the Guly API and then give it the start and end dates

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,750
and we'll do the exact same thing except instead of forward we'll have it be General Motors and that

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,100
ticker is GM.

33
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,230
And then if we check out for instance the head of Ford that matches up open at 11 dollars and for check

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,760
out the head of General Motors that shows up opening twenty point eight three.

35
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,410
OK great.

36
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,910
So that concludes Part 1 actually getting that data should have been pretty straightforward if you were

37
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,340
having issues of Panas data reader you can always just use the C Espey files.

38
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,280
Living on support to visualizing data.

39
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,210
So we're going to do is follow along and recreate the plots below.

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,290
According to the instructions and explanations.

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,850
So the first thing to do is to recreate this linear plot of all the stocks open price.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,390
So hence for the legend you can use the label parameter and plot legend.

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,910
So that's an easy way to actually get this legend here to show nicely.

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,840
And let's actually walk through that now.

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:51,680
We're going to do is say Tesla that was that variable for the data frame grab the open column.

46
00:03:51,690 --> 00:04:01,350
So that's the opening price and then going to plots and I'm going to give this the label Tesla and we'll

47
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,870
just say Fix size is equal to let's say 12 by 8.

48
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:13,730
I think that 16 by 8 but doesn't really matter too much and we'll give it the title opening prices here.

49
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,440
So that title that figure size is going to fall along with anything else I plop below this.

50
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:26,430
So then if I do GM open all I need to say is plot and give it its label.

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:35,760
In this case GM and then it going to save Ford again just the open column that is going to plot this

52
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,440
one as well.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,990
So give that to label Ford and then any to call people that Legin in order to actually see the results

54
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,760
of this and call it some open and closed Princie So if I run this I should get now the same plot that

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,420
I saw earlier.

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,310
So this is the same plot as it is here just a different figure size.

57
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,860
I think 16 by eight is the actual matching figure size so there it is.

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,850
And as a quick note if you're using Jupiter notebook you may get this thing right here it says legend

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,890
if you want to not see that I believe you should be able to just add a semi colon to the end of this

60
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,690
and then it will hide this output.

61
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,010
So if we run this again go ahead that little Lijun output so you can put a semicolon there to hide that

62
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,700
just a little quick.

63
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,570
OK let's continue along.

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,540
And now we want to plot the volume of stock traded each day.

65
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,600
This is actually going to be extremely similar.

66
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,570
So what we can do is just copy and paste from the cell because essentially we're doing is doing the

67
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,580
exact same task except instead of plotting the open column we're going to plot volume.

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:49,610
So I'll say volume for this and then sort of S. open prices or opening prices we will say just volume

69
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,600
traded well such as up for volume here.

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,170
And then switch us up for volume there.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,150
Run this and there we go.

72
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,900
That's the total volume traded.

73
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,980
So you can see it looks like Ford had a really big spike somewhere in late 2013.

74
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,970
So in late 2013 you would see this huge spike it's well above anything else.

75
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,930
So you can see here this is 1.5 times the power rate.

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,580
That's this line right there.

77
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,860
If we zoom in on this line this is above two times tenth power base.

78
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,890
This is huge.

79
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,200
So we want to know is what was the date of this maximun trading volume for Ford.

80
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,980
So those were Pandurs comes into play.

81
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,250
And then as a bonus question what happened that day.

82
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,210
So it's actually check this out.

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,150
So in order to figure out this time stamp what I need to do is figure out where is the maximum of the

84
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,290
volume being traded.

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:49,100
So let's go ahead and just do that with Ford and what you might think to do it just get the max here.

86
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,960
But if you just do Max that's going to return the actual amount.

87
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,420
So ended up returning back how many units of stock were actually traded $220 million.

88
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,900
If I want the actual dates I need to use arguments and it returns back that it was December 18th of

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,090
2013.

90
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,170
Now to answer the bonus question as far as actually what happened the they all ended do essentially

91
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,170
Google search forward plus this date.

92
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,480
So 2013 December 18th and you'll end up getting a bunch of news articles and there's links in the solutions

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,710
notebook that say things like aggressive forward plans hit profits shares fall.

94
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,890
So what ended up happening is that they are the before Ford basically made an announcement that the

95
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,840
cost of launching new products would cut into next year's profits so that ended up causing a big sell

96
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,100
off and you can see that big selloff happening on that particular day.

97
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,170
And if you kind of take a look at Ford by itself.

98
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:50,260
So if you take a look at Ford's opening price and then plot that let's give this a fixed size of let's

99
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,090
just say I don't know 20 by 6.

100
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:01,290
If we take a look at that actual day it's kind of late 2013 you'll end up seeing the drop right here.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,630
Now in context of this entire huge time period it's not actually such a huge drop.

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,450
So it's not as noticeable as the spike here.

103
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,550
So keep that in mind.

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,330
And what's fun to do is kind of take a look at these other spikes and see how it corresponds with the

105
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,020
actual dips because it is a much larger kind of a mid-2014.

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,400
So if we take a look at mid-2014 over here we end up seeing a little spike here.

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,100
So not as significant as this large spike.

108
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,530
So just kind of interesting things to check out as you're kind of playing around and visualizing this

109
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,330
data.

110
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,340
OK.

111
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:39,240
So the open price time series visualisation that is we look all the way back at this first one right

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:47,360
here where we see Tesla's huge stock price versus General Motors and Ford kind of laying flat that visualization

113
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,710
makes it look like Tesla's always been much more valuable as a company than General Motors and Ford.

114
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,500
But to really understand this we actually need to think about is the total market cap of the company

115
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,790
that is the not just the stock units themselves but the stock price multiplied by how many available

116
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,900
units of stock there are.

117
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,890
That's the market cap of the company.

118
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,010
So our current data doesn't actually have information of total units of stock in the company it just

119
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,530
has volume traded.

120
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,750
So we're going to do just as a really simple calculation try to represent the total money traded that's

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,990
going to be multiplying the volume column by the opening price.

122
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,450
Remember this still is not the actual market cap.

123
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,520
It's just a visual representation of the total amount of money being traded.

124
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,530
So basically 100 units of stock at $10 each versus like you know a hundred thousand in stock at $1 each.

125
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,380
Just how much money is actually being traded for each of these companies on these given days.

126
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,090
So first off why don't you to create a new column for each data frame called Total traded which is the

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,290
opening price multiplied by the volume traded.

128
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,680
And this is not a real technical analysis so we usually want to do something like this.

129
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,120
This is mostly just to explore your panda skills.

130
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:09,090
So I'll say Tesla total traded and also equal to Tesla the open price of the column.

131
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,140
And then we'll say Tesla the total volume traded.

132
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,100
So this is what we're doing is we're trying to get an idea of more or less how much money was actually

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,700
traded.

134
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,500
Now again this is not an exact calculation because the opening price is not the average price for that

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,510
day you can do a lot better estimations than when I doing here.

136
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,510
And this is kind of just the practice or panda skills.

137
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,910
So we're going to copy and paste this and do this for the other two.

138
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:40,320
So that's going to be Ford it's going to be Ford and that's going to be Ford.

139
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,710
And then the last one is going to be General Motors General Motors General Motors OK.

140
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,830
So we have three total traded and now we're going to plot this against the time index.

141
00:10:52,830 --> 00:11:01,110
So we're going to do is basically copy this total traded column and then say dot plot and we'll give

142
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,600
this the label Tesla and let's give this the fixed size 16 by 8

143
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:24,410
and then we'll say General Motors total traded plot that with the label GM and then say Ford total traded

144
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:32,280
shooting type to autocomplete there and we'll give that the label Ford let's add in our legend T.

145
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,960
Legend and then it's put a semicolon there.

146
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,390
OK.

147
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,940
So this is essentially a visualization of the total amount of money being traded.

148
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:51,490
So now you can see that Tesla is a lot closer throughout many of the actual years.

149
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,750
Now there is a huge spike for Tesla.

150
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,400
So on this particular day there's a huge amount of money being traded for Tesla which we can explore

151
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
later on.

152
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,840
But as far as the difference between this particular visualization and if we scroll back up this particular

153
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,820
ization the actual amount of money being traded is a lot different.

154
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,520
So again the opening price the actual individual price per stock unit is quite different between Tesla

155
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,870
General Motors and Ford.

156
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
But again this doesn't do a good representation of total market cap.

157
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,100
Now total market cap is not something we can actually get from the data we have at hand here.

158
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,850
All we have are the open high low close prices and volume where we can kind of get some sort of idea

159
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,720
doing kind of this crude calculation of open price times volume.

160
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,210
This is again not a market cap but more discussion on how much actual money is being traded each day

161
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,420
for each of these companies.

162
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,200
And you can see here that for a lot of these days a lot of money is being traded around for all of the

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,980
companies.

164
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,310
Now Tesla again quite a bit more money being traded around especially during certain years when those

165
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,790
being shorted a lot for various reasons but deciles also kind of a crazy company when it comes to its

166
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,370
stock price so just keep that in mind.

167
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,350
So going around or going to do is continue on.

168
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,750
And if he keep continuing on scrolling down you'll end up seeing it says.

169
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,540
Interesting.

170
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,440
Looks like there was a huge amount of money traded for Tesla somewhere in early 2014.

171
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,330
So that's this number right here.

172
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,410
You can see there's a huge amount of money somewhere early 2014 that's being traded.

173
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,600
So one of those What was that day and what actually happened.

174
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,660
We are actually going there really similar thing to that earlier we'll just say Tesla grabbed the total

175
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:35,710
traded column and then I'm going to ask for RMX and that should return a February 25th of 2014.

176
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,230
So what actually happened that day.

177
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,560
Well if you google searching this day plus Tesla finding news like this where it says Wall Street Journal

178
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,550
Tesla shares surge on Morgan Stanley report.

179
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,240
So essentially what happened is some Morgan Stanley analyst gave a good report on Tesla shares.

180
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,150
So that caused a huge spike.

181
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,250
That particular day.

182
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,820
So we're we're also going to do is practice putting out some moving averages.

183
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,770
I want you to plot out the moving average 15 then moving average.

184
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,690
Two hundred.

185
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,080
So let's go ahead and do that.

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,150
That's going to be actually quite straightforward.

187
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,960
We'll just do this for General Motors.

188
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,480
Now all the stocks as it says in the instructions still say General Motors call it a 50.

189
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,870
That is the 50 day moving average is equal to GM open.

190
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,190
And all you have to do is call the rolling method on this 50 and then ask for the mean.

191
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,070
And it's kind of up to you whether you want to set this as a new column or not but setting this as a

192
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,470
new column in the original data frame allows us to kind of do a nice little call at the end and get

193
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,010
the legend automatically.

194
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,230
So this is going to be moving average two hundred will be equal to GM.

195
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,810
The open column

196
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,550
rolling 200 days that's quite a large window.

197
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,230
Just keep that in mind it's more for visualization purposes.

198
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,550
And then let's actually just pass in a list of columns.

199
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:08,850
So we're going to pass in a list of columns will say open a 50 and then made 200 and then we're going

200
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,870
to plot this and give the label.

201
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:17,940
Actually we don't need the label really we'll just say Fix size equal to 16 by 8.

202
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,230
So let's run this.

203
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,170
And we should see the same plot result here.

204
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,810
So we can see the opening price which is blue the movie average for 50 day moving average kind of getting

205
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,490
that trend.

206
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,790
And then the even more macro trend which is the 200 day moving average.

207
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,610
OK.

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,200
So again quite a large window of 200 days a little more for realisation purposes.

209
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,610
But you never know certain technical analysis techniques require really large windows.

210
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,110
So finally we're going to do it see if there's a relationship between these stocks.

211
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,430
After all they're all related to the car industry in some form or another.

212
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,530
So we can actually do this easily through a scatter matrix plot.

213
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,470
So what I want you to do is import scatter matrix from panel start plotting and use it to create a scatter

214
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,120
matrix plot of all the stocks opening price.

215
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,790
Now something you may need to do is rearrange the columns into a single data frame and there's some

216
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,690
hints and info so we check out this link.

217
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,710
There's hints and info on how to actually use the scatter matrix plot so you can come over here to the

218
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,270
actual documentation and I'll describe how I'd actually use SCOTTER matrix and give you some visualization

219
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,000
examples as it loads up there.

220
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,330
Let's hop over to Jupiter now.

221
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,650
It can actually do this ourselves.

222
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:33,620
So when you say from pandas plotting in poor Scouter matrix so I will import that and then I'm going

223
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,900
to create a variable called car companies and I'm going to just concatenate a couple of things I'm going

224
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:55,360
to concatenate the open column of Tesla and then the open column of General Motors and then the open

225
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:05,170
column of Ford and I want to do this all access equal to one because sweep's X equal to one.

226
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,960
And if I just take a quick look at what I've done by checking out the head of this essentially is concatenated

227
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,970
three open columns here.

228
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,210
So Tesla General Motors and Ford.

229
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,000
So this actually doesn't have any column names yet.

230
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,030
They're all open so let's change that.

231
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,260
They're all still in the correct order that is concatenated them.

232
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,220
Tesla General Motors Ford.

233
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:38,140
So let's define this as car come columns and I will say Tesla open General Motors open.

234
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,490
And then Ford open will run that the now facey car company is the head of it.

235
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,440
I get this nice little Tesla open General Motors open and Ford open and now we're going to do is just

236
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,610
use a scatter matrix to create this portrait here.

237
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,960
So we're going to say scatter matrix Pessin passenger data frame which is that car company data frame

238
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,970
and we can set the size to really whatever you want I'll just say eight by eight.

239
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,670
If you're not zoomed in as me you won't need to do that.

240
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,330
And I'm just going to run this and we'll go over a few more arguments.

241
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,010
So if you just run that you end up seeing kind of this big thing of Auray telling you the map pulling

242
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,370
axes and then you get something that looks like this.

243
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,390
So there's a couple of things you can do this in a zoo much the second so you can see the whole scatter

244
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,330
matrix plot.

245
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,880
We can see that there's a clear positive correlation between General Motors and Ford.

246
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
Tesla is quite a bit different has some different behavior and that makes sense because we saw there

247
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,860
was kind of a huge jump in Tesla stock price while General Motors and Ford kind of stayed at the same

248
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,070
level in comparison what you can do to kind of get a better idea of this scatterplot is add an alpha

249
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,340
variable.

250
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,810
So I'll say Alfa is equal to English you say 0.2 because we're dealing with a lot of data points here

251
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,400
and now it's going to appear much starker where there's more points stacked on top of each other.

252
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,800
So that's something you can do and if you want to actually add in more bars this histogram will you

253
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,110
end up doing is you add in as an argument.

254
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,260
H I S T underscore.

255
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:23,990
KW The s and this is going to be a dictionary and what the stick represents is these are histogram keywords

256
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,660
based off map Hotlips own histogram so you end up doing is you go to a map outlives documentation check

257
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,010
out the keyword arguments for using a histogram lib and you can pass isn't as a dictionary.

258
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,870
So the one we are concerned with is Beenz.

259
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,540
So that's the parameter colon as the value you give it.

260
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:49,350
The key one so 50 bits and I think I misspoke I said the key you want you just want to give it the value

261
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,190
you want but the key the key is bin's values 50.

262
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,880
And if you want to get rid of this array you can just use a semi-colon again here.

263
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,000
And there are a scatter matrix and that basically concludes part 2.

264
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,550
There is a bonus visualization task but we'll do that in a separate lecture.

265
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,290
That was the main visualization tasks you had to do for this exercise.

266
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,580
Coming up next we'll tackle this bonus viz. task and then we'll move on to part three basic financial

267
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,500
analysis.

268
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,310
If you have any questions feel free to post them to the Q&amp;A forums but also make sure to check out the

269
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,770
solutions.

270
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,640
No but for the full code and explanations I'll see you at the next lecture.
