Hello everyone will.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,440
The section on visualization a lot of financial techniques will actually require us to be able to visualize

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,870
our data clearly.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,300
Now there are many libraries for visualization with Python will focus on map plotted and planned those

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,180
visualizations that are actually built directly on top of that plot lib will really cover any other

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,400
libraries in order to quickly focus and move on to the financial aspects and algorithmic trading portions

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,810
of the Course instead of just having a giant section on visualization.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,400
However keep in mind there are many other great libraries.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,300
Some of my favorites include seaborne cufflinks Plott Lee Bocca Vincent and many more.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,820
If you just google search for Python visualization libraries you'll get a plethora of results and I

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,420
encourage you to check them out.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,600
We're going to start by covering the basics of map plotted.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,850
It's kind of the grandfather of visualization libraries for Python and then with that knowledge we're

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,100
going to be able to easily leverage panels visualizations because pandas actually comes with built in

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,770
visualization tools that are directly built on top of that live.

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,360
So it's important to understand my lib first before going on to Panas visualizations.

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,370
We're also going have a lecture focusing on time series visualizations with pantless.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,530
Keep in mind that the majority of all our plots in this course are going to be static.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,570
That is not interactive but we will show you a quick trick of Jupiter that will allow it to interact

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,450
the plots that we create Laurie as a quick recap.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,440
This section is going to cover the following topics we'll discuss.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,570
Matt plotless visualization We'll also discuss pandas visualization.

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,500
We'll have a little lecture on pantless time series visualization specifics then we'll have a map plotted

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
exercise for you to do as well as a tandem visualization exercise for you.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,320
OK let's get started.

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
I'll see you at the next lecture.
