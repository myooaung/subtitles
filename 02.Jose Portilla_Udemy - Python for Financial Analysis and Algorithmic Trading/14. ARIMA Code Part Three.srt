00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,850
Welcome back everyone to part three of the three Makoto long lecture in part three will focus on creating

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,490
the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,700
Let's hop over to you put a note book and continue where we left off.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,270
All right so back of that you put it up but what we'll do is we will do the autocorrelation plots and

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,880
partial autocorrelation plots.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,590
But we're actually going to do it for several of the time series so we created.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,300
So you will run these plots on your different datasets.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,950
Now we created several different state assets such as the seasonal first difference the first difference

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,450
and the second difference.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,840
So let's go ahead and show you what autocorrelation plots can look like on various different datasets.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,540
So the way you do this is first we have to import it will say from Stets models thought graphics thought

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:02,310
TSA plots import plot HCF and plot PRCA and then using these functions is actually quite easy you'll

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,760
just say create some figure object and let's call this figure object fig first because we'll do this

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,300
plot of the HGF that is the autocorrelation we'll do it first on the milk first difference.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,670
Or I believe it's just the first difference.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,100
There we go and we need to drop and Ayon this well run it.

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,830
And here we see the autocorrelation.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,240
So this is the gradual decline autocorrelation that you may see in some of your differenced time series

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,710
data the other type of autocorrelation that's common to see is the sudden drop.

20
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:46,810
So to do that let's create fig and we'll just do seasonal let's say seasonal first here and we're going

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:55,580
to do is we'll plot the autocorrelation function for DMF and we'll say milk actually will say Seasonale

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:04,230
first difference and we'll need to drop in a here so we'll run that and we can see we have the autocorrelation.

23
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,210
And here is the sudden drop off.

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,000
So that's a very common autocorrelation plot to see.

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,820
And just so you know pantless actually has this functionality built in but it only has for autocorrelation

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,390
plots not partial autocorrelation functions.

27
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,930
So I recommend using stat's models for the sort of plotting but I do want to show you how you can create

28
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,220
this autocorrelation plot with pantless we end up doing as you say from panderers start plotting import

29
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,060
autocorrelation plot and then from there you can say auto correlation plot and then pass in whatever

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,480
you want.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,450
So you get passen the seasonal first difference that we just did drop a.

32
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,110
And this will give you the autocorrelation plot.

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,270
So it's autocorrelation plot looks a little different.

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,100
It doesn't do these connecting lines here and if you actually don't want these connecting lines that

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,660
see parameter you can pass into plot HCF.

36
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,680
So if you do shift tab here it will ask you whether you want to use the vertical lines or not and whether

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,590
you want alpha.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,750
So you could say use lines equals false as an argument so we can go in and pass.

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,550
I mean if you want see what that looks like.

40
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,790
And it won't put the actual vertical lines but panderers is a kind of K'NEX seems to be you can see.

41
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,960
It also keeps it from negative 1 to 1.

42
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,970
You can see the that's models will kind of auto adjust to the lowest and highest points in your autocorrelation

43
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,470
plot.

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,100
So that's why it looks a little different here.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,740
It's really up to you which one you prefer but I would recommend sticking to stat's models.

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,150
That's the one that's going to be able to do both autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation.

47
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,080
So we'll continue on here.

48
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,310
Let's go ahead and move on to partial autocorrelation.

49
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,140
That is the plots.

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:55,660
And to do that all you need to do is call plot's underscore P-A C-f and that here will just pass just

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,690
pass in the seasonal first difference again.

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,510
And we'll drop and a

53
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,070
and let's just go ahead and assign this to result.

54
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,070
And we'll see the partial autocorrelation.

55
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,970
So just as a quick note if you do not assign the result here you may accidentally see it twice.

56
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,060
So you can go ahead and do that assignment just to see it one time and there's a partial autocorrelation

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,390
plot.

58
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,900
And this is a sudden drop off.

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,320
And typically you'll see the sudden drop off pretty much for almost every partial autocorrelation plot

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,100
you're working with it.

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,450
It really depends on your time series but this is quite common to see the complete drop off there.

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,410
OK.

63
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,480
So as far as interpreting this as far as the partial autocorrelation is concerned typically a sharp

64
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,410
drop after let's say K number of Laeg segments on the x axis indicates you should use some utterer aggressive

65
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,070
K number model.

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,710
So if there is a gradual decline and this partial autocorrelation or it suggests a moving average model

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,670
so go ahead and check out the Resorcin links if you want more information on learning about how to interpret

68
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:03,120
autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots since we've run quite a few plots already on different

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,810
different data sets.

70
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,500
We're going to do this just quickly create our final HCF MPAC plots and these are the ones we're going

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,860
to be referencing for the rest of the tasks for the arena model.

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,720
So I'm going to create a figure here and I'm going to do say Piazzi Well what I'll do is just say the

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:32,860
following will say plot HCF and we'll just call the seasonal first difference and then I'm also going

74
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,140
to do is whip's say drop and a

75
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,950
all run that and then what I also want to plot is the C-f.

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,100
OK so we have the partial autocorrelation and the autocorrelation.

77
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,260
So kind of the pends on what order you run these lines in as far as what order they come out.

78
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,680
So don't be confused by that.

79
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,390
But here you can see partial autocorrelation and autocorrelation and you can muster out fix sizes if

80
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,230
you want.

81
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,670
So you can say something like purity that figure you can see in the notebook that we provide.

82
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,870
We kind of did some stuff to mess around the figure size but basically we just need these two plots.

83
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,270
So we'll continue along here.

84
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,910
And the very next step that we do is actually use the Arema model.

85
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,050
And in this case our data was Seasonale.

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
So we're going to need to use the seasonal Arema model.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,820
So in the next lecture will actually fit and build over the seasonal Arema model and then we'll use

88
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,680
it to forecast future values.

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,460
And I think you'll find that pretty cool.

90
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,210
How good of a forecast you can get just off of some of the basic stuff we've been learning about here.

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,340
Again some of these forecasting techniques don't work very well.

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,300
Security's financial data but it's still worth learning about.

93
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,930
Just so we can understand how to analyze time series data in a general format.

94
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,890
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture where we actually fit the Arema model.
