1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,650
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,010
And in this lecture we're going to continue right where we left off and discuss continuous futures.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,680
And as a quick review of what continuous futures are.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,020
Remember that when we plotted out the volume being traded for each individual's features contract you

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,580
get the behavior of a lot of volume being traded as you can get close to the maturity date and then

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,910
Elly's for natural gas.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,000
But a month before you know the speculation of the market price is starting to match probably the true

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,070
market price value at the point of maturity so people start kind of declining in their trading and maybe

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,860
there's some event to give you a little spike.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,030
But eventually it goes down to zero once the actual maturity date has been reached.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,970
So again this is volume being traded.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,690
So it would be nice is if we could somehow kind of get some sort of continuous value here that we wouldn't

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,510
have to deal with the hassle of kind of jumping from a futures contract the futures contract.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
So it continues.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,500
Future is an abstraction over these underlying assets.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,140
So for example if we wanted to trade crude oil we could create a reference to see oil that's the crude

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,880
oil reference code instead of a series of seal contracts.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,080
So we're going to be able to use continuous features and just type in natural gas instead of typing

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,330
in a natural gas January 2018.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,700
We can just say natural gas.

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,830
So we use the continuous fut. object as part of the platform to get a continuous chain of historical

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,400
data for futures contracts taking some of these concerns into account.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,010
Now one of the things we're going to discuss when talking about continuous features is how do we actually

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,660
adjust for the change from one fut. to another.

25
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,840
You can see there's kind of a crossover point here but at what time should we crossover or should we

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,250
just crossover when the volumes kind of overlap should cross over at the maturity date and should we

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,790
kind of make any sort of mathematical adjustment in pricing here.

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,780
So we're going to talk about that adjustments as kind of a huge part of continued features and there's

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,620
different ways to do it and there's multiple options that you can provide.

30
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,220
So as a quick reminder continues.

31
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,960
Futures are not actual tradable assets.

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,680
They are just an abstraction over the actual tradable assets which are these individual futures contracts.

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,920
So what they really do is they maintain a reference to the current active contract related to the given

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,590
underlying contracts.

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,600
Okay.

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,520
So let's go ahead and kind of explore how you can grab continuous fut. and as a quick no.

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,450
I know the wording is kind of confusing sometimes because I'm using consecutive versus continuous.

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,910
So just to make it clear especially if English is not your first language what I showed here were consecutive

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,670
contracts.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,850
So I can see one contract after another after another after another.

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,930
So these are consecutive what I'm going to discuss now is continuous.

42
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,310
So some sort of abstraction that allows us to be kind of a single continuous line.

43
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,420
So hopefully that kind of clears things up.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,950
I know it can be a little confusing especially because the words kind of are so similar to each other.

45
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,340
All right so I'll say from one toping that research experimental import continuous future and at some

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,340
point in your future if you're watching this video at a later time it may a little longer be under experimental

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,760
So definitely check the documentation of CONTO Appian to see where he should import continuous future

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,680
from.

49
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:22,020
And then I'm going to just say continuous future and print out the documentation for you so you can

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,800
see here it takes in some parameters.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,760
The root symbol.

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,270
So that's the root symbol for the continuous future.

53
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,580
Again it's just a symbol.

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,740
The actual thing you're tradings it come back here to this notebook.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,060
It's just going to be one of these symbols like natural gas or energy because it's continuous.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,140
We're kind of doing away of the date and time codes.

57
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,700
Then you're going to have what you could do is an offset.

58
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,640
So the distance from the primary contract you can always just use the default zero.

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,040
There's going to be rules and then adjustments which we're going to talk about at a later time period.

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,200
So again root symbol is a symbol for the underlying offset the distance from the primary contract.

61
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,430
Zero icles primary one is equal secondary.

62
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,730
Talk more about that later.

63
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,750
Role is how do the term the current contract of the continuous feature and the current options are volume

64
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,070
and calendar.

65
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,340
So the volume approach here chooses the current active contract based on trading volume.

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,930
So as I discussed up here I was kind of mentioning Well how do we decide when to jump from this kind

67
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,750
of blue future to this green future.

68
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,900
So there's two ways to do that.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,050
We could choose the one of the highest volume being traded at any given time.

70
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,340
So we would switch over kind of when they roll over here or we could choose to kind of hop over to the

71
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,210
next future.

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,860
Once this futures contract has reached maturity and then we would kind of jump back up to here.

73
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,540
We're going to usually use the volume way of rolling over.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,860
But again it really depends on your current situation and what kind of data you want.

75
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,650
Then there's finally the adjustment and the adjustment is how to adjust historical prices from earlier

76
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,150
contracts and the options are and you l for multiple multiplicative adjustment D for ADD additive adjustment

77
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,100
and then none for no adjustment.

78
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,970
And we'll talk about that later we'll kind of play around with them to show you how they each affect

79
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,420
your continuous futures contract.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:16,090
So let's actually get our continuous feature so we're going to say continuous Gunton US natural gas

81
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,990
and we're going to use that continuous future function we pass in the CO-2 want ngi for natural gas

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,770
when we use a default offset.

83
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,870
We're going to roll over based off volume.

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,460
So basically at any given point in time we're going to choose the futures contract that has the most

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,790
volume being traded.

86
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,980
And then we won't have any adjustment for now or actually let's go ahead and pass the multiplicative

87
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,880
adjustment later on we'll show you what it looks like no adjustment.

88
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,550
Okay.

89
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,490
So we grab that data we're going to grab continuous energy and you can see here it's a continuous feature

90
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,460
has some sort of code based off where we actually provided route symbol and then these three parameters.

91
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,900
So what we're going to do is grab historical information for this continuous natural gas.

92
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,240
Previously we just did it for one futures contract.

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,480
Now we're going to do it for this continuous features kind of abstraction object so forsake natural

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,240
gas continuous I'll call it active because it's kind of like which ones are the most active right now.

95
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:23,330
Well passen that continuous natural gas object and then I'm going to ram multiple fields from this we're

96
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:32,730
going to say grab the contract the price and the volume.

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:43,120
Now let's go ahead and say that frequency is going to be daily we'll see the start dates and we'll say

98
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,910
start from 2016.

99
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's just grab from kind of the same date so was it before.

100
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,400
So kind of October 2016 end date.

101
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,650
2017 let's say August 1st.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,320
OK so we have that information and if we actually take a look what this ends up looking like it's a

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,540
data frame just as before.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,400
And we can see here we have price volume and then the contract name.

105
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,250
Now there's something important to note here is since this is continuous versus what we did before which

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,570
was kind of grabbed this historical information for various individual futures contracts.

107
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,180
You'll notice that this contract is going to end up changing as we go further and further out in time.

108
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:31,760
So to show you that I'm going to say ngi continuous active and let's go ahead and say contract and then

109
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:41,740
say unique and you can see here I have various features I have natural gas x 16 natural gas Z 16 x cetera

110
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,310
and basically this is indicating at whatever particular point in time and the index this was the future

111
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,010
with the most volume being traded.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
And that's kind of what the rollover is trying to do here.

113
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,920
That ruling style.

114
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,780
So let's go ahead and kind of plot it out.

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,850
So let's plot out the price so we can see how the price changes over time.

116
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,490
So going to copy and paste this pasand price let's just plot that out.

117
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,060
So I can see here the price and now I have kind of this continuous pricing abstraction over what I did

118
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,940
previously and we can see the same thing for the volume.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,540
So if we kind of just copy and paste this and instead of pricing we check out the volume.

120
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,690
I get the same thing here.

121
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,200
So I can see a sort of continuous volume instead of multiple futures.

122
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,270
So again this is an abstraction.

123
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,140
Now typically for most students just seeing a chart like this is a little confusing and it's hard to

124
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,450
connect this chart to the chart we saw earlier over here.

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,020
So we're going to do is actually plot them on top of each other.

126
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,310
And then I think you'll make it really clear what the continuous features object is actually doing.

127
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,330
So we're going to do is we're going to come back up here to where we said ngi consecutive contract volume

128
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,660
copy this come down here and we're going to pace that again.

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,610
Remember this is consecutive not continuous.

130
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,890
We have the same contracts but what we're going to do is at the same time period that we had heard this

131
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,310
continuous object which was 2016 10 1 for our starting date here we started a little bit earlier.

132
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,820
So basically we just have to do is switch out this one date.

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,710
OK so now I have the consecutive contracts of individual contracts that go from October 2016 to August

134
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,220
2017.

135
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,020
My continuous values also go for that same amount.

136
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,240
Let's go ahead and plot them on top of each other to see how this works.

137
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,450
And Renie's a little bit of kind of map plus lib tricks here.

138
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:50,140
So I'm going to say OK my continuous active natural gas.

139
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,420
I'm going to save volume and then I'm going to plot this out and I'm going to say the line style is

140
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,650
a dash line going say the color is black I believe is the single letter code for that.

141
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,560
And let's go ahead and make the line with that a little thicker like three.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,690
So if I plot that out I essentially get the same plot I did before.

143
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,080
It's this plot right here except it has a little bit of different styling.

144
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,400
Now the reason I kind of wanted the different styling and the make this just a little thinner is because

145
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm going to plot this chart on top of what we saw earlier which was this chart and you're going to

146
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,380
see now how the roll over kind of takes effect.

147
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,850
So let's go ahead and do that.

148
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,260
The way I can do this of PANDAS is I'm going to grab my consecutive contract volume.

149
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,400
That's the one I just created a peer.

150
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm going to then plot it out and I'm going to set the access equal to the axes I just created.

151
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,550
So that's why I assigned this to A-X.

152
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,660
That way I can plot these two pandas plots on top of each other.

153
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,990
So I'm going to run this.

154
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,370
And now you're going to see the behavior.

155
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,280
So no here I have my blackline that's my continuous abstraction over this.

156
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,380
And then eventually it's going to line up exactly with the kind of most volume traded for any features

157
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,720
of that particular point in time.

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,800
And then you can see where the rollover occurs.

159
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,440
Right here we switched based on volume to the next fut. volume.

160
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,890
And this kind of gives you it continuous substraction over what's going on.

161
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,810
OK.

162
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,140
So I hope that made it a little clearer and you can kind of play around with this if it's you know if

163
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,210
you prefer kind of a thicker line with so you can really see where it's kind of above everything you

164
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,030
can do that as well.

165
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,720
You can essentially see how it's rolling over based on volume from one contract to the next.

166
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,960
So it gives you a better idea of some sort of continuous value for natural gas over time and sort of

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,930
his individual futures contracts.

168
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,250
And then we can kind of show the same plot for pricing so an issue with that looks like right now we

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,510
have Engy consecutive contract volume it just grabbed the volume field.

170
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm going to copy this paste it down here.

171
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,300
But instead of volume we're going to grab price.

172
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,370
So I'll change that to consecutive contract price change this field.

173
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,130
So the price that I'm going to run that and then later make sure I have those fields as well in my continuous

174
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,510
active.

175
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,630
So looking over here it's continuous active.

176
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,050
It looks like it has everything I need the contract price volume for the same time stamp so that should

177
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,650
be good.

178
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:30,450
So I'll come back over here and I'm going to first plug out the consecutive so we can see those prices.

179
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,190
OK so remember these are my consecutive individual features.

180
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,690
So I can see the prices for those for whatever unit of natural gas as time goes on and you can see as

181
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,590
they reach maturity date eventually they have no pricing information.

182
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,810
So this one expires in March and April and expires in May.

183
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,090
This expires in June or maybe keeps going.

184
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,680
Et cetera.

185
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,990
But you can see here how they kind of each dieoff their maturity date.

186
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,230
So now let's go ahead and show you what this looks like for the continuous versus the consecutive.

187
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,860
So I grabbed my continuous fut. object.

188
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,910
I believe it's called continuous active you grabbed the price in column off of that and then I'm going

189
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,000
to plot out.

190
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,310
Let's go ahead to make the color black again.

191
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:19,500
And make the line with equal to 3 and you can see here I kind of have a continuous representation of

192
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,980
that.

193
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,300
Similar to what we saw for the volume.

194
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,720
However you'll notice that this sort of represents the underlying commodity natural gas on the most

195
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,110
actively traded contract at this particular point in time.

196
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,330
So this is much easier to look at for pricing information versus like all these prices especially if

197
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,800
you're kind of looking at a time stamp where you have multiple contracts being traded at any given point

198
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,850
in time.

199
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,970
Now here's the thing you'll notice here on the Y-axis that we our values go from like 3.0 to 3.6.

200
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,120
And when I plotted out continuously It now starts at 4.0 4.5 for that same time stamp.

201
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,180
So the best way to explain this as why there is that reference is to plot the price history of the unadjusted

202
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,530
continuous feature.

203
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,550
So here we have some sort of adjustment being taken place which is why we're kind of getting a different

204
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,380
price here.

205
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,610
So we'll show you the unadjusted version of this.

206
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:22,820
So I would say continuous natural gas unadjusted is equal to I'm going to use that same continuous future

207
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,350
function.

208
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,960
So when we imported pass a natural gas pass and the offset is equal to zero.

209
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,380
I'm also going to roll off volume again.

210
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,380
The other option was to roll off calendar which basically rolls off when the calendar switches over.

211
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,610
And then for the adjustment I previously did m u l for multiplicative and specifically type and none

212
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,870
no.

213
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,730
So there is no adjustment.

214
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:55,620
And then I'm going to do the same thing for history so I'm going to say grab this and then replace Engy

215
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,770
contracts with continuous ngi unadjusted because I want the unadjusted features.

216
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,460
Same field so actually that person contract as well.

217
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,050
So we can see how the contracts change see contracts and price for these fields.

218
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,920
And now let's call this something else.

219
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:20,260
This is going to be my on adjusted history.

220
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,950
So now I have my natural gas it's unadjusted history.

221
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:30,530
So if I take a look at the head of this data frame unadjusted history I can see here I have the price

222
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,980
and the particular contract that's being referenced as kind of the main contract at that point in time.

223
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:46,490
So now if I plot the sell natural gas and a just that history and I plot out that price I can see here

224
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,890
now with no adjustments.

225
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,360
It pretty much matches up with what we saw appear as far as the range.

226
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,430
So then I'm going to do this as well for the original on that well we can have them kind of back to

227
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:00,800
back.

228
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,270
Let me come up here and copy this.

229
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
So again this is the unadjusted plot.

230
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,300
And then these are the consecutive ones so we can see here.

231
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,320
So the unadjusted one remember it's being figured by volume.

232
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,420
So we can do is to kind of plot these two on top of each other.

233
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,520
We can use what's known as a pivot table trick.

234
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,820
Don't worry too much about understanding the logic behind the pivot table.

235
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,230
There's more of kind of an advanced panderers thing but essentially it's just going to allow us to kind

236
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,120
of create a nice chart for you.

237
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,890
So let's go ahead and explore that.

238
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:40,700
So I'm going to say pivot on an A just as equal to the unadjusted history object that just made that

239
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,690
data frame and I'm going to pivot it.

240
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,560
The index is going to be the same index unadjusted history the index of that data frame.

241
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,400
But I'm going to make the columns equal to the contract.

242
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,090
So let me show you actually happened here with that pivot first kind of remind you what the undigested

243
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,030
version looks like.

244
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,970
So we see this unadjusted version it has a price column and a contract's column here.

245
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,290
What I'm going to do is make these particular individual contracts kind of group them together and pivot

246
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,790
this.

247
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,470
So each individual contract ends up becoming a column.

248
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,380
So if we show you what the pivoted version of this is just it looks like I'll show you the head of it

249
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,300
I can see now I have these price columns and each of these represents a feature and at certain points

250
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,640
in time some of these features don't really exist yet or they're not being traded.

251
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,750
So the future for kind of something in 2017 in October 2016 it doesn't have any volume being traded

252
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,760
or doesn't really have any pricing information for etc. so you can see this one is going to come up

253
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,710
and then they'll die off and then these will start kicking in.

254
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,660
So let's go ahead and plot this so you can see what that looks like.

255
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,630
And again you can always copy and paste from the notes.

256
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,220
I know I'm writing a lot of code here.

257
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,310
But here we're going to essentially plot the prices and you kind of see them jump from one to the other.

258
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,040
So here's kind of the current price for that contract that it jumps to the next one.

259
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,310
Based on volume that adjusts the next pricing that interrupts next pricing pricing jumps and you can

260
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,380
see here its price is jumping from contract to contract.

261
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,470
So these are the actual individual features.

262
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,210
So let's show you the unadjusted so we can kind of plot it on top.

263
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,380
So I will copy and paste this.

264
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,890
We're essentially going to be doing the same thing we did earlier.

265
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,830
So here's the unadjusted plots of the individual ones.

266
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:38,960
And let's get our unadjusted history and plot that out and say access to access are there on top of

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,780
each other.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Well is it the lifestyle to be a dash line and will that color to be black we will run this.

269
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,480
And now I can kind of see what's happening here.

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,250
So this unadjusted history price if we do no adjustments it's essentially just falling along based on

271
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,560
volume pricing.

272
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,340
It should go based on the individual contracts.

273
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,960
So that's the relationship between what is essentially this plot and these plots.

274
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,760
Except this is a kind of messy to look at.

275
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,050
So we can use that pivot table so we can see based on the highest volume being traded What was that

276
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,060
price as we jump.

277
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,190
Contract contract which is essentially what the unadjusted history is doing.

278
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,670
Now typically you will use some adjustment you're not going to use unadjusted.

279
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,870
And there's two main types of adjustments.

280
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:30,530
It's multiplicative or earth Medich which is just adding an emule for the multiplicative technique.

281
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,270
This essentially computes the adjustment as a ratio of the new contract price divided by the old contract

282
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,010
price whenever the active contract rolls to a new contract.

283
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,420
So that adjustment does again again it's a new contract price divided by the old contract price.

284
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,250
Whenever you decide to roll to the new one either you decide to roll based off the calendar or we decide

285
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,490
to roll based on the volume.

286
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,310
And I would say volume is more common than calendar rollovers but again it really depends on your specific

287
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,500
situation.

288
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:05,370
The arithmetic technique or the adding adjustment type is just going to adjust with new contract price

289
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,400
minus old contract price.

290
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,630
So then multiplicative new contract price divided by old contract price when you roll over additive

291
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,510
technique is just new contract price minus the old contract price.

292
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,870
When you roll over Ok I hope that was a bunch of useful information on Quanto Appian futures for you.
