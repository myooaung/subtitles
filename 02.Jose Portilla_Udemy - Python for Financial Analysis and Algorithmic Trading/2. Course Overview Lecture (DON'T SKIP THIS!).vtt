00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.970
I have you on take so much for enrolling in the course.

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.890
I have a favor to ask of you please don't skip this course overview lecture and watch it in its entirety

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.660
we'll go over just a few key things so help you get the most out of this course as well as point out

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.660
where to find things like the class notes.

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.070
OK.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.710
Let's get started.

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.530
Welcome to the Course everyone.

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.560
As I mentioned in this lecture we're going to quickly cover some frequently asked questions and what

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.340
to expect during the course.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.590
Let's go ahead and discuss a few things that will help give you the best possible course experience

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.700
as a quick note no lectures can be sped up to your liking.

12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.160
Up to two time speed and they can also be viewed at a higher quality.

13
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.980
If you think you're getting a lower quality.

14
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.810
Go ahead and click on the settings icon where you can adjust the video playback quality.

15
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.220
Let's quickly know who this course is for and what does it cover.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.310
This course is well-suited for someone that has experience of programming preferably Python but we do

17
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.170
have the quick Python crash course.

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.120
It's not meant to be a complete overview of the Python programming language.

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.240
Hopefully you're also interested in using Python for finance and algorithmic trading because that's

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.730
what the second half of the course really focuses on.

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.340
If you clicked on this course but you're interested in just general data science or machine learning

22
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.740
Python you should probably check out my other course Python for data science and machine learning bootcamp

23
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.640
that might be a better fit for you if you're just interested in those two main topics.

24
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.550
While this course does cover some libraries that overlap topics in data science with python we really

25
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.950
focus here on using those key libraries for financial analysis.

26
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.320
So this course is ideal for students who have some python knowledge and are interested in finance topics.

27
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.050
A few more things before we get started.

28
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.360
This Course uses Anaconda and a Jupiter notebook system.

29
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.650
If you have your own preferences and or a more advanced user of Python or already have it installed

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.140
in your computer please feel free to choose any environment you prefer.

31
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.470
The course notes have been provided as a zip file containing all the Python or Jupiter notebook files.

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.270
Those IPY in the essential files used during the course.

33
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.660
You can easily use the any kind of library available freely online to convert them to a variety of formats.

34
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.530
The slide shown in the course are also linked to as a resource in their respective lecturers.

35
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.680
They are hosted as Google slides so you can just visit online to see any updates.

36
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.680
Let's quickly discuss what's the best way to get help during the course.

37
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.670
Remember to double check that your code matches the notebooks exactly the code provided in the notebooks

38
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.810
is guaranteed to work if you're using the provided environment file.

39
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.140
They've all been tested against the current environment file that we provide so please make sure to

40
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.750
run the provided notebooks first before posting a question.

41
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.370
It will save you a lot of time and a lot of frustration.

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.430
If you still have a question it's no problem.

43
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.570
Just post your questions to the Q&amp;A forums inside the course.

44
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.840
Please remember to give as much detail as possible including what you've tried and what resources or

45
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.430
links you've already seen.

46
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.930
Remember to search the Kewaunee forums for previous similar questions to save yourself additional time

47
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.800
after completing the course.

48
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.210
You will receive the ability to get a certificate of completion if you have any issues regarding the

49
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.500
certificate please contact support me that COM and they'll be happy to help you out.

50
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.160
If you're experiencing any technical platform issues such as slow video playback or weird site bugs

51
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.290
you can also contact support or you to me dot com and they can help you out of those issues.

52
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.620
And last but not least I just want to thank you so much for enrolling in this course and I'm really

53
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.880
excited to get started.

54
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.260
I'll see you at the next lecture.
