Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on e ts models as a quick note for the next few lectures

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,370
we're going to be discussing topics conceptually in slides.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,690
Then afterwards we're going to revisit these topics using Python and stat's models to actually code

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
through them.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,310
So what doesn't an ETF model any TS model stands for error trend and seasonality and exponential smoothing

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,590
trend methods models and IATSE composition are all related to this general idea of an ETF model.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,500
So we're going to be working on several of these using the python stats models library but let's discuss

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,860
a little bit more about the error trend and seasonality components of a time series dataset.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,230
So yes or error trend and seasonality models will take each of those terms for smoothing purposes and

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,830
they may add them multiply them or even just leave some of them out.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,380
So when you're working of a time series dataset you'll have an error term a trend term and a seasonality

12
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,920
term and based off these key factors we can try to create a model to fit our data.

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,560
So let's discuss how we can actually break down a time series into each of those terms.

14
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,990
So each time series the composition with us is a method of actually breaking down a time series into

15
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,380
those terms and visualizing the data based off its the composition is a good way to build an understanding

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,640
of its behavior.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,710
Basically what we're going to be doing is taking a silent time series and then breaking it up into these

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,490
three main factors the error the trend and the seasonality components.

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,770
So it is the decomposition actually look like when you plot this out.

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,910
Well we'll start off with a dataset called the airline passengers data set.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,170
It's kind of the famous data set when dealing with time series data.

22
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:57,020
Now we can see here on the x axis we have some months so we say from January 1949 all the way up to

23
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,930
September 1960.

24
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:05,090
We can see how many thousands of passengers were taking trips on an airplane or airline travel in general

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,210
and in general we can see that there is an upward trend which makes sense from 1949 up to 1960s.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,960
Airline travel began to modernize and thus more people began to actually take these flights.

27
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,910
Also we see there's a little bit of a seasonality to it.

28
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,280
There's kind of peaks and valleys happening right about every year.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,650
That's probably due to people traveling during the summer and then not traveling so much during the

30
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,310
winter.

31
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,010
And you can see some smaller peaks and those may actually have to do if like winter holidays.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,830
So what we see here is the visualization of TSD composition at the top we have the observed values.

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,560
Those are the actual data points of our time series.

34
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,150
So we stretched out the x axis a little bit.

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,730
But keep in mind that top plot that says observe that's the exact same plot that we saw earlier here.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,400
It's just stretched out a little more.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
So we can see the seasonality it's a little bit stretched out.

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,920
And then we can all see the general trend what the composition allows us to do is to actually exclusively

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,250
grab those specific terms or attributes of our time series.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,790
So using Stets models we can perform a test composition and grab for instance right below the observed

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,620
values we see the general trend.

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,350
And that allows us to clearly see visually that there's a clear upward trend certain time series aren't

43
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,590
as obvious as the one airline passengers were the trend.

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,400
So doing is it.

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes the composition can clearly show us that yes or is some sort of upward trend here and then we can

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,190
break and exclusively get the seasonality term or the seasonal term here and we can see that.

47
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,950
Yes in fact there is a seasonal term and it seems to be really repetitive which is good for us because

48
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,820
that's what we suspected and then we get the final residual term.

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,350
So that's kind of the error term that's not explained by the seasonal term or the trend term.

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,410
So time series decomposition with us is a very useful tool and we're going to be discussing it a lot

51
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,540
more when we reach Arema models.

52
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,630
For now we're going to kind of put this on hold and actually go to E.W. a models are exponentially weighted

53
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,180
moving average models.

54
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:07,070
So keep in mind that this idea that we can decompose a time series into a trend a seasonality term in

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,210
an era term or residual term exists.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,140
We'll revisit it later on.

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's go ahead and talk about the male models.

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,700
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
