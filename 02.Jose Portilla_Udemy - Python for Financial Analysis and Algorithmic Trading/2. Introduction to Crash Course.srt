Hello everyone and welcome to the first section of the course which is the python crash course before

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,450
we get started.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,340
The rest of the course what we're going to do is have a quick review of how to work with Python.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,520
If you already know Python you can feel free to skip this section.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,470
Keep in mind that this section is not meant to be a complete comprehensive review of Python.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,160
Instead what it's meant to be is just a quick overview of how to use Python.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,120
If you're completely new to programming in general this is probably not a best fit for you.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,440
If you've programmed in another language extensively and you just want to quickly get around to learning

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,510
how to use Python syntax or fi's Python a while ago and just need a quick refresher then this is the

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,510
right course for you.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,140
So we're going to be using a Jupiter notebook environment for the majority of this course but please

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,170
feel free to use any development environment or ID that you prefer for Python whether it be a text editor

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,790
like Adam text editor or sublime text editor or the full blown I-T like pite charm.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,170
Everything we do here is going to work in any I-T each choose.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,760
After this quick crash course you're going to have an exercise no book for a few tasks to go through.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,140
Then after that we'll go through the solutions book OK.

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,950
Let's get started.

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,810
By opening up the python crash course notebook and then going through and reviewing Python I'll see

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,850
you at the next lecture.
