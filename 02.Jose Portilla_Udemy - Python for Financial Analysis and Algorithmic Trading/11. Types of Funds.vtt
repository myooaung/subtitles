00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.890
Welcome you on this lecture we're going to be discussing the different types of funds essentially there

2
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.900
are three major fund types.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.760
There are ifs or exchange traded funds.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.110
Then there are mutual funds and then there are hedge funds.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.530
These funds vary by fees transparency regulation and more.

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.870
Let's go ahead and discuss our differences.

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.350
ETF or exchange traded funds are constituted of a basket of funds bonds commodities securities etc.

8
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.290
and their actual holdings and what they are made up of are completely public and transparent and individuals

9
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.850
can buy and trade the marketable securities just as if there were a normal security.

10
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.400
So you can see here that we already have a lot of transparency of what actually constitutes DTA.

11
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.540
And we also have a lot of what's known as liquidity meaning we can easily buy and sell these ETF typically

12
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.300
people invest in an ETF or more interested in having a diversified portfolio and want to keep their

13
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.090
investment in an ETF for a longer period of time.

14
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.060
So it's very common for 401 ks to happen to be put into an ETF.

15
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.100
One of the most common ETF is spider or Espey Y which essentially tracks the S&amp;P 500.

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.110
Let's move on to mutual funds.

17
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.780
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for

18
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.720
the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks bonds money market instruments and similar assets

19
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.400
mutual funds are operated by money managers who invest the funds capital and attempt to produce capital

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.650
gains in income for the funds investors a mutual funds portfolio is structured and maintained to match

21
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.850
the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.

22
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.810
Mutual funds usually have to disclose their holdings.

23
00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.650
Typically once a quarter although this can vary by fund hedge funds are alternative investments using

24
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.830
pooled funds that employ numerous different strategies to earn active return what they call alpha for

25
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.900
their investors.

26
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.620
Hedge funds may be aggressively managed or make use of derivatives and leverage in both domestic and

27
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.680
international markets with the goal of generating very high returns either in an absolute sense or over

28
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.940
a specified market benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500.

29
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.550
So the main goal of a hedge fund is essentially to beat the market or beat the benchmarks.

30
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.420
It's important to note that hedge funds are generally only accessible to our credit investors as they

31
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.280
require less FCC regulations and other funds.

32
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.580
So typically to actually put your money in a hedge fund you have to be a person with a very large amount

33
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.550
of money or have very good connections the people involved in those hedge funds.

34
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.070
One aspect that has set the hedge fund industry apart is the fact that hedge funds face less regulation

35
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.400
than mutual funds and other investment vehicles like ETF.

36
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.760
Much of what we do in this course mimics the way a hedge fund would operate.

37
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.560
We're going to end up trying to do is to use Python math to attempt to beat some sort of benchmark.

38
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.330
Typically the S&amp;P 500.

39
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.100
We also won't need to disclose our own strategies.

40
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.020
So let's go ahead and discuss the fee structure for these three fund types.

41
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.100
So what are the fees associated with each fund the type.

42
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.850
Well for ETF funds usually have something known as an expense ratio where you end up paying something

43
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.000
of between 0.01 percent and all the way to 1 percent.

44
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.450
Or if you end up going beyond 1 percent that's usually kind of expensive for an ETF but it does exist

45
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.210
and that essentially is just a percentage of what's known as a U-M are assets under management.

46
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.990
Then you have mutual funds and they also operate with an expense ratio.

47
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.460
And typically they're a little higher.

48
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.950
There's something like 0.5 all the way up to around 3 percent maybe even 4 percent depending on what

49
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.390
the mutual fund is.

50
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.930
And then you have hedge funds so hedge funds operate a 2 percent fund and 20 percent of profits is sometimes

51
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.670
known as a 2 and 20 rule.

52
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.430
So basically what happens is a hedge fund will end up taking as their fee 2 percent of them are assets

53
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.030
under management and then 20 percent of the profits.

54
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.120
Now this has changed recently as ETF have become more successful with the market doing very well in

55
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.530
the past couple of years.

56
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.720
So hedge funds sometimes are bring it down to maybe like 1 percent and 10 percent of profits so they

57
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.660
have like a one in 10 rule or maybe even go higher if they're a very successful hedge fund.

58
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.770
It really depends on this because there are essentially no real rules that they have to follow the classic

59
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.480
rule though it's called 2.20 and that's what it stands for 2 percent of the fund and 20 percent of the

60
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.240
profits.

61
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.720
Now what is the actual liquidity.

62
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.520
With each fund type that is how easy is it to get your money in and out.

63
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.440
So ETF funds you can buy and sell them just like a normal stock for mutual funds.

64
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.690
It's a little stricter.

65
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.520
Typically though you could buy and sell them at the end of each day through some sort of broker and

66
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.070
then the last one is hedge funds which have kind of the quote worst liquidity of them all.

67
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.560
So hedge funds it really depends on your particular agreement with the hedge fund hedge funds sometimes

68
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.060
you make an agreement with them where you can't pull out your money within the first six months or you

69
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.040
have a six month drawdown period.

70
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.840
So if you say you want to pull out your money you have to give them six months to kind of move things

71
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.490
around in order to get you back your money and hedge funds remember they don't even really need to disclose

72
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.060
what they're doing not just to the public but even to their own clients.

73
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.160
So certain hedge funds you give them your money and they won't even disclose to you as an investor what

74
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.900
they're actually doing with that money.

75
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.050
So that's all we really need to know about the basics of the different fund types.

76
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.910
Like I mentioned we're going to be pretending we're our own hedge fund where we're kind of using math

77
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.030
and algorithms in Python to take some sort of money just made up investor money or own money and then

78
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.990
play around Fit see if we can beat these benchmarks.

79
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.410
So up next we're going to do is we're going to discuss what actually happens when we send a buy or sell

80
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.500
order for the stock on the exchanges.

81
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.270
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
