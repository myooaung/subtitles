00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,050
Hello everyone and welcome to part two of your first training algorithm.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,690
Let's go ahead and actually implement what we discussed in the research note books in Quanto.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,470
Id and hop over to Quanto Penn Dot Com and get started.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,050
OK.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,800
Here we are.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,200
Quanto paeans ID and the first thing to do is important umpires MP because we'll be using that later

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,960
on.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,900
And then let's find out the steps we want to do.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,340
So first off we're going to need to initialize everything inside of this.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,070
We're going to need to schedule one of our functions and the function we're going to schedule is essentially

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,830
going to be our what we'll call a check pares function and this chick Paris function is essentially

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,400
going to implement in the Ideally everything we discussed there in the research lecture for the notebooks.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,830
So we're going to do things like calculate the 30 day moving average get the 30 day standard deviation

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,140
get the one day moving average compute the z score and then we're going to have essentially two and

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,130
three cases.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,530
So let's go ahead and try this all out.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,220
So we'll start off initialize because that's pretty easy.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:18,580
We'll set up T.F. initialize context and remember this is called only once at the start of the algorithm.

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,190
So we're going to have insight of this is a schedule function and leave it blank for now because we

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,510
haven't actually created the check appears function that we're going to end up scheduling but for now

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,290
we can just say check pairs and check pairs is going to take in context and data.

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,860
Remember if you're going to schedule a function it's going to need to take in those two arguments and

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,850
more likely than not you'll be using those two arguments in some capacity.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,990
But there's our schedule function and then later on what we're going to do is we're going to say context

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,380
American Airlines and get the security I.D. for that.

26
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:58,310
So if you start typing American Airlines You should see A-L.

27
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,070
And then for United Airlines will say contex thought you A-L and that stock ticker it's basically a

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,120
holding group so you can say whale.

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,990
And it should eventually find it for you.

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,440
If not we can search for you AOL.

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,200
And there it is.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,590
United Continental holdings.

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,340
That's the company we're looking for and all this code is available to you in the notebook.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,070
In case you need a copy and paste it and then offer this initialize.

35
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,440
We're also going to have two more flags.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:34,360
So these are going to be called long on the spread and that will set that equal to false.

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,660
And then we're going to have another one called shorting spread and also equal to false and it'll become

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,490
more clear and just a little bit how we're going to use these to basically flags or checks.

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,610
So let's go ahead and grab everything we're going to be needing to compute the score because basically

40
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,440
our whole strategy is based off to the score here.

41
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,680
So one thing I'm going to do for convenience is instead of having to call context thought a context

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:12,100
thought all the time I will say ha equal to contex thought AA and I was able to contex thought well

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,380
that way this context.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,040
AA which remember it's just a security ID for American Airlines is now set to the variable AAA instead

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:28,390
of this check pares function and now we're going to do is get the pricing history so I'm going to say

46
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:38,630
prices is equal to data call history off of this and I to pass into assets AAA el.

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:47,590
And then I just want the basically the price and I'm going to grab 30 days of price information and

48
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:55,260
because I want it daily I will say one the and then off this price Remember this is a data frame and

49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,730
if you wanted to you could print this out and check what it looks like but it's essentially just the

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,750
data frame.

51
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,820
So I can do the following I'm going to say short prices is equal to prices.

52
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:16,740
I see negative one colon and that basically Razmi the prices for American Airlines and United Airlines

53
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,540
at the current time stamp in my back test.

54
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,740
And then we need to get them moving the 30 day moving average.

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:32,440
So say moving average 330 days one way to do this is to just say I mean grabbed the average.

56
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,950
I remember actually want this to be the spread.

57
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,750
So we make sure that's clear everything is in the context of the spread between both of these.

58
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:49,930
So I want them 30 day moving average of the spread and I will say prices American Airlines minus ups

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,210
prices of United Airlines.

60
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,180
So those two security IDs.

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,690
So that's my 30 day moving average of the spread.

62
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,750
I want to get the same thing for the stair deviation over 30 days.

63
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:10,170
So I'll say SDD 30 and the deviation and we'll say prices.

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:19,350
American Airlines prices United Airlines and then the last thing I want is basically the one day moving

65
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,890
average.

66
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,680
So the current price of the spread and I will say moving average of one is just equal to P..

67
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,980
I mean we're using this notation so it matches up with the notebooks that we discussed earlier.

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,650
And grab a short prices.

69
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,850
American Airlines minus short prices.

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,410
United Airlines.

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,630
And if you ever have any questions of what is prices or what is short prices what does moving average

72
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,590
or what is standard deviation.

73
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,910
The quickest way to get the answer that is just printed out and then check the log.

74
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,870
So if you're ever unclear with any of these variables are just go ahead and print them out run them

75
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,090
and the logs will tell you what they are.

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,620
OK so we have everything we need for the spread.

77
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:08,240
Now let's begin computing the z score so I'll start off I'm going to say if stere deviation of the past

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,040
three days is greater than zero which means now I have three days worth of information.

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:26,950
I will do the following I'll say the score is equal to the moving average one minus moving average 30

80
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,970
divided by a C the 30 number that was the same.

81
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,090
These were calculation we just did in those no books before.

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,320
And then we're going to have two entry cases.

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:43,000
So one of the entry cases is when our z score threshold has been topped over.

84
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,850
So that means the spread is currently above our z score threshold.

85
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,430
The second case will be when our spread is below the normalized threshold.

86
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,020
So let's go ahead and choose some arbitrary threshold values when we were planning it up previously

87
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,860
we chose one point zero.

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,470
And you can kind of imagine that the higher your threshold.

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,890
It means it's a little less risky because it's unlikely to peak or go below those threshold values.

90
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:19,530
So I will say if my z score is greater than 0.5 so is my ruling a z score is greater than 0.5 and I'm

91
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:26,260
currently not contex thought shorting the spread I will do the following.

92
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:34,490
Remember that the spread is equal to American Airlines price minus United Airlines price.

93
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,810
So if my spread if my currency score is above 0.5 then I believe that American Airlines is currently

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,470
overvalued and will eventually regress down to the mean.

95
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,920
So what I will do here is I will say Order target percent's and I'm actually going to shorts.

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,190
American Airlines.

97
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,240
Now this is a pretty aggressive strategy.

98
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,560
So keep that in mind but it works far kind of simplified version of thinking about things.

99
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,690
And then for United Airlines all go along on it.

100
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,520
So let's kind of look at the logic here.

101
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm saying OK in my ruling the score has now reached this particular limit 0.5.

102
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,240
And in the previous plots in the last lecture it was one point zero.

103
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,020
Whatever you want it to be is kind of fine you can test out different ones see what works better for

104
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,880
you.

105
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,070
So right now my score has breached this arbitrary value that I chose and I'm currently not shorting

106
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,070
the spread.

107
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,590
So does that mean that I'm going to say OK if my spreads American Airlines minus United Airlines then

108
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,220
I believe the American Airlines are going to come down in price so I will.

109
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,370
Short American Airlines and I believe United Airlines is going to continue so we'll say long on that

110
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,810
and then I'll do the following.

111
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,480
So I want to make sure that my algorithm is aware that I'm currently shorting the spread.

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,120
So I will say that shorting spread equal to true and in case I was going previously long on the spread

113
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,170
I want to set that now equal to false.

114
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,870
OK so that's one of the things we're going to check.

115
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:09,650
Then I'm going to check another condition and that's going to be if my score is now less than 1.0 and

116
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,150
I'm not currently long on the spread

117
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,320
I will do the following.

118
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,110
So it's a couple more lines here.

119
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,960
So this is essentially the opposite entry condition.

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,540
So remember now American Airlines is supposedly undervalued.

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,070
So I would believe that I should go do the opposite.

122
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:39,970
Go long on American and then order target percents and go shorts on United Airlines

123
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,820
because I believe that United Airlines is overvalued.

124
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,720
So that's causing a big subtraction for American Airlines causing the spread to go down.

125
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,060
And then ingoing those context variables here.

126
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,400
So we'll say I'm not sure in the spread.

127
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:07,470
Set that equals false and I'm currently long on spread so that equal to true so setting this context

128
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,890
long on spreads equal to true.

129
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,370
It makes sure what it does is it makes sure that I'm not already going to continually execute this.

130
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,310
So I'm only going to execute this once the score is less than one point zero and I'm checking for the

131
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,830
long odds spread so I don't do this over and over again I just do it once.

132
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,730
What is it.

133
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,770
And then I need to exit out of the positions so it's exit out of the positions.

134
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:39,090
We're going to need some sort of kind of minor threshold and we'll say the absolute value of the z score.

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,210
0.1 or something like that.

136
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,520
Kind of a smaller value.

137
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,990
So once the absolute value of that Rollings z score has become less than 0.1 which means we're kind

138
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,160
of basically hovering around zero.

139
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,700
I will exit my positions.

140
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,800
So say Order target percents get rid of all my American airline stock.

141
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,820
Turn it back into cash and then in order orders target percents get rid of all my United Airlines stock

142
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,270
as well and then I'm going to reset these contacts.

143
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:26,710
So shorting spread is going to be false as well as context long on spread is equal to false and then

144
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,640
off of all this.

145
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,270
Let's just go ahead and have record here.

146
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,960
So it might be nice to record some of this.

147
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,690
So I'm going to record the z score.

148
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,300
So we'll say something like z score ups and set that equal to the actual z score.

149
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,920
So again this is just going to record the z score as we go throughout time.

150
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,820
And you can record kind of whatever you want.

151
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,280
You could technically record the prices etc..

152
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,720
The moving average any amounts you really want to record and see plots for.

153
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,960
You can do that as well.

154
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,730
OK.

155
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,330
So there's our actual check pairs function.

156
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,530
The next we have to do is schedule it.

157
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,800
So let's go ahead and do that.

158
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:13,310
So we're going to schedule this function and let's have it the calls will say check pares passes some

159
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,870
rules and it's going to happen every day.

160
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,710
And let's make sure that's a thought not comma.

161
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,220
It's already said Make it happen every day.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:31,110
And as far as time rules are concerned let's just go ahead and have it be done at market close and let's

163
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,700
have it be done.

164
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,960
Should we begin executing it like 60 minutes before the market closes I could have just one hour.

165
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Either way is fine.

166
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,050
All right.

167
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,940
So that should be it for our overall strategy.

168
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,960
Let's quickly review what's happening here.

169
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,180
I'm grabbing American airline stock United Airlines stock.

170
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,380
The security IDs and I'm sitting along on spread false and shorting spread false and then I'm going

171
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,550
to schedule this check pairs to happen at the essentially at the end of every day.

172
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,370
We'll make sure that time rules.

173
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,410
That's right rules.

174
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,320
And then 60 Minutes for the market closes I'm going to check the pairs.

175
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,620
So what does that actually do.

176
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:11,760
Well again to have American Airlines United Airlines are going to grab the previous 30 days of history.

177
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,120
I have my short prices was sincerely just today's prices that I have my 30 day moving average sarod

178
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,740
deviation of the last 30 days and then essentially my current spread.

179
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,400
So I have spread over three days straight deviation and spread over three days and then my current spread

180
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,720
and we're reusing and that means so kind of goes along.

181
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,010
What we did in the previous lecture and once I have 30 days of information than my standard deviation

182
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
will be above zero.

183
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,290
And then I can calculate the score.

184
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,900
So I will say hey I'm moving average today minus moving average of the past three days divided by the

185
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,010
start of the nation or Thursday days so I'm normalizing the amounts.

186
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,090
Then we're going to say the following.

187
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,210
If my score is above one point zero and I'm not currently shorting the spread I'm going to short American

188
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,110
Airlines because I think it's overvalued because it's above that z score threshold and I'm going to

189
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,840
stay long the United Airlines then I'm going to say hey I'm currently shorting the spread.

190
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,730
So don't keep repeating this if statement and then I'm saying I'm no longer long on the spread.

191
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,110
However we have the opposite case which means I think United Airlines or valued because it's taking

192
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,880
away too much from that spread to say hey Mazi scores less than 1.0.

193
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,250
And I'm not crawling along on the spread go long and American and start shorting United Airlines stock

194
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,130
because I think it's going to come down soon.

195
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,100
Then again I say I'm not shorting the spread I'm currently long on the spread else and this is essentially

196
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,580
how we actually get out of these positions so how we exit these positions and we say if we finally are

197
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,530
hovering around zero.

198
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:43,150
So if the absolute Mazi score is somewhere between world the score somewhere between zero point one

199
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,090
a negative point one then it's reset these to be zero and am currently no longer shorting or going long

200
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,930
enough spread and I'm going to record the z score as we go along.

201
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,200
So let's try this out.

202
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,750
What I always recommend is just trying this out on essentially just a few weeks of data to make sure

203
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,610
there are no errors here so let's quickly build this algorithm or it looks like I got an error line

204
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,700
44 invalid syntax so if I take a look at that it looks like axially else here.

205
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,330
This should be if the reason for that is because I'm actually checking on condition or Imber else statements

206
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,730
don't check on the condition.

207
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,740
So that should have been Elif we technically could add an else here that says pass or something but

208
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,070
we don't really need it.

209
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,510
So once that saved let's try building this algorithm again see if we get any other errors.

210
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,720
It looks like we don't have any runtime error so we're just producing those logs and it looks like we

211
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,890
actually generated something so over 1 week we got pretty bad returns.

212
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,100
Let's go ahead and try this over two years and see how it performs.

213
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,910
So we'll build the algorithm again and let it run.

214
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,690
I'm going to hop forward in time until this is done backtesting this particular algorithm shouldn't

215
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,900
actually take that long to back test because most of the time we're not going to be actually ordering

216
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,640
something and we're not ordering something every minute.

217
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,470
In fact it just finished by the time I'm done talking so we could see here that the returns were actually

218
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,350
negative for us and we performed way worse than the index.

219
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,770
But hopefully you can see here how we were actually able to implement a particular strategy of ours.

220
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,510
So again not a good strategy overall but the implementation was the important part here to understand.

221
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,480
So we successfully imported a very simplified version of our strategy.

222
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,040
If you have any questions make sure check up the notes for this.

223
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,670
If you've got an error or something or got a bug go ahead or just copy and paste from notes make sure

224
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,110
it matches exactly as shown there.

225
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,590
But hopefully now you have a basic understanding of how you can create your own trading algorithms and

226
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,290
implement them in Quanto Appian.

227
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,860
Because coming up next we're going to give you an idea for a trading algorithm and then your task is

228
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,900
going to be to implement it in the IEEE as an exercise.

229
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,790
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
