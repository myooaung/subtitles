00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,070
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on stock sentiment analysis.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,980
We've currently only looked at numerical data as a trading signal but there's actually a lot more information

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,180
out there in the world and a common source for signal is to use sentiment analysis sentiment analysis

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,460
uses natural language processing to attempt the tech sentiment in some sort of text.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,630
For example if you had the text saying this is bad it's going to fail natural language processing and

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,720
sentiment analysis could say hey this piece of text has a negative sentiment or if you have a piece

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,100
of text that says something like Great job it is a winner.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,900
Again using an LP or natural language processing you'd be able to tell that there's a positive sentiment.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,630
So the actual mechanics behind sentiment analysis algorithms is beyond the scope of this course but

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,060
luckily you can easily obtain positive and negative sentiment scores from negative one to one from a

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,730
variety of source on Quanto Appian.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Keep in mind the sort of data is almost never free.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,600
Quanto Appian does have a free version of sentiment analysis available only for years 2013 through 2015.

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,780
But keep in mind this may change in the future.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,560
So always look at the documentation to see what years are currently available for free and this free

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,020
data is provided by Acer and alpha one and it provides a sentiment score from negative 1 to 1 and an

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,040
impact score from 0 to 100.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,250
So the impact is a measure of how likely a stock price will change as a result of the sentiment according

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,660
to whatever metrics they're measuring this by and in the following lectures we're going to show you

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,230
how to access this free data and set up a trading strategy with it.

21
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,400
So let's go ahead and hop over to Quanto in will jump straight to the ID and code it all out.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
OK so here I am at the Quanto open idea.

23
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,100
The first thing to do is a bunch of imports and we're going to be using a pipeline to actually get our

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,290
sentiment data.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,900
So I'll start off by doing a couple of necessary imports.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,170
So one of them is from Quanto in the algorithm.

27
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:08,530
Import the attached pipeline that we've seen before and then pipeline underscore output that we've also

28
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,430
seen before.

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,180
And then we also some other general pipeline imports to do.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,830
And sometimes you can import these from other places but I'll just do this for now.

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:26,770
We're going to say import pipeline and then we'll see from Quanto up in the pipeline factors in your

32
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,410
average dollar volume okay.

33
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,610
They're going to do is actually import our free data source and that's going to come from Quanto up

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:49,720
in the pipeline data CRN in poor alpha one underscore free.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,520
So keep in mind since we're using the free dataset it's only going to work on particular time periods.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,400
So we'll go over that in a second.

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,860
But right now as far as the time I'm filming this kind of in mid 2017 it's only available for the years

38
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,110
between 2013 2015 they can always check the documentation and that will let you know what's currently

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,440
available for free.

40
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,380
So we're going to do here is as always our initialize function and this takes in context and we're just

41
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,980
going to attach the pipeline and we're going to call make a pipeline which we haven't defined yet but

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,510
we will in just a second and we'll call it just pipeline again kind of call it whatever you want.

43
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,680
Okay.

44
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,410
So we made the pipeline.

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,550
So it's actually.

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,670
So we're going to do in this pipeline function.

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,500
So in this make pipeline function we're going to do a couple of screens here.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,880
Let's go ahead and say dollar volume.

49
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,880
So I'll say out of all the stocks that the average dollar volume

50
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,540
and we're going to give it a window length of let's say 20 days this kind of all just arbitrary and

51
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:11,010
then we're going to the fine is liquid to be dollar volume and we can actually rank these actually actually

52
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,070
let's go ahead and say grab the top 1000.

53
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,610
So that's kind of a quicker way to do this.

54
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,040
Sometimes you also see it done in the following manner just so you know you'll see someone say dollar

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,430
volume of some sort of filter and then they're going to rank them and then they say something like ascending

56
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,150
equals false and then less than 1000.

57
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,490
So this rank is kind of similar to this call where essentially grabs the ranking if you sort them in

58
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,070
descending order or ascending the Pentagon on what you call here and then it just grabs the 1000 of

59
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,440
them.

60
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,240
So we'll just say grab the top 1000.

61
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,120
So this is a top 1000 liquid stocks.

62
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,680
What we can also do is import.

63
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,330
1200 U.S. from before but we're just going to not really focus on that we really want to focus on the

64
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,450
sentiment analysis and how we can do that.

65
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,100
So it's actually quite simple with the pipeline operations.

66
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:12,730
You just say impact is equal to Alpha 1 free and then offer this we're going to call impact score and

67
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,220
the way you know what to call it just looking it up in the documentation.

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,270
So we want the latest impact score from Alpha 1 and we'll set that is impact and then we'll say sentiment's

69
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:31,130
is Alpha 1 free thought and it's called Article sentiments and grab the latest sentiment.

70
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,400
So let us actually do.

71
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,390
Well we go ahead and select the top 1000 based off the average dollar volume of the last 20 days and

72
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,150
then off of this we have an impact score which is from zero to 100 100 It means alpha one thinks it's

73
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,360
going to have a large impact on the actual stock price.

74
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,220
And then 0 means it believes it's going to have no impact on the stock price.

75
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,810
And then we have sentiment which goes from negative 1 which is a negative sentiment all the way to positive

76
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,860
1 which is a positive sentiment.

77
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,220
OK.

78
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,510
So you can imagine if we had 100 impact with 1.0 sentiment we would think that the price would go up

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,000
and if we had negative on 100 impact you would think that the price will go down because of a large

80
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,470
negative impact.

81
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,560
So then we're going to do is just return all of this as a pipeline will say return pipeline columns

82
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:31,160
and then we're going to say here we just have impact's be impact and then we're going to have sentiment's

83
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,190
sentiment lips

84
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,910
and then let's finish off this.

85
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,240
Actually that's all we need for our column so we'll just have those two columns impact and sentiment

86
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:52,830
and then apply a screen which is our liquid screen and again the screen could have been the Q 5200 at

87
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,630
us or whatever you really wanted.

88
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,560
So another we have that we we've attached it and we call that pipeline which means we can call it in

89
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,370
other places.

90
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,550
So what I'm going to do is a period initialize.

91
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm going to schedule a function and I'm going to call this my rebalancing function which we haven't

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,540
defined yet but we will in just a second and I'm going to have it run.

93
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,030
Let's just have it run every day.

94
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,600
OK.

95
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,300
So schedule a function it's going to rebalance every day based off this pipeline so let's go ahead and

96
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
create a rebalancing function.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,190
So this is essentially where you're going to be doing the logic of what you want to actually do as far

98
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,710
as the impact is concerned.

99
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:48,260
So to do this all say if my rebalance context and data so this rebalance function is going to basically

100
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,650
say are we going to order securities in long shore or we're going to exit out of our positions.

101
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,880
So in order to do that that means basically as we've done before we actually grab the stocks that we're

102
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,100
going to go long on and the stocks that we're going to go short on.

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,730
So let's go ahead and do that before the trading actually starts before trading start.

104
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,500
And this should feel pretty familiar based off some of the last examples we've gone through as far as

105
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,920
the pipeline examples will take in context and data and I'm going to create our portfolio or just some

106
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,820
object for our pipeline.

107
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,740
I remember we call pipeline output pipeline and this grabs the data offering that we created in the

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,710
pipeline.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,040
So off of this we're going to grab the stocks that we're going to go along on.

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,900
So there's a context longs is equal to and this is where it gets a little tricky because you kind of

111
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,230
have to decide on what you're going to choose.

112
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,000
So let's go ahead and go long on stocks to have 100 impact and a sentiment score of at least greater

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,620
than 0.5.

114
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,620
So the way we do that is through pandas.

115
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,860
So this is going to be multiple filters.

116
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,910
So we'll see where the impact is equal to 100 EON's

117
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,580
portfolio where the sentiments is greater than 0.5.

118
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,120
But again remember this is panderers going to zoom out just a little bit here so we can see the whole

119
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,750
lines.

120
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,850
Remember this is panderers.

121
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,070
So I'm going to filter this out based off the portfolio itself.

122
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,030
So hopefully this kind of reminds you a lot more of what Panda looks like.

123
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:32,670
Remember to put each of these conditions in princes and if you're kind of confused on what port actually

124
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,820
is what this pipeline actually looks like.

125
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,870
All you have to do is just say print port and then run this for a day somewhere and you'll end up being

126
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,060
able to see it in your logs.

127
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,900
But essentially it's just a data frame with an impact column and a sentiment column and all we're doing

128
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,910
is saying hey for context that longs that's going to be the securities where the impact is equal to

129
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,560
100.

130
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,560
And the sentiment is greater than 0.5 But remember the securities our are in the index so when you say

131
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,060
that index to list and that gives us a list of securities.

132
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,260
So those are our lungs and we're going to do something really similar for the shorts.

133
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:14,430
So instead of Longs here we'll say shorts and we do want where the impact is 100.

134
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,290
But instead of greater than 0.5 we're going to say less than negatives or 0.5.

135
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:27,080
And if you want to kind of play around with this you could say 0.75 and negative point 7 5 et cetera.

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,050
It's really up to you.

137
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,680
Is where you can kind of play around see how impacts score affects things how sentiment score affects

138
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,300
things or maybe you want to do a whole other strategy to maybe only look at impact score or you only

139
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,800
look at sentiment scores etc..

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,410
So it's really up to you can play around a lot of this.

141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,490
It's a fun data set to play around with.

142
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,700
And again usually you have to pay for this kind of thing.

143
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
Obviously we can only look at historical data here.

144
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,030
We have to pay if we want the most recent data.

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:57,160
Ok so now that we have our longs in our shorts Well we need to do is actually compute the weights.

146
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,610
And this is a really similar function to them in the past.

147
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:09,460
We're just going to say my compute weights takes in some context and it's going to say okay the long

148
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,740
wait is going to be half of our portfolio divided by context.

149
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:24,970
Wongs and then we'll say the same thing for the short way which is going to be negatives or 0.5 number

150
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:32,240
that's a short and we're going to say length of context shorts and for this particular example we all

151
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,980
have to deal with the actual checking if its length is zero or not.

152
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,880
There's pretty much always going to be something in Longs or something in shorts that as we previously

153
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,940
discussed sometimes you want to check to make sure that the length of context that long or the length

154
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,210
of context that shorts isn't actually zero and you don't get some sort of division by zero error.

155
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,700
But in our case it will work fine if you run the same dates I do.

156
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,540
So now we're going to say rebalance this.

157
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,430
And let's go ahead and put in that logic and this is logic.

158
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,220
I'm just going to copy and paste that from the notes because we've actually done this before a few times.

159
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,550
So let me copy and paste this and then go over it real quick.

160
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,770
So let me zoom out so we can see the whole thing.

161
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,280
So what does sludging actually say.

162
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,180
Well the first thing I check is for the security in my portfolio positions.

163
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,780
If the security is not in current context longs and it's not in shorts and I can trade the security

164
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,690
Well I should exit that position because I'm holding it and I no longer want to go long or short it.

165
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,490
So I'll just set it to zero.

166
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,320
Then for security in context that longs I'll check.

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,360
I'll check first if I can trade the security then if I can for that security I'll say go for the long

168
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,230
wait there and then for the one that shorts I'll check if I can trade it.

169
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,120
And if so I will order a certain percentage to short it.

170
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,890
OK.

171
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,650
And that's really all we have to do.

172
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,540
This should pretty much be it.

173
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,150
So very basic function.

174
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,630
The part you really want to play around with are these two lines 29 or 30 whether you're going to go

175
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,610
long or short.

176
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,210
What's the impact factor are going to look for.

177
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,520
Was sent them a factory to look for et cetera.

178
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,340
Let's go ahead and back test this.

179
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,730
We're going to back test this.

180
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,190
Remember we're going to go from let's say 2015 to 2013.

181
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
And if you get errors here make sure you actually check the documentation because sometimes the update

182
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,070
on what's available for free.

183
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,200
Well let's go ahead and build this algorithm make sure we don't have any typos anywhere.

184
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,000
OK long way is a sign and never used.

185
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,880
Short ways assigned but never used.

186
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,100
So let's make sure I actually called these correctly context that long way short wait.

187
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,710
OK so what I had to do is actually set this so I'm going to do the following.

188
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,020
Let's go ahead and say I forgot to actually assign the weights.

189
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:47,760
We're going to return long waits and waits and then every day here when we call context that long is

190
00:13:47,760 --> 00:14:00,560
a context that shorts we're going to do is say context thaw a long way in context short wait is going

191
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:08,180
to equal to my compute the weights and then I'm going to pass in a context object there.

192
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,110
OK so now let's try this again.

193
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,210
So it's like kind of totally forgot to save the actual weights.

194
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,790
Let's build this.

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,300
Now let's make sure we don't have any more errors.

196
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,990
Run this again same back test and then hop forward in time to this finish backtesting.

197
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,350
All right so if hop forward in time this is done running the back test and notice we actually performed

198
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,400
quite poorly.

199
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,120
We only got 3.3 percent returns over this time period when the actual benchmarks move something way

200
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,340
closer to like 50 percent returns.

201
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,780
So what's actually happening here.

202
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,220
Well if we take a look back at what we're doing all the logic of our trading is basically here in line

203
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,840
29 and 30 and what we're saying is go long when the sentiment is high and then go short when the sentiment

204
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,240
is low and the impact is 100.

205
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,760
But something to keep in mind is this sort of sentiment analysis is obtained from things like social

206
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,730
media or news outlets.

207
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,110
So what might actually be happening here is we're kind of late to the party when we actually realize

208
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,130
that sentiment is positive and it's going to have a high impact.

209
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,120
This stock may have gone all the way up already that it's going to go and then we come in and buy kind

210
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,310
of that peak price and we hold it there which is probably not so great.

211
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,380
Probably wanted to be there earlier in the game and then for the shorts it's basically the same thing.

212
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,290
The stock has probably bottomed out by the time we're actually realizing that the sentiment is poor

213
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,000
and it's going to have a strong impact.

214
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,980
So we're basically going in at the bottom and the stock might start rising again.

215
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,780
So we're kind of doing this at one of the worst times possibly depending on how we actually use this

216
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,130
data and someone else to keep in mind is this sort of thing is not novel.

217
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,930
Anyone can have access to this data.

218
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,180
So this strategy is definitely not unique and everyone could have access to the same data as long as

219
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,940
they pay for it.

220
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,520
And other companies have their own data sets for sentiment Alliss that may even be better than this

221
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,790
one.

222
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,250
So all those topics are things to keep in mind as you decide to use some sort of sentiment analysis

223
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,820
or some of these paid resources for your trading strategies.

224
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,260
Again if you're going to pay for this information definitely look at the documentation and familiarize

225
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,450
yourself with it.

226
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,600
It could change often.

227
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,580
So my best judgment is if you're really interested in paying for some sort of sentiment else this is

228
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,760
go to documentation and read up on it thoroughly.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,160
OK.

230
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,560
I hope you enjoy this project.

231
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,490
I'll see you at the next lecture.
