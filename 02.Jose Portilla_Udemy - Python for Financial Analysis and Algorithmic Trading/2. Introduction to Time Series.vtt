Hello everyone and welcome to the time series analysis section of the course.

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.860
It's now time to shift our focus to dealing specifically of time series data.

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.250
A lot of financial information is going to come in the form of some value plotted against a time series

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
such as the price of a stock plotted against the day of that price.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.220
Now we've already learned a little bit of how to work with pand those with time series.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.750
Now we're going to shift our focus on techniques and analysis techniques used with time series data.

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.190
While the concepts presented in this section of the course are very important.

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.680
In general we may actually not use them that often when working directly with algorithmic trading models.

9
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.630
In fact one of our main reasons for covering some of these topics is so that in future sections of the

10
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.840
course we can show why using some of these analysis techniques on stock information or financial securities

11
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.570
information is actually not a good idea.

12
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.100
So it can be really tempting to use some of these techniques on financial data but sometimes it's actually

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.890
not a good idea.

14
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.710
But to really understand why that is.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.390
We first need to understand those techniques themselves and I'm kind of specifically referring to the

16
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.210
Arema models.

17
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.260
We're going to cover later on in this section so as an overall approach to this section you should try

18
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.000
to get a higher level understanding of some of these concepts but don't get too concerned that much

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
with some of the details as far as future sections of the course are concerned if you decide you want

20
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.470
to do a model for some other non-financial data sets that do have to do if a time series then you know

21
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.420
these Arema models some of these PTSD composition models that will go over will be really useful in

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.210
other fields.

23
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.460
But as far as we're concerned for future sections of the course you don't need to worry about getting

24
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.530
bogged down too much in some of those nitty gritty details.

25
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080
So in this section we'll going to discuss the following topics.

26
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.680
We'll start off with just the basics of a time series.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.960
What are different attributes of a time series things to look out for than we're going to introduce

28
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.480
a new Python library called stat's models.

29
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.730
Such models is probably the most popular library in Python for actually working with time series data

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.100
and creating a models for time series data.

31
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.890
Then we'll discuss it models that's like an error trend season model and how to decompose a time series

32
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.440
into those three specific topics and then we'll discuss E.W. a.

33
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.310
Those are exponentially weighted moving average models.

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.990
Those will be useful later on.

35
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.050
And then finally we'll discuss Arema models that is auto regressive integrated moving average models.

36
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.450
So when I specifically refer to not worrying about some of those details of the models I'm kind of really

37
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.540
specifically referring to the Arema model itself.

38
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.980
We're going to go kind of a lot of detail for the Arema model and it is a really useful model for time

39
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.000
series but often it doesn't work well financial and securities data and we'll understand why.

40
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.720
Once you understand how the Arema model works.

41
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.100
All right let's get started.

42
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.550
I'll see you in the next lecture where we begin to discuss time series basics.
