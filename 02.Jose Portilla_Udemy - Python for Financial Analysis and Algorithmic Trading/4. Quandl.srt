00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,910
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on Quando.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,070
So as you previously noted quando is actually a company which means it does charge for its services

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
on a premium tier.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,680
However everything that we're going to be showing here can be done absolutely for free.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,440
So will do in this lecture will hop over to quando dot com explore the Web site a little bit explain

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,980
a little bit more about the company and they will open up a new chapter notebook and show you how you

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,940
can use the free Python API.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,160
Let's hop over to the browser now OK.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,310
So if you come to the quando Web site it will look something like this.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,730
It may have updated itself by the time you're watching this video but there should be alternative data

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,290
in core financial data somewhere on the page.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,720
So we'll end up doing is we'll click on core financial data this alternative data.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,050
It's actually a really interesting product they offer.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,120
I am not paid by call to say this but if you click it basically certain data companies will sell you

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,160
specific data things like how many Toyotas were sold yesterday so that might be interesting to you but

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:03,980
it's not free.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,990
So you actually need to kind of pay for these sort of services.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,970
However a lot of the core financial data is free.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,070
So you know that's what your core financial data.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,580
You have a filter here that allows you to select premium or free will to select free and then you'll

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,280
see all the free data here.

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,300
So there are a ton of data sources a lot more than what Panas data reader has access to things like

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,880
and that they stock prices which we've worked for or things like the London Metal Exchange or real estate

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,420
research from Zillow or Intercontinental Exchange futures data.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,980
So there's a lot of stuff here.

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,430
You can specify by data type by the region it's from by the asset class cetera.

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,690
So what we'll be doing is we'll be working with the wiki and the stock prices so that they stock prices

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,200
dividends and splits for 3000 U.S. companies.

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,430
And it's basically just public domain.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,400
So we'll go ahead and click on that and this will end up being a database for folks to access and Lotusphere

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,460
it says create an account for full access so you can create a free account to do that.

32
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,090
Just click on sign in and then you will click over here which says create one.

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,960
I've already linked this to make it a counselor.

34
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,550
Click also look at hubcap and it should then refreshed the page for me.

35
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:20,990
And now I'm signed in so I'll come back to core financial data select free wiki and the day stock prices

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,320
and then once it's refresh the page you'll see something that looks like this.

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,980
And essentially what this is it's just a huge database or a huge table of end that they stock prices

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,650
dividends and splits for 3000 U.S. companies and it goes up to about 40 years of history depending on

39
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,020
how old the company is.

40
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,000
So it's an absolutely immense table.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,140
But what you can do is if you want you can click here an exporter and then you can bulk download you

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,600
can export the full database if you want it to.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,170
I don't recommend it is because it's a ton of information and you probably won't need it all but you

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,840
never know what you can do is you can request to see SVGA center SML file it will generate a large zip

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,460
file for you to download which you can later unzip on your computer.

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,310
However we'll be using the python API click a little Python symbol.

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,640
It will tell you how you could request the entire table.

48
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,780
Again we're not actually going to grab the entire table if you wanted to you could.

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,370
But what I want to know here is that there is a little special code wiki prices.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,640
These are the Quon the Kurds will be using throughout the Jupiter notebook section of this lecture.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,550
So just to show you how you could actually kind of get information from this.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,390
Let's go back to that previous example of trying to get Facebook stock data we would come do is click

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,160
over here on ticker and you click on this little blue symbol and you can select stickers so you can

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,770
say B select that be in the hit filter.

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,010
And then it will filter Facebook so that we can see the various dates.

56
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,080
And if you click on it here you can filter by dates so you can do just a single day or you can even

57
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,650
do a date range and then select a range of dates.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,220
So from.

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,520
Well let's see from the 6 to 7 think cetera.

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,330
So it could filter by that and then we get back two rows of data.

61
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,630
So whatever you want it's available free here.

62
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,930
Once you've done that you will end up getting this request code or it's data quando get table and then

63
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,220
will actually specify the ticker you want and then the arguments you want etc..

64
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,710
So you could actually just do this manually over here.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,450
Select what you want make sure looks good and then just copy and paste this request we're going to show

66
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,180
you the four ways of doing this when we hop over to Jupiter notebook.

67
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,370
So in another tab here I have a Juber notebook open so let's actually go through a couple of examples

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,530
of calling quando data.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:37,020
So the first we're going to do is also import quando and then to get data we'll say in my data quantum

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,180
lips trees.

71
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,480
Well that's right quando dot get.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,980
And if hit top here you get and get table get what it usually is for.

73
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,870
It's just a single time series get table is to get an entire database.

74
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,680
So if I just use get what I can do is pasan a code.

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,700
So there's lots and lots of codes available for Quando.

76
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:08,850
And one of them could be something like a forward slash petrolium or P-T or WTC.

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,890
So that crude oil price underscored.

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,230
So what this does is it returns the WTI crude oil price from the U.S. Department of Energy.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,700
So if you run that with that specific code it's going to reach into quantiles databases using your special

80
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,830
code that you provided and then call my data.

81
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,100
And there you have a time series of the crude oil price from the U.S. Department of Energy.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,690
Ever since 1986.

83
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:44,900
So what you could do if you wanted to you could import map plot lib pipe plots as Piazzi and then say

84
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,280
map plot live in line run that you can actually then just plot your data.

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,670
And there we can see oil prices from around the early 1980s to present day you can is kind of a big

86
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:09,620
crash and I guess during the financial crisis in as a quick note this returned this as a Pandurs series.

87
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,470
But if you wanted to you could get this as a pie array so you can do as an additional argument specify

88
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,220
returns some pie and then if you run that and then you actually instead of Plotinus we just asked for

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,210
my data.

90
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,090
You'll notice it's kind of a numb piracy of these tuples where we have a tuple of time and then the

91
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,290
actual price.

92
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,080
Usually I would just tell you to use everything as pandas because Pan built on them anyway so you might

93
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,480
as well just get the pandas time series.

94
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,080
Keep in mind you can only do 50 of these requests a day without providing your API key.

95
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,340
So if you're going to do more than 50 you'll have to get an API key and then provide it using quando

96
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,650
OK.

97
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,020
Let's show you how you can actually grab these codes.

98
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,190
We already showed you how to grab the Facebook that we talked about earlier but let's kind of specify

99
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,570
a different example.

100
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,150
So we'll come back to quando Well and let's go ahead and click core financial data will hit on free

101
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,200
over here.

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,100
And then what I want you to do is kind of just pick any of these or go ahead and pick Zillow real estate

103
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,570
research.

104
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,790
And then once you click on that it will end up showing you various things so I'll say like home value

105
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,780
index for various cities.

106
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,870
Let's say I'm interested in San Francisco real estate.

107
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,100
So Type in San Francisco and in London telling me different things that are available.

108
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,930
Things like the home value index and if it keeps falling down it will tell you things like rental homes

109
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,860
index per square foot middle tier homes multi-family residences cetera.

110
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,830
The prices for things and what you end up doing you'll see that there's a code here Zillow slash and

111
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,800
then something.

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,580
So this is the Zillow rental index per square foot for all homes in San Francisco.

113
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,940
So you can do is you can just copy this code come back and then replace this right here.

114
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:04,750
And then you say this is like real estate run that and then eventually they'll read it in and they have

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,460
real estate data for San Francisco provided to you by Zillow directly which is pretty nice.

116
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,430
Now typically we're just going to be getting stocks and securities information.

117
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,950
So let me show you the general format to do that you could do it manually.

118
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,280
And the way we should earlier by actually just visiting Qualcomm but there's a couple of key codes that

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,400
should be useful to you to know just off the top of your head.

120
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:34,540
And one of them should say my data and then you'll say Crondall DOT gets and you'll pass and the code

121
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:41,080
Wicky that is that free wickie database and that they prices forward slash and then the stock ticker.

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,860
So let's say we wanted Apple stock you can pass that in and then if you call the head of this data once

123
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,820
done being read in you'll see we have all the information for Apple stock data from this wiki we have

124
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,070
the open high low close volume and then we also have dividend split ratios or just open interest that

125
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,090
high low close adjusted close and then just that volume.

126
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,800
So again these are adjusted those take things like stock splits into account and if you're using Panas

127
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,280
data reader usually what ends up returning are these adjusted values.

128
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,030
Ok so we can see here we have information Apple ever since 1980.

129
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,560
Sometimes you don't want all these columns so you can do is offer this you can just ask for a single

130
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,870
column and starting from in solution one way you can do is say Apple does one run this and if you run

131
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,410
my data again you'll notice you just get the open column so all the columns are available to you.

132
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,190
Or if you want you can actually just grab a single column by inputting its number at the index position.

133
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,660
However that does require you to remember what the column names are.

134
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,120
So keep in mind that's all available to you.

135
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,530
There's a lot more information on quantiles Web site and always what you can do in case you don't remember

136
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:02,560
those actual codes or the one deal of memorizing those codes just come to core financial data free wiki

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,930
and that they stock prices and then you can mainly grab stuff here and then just export it to C S V.

138
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,830
Or just ask for the Python code.

139
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,480
OK.

140
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,670
That's really all there is to Quando.

141
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,290
I hope you find that useful.

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,110
It's a really great python API for grabbing data for all sorts of things.

143
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,970
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next section of the course.
