Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on stock splits and dividends.

2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.380
Let's quickly discuss why companies split their stock and also give out dividends stock splits usually

3
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.760
occur if the price for an individual stock becomes unreasonably high so that companies essentially do

4
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.860
is it just create a ratio split.

5
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.790
For example one stock is now worth two stocks or one stock is now worth three stocks.

6
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.880
Thus they can drop the price and make it more accessible to other consumers to purchase their stock

7
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.180
because stock splits could cause errors for algorithms looking for price changes.

8
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.010
Well we end up using is the adjusted close price which is just the historical prices to match up and

9
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.400
take into account stock splits often stocks will also pay dividends.

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.360
That is for each unit of stock.

11
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.380
Each shareholder receives some payout for each unit that they own.

12
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.550
This causes the price to jump before the dividend announcement and then drop after the dividend is paid

13
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.000
out.

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.880
The adjusted close price also takes this into account.

15
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.620
So it's important to note to always use adjusted close prices.

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.090
Otherwise you may be affected by stock splits and dividends in your pricing strategies.

17
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.250
And that's why we've been using a justed close or at just that open instead of just open high lower

18
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.170
close and throughout the rest of the course we're always going to be using these adjusted values.

19
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.190
One last thing to take into account is something called survivorship bias.

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.740
If we take a look at the S&amp;P 500 benchmark today it is a different set of companies than let's say in

21
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.260
the year 1999 which is the peak of the dot com bubble.

22
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.440
After the dot com crash many companies that were in the S&amp;P 500 no longer existed or became too small

23
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.620
to be part of that 500 companies.

24
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.150
So meaning that the time actually picked the S&amp;P 500 could possibly matter especially if it's part of

25
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.430
your trading strategy.

26
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.740
If we were creating strategies in the early 2000s we may have heavily used the S&amp;P 500.

27
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.900
But if we didn't take into account the earlier make up of the S&amp;P 500 you would end up having a bias

28
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.560
in our results due to that dot com crash many of the strategies we provide later on won't be affected

29
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.490
by this sort of outcome too much.

30
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.290
But keep in mind in case you end up using a benchmark as part of your strategy and you want to back

31
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.830
to 2007 kind of right before the financial crisis where a bunch of companies got delisted from the S&amp;P

32
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.030
500 you may need to take survivorship bias into account.

33
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.410
So you can actually buy survivor bias free data from a variety of sources including Quando.

34
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.740
Keep in mind that usually not free although it isn't very expensive either.

35
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.250
So you can check out quando premium or other sources for the latest pricing.

36
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.920
Keep that in mind.

37
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.810
In case you ever have a strategy that is really dependent on the actual benchmarks and it happens to

38
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.640
be back tested to a certain time period where certain companies were delisted from the benchmark you

39
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.710
want to look for a survivor bias free data set to work with.

40
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.050
All right.

41
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.990
Those are just a few notes to discuss.

42
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.560
In reality a lot of the trading strategies were going to be using won't be affected too heavily by either

43
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.500
of these topics.

44
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.200
And we're always going to be using the adjusted close prices so we won't be affected by stock splits

45
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.760
or dividends either.

46
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.620
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
