Hello everyone and welcome back to this series of lectures that I'm going to be referring to as financial

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.830
market concepts so in the next few lectures we're going to cover some financial topics such as what

3
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.320
types of funds there are.

4
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.450
Would an order book is and how it works what latency arbitrage or high frequency trading is and also

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.570
what short selling is now a lot of these topics they don't directly relate with coding something out

6
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.720
in Python and said talking about these key financial topics is going to give us a better overview of

7
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.020
the actual ecosystem of the financial space.

8
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.970
So we're going to go over these basically in just pure slide form because they don't actually directly

9
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.270
relate anything as far as programming is concerned.

10
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.270
Then once we actually get to cap em or capital assets pricing models will hop back explain the topic

11
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.510
and then we'll actually code stuff out.

12
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.720
All right let's go ahead and get started in the next lecture.

13
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.060
We'll discuss what types of funds there are.

14
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.790
Thanks everyone and I'll see it there.
