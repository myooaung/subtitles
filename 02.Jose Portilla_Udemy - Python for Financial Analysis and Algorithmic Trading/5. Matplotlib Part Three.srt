00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,510
Welcome back everyone to Part 3 of the series of that pot lib lectures.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,990
This is going to be the last part of the Matt Potter lectures and then after this we'll have an exercise

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,530
and then the solutions to that exercise and then we'll jump into Panda's visualization.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,550
Let's hop back to the Jubran notebook and finish this off.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,140
Let's go ahead and talk about setting colors with MAP plot lib.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,890
So I'm going to go ahead and just say fig equals P.L. T-Dog figure.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,850
And then I'm going to go and add a set of Access's figure x is equal to Fig dot and underscore axes

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,570
and I will set this at 0 0 1 1 and then loops and then off of that sort of axes I want to say X stop

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,090
plot and do X come alive.

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,630
And this is a reference to the same x and y that we've been working with.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,940
So if I go in and plot that I get something that looks like this.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,930
Now I can edit this color of the plot by putting in the color parameter and the color premiÃ¨re can actually

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,690
take multiple arguments it can take in arguments such as common color strings like blue or let's go

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,240
and put in orange or we can see an orange line out or green and you get a green line.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,700
So very basic color names.

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,900
It can actually except as a string if you want to start getting more detailed.

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,090
You can actually put in RGV hex codes so I can put in hash tag and then some RGV hex code such as Gaudens

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,470
copy this from the notebook f f 8 C 00 Whoops.

19
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:53,210
And that gets you a more custom color so you can go ahead and google search for RSGB X code maker or

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,610
Creator and you should have plenty of tools available freely online for actually coming up with these

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:05,240
are G-B hex codes in case you want to make a very custom color for very basic colors basically kind

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,350
of Crayola colors such as purple.

23
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,190
You should be able to easily plot them and just pass the string OK.

24
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,140
So that's the basics of colors.

25
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,960
Now let's talk about line with and line style if you want to edit the line with.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,860
You can actually just passen line with as an arguments and just put in a number.

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,710
So for instance if we put in one that is the essentially default line with we want to go double the

28
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,270
default and say line with is equal to 2 and that will double the width and we can continue doing this

29
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,600
if I want a very thick line just like with equals 20 That's 20 times the thickness of the default line.

30
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,130
Or if you want a very thin line such as have the default thickness 0.5 you can start getting thinner

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,460
and thinner.

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Other very useful tip as far as line with line visibility is the alpha arguments suddenly go ahead and

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,620
set my line equal to line with three and you can specify the alpha argument which allows you to basically

34
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,940
control how transparent the line is.

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:21,600
So I can say Alpha is equal to 0.5 and if I run that I can see we actually have a little bit more transparency

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
on this line.

37
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,420
So you can combine color line with an alpha in order to get the exact appearance that you want.

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,720
One last thing to note here is for short hand you actually don't have to type in line with completely.

39
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,850
You can just type in LW and it will still work just fine.

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,030
OK.

41
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,680
So we talk about line with color and Alpha going to go in and remove the alpha call.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,150
Now let's talk about line style so I can type in line style and line style there's quite a few options

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,140
and they're listed in your note book that it basically just defines the style of the line such as a

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,720
dashed line or a dotted line.

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,970
For instance if I person two dashes I end up getting a dashed line and just passing this in as a string.

46
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,360
Or if I pass a dash and then a period I get the sort of dashed line.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,000
So that point that points and then there's a couple of more options such as Colin which gets me these

48
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,400
smaller dashes here and you can check out the Jupiter note book for this lecture to see what other options

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,850
you have.

50
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,180
And you can also do steps.

51
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,500
However I rarely use those.

52
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,930
Most often I'll just either do a dash line or if you just put in one dash it's just a solid line.

53
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,790
OK.

54
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,600
And just like with line with you actually don't need to type in line style.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,720
You can just put ls and it will end up working just the same.

56
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,070
OK so he talked about line with and line style.

57
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,820
Now let's talk about markers.

58
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,810
So markers are going to be used when you have just a few data points.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,950
For instance if we take a look at X as a reminder of what it is we can see that X is just an array of

60
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,980
go ahead and check the length of X of 11 points.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,400
Let's say actually I wanted to mark were those 11 points occurred on this plot.

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:21,670
Well I can specify marker as a new arguments should be a comma and then I can pass in a string.

63
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,750
So there's lots of possible marker symbols and they're listed in your note book.

64
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,660
But the most basic one in common one is just this lowercase O as a string.

65
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,840
And there you can begin to see some dots that basically mark out each points on X versus Y here.

66
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,560
And there's a wide variety of markers available to you.

67
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,370
There are always that in the notebook but just to show you a couple who can do things such as plus signs

68
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,360
which don't show up too well here.

69
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,040
You can do things such as Little stars like Asterix symbols.

70
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,550
You can do things such as passing in these number codes I'm going to make the line with a little thinner

71
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,900
so you can actually see these markers here.

72
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,500
So we wanted to make these markers bigger.

73
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,600
Well you may have guessed that marker size isn't arguments so you can go ahead and specify marker sizes

74
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,430
essentially just one is the very small size.

75
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,010
And then if you want to make it quite a bit larger You could say 10.

76
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,770
And here we can begin to see these kind of triangles being in the form.

77
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:28,040
So let's go and say just huge markers at 20 and then we can specify marker type ear you can say plus

78
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,830
we get these plusses here etc..

79
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,400
So all these options are listed in the documentation and more importantly in your Jupiter notebook.

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,620
So there's so many different types of strange you can pass in as marker for marker codes.

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,610
And if you really want to customize your markers for instance go ahead and put this back to lowercase.

82
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,610
Oh so we get these points here and change this line with back to one.

83
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,810
There's actually quite a few options as far as specifying what the marker looks like.

84
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,130
You can specify the marker face color the marker edge with and the marker edge color.

85
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,830
So for instance I'm going to go out and add these arguments.

86
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,850
So just press comma enter for a new line and I'm going to go in and say Mark face color

87
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,210
you can specify the marker face color.

88
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,260
So I'll be the color inside of that circle.

89
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Let's go ahead and make it yellow and run this and that changed the marker or face color.

90
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:29,150
Let's say I want to change the marker edge with I go and edit that as well.

91
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,890
Make that a little thicker such as three that makes a little thicker.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,050
And let's actually want to specify the color of the marker edge I can specify a marker edge color and

93
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,080
it's good to make that green.

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,440
All right.

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,120
So you can see there's a lot of customized ability here and there's a lot of options if you want to

96
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,810
see a bunch of examples of different options you can go ahead and jump to the Jupiter note book for

97
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,710
this lecture.

98
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,610
When you go out and do that now it's going to go ahead and click on over and if you see here and there

99
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,660
the map Cutlip concepts lecture.

100
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,140
Right now we're in the section line marker and line and marker styles here there's basically a figure

101
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:14,470
where we did 12 by 6 on the subplots as far as figure size and did a bunch of plots and edited the colors

102
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,280
the line with the line styles.

103
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,590
And here's a bunch of examples so you can go ahead and read them out.

104
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,480
And if you're looking for a different possible marker symbols are all here as comments or line cell

105
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,530
types etcetera.

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,150
So there's a lot of different examples here the kind of copy and paste from or build your own knowledge

107
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,620
off of.

108
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,990
Finally let's talk about control over access appearance and plot range.

109
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,310
And if we hop back over to our original notebook over here we can go ahead and show how we can set the

110
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,900
Y limit and the limit.

111
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,620
I'm going to make this just a very simple plot again.

112
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:54,340
Go ahead and just make this line with equal to and let's make lifestyle equal some Ashlynn.

113
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,180
OK great.

114
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,100
Let's say I only wanted to show the plot between 0 and 1 on the x axis.

115
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:10,370
Well to do that just clear access and then say set underscore X Lim and then you pass any list with

116
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,440
a lower bound on the upper bound.

117
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,650
So we'll go from 0 to 1.

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,180
And here we can see we've set the lower bound and upper bound of the x axis.

119
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,430
Now let's go ahead and do the same thing for the Y limit.

120
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:31,290
Just call your axes and then say sets underscore why Lim and as a list you pass an upper bounds and

121
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,800
lower bounds so lower bound zero comma.

122
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,870
Let's make the upper bound.

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,690
It's going to just put it at two.

124
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,250
And now we can see this plot.

125
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,250
And notice as we zoom in the plot looks more and more like a bunch of straight lines connecting points

126
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,010
which makes sense because we don't have as much detail.

127
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,590
There's only 11 points as we zoom out we see more of a curved line and we can fix that by getting more

128
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,250
data points or by zooming out.

129
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,150
All right and one last thing I wanted to show you before we actually end the series of map plot lib

130
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:06,000
lectures is that if you go to the map Cutlip concepts lecture and scroll all the way down you'll end

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,840
up seeing a little subsection all the way towards the bottom that says something about special plots.

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,280
So beyond plot range or special plot types so there's actually lots of specialized plots we can create

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,930
such as bar plots histograms scatter plots and many more.

134
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,290
But most of these plots were actually going to be creating using pandas visualization.

135
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,660
All those panel visualizations are based on top of that plot live.

136
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,950
So basically under the hood pansit is calling Matt plotless commands.

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,000
But I do want to show you that you can do that clip here so you can do a scatter plot that plot live

138
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,880
basically passing an x and y array.

139
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,520
You get a scatterplot you can do things like a histogram which kind of shows you a distribution of things

140
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,840
that you can to appeal to the highest and we'll see how to do that later of pandas.

141
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,980
And then you can do things like box plots which also show you statistical distributions of categorical

142
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,310
data sets.

143
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,460
And if you scroll all the way down you get a further reading there's lots of helpful links here.

144
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,730
In case you want to check out more about my plot lib.

One of the ones I really recommend beyond just the page and the official gallery and tutorial is if

146
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,320
you click here it says good map Portlands Tauriel kind of second from the bottom.

148
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,020
Click on that link.

149
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,840
There's a really nice live tutorial here that basically walks you through a lot of the stuff we already

150
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,640
talked about defaults instantiating defaults changing color line with cetera.

151
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,080
But it's a really nice reference in case you need something a little extra than just the note book we

152
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
covered.

153
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,640
OK.

154
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,890
So we're going to now is have a quick little exercise for you will go over the exercise and then the

155
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,740
lecture after that we'll go over the solutions just so you can test your new skills with Matt plotless.

156
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,090
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
