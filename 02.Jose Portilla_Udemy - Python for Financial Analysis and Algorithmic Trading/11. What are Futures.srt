00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,620
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,170
This lecture on an introduction to fut. before we actually dive into how to trade futures on Quanto

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,110
in let's get an introduction and first discuss what features actually are you may have heard of the

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,920
term derivative when discussing financial topics and futures are an example of a simple derivative.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,170
So let's discuss what a derivative actually is.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,620
A reactive is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed upon underlying

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,860
financial asset index or security and common underlying instruments or things such as bonds commodities

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,980
currencies interest rates market index values and stocks derivatives can be extremely complex.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,660
But luckily futures contracts are relatively simple derivative.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,450
But before we actually discuss what a futures contract is we need to discuss a forward contract.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,260
Forward contracts are an agreement between two parties to pay a delivery price which will call OK for

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,590
some asset at some future point in time the person selling the asset is said to be in the short position

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,110
and the person to buy it in the future is said to be in the long position.

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,850
So let's go ahead and walk through a simple example and keep in mind we're walking through an example

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,030
of a forward contract not a futures contract.

16
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,200
We'll discuss futures after we learn about forward contracts.

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,890
So let's say we have two people Sandy and Billy Sandy over here on the left and Billy on the right.

18
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,480
Billy runs a gas station and needs gasoline and Billy knows that he's going to need gasoline not just

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,760
today but a year from now as well.

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:51,350
Sandy produces gasoline refinery so Billy knows he's going to need gas a year from now.

21
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,960
But as we all know oil production fluctuates which can cause the price of gasoline to fluctuate.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,830
And Billy wants a way to guarantee a price now for his purchase a year from now so Sandy is also subject

23
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,210
to the same fluctuations.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,480
And she wants a way to reduce the volatility in her pricing a year from now.

25
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,870
So it's beneficial to Sandy to get some sort of guaranteed price as well as Billy to also get some guaranteed

26
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,770
price.

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,610
Later on we'll see winners and losers in certain situations.

28
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,870
So this is where the forward contract actually comes into play.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920
What happens is Billy on the right of his gas station agrees to pay Sandy a fixed amount one year from

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,660
now for a barrel of gasoline.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Billy has entered the long forward position and Sandy has entered the short forward position.

32
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,250
So who really benefits from this transaction.

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,680
Well this depends on the future price of gasoline a year from now.

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,490
So let's walk through the two possible scenarios.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,400
So the first example we're going to go through is that a year from now the market price is higher in

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,540
the future.

37
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,450
So let's say we have a forward contract and the Ford contract says the following that Billy will pay

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,050
$100 for a barrel of gasoline one year from now in he thinks that's a fair price for gasoline one year

39
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,620
from now.

40
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,280
So both parties agree.

41
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,990
So then a year passes and the market price for gasoline is actually $150 a barrel Well Billy.

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,760
Now according to his forward contract only has to pay Sandy $100 for a barrel saving himself $50 from

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,400
having to go out into the market and buy a barrel himself.

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,930
So in that last case that we just discussed the market price went up meaning Sandy had lost a potential

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,560
profit.

46
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,840
If Sandy was able to just give that barrel out to the market she would have made $150 instead because

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,250
of her forward contract.

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,370
She had to give it up for $100 to Billy.

49
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,500
But what if the future market price was actually lower than the four to contract them out.

50
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,220
So let's go over this second example where the market price is lower in the future.

51
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,440
So again same forward contract Billy's going to pay $100 for a barrel of gasoline one year from now

52
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,730
and Sandy agrees.

53
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,620
A year passes and the market price of gasoline has crashed to let's say $25 a barrel so Billy according

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,500
to his forward contract still has to pay Sandy a hundred dollars for that barrel regardless of the market.

55
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,740
So actually happens now is Sandy's really happy because she gets an extra $75 above the current market

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:37,450
value a year after that forward contract was signed so Billy would have saved $75 without the contract.

57
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,110
But that again takes risk.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,620
He negotiated this price a year in advance so you can see Sandy comes out ahead.

59
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Instead of Billy.

60
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,620
So why would Billy and Sandy agree to a forward contract in the first place.

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,410
Well on both sides of the transaction it reduces risk since both parties know how much the price is

62
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,180
going to be in the future for this particular asset.

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,870
Obviously calculating that future price is absolutely critical and both parties are incentivized to

64
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,980
get the best deal possible for themselves.

65
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,940
And we can actually formally describe the sort of payoff each party gets.

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,830
Mathematically if we say again that K is the pre-determine future price and we'll say s of t is the

67
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:27,360
actual market price at some time t we can find the payoff for both the long party and the short party.

68
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,790
The payoff for the long position is the following.

69
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,430
S of t minus k so you can see that if you're going long on this forward a contract position as the price

70
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,160
goes up as you mature what happens is you get a better payoff because you don't have to pay that much

71
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,620
at the market price.

72
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,290
Instead you hit some whatever k value and if the market price ends up going down your payoff ends up

73
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,660
going negative because you could have saved money had you bought at the market.

74
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,040
The payoff for the short position is essentially reverse.

75
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,400
It's going to be the agreed upon price of the asset K minus the current price of the market.

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Once that actual forward contract has matured.

77
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,670
So what actually happens here is as the price goes down it means that the short position has actually

78
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,390
benefited.

79
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,840
They got to sell that asset such as Sandi's barrel of oil at a higher price than what the market was

80
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,300
actually willing to pay for it.

81
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,650
But as the price goes up they end up losing potential profit.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,950
So even though the forward contracts are quite simple there are some issues with them.

83
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,910
There's things such as counterparty risk which is if someone that you'd negotiate with just decides

84
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,110
to not pay up.

85
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,780
There's also a lack of liquidity.

86
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,000
You have to wait until the actual contract matures before you can execute any of these asset transactions.

87
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,570
And then you also need to negotiate many customized terms of the contract.

88
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,050
A lot of this could really depend on what particular asset you have the Ford contract for.

89
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,480
So this is where futures contracts come in and futures contracts our forward contracts that have been

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,150
standardized for trade on an exchange basically being bringing in a third party to kind of handle the

91
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,260
transactions and hold that contract for the two other parties.

92
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,650
So a single futures contract is for a set amount of the underlying whatever happens to be either an

93
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:23,090
asset securities financial fundamentals etc. with agreed upon settlement delivery date and terms.

94
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,290
And on top of this the exchange acts as an intermediary virtually eliminating counterparty risk.

95
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,770
The main idea of a forward contract is a futures contract is this introduction of the third party essentially

96
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,980
the exchange futures for a given asset are standardized so the terms of corn futures may differ from

97
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,520
Turns for instance pork bellies futures.

98
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,250
Now the existence of future contracts can lead to things like futures speculation and futures hedging

99
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,720
which we're going to discuss and a lot more detail when we actually show you how to implement features

100
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,500
in Quanto.

101
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:02,950
But things like speculation occur when market participants such as yourself anticipate a price change

102
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,720
in the underlying asset in the future.

103
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,880
Maybe you think the price of pork bellies is going to go down because there is some sort of disease

104
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,130
or some sort of overproduction etc..

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
So you never know what's going to happen.

106
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,480
But sometimes if you have really good domain experience you can anticipate price changes.

107
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,820
So one last feature of futures is that they're actually settled daily with a margin account at a broker

108
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,650
held by the holder of the futures contract.

109
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:35,350
So each day the change in price of the underlying asset which just is shortened to underlying is reflected

110
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,340
in an increase or decrease in the amount of money in the margin account.

111
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,900
And this process is called marking to market.

112
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,480
So now that we understand the basics of what futures are.

113
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,060
Let's go ahead and see how they work with Clintonian.

114
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,200
Keep in mind this is a really advanced topic and there's a lot more features and what we can cover in

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,070
these lectures.

116
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,090
But hopefully after viewing these lectures you'll get a basic idea of how to work with features in the

117
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,800
Clintonian platform.

118
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,900
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
