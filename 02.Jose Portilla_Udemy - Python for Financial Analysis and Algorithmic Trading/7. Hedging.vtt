Welcome back everyone to this lecture on hedging in this lecture.

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.080
We're going to explore the concept of hedging a bit further.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.630
And keep in mind a lot of what we discuss here is related to cap and are the capital assets pricing

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.190
model.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.140
So make sure to review those lectures before viewing this one.

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.660
Recall from the capital assets pricing model that beta represents assets exposure to the market basically

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.200
its relationship to the way the market moves up or down.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.690
Typically the market is represented by the S&amp;P 500 trading strategies follow Bayda are attractive as

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.100
they should operate independently from the market.

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.340
In this book what we're going to end up doing is calculating in assets beta and alpha and then show

11
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.290
a simple method of hedging against the beta in an attempt to cancel any risk exposure to the market

12
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.180
that we are strategy's going to work regardless of the way the market is going.

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.680
If the market goes up we won't really be affected by it.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880
We don't gain too much but hopefully if the market goes down we also won't lose that much because we're

15
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.850
trying to hedge against that beta value.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.830
So we're going to choose just a stock such as Apple and then get its alpha value and its beta value

17
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.950
then we can calculate a short position on the market.

18
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.590
In this case will you ASPI which is that exchange traded fund to represent the S&amp;P 500 to eliminate

19
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.450
its exposure to the market and treat only the assets Alpha Okay let's get started.

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.040
I'm going to open up a new research notebook in Quanto.

21
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.760
All right so here we have a new research notebook sort of get started with hedging what I'm going to

22
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.330
do a couple of imports here will important up-I is MP.

23
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.580
And then we're also going to save from stat's models import regression and this should feel familiar

24
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.750
to you based off the cap and lectures and then I will also say in poor stat's models thought API as

25
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.410
s.m and then going to import that live pipe plot as Piazzi.

26
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.850
OK so the first thing to do is get some data and luckily there is a nice get pricing function.

27
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.420
So I will say my start dates and you can just use the same Surtsey I do in fact that encourages and

28
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.550
follow along exactly.

29
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.760
But basically were going to get one year of data all of 2016.

30
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.830
So from the 1st of 2016 the 1st of 2017 and then I'm choose some asset go ahead and choose Apple or

31
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.310
the same one on choosing.

32
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.670
And theres this pricing which allows us to essentially in some stock ticker asked for some fields such

33
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.120
as the price and then input the start date star and leps our end date.

34
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.850
And so run that and that should get us the pricing for that asset.

35
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.470
So if you check out what the asset actually looks like its essentially is a time series that has the

36
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.590
date and then the actual price for Apple at that time okay.

37
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.260
And then we're also going to get some sort of benchmark.

38
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:10.290
So let's go ahead and say benchmark is equal to get pricing and we'll say spy for the S&amp;P 500 or so

39
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.100
she going to do the exact same thing here that the price at the start equal to start.

40
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.750
And then the end dates equal to.

41
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.950
And so that's going to get us the same information for the benchmark.

42
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.160
And what I want to do is just compare the returns real quick.

43
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.900
So we'll say asset returns are equal to asset.

44
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.920
And remember we can get daily returns by simply saying percent change and is going to be plotting this

45
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.870
so I'm going to grab everything beyond the first index point because remember for a percent change or

46
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.890
daily returns that first row is going to be a bunch of null values the same thing here for my benchmark

47
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.600
we'll say percent change one and then we'll get everything past that first one.

48
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.490
OK so let's go ahead and pluck these out.

49
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.220
We'll say whoops so we'll say plot.

50
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.940
And then what are you going to do here is call assets returns plot those out versus time and then we'll

51
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.300
say my bench returns plot those persist time and then let's go ahead and call it legend here.

52
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.410
So we can see them plotted against time.

53
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.110
OK.

54
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.350
So these are my daily returns for Apple as well as the S&amp;P 500.

55
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.620
Now you can see they're not exactly lined up but there are certain times where there's a dip in the

56
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.530
S&amp;P 500 and Apple dip as well particularly You can see this around the July Mark where they both essentially

57
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.580
have the same behavior.

58
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.870
Now there's definitely periods of time where Apple basically doesn't follow the market at all.

59
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.510
Here the green line is the S P 500 and you can see these blue dips and blue peaks.

60
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.020
So that is essentially what we can refer to as the alpha because it's not behaving in line with the

61
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.810
rest of the market.

62
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.780
Now we want to use hedging to basically isolate that behavior.

63
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.900
So in other way that put this out is to essentially create the scatterplot for this so say plot scatter

64
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:15.630
and I'm going to scatter my benchmark returns versus my asset returns and is given an alpha value because

65
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.810
we do have quite a bit of information here we'll just say like 0.6.

66
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.270
So we get a little bit of see through and we can kind of player on the size I think a 50.

67
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.190
You don't really need to provide the size argument just for making it look a little nicer and let's

68
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.160
give it the label.

69
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.670
So spy returns on the label and then our Y column is going to be the asset return.

70
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.080
In our case those are Apple returns.

71
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.900
So let's run that and see what scatterplot looks like.

72
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.320
OK.

73
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.070
So you can definitely see that there's some sort of relationship between the spire return and the apple

74
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.740
returns.

75
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.310
Generally we can see as the market comes up Apple goes up and as it comes down Apple goes down as well.

76
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.790
But there are some points here that are a little more unrelated to that.

77
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.490
So we're going to see how we can use hedging to kind of isolate that alpha behavior of Apple.

78
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.960
Now in order to do that we're going to do the same thing we did in the cap and lecture and essentially

79
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.330
fit some sort of regression line here so we can get the alpha and beta values so we were going to do

80
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.000
this is the following will say Apple is equal to my asset returns.

81
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.950
And I just want the values and the difference between asset returns and asset returns stock values is

82
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.570
one of them has the time the index.

83
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.070
The other one is just the actual numbers.

84
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.140
So we are going to be using Stout's models.

85
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.480
I just want the numbers and then we can say spy doesn't really matter if it's capitalized or not we'll

86
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.630
say those the bench returns.

87
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.980
And I just want the values there.

88
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.100
So if you take a look at Apple essentially just an array of numbers no longer has time information because

89
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.680
I'm running regression the regression and really care about the time.

90
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.810
So then the other thing to do is say Spike constant and I'm going to add a constant.

91
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.670
That way I can get the intercept which essentially just adds in a bunch of ones for the intercept so

92
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.500
I'll show you what that looks like so I'll say S.M. the at constant on spy.

93
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.830
So if we take a look at the initial spy It's just that value of all these numbers here that of all these

94
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.250
numbers.

95
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.610
And if I take a look at Spike constant you'll notice it's now has this constant 1.

96
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.810
Along with that initial value and this is allow us is going to allow us to get alpha off of this basically

97
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.410
that intercept.

98
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.070
OK so we have spy costs now.

99
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.360
And now what we can do is say model is equal to regression the linear model and we'll use ordinary least

100
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.920
squares pass an apple and then passen Spike constant here and then I can call for this to actually fit

101
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.280
a model to the state of.

102
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.380
And that should run really fast because it's a pretty small dataset it's pretty simple.

103
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.820
So say it modeled up harams and that's going to return these two values right here.

104
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.190
And this is essentially why is equal to x plus B.

105
00:07:52.330 --> 00:08:00.050
So we can do here is say Alpha Beta is equal to model prims.

106
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.340
So I can check out my alpha value and then I can check up my beta value.

107
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.520
So here's my alpha value and here's my big value for the relationship between Apple and the S&amp;P 500

108
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.980
or the market.

109
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.840
Now this by itself doesn't tell us much.

110
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.660
Let's actually plot this sell.

111
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.450
So we're going to have the same scatterplot from before.

112
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:25.450
I'm going to copy this and paste this down here but we're going to add in a plot to represent that linear

113
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.930
model we just created.

114
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.730
So we'll say have the minimum S&amp;P 500 value is equal to benchmark.

115
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.810
Values men remember this is a Pyra.

116
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.890
And then my maximum value is going to be equal to benchmark returns values max.

117
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.980
So the reason I'm grabbing those is because I want to plot my line for the minimum spy value up to the

118
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.160
maximum buy value.

119
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.370
That way I don't have some huge long red line.

120
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.890
I just want it from here it's around here.

121
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.170
So once I have that I have my minimum and maximum when I'm going to do is say by line is equal to and

122
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.140
P that I'm going to create a linear space the amount of numbers or an array here.

123
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:16.020
From minimum spy to maximum spy or S&amp;P 500 and then let's say 100 points.

124
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.870
So that essentially gives me a bunch of x values from here to here.

125
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.950
And then we're going to calculate what the actual line value is or that y value based off the alpha

126
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.700
beta.

127
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.600
So just the really simple Weikel expulsed bee line.

128
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.860
So I'll say our value is going to equal to Skyline.

129
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.240
All those x values that are going to multiply it by beta and then add in my alpha.

130
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.910
So against just the cap and model that we talked about for so let's go ahead and run that and whoops

131
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.350
I forgot to set that.

132
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.990
So let's actually plot that out.

133
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.120
We're going to say Pulte plot and then go on a plot by line versus Y.

134
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.730
Let's go ahead and give it the color red.

135
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.860
So now when I run that I can see my line here.

136
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.150
So I can see this model and essentially describing the relationship between the S&amp;P 500 or the market

137
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.770
and Apple returns.

138
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.750
So now we're going to do a show you can implement a really basic hedge essentially taking that bait

139
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.210
of value that you calculated and turning it negative so that they're essentially canceling out any relationship

140
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.290
with the market.

141
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.750
The S&amp;P 500.

142
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.710
So let's go over how to do that actually implementing the hedge.

143
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:30.440
So it's actually quite simple We'll just say hedged is equal to beta multiplied by our bench returns

144
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.090
just like we did last time plus our asset returns.

145
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.000
Except we're going to do here is we're going to multiply this component by negative 1 say negative 1

146
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.110
times the first component and that should essentially act as if we're cancelling out any effects from

147
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:54.350
the market because we're essentially shorting that market position to a certain extent to that extent

148
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.530
which we calculated using that regression line.

149
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.620
So then I'm going to say hedged plots.

150
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.850
And I'm going to plot this as Apple with hedge.

151
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.080
And then let's also take the other returns here.

152
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.940
So we'll say asset return.

153
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.140
I'm going to plot that and let's get this an alpha of 0.5.

154
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.810
So there's going to be much stuff stacked on top of each other.

155
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:23.410
And then let's also get the bench mark returns and we're going to plot that with Alpha equal to 0.5

156
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.000
as well.

157
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.950
And then finally we're going to say Piazzi thought legend and run this and let's make sure everything's

158
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.990
all right here.

159
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:39.790
So we may have another apple of hedge just not a valid plot type whip's the should be label is equal

160
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.750
to this.

161
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.060
OK.

162
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.900
And you can see this behavior.

163
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.920
So just looking it at an entire year's worth of information may not be particularly useful.

164
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.420
So what I'm going to do is focus on a certain period of time when there's a big drop in the market and

165
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.650
it looks like that happens.

166
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.980
Remember I was saying around July if you take a look at the espie 500 that's the red line.

167
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.790
It essentially drops right here and you can see that normal Apple stock if you have a position entirely

168
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.520
in Apple it will also drop.

169
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.720
But if you hedge it by cancelling out that beta factor as we did here you'll notice it's unaffected

170
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.080
by the drop that much.

171
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.040
So let's go ahead and kind of zoom in here.

172
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.080
So we're going to do is copy this and I'm going to paste it here and then we're going to set the limit

173
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.180
to kind of focus on that summer drop.

174
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.960
So we're going to do the following.

175
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.510
We'll say Piazzi excellent.

176
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:39.170
And it looks like that happens somewhere around July or June so we'll say 2016 0 6 1 and then let's

177
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.310
have it go to August 2016 0 8 0 1.

178
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.370
Okay.

179
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.290
So playing that out now we see this behavior.

180
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.650
So no what happens here in let's say the middle of June.

181
00:12:52.700 --> 00:13:00.250
There was a big market drop so we can see the S&amp;P 500 this red line had a drop during that kind of mid

182
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.040
June late June period.

183
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.180
And Apple since it's affected by the market also dropped not as much as the market itself but it did

184
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:08.570
drop.

185
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.590
It had really similar behavior there.

186
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.660
However Apple with the hedge no longer follows that behavior.

187
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.000
It just stays flat.

188
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:21.800
So we can see we hedged against the market behavior and if we take a look at somewhere around this point

189
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.020
you can see that it still goes in line with the behavior of Apple stock in general.

190
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.760
It's just not as affected by the S&amp;P 500.

191
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.200
So you can see here sort of in late July the S&amp;P 500 was relatively flat.

192
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.810
Apple tends to go up that day as far as its returns.

193
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.580
And the hedged version also goes up because it's only canceling out the portion that's affected by the

194
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.560
market not the portion that's affected by the Apple stock.

195
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.990
So that's kind of the whole point of hedging here.

196
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.850
So we can see here that's not really affected too much by the market.

197
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.340
Now that also goes the other way around.

198
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.500
If there's a big market jump Apple won't gain as much.

199
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.720
So eventually you're going to see that we're sacrificing average returns for volatility.

200
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.350
So we're going to actually show in much more detail in the next lecture.

201
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:08.750
The effects of hedging by calculating alpha beta for the year 2016 that will create a portfolio and

202
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.230
show you how the actual hedging effects our returns and our standard deviation.

203
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.010
So we're going to jump right back where we left off this time in the next lecture.

204
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.580
I'll see there.
