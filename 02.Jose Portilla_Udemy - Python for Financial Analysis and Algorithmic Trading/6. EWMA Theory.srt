Welcome everyone to the lecture on E.W. a models so we've previously seen how calculating a simple moving

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,640
average of pandas rolling can allows create a simple model that describes some sort of general trend

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,180
level behavior of a time series.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,870
For example when we were calculating the simple moving average using pandas rolling we did things like

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,320
calculate a six month average a 12 month moving average etc..

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,290
So looking at that passenger airline data again we can use the simple moving average to kind of try

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,930
to grab that general trend.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,420
And the longer the window the time period the more you're focused on a long term trend.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,240
Here you can see that that 12 month moving average basically describes on a year to year basis what

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,340
the trend is and we can see year to year.

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:56,890
It's slowly moving up we can improve the simple moving average by actually calculating an exponentially

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,520
weighted moving average.

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,880
So this is because a simple moving average has a few weaknesses and some of those weaknesses are things

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,220
like smaller windows will lead to more noise rather than signal.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,880
It's always going to lag by the size of the actual window itself.

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,230
So you'll always have missing data.

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,650
The very first point and then it's never actually going to reach the full peak or Valley of the data

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,550
due to the averaging.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,550
It also doesn't really inform you about possible future behavior.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,030
All that really does is describe trends in your data and extreme historical values can also skew your

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,140
SMK significantly to help fix some of these issues.

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,720
We're going to do is use E.W. M-A which stands for exponentially weighted moving average.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,130
Let's describe how E.W. M8 works.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,800
So exponentially weighted moving averages will allow us to reduce the lag effect from a simple moving

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,420
average and it will put more weight on values that occurred more recently.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,780
And that's easy to do.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,790
All we have to do is apply more weight to more recent values and that's how it gets its name.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,340
So as the values get closer to the present time we actually apply more weight to them when calculating

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,140
the average.

30
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,540
So the amount of weight applied to the most recent values will depend on the actual parameters used

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,840
in the E.W. M8 and the number of periods given in a window size those parameters can be messed around

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,590
with empanadas until you get the desired effect.

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,750
So we're going to do in the next lecture is coda an example of using pandas to create an E.W. a model

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,190
in the very next lecture.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,160
We've already talked about as composition and we've already talked about E.W. here.

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,700
So let's kind of switch gears and go to the Jupiter notebook.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,060
We'll first talk about E.W. may then in the next lecture after that we'll talk about TSD composition

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,810
and then we'll shift gears to talk about ARIMA models in general.

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,560
Thanks everyone.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
I'll see you at the next lecture.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,330
Are we actually code out E.W. may using pandas.
