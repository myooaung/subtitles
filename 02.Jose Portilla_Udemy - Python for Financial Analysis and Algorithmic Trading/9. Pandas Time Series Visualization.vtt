00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.230
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on visualizing time series in this lecture we're going to go through

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.140
a few key points of creating nice time series visualization and how you can edit your time series X-ists

3
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.290
using Map plot lips capabilities.

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.970
Let's open up a new Jupiter notebook and get started.

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.640
OK here I am in the Jupiter notebook and going to import Pandurs as P-T going to import map plot lim

6
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.900
the PI plot.

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.640
As POPC and then I'm going to say map plot live in line and later on we're going to show you a way to

8
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.240
make this notebook interactive or at least a visualisations.

9
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.160
I have some McDonald's stock data for you as a McDonald's c v.

10
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.290
Let's go ahead and read that in we'll say panderers or PD that read CXXVI the McDonald's let's see every

11
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.060
file and then we'll say in the next column is equal to dates.

12
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.380
And we're going to ask States to be true.

13
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.980
Once you've done that you should notice that there's two columns here.

14
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.240
We just check out the head of the data frame there is just that close.

15
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.140
And it just adds value now when you see a data frame like this where you have many column sharing the

16
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.470
same date time index may be very tempting just to do something like this say Mactan and then plot.

17
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.380
But unfortunately if you're Y-axis on a totally different skill for both columns it's not going to work

18
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.950
very well.

19
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.420
So notice here that the adjusted volume is on a completely different scale than it just that close.

20
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.740
You want to avoid doing things like this unless all your columns are relatively around the same scale.

21
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.610
Instead what you're going to do usually is just call a series such as just call it just to close.

22
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.230
And now we see a plot that is actually interpretable.

23
00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:01.580
So then we do the same thing with adjusted volume will say Mactan adjusted volume plus that we'll see

24
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.930
this plot where it's actually showing how much volume is traded per day and we can see different spikes

25
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.530
here.

26
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.460
And then on that spike you can then realize hey something interesting happened this day.

27
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.580
Let me go check it out.

28
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.300
And if you want more clarity on this plot you can in the editing figure size by passing and Fig size

29
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.460
here and then you could say something like.

30
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.720
Told by 4 stretch out a little bit.

31
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740
See those spikes even clear.

32
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.000
So what I want to now show you is how you can format this plot even further.

33
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.640
And one of the things you can do is set X limits and y limits.

34
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:44.460
So let's say if I check out McDonald's the adjusted clothes column and I plot that out.

35
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.280
I have some kind of interesting period.

36
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.970
Let's just make up something like 2007 is kind of interesting to me.

37
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.780
So we're going to do is say plot and I can set the X limit in sight of this to be either a tuple or

38
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.440
a list just needs to be an iterable sequence of two items.

39
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.980
And then I pasan let's say 2007 0 1 0 1 so that's 2007 January 1st and then comma I pass in whatever

40
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.500
the next time stamp I want to see is 2009 let's say 0 1 0 1.

41
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.830
So when I run that I see now I've set the limit to go from January 2007 to January 2009.

42
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
Unfortunately when you do this it will adjust the Y limit automatically.

43
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.920
It will keep the wildmen at the same Wylma it shows for the entire data set when you plotted it.

44
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.930
So usually when you say Excellent have to also sit while in it.

45
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.630
So in this case we can set a limit.

46
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.500
And notice I can pass in a tuple a list for this and we'll just go let's say from 0 to no let's say

47
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.470
50 and I will see a more reasonable way.

48
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.100
Let me here.

49
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.270
And if you wanted to you could then raise the y element to something like 20 to 50 if you really want

50
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.060
to see the behavior there.

51
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.240
So continuing along if we just kind of copy and paste this code.

52
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.250
So McDonald's is just that close plot.

53
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.060
And let's actually do the same limits here so everything's the same.

54
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.430
You can set lifestyle and line color.

55
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.760
So the easy ways to do that is for lifestyle just.

56
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.500
LS That's I'm at lib.

57
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.100
Quick code make it do something like that dash line if you really want it.

58
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.480
And then if you want to set the color you could set something like see equal to read the whole set to

59
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.120
be read.

60
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.580
We really won't be changing color and style that often throughout the course will basically just usually

61
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.550
use a default panderers that will be enough for us.

62
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.930
But in case you ever feel the need to you have all the capabilities mapped lib inside the stopped plot

63
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.010
call.

64
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.380
Now let's really talk about one of the important things when dealing with time series data.

65
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.910
The time series is pretty much always going to be on the x axis and if the x axis that's automatically

66
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.400
formatted for us doesn't work for you you're going to need to use map plus lives capabilities with the

67
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.330
map published dates module or sub library in order to actually work with this.

68
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.980
So one of the other here is I'm going to import that plot live dates as

69
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.530
you can also say from spotlit import dates.

70
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.630
And then when I go into is just going to passen the exact same plot we did last time.

71
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.610
And here it is.

72
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.870
And let's just make this limit doesn't really matter.

73
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.260
We can make it zero cetera.

74
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.410
So let's pretend that you're not satisfied with this automated X ticks on the x axis you actually want

75
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.310
it to show something like daily data or daily ticks.

76
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.170
Or maybe you want to show both daily ticks and monthly ticks or weekly ticks etc. How can you actually

77
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.420
set these X ticks using that plot lib.

78
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.750
Well to do that you'll need to grab the index that you're concerned with so you can say id x is equal

79
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.300
to make Dawn.

80
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.780
And if you're dealing with your entire data frame here you would just say McDonogh that index.

81
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.720
And then what you would end up having now is this date time index.

82
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.690
Since we're only concerned if a portion are at data we're going to do is say Alosi and we'll pass and

83
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.630
the dates that we're just messing around with.

84
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:10.090
In fact let's make it even smaller we'll just say Girk grab a few months from this 2007 to let's say

85
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.440
2007

86
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:21.560
dash 0 5 0 1 and No here I mean isn't colon because this is essentially a slice operation slicing that

87
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.590
out of the index and then called the index actually get the index because if you don't call the index

88
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.450
Ill just turn that actual part of the data frame.

89
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.130
So now I run this I get back from 2007 January to 2007.

90
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.770
May for the fifth month then we're also going to do is set our stock data.

91
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.170
So I'm going to create a new variable called stock and that's going to be equal to McDonald's thought

92
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.990
Alosi at that same time series will just copy and paste this those same locations.

93
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.670
And I'm just worried about just that close.

94
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.260
So what I'm going to do is say here adjusted close call call it off of that.

95
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.890
So now take a look at my stock data.

96
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.900
It should be an asshole time serious here from those dates with just a close price.

97
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.950
OK now let's slowly plot this out using Map plot lib and it will show you things that you can add onto

98
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.650
this to fix things.

99
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.900
X-Tex access.

100
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.350
So if I wanted to plot this from that plot live I would end up doing maybe say something like Fig x

101
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:29.720
is equal to peel t the subplots and then off of this axis I'm going to call not just plot.

102
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.060
I'm going to say plot underscore date and that's basically kind of special method beyond just plotting.

103
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.910
Often access to let my public know hey I'm not just dealing with any sort of array here.

104
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.710
This is actually date time index information which makes map plot lib.

105
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.010
Understand that you can call things like a year week day off of it.

106
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:55.810
So I get a pass in the index and then going to pasand stock time series and if you just run this by

107
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.930
itself you'll get back a plot that looks like this.

108
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.320
Essentially a scatterplot.

109
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.190
And that's not exactly what we want we don't want these markers here.

110
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.700
So a third argument just sort of play a basic map Hotlips tiling I can add a dash here and then this

111
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:14.870
will create a line now if you have errors like this where stuff is overlapping one thing you can try

112
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.290
to do is say peel tea tightly.

113
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.800
However often for Titely that usually concerned with more than one plot if you run this you still won't

114
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.790
get enough of a fix.

115
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.720
You'll still have overlapping material.

116
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.260
So the way to fix the overlap with date times is with a simple command you just say Fig.

117
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.780
So off your figure object you call Otto FM t underscore X date and you just start typing auto hit tab

118
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.550
and will auto complete this for you and then just close Princie sexually execute that method and what

119
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.380
it's going to end up doing it's going to automatically format.

120
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.050
That's what this FMC stands for.

121
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:56.150
Automatically format the x axis and here you can see it ends up twisting them in a way that makes everything

122
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.820
look a lot nicer.

123
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.970
All right let's see you wanted to actually add in grid lines so this will that's actually quite easy.

124
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.440
All you need to do is add them to the access so you can say X dot and then we can call the y axis on

125
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.480
this say grid is true.

126
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.570
And then we get those grid lines on the y axis if you want them on the x axis you can say x x axis grid

127
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.720
and then pass that to be true.

128
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.470
And there's more parameters as we saw earlier when discussing that plot lib.

129
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.960
You can make these dasht grids etc a much darker whiter whatever you really want it can do for you.

130
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.410
However we're kind of concerned about or interested in editing these X-Tex like if you only want the

131
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.510
months I don't want this much of a detailed information how would I actually do that.

132
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.140
There's basically two steps for it.

133
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:52.530
One is to set the major or minor locator and then the second step is to set the major or minor formatter

134
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.750
so it's location and then formatting.

135
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.620
So let's show you those two steps.

136
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.330
I'm going to get rid of the grid lines for this.

137
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.660
It's clear.

138
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:11.080
So the first step is location or locating so you grab your access and then we're going to say grab x

139
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:19.020
axis off of that and then we're going to say set underscore major locator and then in this major locator

140
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.330
what you end up doing is say pasand dates.

141
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.820
And you'll notice they has a couple of locators.

142
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.840
If you keep scrolling down maybe type.

143
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.370
Oh you'll see there's a month locator.

144
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.920
If you start typing week you'll notice there's a weekday locator.

145
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.120
So there's various locators you can use.

146
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.640
And we'll just use the month locators an example and then we'll just close print Cesaire and call it.

147
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:47.820
So I'll pass that in and then once you've located what you want off date in this case it's locating

148
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.490
months.

149
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.050
You can specify how you actually want to format it.

150
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.040
So we'll do the following.

151
00:10:52.040 --> 00:11:02.610
We'll say x x axis set major and or say set major formatter and then we'll say dates thoughts and then

152
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.180
you're going to call it formatter.

153
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.670
That's pretty much always going to be the same regardless of what you're actually locating month or

154
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.150
week day.

155
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:09.960
Cetera.

156
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.960
And we're going to pass and here is a string indicating how you actually want to format the time series

157
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:21.870
for the time series data that is with each x Tich actually going to look like when you print it out.

158
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.860
So the way you do that is you just passen the string formatting for a time so you can say something

159
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.960
like.

160
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.540
Percent sign B cash.

161
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.560
Percent sign.

162
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.930
Let's just say why.

163
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.520
You'll run that and what's going to happen is it's going to locate the months.

164
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:45.330
What it does is it sets the ticks every month and then for the formatting it just formats what the data

165
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.500
output should look like.

166
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.210
So here we just use the special percent site codes for time and you can check out the resource links

167
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.230
for all the codes you can do pretty much anything day month for month name.

168
00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:01.130
So if we change it to a capital B and run this you can see it get the full month name etc. So there's

169
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.700
a bunch of special codes here.

170
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.720
They can check out the resource link for all of them.

171
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.650
Essentially just gives you a free range of format.

172
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.680
However you want.

173
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.760
So if I add in a bunch more dashes there's a limit to how useful this is.

174
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.740
But I can run this and I can see all the dashes etc..

175
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:22.440
Now what's interesting here is let's just go back to kind of a lowercase b dash if I can add in new

176
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.750
lines and adding in those new lines pushes the actual dates past the ticks of fat in a couple of new

177
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.550
lines here.

178
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.080
I can really push them out.

179
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.210
And what that does is it gives me space to input a minor set of axes and we're going to do the exact

180
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:44.070
same thing locating and then forgot to comment out the stat formatting.

181
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.120
So we're going to do locating and formatting.

182
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.670
Not for the major axis but now we're going to do for the minor So still the x axis.

183
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.130
But now it's going to be minor which means it's going to be closer.

184
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.720
So it's giving ourselves a little gap here and we can fill that in.

185
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.980
So let's do that.

186
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:06.290
We will say x x axis and then I'm going to set the minor and whoops we actually first want to locate

187
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:14.270
this so I'll say locator and then for this one will they will say they locator.

188
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:20.370
So it's going to find the weekdays from that series in their state time index and then we're going to

189
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:26.960
say X-axis again and then we're going to set the minor formatter so let's format this.

190
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:36.100
We'll call called data the formatter and how you can basically use whatever you want lushest passen

191
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:44.850
percent saying the run that you'll notice it gives you back the actual day for the second 9 16 etc..

192
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:51.160
Now question you might be having is actual day of the week is this is Monday a Tuesday Thursday ET cetera.

193
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.820
Well if we replace this percent 70 percent a year let us get a bunch of Tuesdays out.

194
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.110
So all of these are Tuesdays.

195
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:05.000
So you can do CICA week they located the shift tab here you can say by weekday as an argument and what

196
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.930
by weekday those is it actually sets what the weekday you're concerned with is.

197
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.460
So one is Tuesday meaning zero is Monday the start of the week.

198
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.900
So if you run this again then you get pure Mondays.

199
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:22.180
If you run three you get Thursdays up to 6 which is then Sundays.

200
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.280
So usually what you wouldn't do is just say percent I would say present sign D and you would get the

201
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.050
actual date so you can choose if you want the Sundays to be represented or the Mondays etc..

202
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:39.940
Now as quick no this is not super common to both major locater major formatter minor locator and minor

203
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:45.130
formatter unless you have a very specific story to tell and want to format your data in a very specific

204
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:45.820
way.

205
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.810
Usually we're just going to do whatever Panas this automatically and that will be fine for us.

206
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.070
We don't have to worry about setting major locaters any major formatters we'll just say essentially

207
00:14:54.070 --> 00:15:00.010
what we do all the way up here will pretty much always just say something like D column and then plot

208
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.200
it and if we really need to we'll do a couple of things like at finger size mess around X limits y limits

209
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:11.380
etc. this that we discussed on here with the major locater major formatter we really won't do that again

210
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.510
in the course but in case you ever need to for some publication purpose or want to make an image it

211
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.260
is available for you.

212
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.780
Now the last thing I want to discuss is this nice little trick they can use only with the Jupiter notebook

213
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.800
to kind of make these a little more interactive right now they're just static for us.

214
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.300
Let's go ahead and see if we can make them interactive in order to do this what you'll need to do is

215
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.430
restart the kernel Ill say hey do you want to restart the kernel.

216
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:43.290
Go ahead and say restart and then change that putting it in line to map lib notebook and then run that

217
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.150
let it run.

218
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.930
Make sure you research the kernel because if you called Matt Cutlip in line call him at public know

219
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.680
might cause some errors so you need to restart the kernel.

220
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.610
So once you called my lab notebook instead of putting it in line we're going to read in that CACP file

221
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.350
again.

222
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.130
Show the head again and then I'm going to plot it just that close column and you'll notice my plot looks

223
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.590
a little different.

224
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.880
In fact I now have different capabilities that are interactive plugin to zoom out just a little bit

225
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:16.880
so we can see as plot so zooming out I can see I have home reset the original view I have back to previous

226
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.020
view for the next view.

227
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.040
I have this pan.

228
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.140
So there's a lot and it's kind of pan around.

229
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.460
You can see how the axis are interactively changing and you can see I also have Zoom's rectangle.

230
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.520
So if I actually wanted to focus in on a particular thing maybe I want to focus in on this little slump

231
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.110
right here.

232
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.210
I can zoom in.

233
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.200
Check it out and you notice that as a hover metal cursor I have the actual x value that I'm looking

234
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.630
at and the y value and then I can keep zooming in.

235
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:43.970
Checking stuff out etc. seeing the grid lines or whatever you really are concernedly if you want to

236
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.620
see the original view you go back to home and there's little power button here so it stops interaction

237
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.400
and then it just goes back to a static plot.

238
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.200
If you want to see the plot again interactively you have to call it again.

239
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.090
OK.

240
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.060
So that can only be available right now with the Jupiter notebook.

241
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.930
Hopefully in the future they can expand on that.

242
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.230
But essentially right now Sesi magical or not magical.

243
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.510
It's a magic.

244
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.560
Jupiter come in but it feels magical because of how cool it is and it can also expand and contract the

245
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.070
size of this thing.

246
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.480
All right.

247
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.760
Hope you enjoyed that and I hope you make use of it.

248
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.200
We won't be doing this sort of interactive stuff that often because basically static plots are going

249
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.240
to be enough for us but that's a nice little tool for you to explore and you base it on how to learn

250
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.740
anything new.

251
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.280
All you had to do was restart your kernel and then this set of same.

252
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.770
I live in Lyon say mapa lib notebook.

253
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.080
All right thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
