Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,220
And this lecture we're going to quickly go over the pandas visualization exercises the problems and

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,350
in the next lecture We'll show you the solutions for them.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,070
All right here I am at the exercise notebook and basically a quick exercise for you to review the various

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,010
plots that we showed the previous lecture and what I want you to do is actually use the F 3 as the C

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,410
S V file source for data frame and this is actually already kind of laid out for you in the very beginning

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,900
and we're going to go ahead and read do throughout this exercise try to recreate the plots that are

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,440
shown in the notebook.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,570
Something to take note of is you probably want to insert cells instead of overwriting the actual cell

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,780
above the plot.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,540
Otherwise if you run something and don't get the right result you won't be able to see that plot again.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,500
So he can do is just go ahead and for instance click on this markdown instruction and then say insert

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,450
cell below and here you have an extra cell.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,320
The other way to do this automatically is by saying alt enter and that will also insert a cell below

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,720
it.

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,490
OK.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,000
That way you don't have to type in the cell and accidently overwrite this figure.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,490
Thanks everyone.

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,820
I'll see at the next lecture when we go over the solutions.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Is exercise.
