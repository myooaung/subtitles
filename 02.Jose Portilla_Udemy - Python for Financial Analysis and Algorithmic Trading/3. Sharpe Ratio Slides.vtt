00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.190
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on your portfolio and statistics.

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.010
So far we've really only analyzed individual stocks.

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.780
Now we're going to shift our attention to a more realistic understanding of a portfolio of multiple

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.530
stocks.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.520
Usually when you're doing algorithmic trading you're not just dealing with a single stock you're doing

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.640
a portfolio.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.560
So the question comes up what is a portfolio analytically and mathematically speaking to put it simply

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.750
a portfolio is just a set of allocations in a variety of securities.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.310
So for example you could have 20 percent of your total money portfolio in Apple stock 30 percent in

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.360
Facebook and then 50 percent in alphabet or Google.

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.020
These percentages should add up to 100 percent or defined as weights.

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.070
They should add up to one that is usually more we're dealing with portfolios will define things as 0.5

13
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.980
of your portfolio standing for 50 percent.

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.450
So let's review a few key statistics for a portfolio.

15
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.550
Some of the few keys to that we've already talked about are things like daily returns.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
That is the percent return from one day to the next for each stock.

17
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490
Then we also have cumulative return.

18
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.580
That is the amount return after an entire time period.

19
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.120
Then we have the average day the return which is just the mean of the daily returns and we also talked

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.990
about the standard deviation of a daily return which is just a standard deviation of the daily returns

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.000
and we can think about that as the volatility of that actual return.

22
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.720
But there's still one critical statistic we haven't actually discussed yet.

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.590
And it's the Sharpe ratio named after William Sharp.

24
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
Before we explain what it is let's give you an intuitive understanding of why it is necessary.

25
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.640
Let's imagine that we have three portfolio comparison's So for each of these cases let's try to understand

26
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.200
intuitively which portfolio is better.

27
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.400
We have an orange portfolio and a purple portfolio.

28
00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.970
If we look at case 1 the x axis just represents the time period and the y axis just represents the total

29
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.380
price of the portfolio.

30
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.560
After some sort of time period has passed with the percentage implicating how much you actually got

31
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.460
in return.

32
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.080
If you look at case 1 we can see that that orange top line it returns 8 percent and that bottom purple

33
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.510
line return the 5 percent.

34
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.610
So if you ask someone which portfolio is better in case one the orange or the purple you would probably

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.880
just intuitively say the purple it had a greater return.

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.060
If we look at Case number two in the middle both portfolios return the same amount both return to 5

37
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.020
percent.

38
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.110
So if someone asked you which one would you rather have.

39
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.700
Intuitively you would probably think you would want the purple line and that's because the purple line

40
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.840
is a lot more stable.

41
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.790
It has a lot less volatility.

42
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.800
The orange line goes all over the place it has a lot more volatility.

43
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.040
It has a lot more fluctuation meaning it has a higher risk.

44
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.720
And if they both return the same amount then you'll probably just choose the less volatile stock.

45
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.300
Then we get to something like Case 3 where we can say we have a more stable stock in purple with a 6

46
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300
percent return.

47
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.920
And we have a more volatile stock with a 12 percent return.

48
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.320
And now the question arises Well which one should we choose should you have a larger appetite for risk

49
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.950
and take the 12 percent or should you have a lower volatility and take the 6 percent what the Sharpe

50
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.480
ratio allows us to do.

51
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.920
It allows us to use mathematics in order to quantify the relationship between the mean daily return

52
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.090
and then the volatility or the standard deviation of daily returns.

53
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.640
So let's go ahead and discuss what the Sharpe ratio is actually in a formula accent's the Sharpe ratio

54
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.040
is a measure for calculating risk adjusted return and this ratio has become the industry standard for

55
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.240
such calculations.

56
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.100
And it was developed by Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe The formula for the Sharpe ratio is the following.

57
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.690
You have s is equal to r.

58
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.310
P minus r of f over Sigma P Where r p is the expected porfolio return.

59
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.170
R f is the risk free return which we'll discuss in just the second and then Sigma P is portfolio standard

60
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.250
deviation.

61
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.890
So our P and Sigma we kind of already understand just the expected portfolio return and Sigma that is

62
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.940
the volatility or standard deviation.

63
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.050
But what is risk free return a risk free return is the return you would receive if you had put your

64
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.700
money instead of putting in a portfolio into an investment such as a bank savings account.

65
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.230
And sometimes people also use Liab or Treasury bond return rates as risk free returns and all three

66
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.350
of these things are essentially risk free something to keep in mind is that currently in the United

67
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.860
States and I'm filming this in early 2017 the actual returns for a risk free investment such as putting

68
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.780
your money into a bank account are in reality very close to zero.

69
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.200
So it's just easier to approximate this risk free return for our calculations as being zero.

70
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.820
Keep in mind though the Federal Reserve may continue to raise interest rates in the future affecting

71
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.050
this result.

72
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.420
I know there are some online banks that have a return of 1 percent on a savings account.

73
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.210
So you could also use that as your approximation for a risk free return in this class.

74
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.390
And you'll notice that in a lot of other online studies people are just using zero because that's what

75
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.090
it's been for such a long time.

76
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.770
So for now assuming that rate of risk return is zero we get that the Sharpe ratio is just equal to the

77
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.280
mean return divided by the standard deviation.

78
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.920
Keep in mind the Sharpe ratio was actually originally thought of as a yearly metric.

79
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.980
That is a mean yearly return versus a mean daily return.

80
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.670
So and William Sharp was actually formulating this.

81
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.200
He thought people were going to write an mean yearly return divided by the standard deviation over the

82
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.030
year.

83
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.980
However we're usually dealing with daily data or maybe even weekly data and it's actually really easy

84
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.140
for us to fix this ratio to become a yearly return ratio.

85
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.510
So we're going to call this the annualized Sharpe ratio.

86
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.710
And it can be attained by multiplying a K factor against your sampling rate.

87
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.840
So if your data has a daily sampling rate then what you have do is set K equal to the square root of

88
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.860
252.

89
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.810
We have 252 business days in a year.

90
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.810
If you have weekly data you'll multiply your sampling Sharpe ratio by the square of 52 and if you have

91
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.720
monthly data you'll just multiply it by the square of 12.

92
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.950
So what does that actually mean.

93
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.610
Well if we go back and you're using this formula of mean return divided by standard deviation and you

94
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.950
happen to calculate mean return instead of deviation on daily data to get the annualize sharp ratio

95
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.130
you would just take your case.

96
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.030
In this case daily square of 2:52 and multiply it by the sharp ratio and that gives you the annualized

97
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.350
Sharper's issue.

98
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.510
Now if you're the one with yearly data and you actually just have straight up the yearly standard deviation

99
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.090
and the yearly mean or return then you don't have to do any sort of K factor multiplication.

100
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.170
All right let's see how to actually do all of this with python in the next lecture.

101
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.770
We'll open up a Jupiter notebook and code all this out.

102
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.730
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
