00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,350
Hello everyone and welcome to the stock market analysis capstone project.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,080
I want to welcome you to your first large project.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,030
This project is going to guide you through using all the skills you've covered in the first half of

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,830
the course.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,640
The first half of the course really focused on teaching you the basic libraries that were going to be

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,810
using throughout the course.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,560
Things like pi panels for data analysis that lived for visualization etc. and also using things like

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,170
stat's models for time series analysis.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,060
The second half the course is going to focus on using all those skills in financial analysis situations

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,390
as well as algorithmic trading everything you need for this project is located under the fold or stock

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,710
market analysis some project which is in the top level of that SIV file.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,680
There's an exercise Jupiter notebook as well as a solution's Jupiter notebook.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,750
There's also some CNC files you can use in case you need them.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,170
I want you to note that this project exercise is optional.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,650
You can basically treat it as an exercise where you open up the exercise notebook work through it do

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,820
the reading and then answer the questions in it.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,460
Or you can treat it as a code long project where you go with the solutions lecture.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,910
Coming up next and actually just follow along in code along with me whatever your style preferences

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,610
go ahead and go for it.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,130
Now there's a few bonus tasks inside the exercise notebook such as the candlestick visualization that

21
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,720
require exploring the documentation.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,860
There's a couple of things to do some of these bonus tasks that we actually haven't covered yet so feel

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,100
free to skip these and wait until the solutions lecture to actually see how they're done.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,200
Or if you're feeling up to the challenge go ahead and go for it.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,530
Another major part of this project is to slowly introduce a few new financial concepts to get us ready

26
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,140
for the second half of the course.

27
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,580
These are just basic things like returns and cumulative daily returns.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,600
The methods for these financial analysis techniques are described really thoroughly in the notebooks.

29
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,990
So quite a bit of reading will be involved this project to make it a full learning experience so when

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,580
you're learning how to actually calculate the cumulative daily returns there's some things to read in

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:10,270
that actual exercise notebook and one last note the note book will want you to use panderers data reader

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,250
in order to actually get stock information directly with Pancho's from the internet.

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,480
However for some geographical locations or if your computer has a firewall or you don't have full admin

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,720
settings that may actually limit your use of Pandurs data reader.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,970
So all the CSB files that you're going to be using are provided just in case you need them.

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,750
All right let's explore the exercise notebook and walk you through it so you can decide how you would

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,980
like to approach the project either as a fool exercise or as a code along solutions project.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,220
Let's hop over the exercise notebook now.

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:40,850
OK.

40
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,360
Under the Python for finance repo folder you have the stock market analysis capstone project.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,250
You can go ahead and open up the stock market analysis project notebook and then the corresponding note

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,380
book for the solution.

43
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,580
No but don't click on that unless you actually want to see the solutions that click on stock market

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,150
analysis that will open up this notebook.

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,280
And here we have the stock market analysis project.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,640
And then here's the note again.

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,060
If you treat this as a fool exercise or just be the solutions that have be echoed along.

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,330
So there's your first capital project and then zoom out just a little bit so we can read some of this

49
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,000
stuff.

50
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,950
So separate out into parts so part zero just importing various libraries.

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,800
Then part one getting that data.

52
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,240
So this project focuses on car companies and analyzing the returns of car companies and comparing them

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,920
to each other.

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,990
So we focus on comparing things like the Tesla company versus the general motors versus Ford and how

55
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,680
their stock performs from January 1st 2012 to January 1st 2017.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,890
So we're just dealing of historical data here.

57
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,720
So we have getting the data.

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,790
So using Panas data reader again in case you can't use Pandurs data reader we had the cxxviii files

59
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,470
for you.

60
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,830
So it walks you through getting the data and then also wants you to repeat this step for Ford and General

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,700
Motors.

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,810
So then once you get that data there some visualization tasks.

63
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,160
So I want you to visualize things like a basic plot of what the stock performance looks like so you

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,960
can see here Tesla much higher than General Motors and Ford although keep in mind this doesn't take

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,790
into account things like total market cap.

66
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,700
This is just price per stock.

67
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,720
Then I also want you to plot the volume of stock trading each day.

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,740
Things like that.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,880
And then there's a little bonus question what happened that day.

70
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,880
So these little bonus questions require you to do a little bit of Google searching.

71
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,570
For instance Ford has a really big spike in late 2013.

72
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,390
I want to ask like what happened that day.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Like what is this day.

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,090
Cetera.

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,130
And an example answers right there.

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,540
There's also some more questions here.

77
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,870
Trading total traded et cetera more plots moving average plots.

78
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,220
We've discussed those already scatterplot which which we've also discussed seen trends et cetera.

79
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,310
Then there's this bonus visualization task.

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,460
This is really hard.

81
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,940
Well not really hardish just requires you to kind of check up this finance demo documentation and eventually

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,660
if you actually end up doing it you'll get a little candlestick plot that looks something like this.

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,920
Now we haven't actually covered how to do this yet so always feel free to kind of skip this bonus task

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,550
here.

85
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,510
So going along we come to part 3 which is the basic financial analysis so this is where we actually

86
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,480
begin to focus on a few key financial calculations.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,960
Nothing too crazy just things like daily percent change which is the daily percent change formulated

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,840
by the price at time t divided by the price.

89
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,260
T minus one minus one.

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,830
So the ratio of the current price divided by yesterday's price minus one.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,310
And that's your return which makes sense because it's basically the ratio of how much you made from

92
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,220
yesterday and then you'll calculate returns.

93
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,480
You'll keep going down.

94
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,220
There's some more stuff with moving averages etc. you'll do some histograms kind of measuring volatility

95
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,990
here are the various stocks.

96
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,620
Compare them one on top of each other so more visualisations you'll do some kernel density estimation

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,790
plot's you'll do some box plots etc..

98
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,150
He'll compare daily returns between the stocks see if something's correlated or not so you can see kind

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,430
of Ford and GM have a higher correlation versus Tesla and then you have cumulative daily returns so

100
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,930
there's a little bit of reading here free to do in case you don't know how to actually calculate cumulative

101
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,150
daily returns.

102
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,800
There's a little bit of explanation of a daily return versus a cumulative return.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,540
There's also some formulas here you can follow.

104
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,850
And here's the formula here.

105
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,610
And then here's the actual Pancho's formula that you'll be using.

106
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,960
So you'll do that you'll calculate it you'll get the returns and then the cumulative return and then

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,760
you'll plot them out.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,020
And that's the end of the project.

109
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,290
If you have any questions feel free to post on to Q&amp;A forums or just check out the solutions lecture

110
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,940
or I'll be explaining everything and a lot more detail as we actually cut through the projects.

111
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,600
OK.

112
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,890
Best of luck and remember you can approach this project however you feel best works for you.

113
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,290
I'll see if the solution is lectures.
