00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.760
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on rolling and expanding.

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.220
We can use pandas built in rolling methods to create things like a rolling mean based off a given time

3
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.900
period.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.470
Let's quickly discuss what a rolling method can be used for often daily financial data can be a bit

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.350
noisy.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.590
Well we can do is use the rolling mean which is often called a moving average to get more signal about

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.520
the general trends.

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.520
The data you'll provide a window of a set time period and then use that to calculate whatever your aggregate

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.460
statistic is such as the mean or average.

10
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.240
Let's see what this actually looks like with pandas in her Jupiter notebook.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.470
All right.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.430
Here I am at my Jupiter notebook I've imported both pandas and Matt plotless.

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.580
We will be applauding in this lectures we can visually see that rolling and expanding method and then

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.730
have also imported the Wal-Mart stock data that we've been working with with the index column being

15
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.150
that they have all said states to be true.

16
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.010
Let's just take a quick look or data one more time.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.050
We have an open high low close volume just that close.

18
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.380
And then some sort of date time index.

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.950
So let's go ahead and plot this.

20
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:19.760
I'll say DMF open I will plot this and figure syas have it be 16 by six that should give us a nice little

21
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:28.760
plot and here I can see the actual daily data all the way from early 2012 to late 2016.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.730
So there's quite a bit of noise because this is daily data would be nice.

23
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.990
I can average this out by the week so we can actually do a moving average or what's known as a rolling

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.220
mean as well using panderers.

25
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.110
So the way you do this is either on a particular column or series or on the entire data frame you call

26
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.510
the rolling method.

27
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.550
So you will say if rolling shift tab here and you'll see the actual arguments seek capacity will focus

28
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.930
mainly on the window argument or the window.

29
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.410
We'd take a look at this.

30
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.070
That is the size of the moving window and this is the number of observations used for calculating the

31
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.840
statistic.

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.030
So this case we're going to do is say seven because I want every previous seven days to be calculated

33
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.410
with.

34
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.790
And then we actually add in the aggregate statistic as if we're doing something like a group by in this

35
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.440
case we'll do mean and then let's just get the head of 20.

36
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.600
So that's going to be returning the first 20 rows.

37
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.660
So we don't need that many probably say 14.

38
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.610
OK so Notice what happens here.

39
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.160
The very first six values those have all become blank.

40
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.080
And if we look at the value for 2012 111 that's become fifty nine point four nine.

41
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.940
And the next value is almost the exact same it's really similar.

42
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.650
Now what's actually going on here is this first data point that we get with an actual value.

43
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.920
Fifty nine point four nine that is the average or mean of these first seven rows.

44
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.450
Now the reason the first six rows are blank is because there wasn't enough data to actually fill that

45
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.920
in.

46
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.920
We specified We want a window of seven.

47
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.530
So this first six rows all had less than 7 points to aggregate with.

48
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.680
So that's where they all get filled in.

49
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.410
No.

50
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.370
So what are the major effects of calculating a moving average or using this rolling method.

51
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.160
Is that our data becomes a lot less noisy and becomes more reflective of the trend than the actual data.

52
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.930
I can see here that this point fifty nine point nine is very similar to fifty nine point four six which

53
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.270
is again really similar to the nine point three too.

54
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.450
You don't get such noisy jumps on the daily data because you're averaging the previous seven days.

55
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.550
Let's actually plot this out so you can see this visually.

56
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.120
Well say with open.

57
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.270
So that's our original data frame.

58
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.890
This rolling doesn't actually take place on the original data frame.

59
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.580
So just to show you that real quick if I call my data frame notice still has all the original information

60
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.110
there.

61
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.630
So this is not in place.

62
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.220
Operation.

63
00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.100
So coming back here I'm going to call my original open column that I'm going to plot it out.

64
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.640
Then on top of that we'll say if rolling and let's actually just to really show the effect here will

65
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.790
make the window be 7s on the same window.

66
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.980
Is 7.

67
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.290
And then we'll keep expanding that to more and more days.

68
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.370
So that's the average and then off of that data frame data from I just showed above.

69
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.940
I will call the close call them and then plot that out as well.

70
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.950
So let's run that and see what we get.

71
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.670
So this isn't a good figure size to actually show what's going on so let's adjust the figure size let's

72
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.310
say for your size is equal to 16:6.

73
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.900
All right if we take a look at this plot we end up seeing is that blue line that is the original open

74
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.790
price data.

75
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.290
And then we also see the rolling close that seven day average.

76
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.800
And notice that the orange line that rolling day seven they close that ends up having not as much noise

77
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.810
as the blue line.

78
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.550
You can see that certain big jumps are set in big drops that happen on the span of just one day or a

79
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.650
few days don't get reflected in that orange line.

80
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.500
Now to really see this effect especially for such a long time series we're going over the span of several

81
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.110
years.

82
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.510
So a weekly rolling average isn't a whole lot.

83
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.490
Let's actually make this 30 days and then we can see the 30 day moving average on our dataset.

84
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.230
Now something to keep in mind once you run this is that those first 29 days aren't going to have that

85
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.320
orange line because there wasn't enough data to actually calculate that rolling mean.

86
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.100
And now you can definitely see how it's pretty much just the main trend of the actual stock data.

87
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.610
So it's kind of like to kind of detect where the stock price may go based off the previous 30 days of

88
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.420
values.

89
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.250
So you can see here there's definitely a trend to go down here based off the 30 days of values you can

90
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.400
see kind of plateaus.

91
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.490
And there's a lot less noise here and you can keep expanding this obviously the larger you expand this

92
00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.060
window the more you focus on just the general trend over a longer period of time versus actually focusing

93
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.630
on those actually daily movements.

94
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.520
So if I run this again then I can see the 3 month or 90 day trend goes up kind of flattens out a bit.

95
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.350
Then there's a big drop and then it starts coming back up again.

96
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.000
Okay.

97
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.400
So there's lots of ways to actually add in a legend to this to show you one of the easier ways.

98
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.320
So the easiest way to add a legend is just make that rolling value add new column and then panderers

99
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.430
will automatically add in the legend.

100
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.470
So how to do that.

101
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.970
Or essentially just going to say the close price.

102
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.520
Well it's actually a close 30 day.

103
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.930
So moving average.

104
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.080
And I know it's at that equal to close.

105
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.080
And I can call rolling not just off the entire data frame but also the series or column itself.

106
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.770
And then I'll call window 30 mean.

107
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.500
And then once we've done that I can actually just pass on a list of those column names so I'll say close

108
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:05.400
30 day May and let's make sure there's actually a list of column names because when I passed one more

109
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.240
in next I'm going to pass and is just the normal close.

110
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.140
And then I can plot that out.

111
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.560
Well let's give this nice big size let's say big size.

112
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.230
What we've been working of 16 by six so now running that even though the colors have switched.

113
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.390
I can actually see the labels themselves so closely they close and you can use all your matte plotless

114
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.770
skills to change just color the style this to whatever you prefer.

115
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.940
Just keep in mind that when you actually call off a single data frame multiple columns paint those will

116
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.670
automatically make that nice little legend for you.

117
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.260
OK.

118
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.490
So now what do you do if you want to take into account everything from the start the time series to

119
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.260
the actual rolling point of the value.

120
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:51.240
So for instance not just take into account a period of seven days or 30 days but instead take in to

121
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.410
account everything since the beginning of the time series to where you are in that current point.

122
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.270
Well the way you can do this is with the expanding method.

123
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.980
So let me show you how you can use that in order to do this.

124
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:01.910
Quite simple.

125
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:09.090
We'll just say DMF the clothes column and then instead of calling rolling I will call expanding

126
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.170
in the expanding method it has this argument of minimum periods.

127
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.690
That is the actual minimum number of periods you need.

128
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.890
You can just leave it as one that basically means it just needs one period to start calculating the

129
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:29.860
expanding mean and then we're going to plot this out let's call Fix size of what we did before 16 by

130
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.270
6 so if we run this now we get this result.

131
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280
So what does this plot actually represent.

132
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:45.090
Well basically each particular time stamp on the x axis what is shown on the y axis is the actual value

133
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.210
of everything that came before it averaged out.

134
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.310
So that's why you get this big long trend line instead of something like this where it actually focused

135
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.800
on the actual movements.

136
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.050
Basically this very last point that is the average of all the values that came before it and the halfway

137
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.850
point is the average of all that.

138
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.470
That first half that came before it etc..

139
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.690
So that's just expanding it essentially takes into account everything since the beginning of the time

140
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.190
series to the current point on the x axis.

141
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.600
And this just shows kind of major trends.

142
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.330
But depending on the length the time series it may or may not be that helpful.

143
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.180
So this kind of indicates that since the very beginning or average price has risen but it won't reflect

144
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.640
something like a drop in the price during the middle of a time series so we can see here that on average

145
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:36.360
in the very beginning we had $60 and then at the very end of that time series comes out around 70.

146
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.110
So this is sort of reflected here.

147
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.400
But again don't take that as kind of a one to one comparison because there could be kind of a huge rise

148
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.480
in the middle and a huge drop and that would end up eating out.

149
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.540
So keep that in mind.

150
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:54.230
It may not reflect the beginning versus the end there's just a general expanding mean from the beginning

151
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.970
of the time series wherever you are at that point.

152
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.670
So I just wanted to be aware that you can use that will be using rolling a lot more often than expanding.

153
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.650
Now before we end this lecture in future section of the course we're going to be talking a lot more

154
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.770
about financial analysis plots and technical indicators.

155
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.360
But since we're actually talking about rolling means and moving averages right now it's a really good

156
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.150
idea to introduce one financial analysis or technical indicator that's really common to use and it's

157
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.300
called the Bolinger band and you may have even seen it yourself before.

158
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.830
So let's hop over to some slides explain what the Buller's your bands are and then we'll hop back to

159
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.340
this Jupiter notebook and code them out ourselves.

160
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.410
All right so let's take a brief moment to discuss Bollinger bands.

161
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.140
This is what a Bollinger Band actually looks like and they're Bolinger bands were developed by John

162
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.100
Bolinger.

163
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.770
Essentially what they are they're volatility bands placed above and below a moving average where the

164
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:54.190
volatility is based on the standard deviation which changes as volatility increases or decreases and

165
00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:00.370
the bands will automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow and volatility decreases and

166
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.810
the dynamic nature of the bowl and your bands also means that they can be used on different securities

167
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.890
with the standard setting so you can use them on a variety of securities or stocks.

168
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.810
So for signals Bollinger bands can be used to identify tops and bottoms or to the term and the strength

169
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.160
of the actual trend.

170
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.480
Let's take a look at this plot a little more closely.

171
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.870
That blue line that middle blue line that is the original closing price and then the orange line is

172
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.860
the 20 day means so typically Bollinger bands use a 20 day period as their movie average.

173
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:34.170
But other analysis techniques can increase those actual moving average windows.

174
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:40.130
And then we see the actual bands themselves so the top green line that is the upper bands and the lower

175
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.770
red line that is the lower band.

176
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.840
So those are the Bolger bands themselves.

177
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.700
The two middle lines those are just what we did before the moving average with the Borgir bands actually

178
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.930
are is that Greenline and the red.

179
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.910
So we can see that as the stock becomes more volatile.

180
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.830
Those bands actually expand.

181
00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.930
So for example we can see in 2016 that fifth month or maybe in 2016.

182
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.810
June there was kind of a drop and then a big spike or jump.

183
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.680
So that would mean that your standard deviation is jumping or moving really drastically with such a

184
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.540
large jump in the closing price.

185
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:20.000
The trend that will close 20 they mean reflects that a little bit of a tiny drop but the actual jump

186
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.890
in price is much better reflected with those Bollinger bands based off the standard deviation instead

187
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.360
of the mean.

188
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.050
So you can see that there is kind of a jump in there expansion indicating that theres a lot more volatility

189
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.940
for that time period and based off your quantitative trading algorithm you may want to trade more when

190
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.130
it's more volatile or you may want to close that position if it's too volatile for you.

191
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.560
So basically what people can use these bands for is to determine whether a price movement is significant

192
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.350
or not.

193
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.810
So technically prices are relatively high when they're actually above the upper band.

194
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:57.010
So you can see there's a few points such as in right before February of 2016.

195
00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:03.410
We see the blue spike a little bit above that upper band and we can definitely see it in May 2016 that

196
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.920
is spikes below the lower band.

197
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.670
So again this is not just a kind of straight indicator of whether you should buy or sell.

198
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:16.220
So a relatively high price should not be regarded as bearish or as a cell signal and the relatively

199
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.390
low price should not be considered bullish or as a signal.

200
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.820
You know prices are higher low for a particular reason.

201
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.050
So as other indicators Bollinger Bands are not meant to be used as a standalone tool to do your trade

202
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.580
off.

203
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.540
There's just one other technical analysis or one other indicator that you can use and factor into your

204
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.620
decisions.

205
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.390
So let's hop over to the Jupiter notebook and actually code some of this out.

206
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.390
All right so let's actually go through the process of creating the Bolinger pants and it's really actually

207
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.160
quite simple with pandas.

208
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.230
So the first thing I'm going to comment on are actual steps we need to create three columns and then

209
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.110
put in our close call them along with it.

210
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:57.210
So the first column I want to make is the closing price 20 day moving average then I'm going to create

211
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:06.000
the upper band and the upper band that's going to be equal to that 20 day moving average plus two times

212
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.280
the standard deviation over 20 days.

213
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:17.810
So it's going to be basically rolling dot SDD and then the lower band is going to be equal to that 20

214
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:24.410
day moving average minus two time whoops minus two times the standard deviation.

215
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.600
Over the past 20 days.

216
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.860
And then finally we'll have the close column which we already have.

217
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.000
OK so let's create this closing day 20 day moving average source HCF close

218
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.590
20 they mean.

219
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.830
And as I mentioned before Ballinger bands can be used on a variety of window sizes so there's not to

220
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:50.470
be 20 it can be 30 can be seven different algorithms or different people use different band sizes or

221
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.460
window sizes.

222
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:58.140
And we're going to basis off the original close call them and then call rerolling give this a window

223
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:03.860
of 20 days and then call mean that mean to get the average off of it.

224
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:12.670
Then for the upper band I'll create a column called Upper and then I'll set that equal to the close

225
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:27.030
20 day mean that I just created and I'm going to add two times the close column and hearing to say rolling

226
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.720
the window 20.

227
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.300
But instead of calling me I'm going to call SDD for the standard deviation.

228
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.940
So essentially here I'm just grabbing and get me the standard deviation of a rolling window of 20 previously

229
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.730
asked for the average and I'm just asking for a standard deviation.

230
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.040
Multiply it by two.

231
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:49.350
And then add that indicating the volatility as the upper bands of 20 day moving average and then I'm

232
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:57.390
going to copy and paste this for the lower in all you do here is instead of saying upper call this slower

233
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.960
and instead of saying Plus I'm subtracting.

234
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:05.340
So this is basically kind of her indicator of volatility the standard deviation over the past 20 days

235
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:11.950
multiplied by two and will add and subtract that as our upper and lower bands once we've done that.

236
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.610
We're actually ready to plot them all.

237
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:26.080
So we'll say give me the close give me the close 20 they mean and then give me the upper bands and the

238
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.950
lower bands.

239
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.160
And make sure I have a comma there.

240
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.170
And I'm going to plot this out and it's given a nice size.

241
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:45.740
Will say size is equal to 16:6 And if we scroll down here we have kind of a really long time series

242
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.250
data set.

243
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.720
So it may not be super clear but hopefully you can see that I have these two bands that green tends

244
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.650
to usually be above the blue just like why is the red tenso usually be below the blue.

245
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.070
And then the orange is that actual moving trend line there.

246
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:05.030
So we would kind of assume that if there's blue movement above the green line or below the red line

247
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.500
something's happening here where we should take a closer look.

248
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:14.660
And if you want to just kind of zone in on a particular part of this dataset you could just use indexing

249
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.920
or for instance if you just want to focus on the end you could use something like just say tail of the

250
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.920
last 200 days and just plot that.

251
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.060
And this way the lights kind of indicate what we saw in the slides earlier.

252
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.540
All right.

253
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.460
So we'll be seeing a lot more financial analysis plots and technical indicators in the future.

254
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:36.430
But since this one's so closely related to using rolling I wanted to mention it here in this lecture.

255
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:36.920
OK.

256
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.450
I hope you enjoyed learning how to use those with time series data.

257
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.200
Coming up next is kind of a little capstone project to aggregate everything that we've learned in the

258
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.590
first half of the Course and talk a little bit more about financial analysis.

259
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.390
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section of the course.
