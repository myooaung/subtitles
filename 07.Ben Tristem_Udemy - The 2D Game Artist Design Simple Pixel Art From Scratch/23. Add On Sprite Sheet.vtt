00:04.230 --> 00:07.710
Hello and welcome to this lecture where we are going to generate a sprite.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.260
She as you can see here it's one long one.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.770
However again it is just one click to get there.

00:14.100 --> 00:18.250
OK everyone this is going to be a really quick lecture because it is one click.

00:18.390 --> 00:24.240
Now I'm joking we've got some other stuff to learn as we go here as well because there are a few things

00:24.240 --> 00:30.170
that both apply to the previous filter and this one that will trip you up at some point.

00:30.180 --> 00:31.620
So let's get going straightaway.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.670
First of all the use of it.

00:33.690 --> 00:38.880
Well if we go ahead and open up an animation that we've already made like this bouncing ball that we're

00:38.880 --> 00:45.030
so familiar with at the moment we do not have to change the order of the layers so we don't have to

00:45.330 --> 00:49.230
flip that up as we've done with the previous filter.

00:49.230 --> 00:55.500
However this one when we go to filters and Sprite sheets right at the very bottom and create from layers

00:55.950 --> 00:59.070
you can see that it creates a nice long spreadsheet.

00:59.340 --> 01:06.180
However the issue with this if we have a look at the very top is it's two thousand five hundred and

01:06.180 --> 01:07.770
sixty pixels wide.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.370
Now that's beyond the 2048 hard limit that we're imposing.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.290
So at this point you'd have to chop it up somehow.

01:15.470 --> 01:20.110
And there's no way of putting things on other layers with this particular tool.

01:20.130 --> 01:25.260
So in that case the other one would be more appropriate if you will sprite's however managed to fit

01:25.260 --> 01:25.800
in this.

01:25.830 --> 01:33.000
This would be a great way of working with it or indeed if you've got a target platform or happily take

01:33.300 --> 01:34.710
that size texture.

01:34.770 --> 01:41.340
Remember the issue is not necessarily whether or not the game engine or other application can initially

01:41.340 --> 01:42.810
imported to and use it.

01:42.810 --> 01:48.390
But if you're working on a mobile device you may find this is beat on the actual memory the graphics

01:48.390 --> 01:53.100
memory that you can assign to your image and if it is one big image like this you'll come across some

01:53.100 --> 01:53.770
problems.

01:53.860 --> 02:00.420
But again that's up to you to decide where it's going and then making your spec from the specifications

02:00.570 --> 02:02.300
of the target platform.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.760
Okay so this is all very well we've just done one click and we got ourselves a spreadsheet.

02:06.770 --> 02:07.410
Brilliant.

02:07.410 --> 02:08.490
Now what's next.

02:08.490 --> 02:10.800
Well occasionally you will run into an issue.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.410
Now when I was playing around with this I came across this issue and it did make me scratch my head

02:16.410 --> 02:17.150
for a moment.

02:17.340 --> 02:24.050
So if I go back to the sunsets that we made a couple of lectures backed with these stars setting is

02:24.060 --> 02:29.640
great everything's in the right order when we just go to filter's Sprite sheet and create from layers

02:29.640 --> 02:31.350
we don't have to reorder anything.

02:31.470 --> 02:31.860
You go.

02:31.940 --> 02:32.620
I can't see anything.

02:32.630 --> 02:41.460
Well just let me turn this back on so we can see the first one is we've got a faded first image in here.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.700
Why's that happened.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.890
Well we can have a look at that in more detail in a bit.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.360
I'm guessing one of my players has the capacity turned all the way down.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.580
But also there's this dead space at the very bottom where's all this come from.

02:52.950 --> 02:59.940
Well what happens when you use these tools is it takes the actual layers themselves into account not

03:00.000 --> 03:01.610
the canvas size.

03:01.620 --> 03:09.060
So if we go ahead and issues the other tool just for reference and go filters combine and fuse layers

03:09.100 --> 03:11.430
and I don't mind going to do this five.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.410
You'll see we get the same thing here.

03:13.410 --> 03:18.900
It's made it into a nice spreadsheet but it's automatically got this sort of banding in the middle and

03:18.900 --> 03:20.900
that's come from somewhere.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.250
We have a look at the source file itself.

03:23.250 --> 03:30.990
We can see that the layer itself extends below the canvas and that is what is pushing this extra Alpher

03:31.140 --> 03:32.310
into our scene.

03:32.340 --> 03:39.890
The sky fits in the ground is shoved below the darkness itself is fine and the stars are also finds

03:39.900 --> 03:46.380
it is this ground LA hair on every single layer that's giving us almost like an artificial padding around

03:46.410 --> 03:53.220
our image that we don't necessarily want because we've got no control over that so it is important to

03:53.220 --> 03:57.960
watch out for that it will happen from time to time if you've got something slightly off the screen.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.050
It's going to change the dimensions in this case.

04:01.050 --> 04:07.200
For instance if this ball itself had ended up in the final one so let's go to the final one actually

04:07.200 --> 04:10.180
and recreate this in the final one here.

04:10.230 --> 04:17.910
If the ball had ended up off slightly we would have ended up with a slightly different size final Sprite

04:17.910 --> 04:19.540
sheet being generated.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.290
Now we have a look at the order these are coming across.

04:22.290 --> 04:23.810
This was absolutely fine.

04:23.820 --> 04:29.650
We haven't got any outfit out and we've got one two three four five so we got 20 in total.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.400
I am going to count these really quick.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.640
We've also got 20 there.

04:33.640 --> 04:41.040
However this first one is alferd out so we scroll down to this first one frame one the pastie is turned

04:41.040 --> 04:46.380
all the way down if we turn that all the way up there we go we've got our image back and I'm happy with

04:46.380 --> 04:46.880
that.

04:46.890 --> 04:52.080
It's usually something as straightforward as that when you're working with a file if you've inadvertently

04:52.110 --> 04:53.840
brought it across it will end up like that now.

04:53.850 --> 05:00.390
Interestingly when we use this tool notice it's brought everything across with it including all the

05:00.390 --> 05:01.610
multiple layers.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.420
Apart from the last one.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.650
It's a solid layer.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.270
Well what's going on there.

05:06.560 --> 05:12.800
Well it's because this solid layer at the top was visible when we run the tool.

05:12.840 --> 05:17.560
If we go back and do that again but this time turn on all the other layers.

05:17.660 --> 05:21.180
And of course turn the A pastie up on frame one.

05:21.210 --> 05:27.980
Now if we go ahead and go to Sprite she can create from layers you can see not only have we got everything

05:28.040 --> 05:30.490
in a row there and without the alpha.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.620
We've also got one single layer that's come across.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.940
And incidentally if we had hidden everything so you can't see anything.

05:37.940 --> 05:43.010
Well let's go back to your original if we'd hidden everything so you can't see anything at all and run

05:43.010 --> 05:47.980
the same thing again the Sprite she create from layers and then turn everything back on you notice we've

05:47.990 --> 05:53.700
got the complete control of everything including that top layer as well.

05:53.720 --> 05:59.050
So this has its advantages that we can make a sprite sheet that's still editable.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.470
Whereas before when we did it.

06:02.530 --> 06:09.640
These ones are not as editable as having all of the layers intact so you can fiddle with them.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.910
Of course once we've done this we know that these bits are dead on the bottom we can actually go into

06:14.980 --> 06:20.730
image camber size and the bottom bit I can set that to 64.

06:20.890 --> 06:26.350
So it's not high enough to cause any issues and it's very hard to see the preview of the offset I'm

06:26.350 --> 06:29.150
going to leave it as 0 0 and see what happens.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.340
That's absolutely fine.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.300
So it's taking zero zero is this top left hand corner.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.260
In fact it's labelled 0 0 so everything is offset from there.

06:38.260 --> 06:44.350
So that is quite easy to clean that up if you do have these extended outlets you don't want to go in

06:44.590 --> 06:50.250
and have to do a lot of editing to your original image which could be a real pain to sort out.

06:50.410 --> 06:56.870
And the challenge for this lecture is to create a sprite sheet using the Sprite sheet script test the

06:56.870 --> 07:02.600
sprite's she works nice and straight forward go ahead pulls the video now and give that a go.

07:04.790 --> 07:05.430
Oh OK everyone.

07:05.450 --> 07:06.100
Welcome back.

07:06.230 --> 07:11.280
Let's go ahead and just make sure we can make a spreadsheet using the Sprite sheet script.

07:12.110 --> 07:14.200
Okay so here I've opened up guimpe refresh.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.540
I'm going to go and find one of my other pieces of work for five.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.080
And then we go ahead and open that for some reason took in e.on to do.

07:23.150 --> 07:23.470
Right.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.170
Let's have a look.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.150
I've got plenty of options here.

07:27.140 --> 07:35.750
I will do my portcullis slamming down and I'm going to use my flattened version but the XY f rather

07:35.750 --> 07:37.220
than the GIF itself.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.550
So I've got all my frames laid out there are 10 of them in total.

07:41.660 --> 07:48.620
We can go to filter's now sprite's sheet create from layers and we can see here that it's actually extended

07:48.620 --> 07:49.070
the frame.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.460
No we don't want that extension but that's perfectly natural.

07:52.460 --> 07:57.860
It's going to happen when we're just moving layers about as worthwhile knowing.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.290
That and we can chop that off of course.

08:00.380 --> 08:05.570
But this time we need to make sure we're the offset is not zero zero it's going to be a bit further

08:05.570 --> 08:06.380
down.

08:06.570 --> 08:10.850
But in this case I'm not quite sure how much further down it's going to be it might be worth setting

08:10.850 --> 08:12.940
it at the very bottom down here.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.620
You can see it's one hundred and eighty three.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.360
So we just need to work it out from there.

08:17.360 --> 08:22.750
I'm guessing this is going to be around 50 pixels tall or something along those lines.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.410
But I can work around that.

08:24.450 --> 08:25.190
Some going to do that.

08:25.190 --> 08:29.380
First of all no go to the canvas size and set the offsets.

08:29.520 --> 08:37.970
We I know is hungry 83 some of them are set the y value at 183 and have the new size the new height

08:38.270 --> 08:42.540
and probably have to go in and do that by itself one to eight.

08:42.650 --> 08:48.860
And this was going to be a hundred and eighty three now fat by moving it around I can see that it is

08:48.860 --> 08:52.130
in fact minus 55 which makes sense.

08:52.130 --> 08:52.740
There we go.

08:52.750 --> 08:53.710
Yes all done.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.160
That's right size.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.260
Perfect.

08:56.270 --> 09:02.660
So the final thing here to do is to export that as a P N G which is fine.

09:02.660 --> 09:05.710
It's not kept the name because it's a new file.

09:05.720 --> 09:11.990
I'm going to call it a port portcullis slam Sprite sheet and I'm going to export that.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.590
Okay so now that that's done the next stage of course is to make sure that it works.

09:17.600 --> 09:23.280
So let's go ahead and open up that file I've just made how we can see straighter ways the wrong size

09:23.280 --> 09:28.210
so that set it a one to eight by 1 to weights and it's not got the right number of frames.

09:28.220 --> 09:32.020
And as always I've not counted the number of frames for them.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.700
See if I can do it from here yet it's 10 frames long there's no padding or anything else along those

09:37.700 --> 09:38.160
lines.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.370
Frame counts 10.

09:40.380 --> 09:47.400
There we go slamming down and let's set this at the appropriate frame time which is 100 milliseconds.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.350
Looks really good.

09:48.350 --> 09:51.580
Let's zoom in so we can see what's going on.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.180
I'm going to say that for.

09:53.300 --> 09:53.870
There we go.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.070
Perfect.

09:55.070 --> 09:56.630
How did you guys get on.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.300
I'd love to see your Sprite sheets.

09:58.310 --> 10:02.730
Do share them over on the forum and I will see you in the next lecture.
