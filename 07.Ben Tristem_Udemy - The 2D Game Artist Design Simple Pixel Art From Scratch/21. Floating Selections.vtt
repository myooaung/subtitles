00:04.220 --> 00:06.080
Hey everyone and welcome back.

00:06.080 --> 00:11.930
In this letter we're going to be talking about floating layers and there's even in the guimpe manual

00:11.930 --> 00:12.920
itself.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.990
It's one of the top causes for people getting stuck in guimpe.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.330
It's happened to me several times a busy working on your project only to find that it looks like gimp

00:23.330 --> 00:25.000
has become unresponsive.

00:25.130 --> 00:31.400
I'll make sure this link is available in the lecture resources for you so you can have a good read of

00:31.400 --> 00:31.630
it.

00:31.670 --> 00:37.670
If you need to but for the time being let's hop over into guimpe and start looking at these floating

00:37.670 --> 00:38.830
selections.

00:39.170 --> 00:44.510
Okay so we're back over in GIMP and the first thing that I want to do here of course is to have something

00:44.510 --> 00:46.230
to select to demonstrate this.

00:46.230 --> 00:51.310
I'm going to go to file new and create a new file that's 32 by 32.

00:51.320 --> 01:00.590
And as always zoom in now floating selections can occur manually and they can curl automatically depending

01:00.590 --> 01:06.410
on the tools that you're using and one of the big questions of course is why would he use a floating

01:06.410 --> 01:07.230
selection.

01:07.270 --> 01:13.970
Well a floating selection is like a temporary layer not show you that in action in a few moments.

01:14.090 --> 01:17.860
Now often you just create a new layer and work on that.

01:17.870 --> 01:22.550
However there may be times where you need to take the lay you're currently working on take a selection

01:22.550 --> 01:24.930
of it and float it.

01:24.950 --> 01:30.380
See you're not working on any of the other bits that you've got selected.

01:30.530 --> 01:31.600
Now I'll demonstrate this.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.400
Now I'm going to go ahead and select the red rectangular Select Tool and literally create a rectangle

01:37.400 --> 01:39.950
selection that's in front of us.

01:40.070 --> 01:46.100
Normally when you go ahead and let's say use a brush tool we will see that you're actually still colouring

01:46.100 --> 01:48.180
in the background layer at the moment.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.970
But it's constrained to where that selection is.

01:51.980 --> 01:59.180
If I go ahead and undo that and float that selection I can then operate on it independently of that

01:59.180 --> 02:00.350
background layer.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.930
So if we had a background that already had a colour on it I'm sure to dismiss everything for a moment.

02:07.930 --> 02:10.040
Sure I've got the right tool before I dismiss.

02:10.170 --> 02:17.440
Okay so I've gone through and using the gradient tool I've decided to make a lovely pattern like so

02:17.860 --> 02:23.480
and then I go ahead and select parts of it because I want to edit this area here.

02:23.530 --> 02:32.380
Now if I go to select and go to float it will extract facts from the rest of the image and we can see

02:32.380 --> 02:35.390
here the background now has a hole in it.

02:35.410 --> 02:40.010
If we have a look at the layers tab and there is also above it a floating selection.

02:40.030 --> 02:43.030
So if you ever find GIMP has become unresponsive.

02:43.030 --> 02:47.120
Take a look over in the layers tab and see if you've got a floating selection.

02:47.140 --> 02:54.120
There are a couple of tools as I've mentioned that will automatically create a floating selection.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.650
We've manually done it here.

02:55.690 --> 03:01.900
Now once you've done that let's say we go ahead and put the gradient going the other way just to see

03:01.900 --> 03:02.870
what happens.

03:02.940 --> 03:06.040
We can see here that it's taken that selection it's lifted it up.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.510
We've altered that selection.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.430
Done something to it will happen ever it happens to be.

03:10.450 --> 03:13.390
Now we can put that back down on the background layer.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.680
Or we could put it on its own individual layer.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.540
First of all.

03:17.590 --> 03:24.600
Demonstrate the background layer and then Arlon do so we can experience the other ones in quick succession.

03:24.790 --> 03:30.100
So what we need to do in order to put the floating selection back down onto the background layer is

03:30.150 --> 03:33.410
anchor it and you can anchor it in several ways.

03:33.430 --> 03:37.690
We can go to the layout menu and you can see anchor layer.

03:37.900 --> 03:42.110
You also have the shortcut key there control in age.

03:42.320 --> 03:49.630
Now if you want to do that directly from the layers tab itself along the bottom of it there is something

03:49.630 --> 03:51.580
that I thought looked like a flower.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.770
Initially it is in fact an anchor.

03:54.010 --> 04:00.250
And if you go ahead and click that or use one of the other methods its merges the floating selection

04:00.250 --> 04:02.440
back down to the background layer.

04:02.860 --> 04:05.700
So that's one way of anchoring that back down.

04:05.710 --> 04:09.000
Another way would be if I just undo what I've done.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.890
Goes back to that floating selection.

04:10.930 --> 04:14.560
I can go ahead and straightaway click a new layer.

04:14.590 --> 04:21.610
Now I go ahead and click on that we will see the floating selection has now been pasted on to a layer

04:21.610 --> 04:25.440
called floated layer and of course you could name it appropriately.

04:25.450 --> 04:32.230
Now one thing to bear in mind when you do this is that the floated layer is the size of the selection

04:32.230 --> 04:35.120
and we can see the layer boundary is a round.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.820
They have not got a layer boundary.

04:36.820 --> 04:43.450
You might have turned it off under view and show layer boundary lines enabled at the moment which does

04:43.450 --> 04:46.620
mean that it can again be further confusion.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.660
If you go ahead and start colouring something in like I've done here and you can't colorin outside of

04:52.660 --> 04:59.530
that image if that if you did do that you'd have to either expand the layer or create a new layer first.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.250
That was the appropriate size.

05:02.260 --> 05:10.080
Now there are some actions which will cause a floating layer immediately without necessarily realizing

05:10.090 --> 05:11.460
that's what's going on.

05:11.530 --> 05:17.770
One of them is if you're copying cutting or and pasting basically any copy cut and paste.

05:17.770 --> 05:18.850
If I go ahead new that.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.300
Now let's use the Select Tool at select part of this layer.

05:22.360 --> 05:27.630
Now bear in mind that only the area in the layer boundary is actually going to be selected.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.900
We go ahead and go edit and let's cut that that's actually remove it.

05:31.950 --> 05:38.500
Again that's cut away and if I just paste it's going edit pace and of course if you see a keyboard shortcuts

05:38.500 --> 05:41.050
you could go control x and then control V.

05:41.350 --> 05:44.740
And we've got ourselves another floating selection.

05:44.890 --> 05:50.500
If we go ahead and try and move that around of course we can move round the floating selection that

05:50.500 --> 05:51.220
we've made.

05:51.250 --> 05:57.170
But as you can see I cannot move it on top of the other layers just yet.

05:57.180 --> 06:04.090
Now I go ahead and click new layer it then appears so can be a little confusing at first because you

06:04.090 --> 06:10.270
can always see what's going on when you've initially floated automatically floated a selection.

06:10.270 --> 06:16.720
If you're doing a copy and paste as you saw there it looked like it just disappeared behind the other

06:16.720 --> 06:19.300
floated layer and in fact it had an it was still there.

06:19.300 --> 06:24.940
We just couldn't really see what was going on only an outline so it can be a bit confusing if you're

06:24.940 --> 06:27.030
not used to that.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.740
Now if I just undo one step there we still now have a floating selection that I can move about.

06:32.830 --> 06:39.220
If I were to click elsewhere because I've got it selected the actual move tool selected on pick a layer

06:39.250 --> 06:44.920
or guide files to go ahead and click on the background layer and try and start moving that you can see

06:44.920 --> 06:49.300
that it's immediately flattened my floating selection.

06:49.300 --> 06:55.120
Back to the layer that was beneath it and now of course I can start to try and move the back around.

06:55.300 --> 07:01.450
Now you've got to watch out for that because obviously I've just lost half of my previous selection

07:01.450 --> 07:06.800
that I was moving about and I'm going to undo to bring that back and were back there.

07:07.260 --> 07:14.070
Now it is important to realize that whilst you've got a floating selection you cannot do anything on

07:14.130 --> 07:15.730
any other layer.

07:15.780 --> 07:22.680
You have to anchor it or attach it to a new layer essentially anchoring it to a new layer before you

07:22.680 --> 07:25.120
can carry on doing anything else.

07:25.170 --> 07:30.030
And that cat that's caught me out several times and I'm sure it will catch you out at some point as

07:30.030 --> 07:31.080
well.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.780
And that covers floating selections down to a tee.

07:35.070 --> 07:38.430
You will get tripped up by them at some point.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.580
It's happened to me it's happened to all of us.

07:40.590 --> 07:45.780
So don't worry when you do it will happen but at least now you know that all you need is glance over

07:45.780 --> 07:48.210
at the layers tab see if you've got a floating selection.

07:48.330 --> 07:53.880
Decide what to do with it Joan just go anchor because if I was to place it here for instance and just

07:53.880 --> 07:56.790
click anchor I might lose information.

07:56.850 --> 08:02.880
Decide what you're going to do with it and then anchor it down before you can continue working on the

08:02.880 --> 08:04.460
rest of your project.

08:04.470 --> 08:08.610
I hope you found the helpful and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
