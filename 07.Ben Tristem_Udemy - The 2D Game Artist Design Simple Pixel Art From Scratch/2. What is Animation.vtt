Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:07.520 --> 00:12.090
In this election I'd like to talk to you about what an animation actually is.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.980
So obviously some of you will know all about this already.

00:15.980 --> 00:21.450
However for those who don't please listen carefully because important information contained within.

00:21.530 --> 00:32.150
Okay so in front of us here we have a ball and an animation is the illusion of motion by having a series

00:32.150 --> 00:40.460
or a sequence of frames or as in this case a sequence of images that are called frames in an animation

00:41.150 --> 00:46.460
and when we step through these frames it gives you the illusion of motion.

00:46.460 --> 00:53.750
So with this ball that we have here if I go in through and step through this animation you can see the

00:53.750 --> 00:58.340
ball dropped to the ground bounces back up and it repeats.

00:58.520 --> 01:03.800
And we can see at the bottom there is a total of four out of eight frames.

01:03.800 --> 01:10.400
So in this entire animation there are only eight individual images that make up these frames.

01:11.080 --> 01:18.340
And in this particular case because the ball is bouncing up and down I have created this from four individual

01:18.340 --> 01:23.290
frames and then they are mirrored on the way back up again.

01:23.470 --> 01:29.560
And you might have heard the term frames per second whether it be a movie at the cinema at 24 frames

01:29.560 --> 01:35.580
per second or if you're a gamer and you want to get the most out of your games 60 frames per second

01:35.590 --> 01:38.530
and of course it goes up and up from there.

01:38.530 --> 01:45.730
Now in this particular case I can play this back at that Sachse you set it a one time 10 frames per

01:45.730 --> 01:47.040
second and press play.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.580
And we can see what it looks like at 10 frames per second.

01:50.590 --> 01:58.390
And it does look like a bouncing ball and it is quite incredible how only eight frayne's can create

01:58.960 --> 02:02.560
an illusion that this ball is bouncing up and down.

02:02.680 --> 02:08.080
Now there are some other things going on in this scene as well which will discuss in more detail as

02:08.080 --> 02:10.470
we get deeper into this section.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.610
But you can see there that looks like a bouncing ball.

02:13.630 --> 02:20.260
Now the number of frames you have is directly related to the speed of the animation.

02:20.290 --> 02:25.720
So not only can you change the number of frames per second but you can also have a different number

02:25.720 --> 02:26.620
of frames.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.880
I'm just going to stop this for the moment because it's rather distracting whilst I'm talking to you

02:31.270 --> 02:38.860
now with these frames per second if you have more frames you can either have a slower animation or a

02:38.860 --> 02:41.800
more detailed or smoother animation.

02:41.800 --> 02:47.590
Now because this only contains eight frames if I chose to go a bit crazy and turn it up to 60 frames

02:47.620 --> 02:54.970
per second it would just as you can see there look a bit blurred more than anything else and difficult

02:54.970 --> 02:56.050
to work out.

02:56.200 --> 03:02.590
The fact that this only has eight individual images in it would suggest in this case with a bouncing

03:02.590 --> 03:10.810
ball that is to be played back at a lower frames per second rather than at this higher rate of course

03:11.050 --> 03:17.470
the more frames per second to try and play your animation back if we rewind the clock there you may

03:17.470 --> 03:22.130
find that means that you have to spend a lot more time animating it.

03:22.330 --> 03:28.690
So in many cases especially when you try a prototype something perhaps something moving or in this case

03:28.690 --> 03:35.920
a ball bouncing having the minimum number of frames to give the illusion of motion providing someone

03:36.240 --> 03:41.340
who didn't know what you were doing turns around says that looks like a red bouncing ball.

03:41.380 --> 03:44.960
Well that is your task completed at this point obviously.

03:45.070 --> 03:52.210
Later Ron you may be required or you may want to increase the level of detail in the image or even increase

03:52.210 --> 03:55.100
the level of detail of the animation itself.

03:55.240 --> 04:00.610
At this point in time of course we are more focussed on learning the key skills required to do that

04:00.610 --> 04:03.310
animation rather than refining it.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.070
At this point in time.

04:05.620 --> 04:13.540
Okay now that we have a grasp of what animation actually is in the next lecture will be applying that

04:13.540 --> 04:18.040
knowledge and creating our very first animation over in guimpe.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.720
And oh see you in that next lecture.
