00:04.190 --> 00:05.620
Hi and welcome back.

00:05.630 --> 00:09.560
And in this lecture we're going to talk about the colour pick at all.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.510
It is an incredibly useful tool that allows us to look at an image that we've currently got on the screen

00:14.900 --> 00:17.910
and pick certain colours that are already there.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.590
And this is incredibly useful again for consistency amongst anything else.

00:22.610 --> 00:26.120
So your picking colours that are already existing in front of you.

00:26.180 --> 00:28.820
So the first thing we need to do of course is have an image.

00:28.820 --> 00:35.270
Some women go to file new and Im going to generate my own 32 by 32 image.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.740
I'm going to zoom all the way in.

00:36.780 --> 00:43.260
I want to go ahead and grab the paint brush tool and I'm going to open up just a basic palette and which

00:43.260 --> 00:43.600
ones.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.000
Yeah.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.260
But the basic palette there's absolutely fine.

00:46.250 --> 00:49.810
That's go to the colour selector under the foreground and background colours.

00:49.820 --> 00:54.740
And I'm going to lay down just a bit of red a bit of yellow.

00:54.770 --> 00:57.310
And why not a bit of blue as well.

00:57.310 --> 00:58.170
There we go.

00:58.550 --> 01:03.590
So we've got three separate colours here but you can see as they're blended together you've got a whole

01:03.590 --> 01:09.800
new gamut a whole new variety of colours as they've blended across in some of those you might like.

01:09.890 --> 01:15.080
And you can go ahead and pick those individual colours and use them yourself.

01:15.650 --> 01:19.490
In order to get to the colour pick at all you can go to the tool box itself.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.730
It looks like a little pet a little gropper.

01:23.060 --> 01:25.260
We can see that a shortcut key is out.

01:25.640 --> 01:31.520
And in the Tools menu itself it is separate from most of the other tools it's just in the Tools menu

01:31.850 --> 01:33.030
under colour picker.

01:33.050 --> 01:39.350
And we can see the shortcut key once again is Oh now we go across to the tool options we see there are

01:39.350 --> 01:44.050
several ways in which we can select our particular colour.

01:44.090 --> 01:46.760
We'll start at the top and just work our way down.

01:47.060 --> 01:54.740
If you put a tick in sample average what it will do based upon the current layer that selected it will

01:54.740 --> 01:59.780
do an average of a radius of three pixel So if we're smack bang in the middle of this red area it's

01:59.780 --> 02:00.880
going to be red.

02:00.900 --> 02:07.190
However as we come across and you can see the boundary itself is picking an average of all of the pixels

02:07.400 --> 02:13.040
that in that border and as we move Venturer all the way into the yellow areas almost all yellow as we

02:13.040 --> 02:18.170
go across into the blue you can see it changes accordingly as we move.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.460
The drop at all.

02:19.460 --> 02:22.250
Now I'm clicking and holding whilst I'm doing this if I just let go.

02:22.250 --> 02:22.700
That's it.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.620
That's that colour selected.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.260
And if we look a little further down we can see that the pink married is set to foreground colour and

02:30.260 --> 02:31.480
that's what we've done.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.880
We've set the foreground colour at this point.

02:34.940 --> 02:35.860
It's yellow.

02:35.960 --> 02:40.310
If I hover somewhere between the border of red and yellow I'm going to get an orange.

02:40.340 --> 02:47.150
Now if I turn off sample average what I will then see is that I can select individual pixels so if I

02:47.150 --> 02:54.090
wanted to select that particular pixel there I can then go use any of the other brush tools and colour

02:54.090 --> 02:58.480
in using that new colour that I have selected.

02:59.370 --> 03:03.030
Back to the drop at all or the colour select or sample merge.

03:03.030 --> 03:08.370
Now we're going to need another layer to demonstrate that if we go ahead and create a new layer just

03:08.370 --> 03:11.040
call it layer for the moment that's absolutely fine with me.

03:11.040 --> 03:16.710
I'm going to go ahead and with the pencil tool and I'm going to turn the size of that pencil tool all

03:16.710 --> 03:19.290
the way down and I'm going to use a different colour.

03:19.290 --> 03:23.470
This time I'm going to use magenta quite a horrible colour.

03:23.490 --> 03:24.400
There we go.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.150
So only very bright anyway.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.040
So now that I've laid down this lay here if I use the colour picker tool again and go back to tool options

03:32.040 --> 03:34.710
we can see a sample merge with it off.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.790
It's currently selected blacking it probably thinking well hang on a minute.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.670
There isn't any black in any of this scene.

03:39.690 --> 03:45.900
Well there's the transparency on the layer that we currently have active and that will come across as

03:45.900 --> 03:46.260
black.

03:46.260 --> 03:52.770
If you go ahead and click on it if I manage to click on the magenta itself it will select the magenta

03:52.880 --> 03:55.900
anywhere else at the moment will select black.

03:55.950 --> 04:02.600
Now that is because we've got the active layer as this squiggle This magenta squiggle with sample merged

04:02.600 --> 04:09.320
to what guimpe will do is it will flatten everything down into one image when it comes to selecting

04:09.330 --> 04:14.550
So now I can still select that magenta if I wanted to but if I go onto the yellow even though we're

04:14.550 --> 04:20.700
not on that layer it will be able to select it which is incredibly useful if youre working across an

04:20.700 --> 04:24.450
image you dont have want to have to switch layers.

04:24.460 --> 04:29.580
Now going down to the pick mode itself at the moment every time weve been clicking weve been selecting

04:30.090 --> 04:35.120
the foreground colour we can change this to background colour if we want.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.710
So as we can see that I'm going to turn back on sample merged for the moment.

04:39.810 --> 04:44.460
So there we go we can select the foreground or background colour and you can alternate those simply

04:44.460 --> 04:51.440
by holding down the control key and it will switch between foreground and background colour.

04:51.450 --> 04:57.450
Now pick only the reason why I've skipped over that is because we cant really use pick only until we've

04:57.530 --> 04:59.430
put the use info window.

04:59.550 --> 05:03.120
So noticable put a tick in the U.S. Info window.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.370
You can see there's a short key shift there.

05:05.370 --> 05:11.550
Now pick only won't change the foreground or background colour but will enable you to get some information

05:11.940 --> 05:14.600
about the colour you've just selected.

05:14.700 --> 05:21.510
It's hexadecimal that may be useful for you and it's r.g. be raw values.

05:21.660 --> 05:28.100
So if I go ahead and go to sample mode and then click we can see that we've got red green blue in and

05:28.180 --> 05:34.060
out for 0 because that is completely transparent and there is no colour.

05:34.320 --> 05:40.860
If I go ahead and click on the magenta we see that we got 100 percent of red or 2 5 5 100 percent blue

05:41.430 --> 05:45.380
and 100 percent Alpha which means we've got four colour magento.

05:45.390 --> 05:48.720
In this case with no transparency at all.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.210
The final option there is to add to palettes.

05:51.210 --> 05:56.130
Now we've already played with palettes themselves who got a pallets here but instead of destroying one

05:56.130 --> 06:01.950
I'm going to create a new one a new pallets here I'm going to name that palettes or what shall we name

06:01.950 --> 06:05.400
it tests so I can go ahead and ruin it if necessary.

06:05.400 --> 06:10.980
Now what I can do is I can go back to the tool options and with it adding to pallets and sample most

06:10.980 --> 06:11.550
turned on.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.760
I can literally click and you can see I can build up a palette.

06:15.770 --> 06:20.190
I'm going to get rid of the information window because it's just in the way at the moment I can build

06:20.190 --> 06:25.100
up a palettes of colours based upon what I'm selecting and that can be incredibly useful.

06:25.200 --> 06:31.530
If you're going into one image getting a palette from it's a selection of colours that works in that

06:31.530 --> 06:39.210
one image and then using that power again in a future image and that will help you consistency across

06:39.210 --> 06:41.120
multiple images.

06:41.130 --> 06:44.190
Now one of the things to bear in mind is that you can use this colour.

06:44.190 --> 06:49.170
Pick a tool straight away with any of the other brush tools by holding down.

06:49.170 --> 06:50.020
Control.

06:50.160 --> 06:50.940
So this is neat.

06:50.940 --> 06:56.430
If I've got a brush tool let's say the paint brush tool and will make their little bigger maybe four

06:56.430 --> 07:01.030
pixels so I'm colouring in here in red and I decide oh no I want the pink.

07:01.050 --> 07:05.310
I hold down control I select and you can see that it's selected.

07:05.310 --> 07:11.130
Pink has the foreground colour and I can start painting again and oh I want a yellow a hold down control.

07:11.130 --> 07:17.010
I can select the yellow and start painting again so that can be a very quick way of colouring in an

07:17.070 --> 07:18.210
area.

07:18.300 --> 07:23.140
Now it must be said that it does remember the options that you've had previously.

07:23.190 --> 07:27.180
So if I go back to my colour picture and look at the tool options.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.110
Now we've got sample merge turn up which is very useful.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.920
While working on several layers.

07:31.950 --> 07:36.160
However sample average of we've also got that turned on let's turn that up.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.020
So the radius is quite large.

07:39.420 --> 07:45.090
Now if I'm using the paint brush on painting in and then I go and select another area you can see it's

07:45.570 --> 07:51.960
got the half Ridge boundary turned on as well and that can be a little bit confusing if you're trying

07:51.960 --> 07:56.850
to colour something in and it's got this boundary on and you don't want it you want to be more precise

07:56.850 --> 07:58.400
you going to have to go back to the.

07:58.750 --> 08:01.250
Pick a tool and turn that off.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.320
And there we go.

08:02.320 --> 08:07.030
That pretty much sums out how to select existing colours that are on the screen.

08:07.030 --> 08:09.350
This is just a quick information lecture.

08:09.370 --> 08:15.340
More than anything else because you're now going to be able to use this in every future challenge that

08:15.340 --> 08:21.910
you come across and it's going to save you a lot of time coming in and out of picking various colours

08:21.940 --> 08:26.750
especially once you've got the majority of them already down on your canvas.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.700
So I hope you found me useful and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
