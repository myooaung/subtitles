00:04.730 --> 00:08.190
Welcome to slow in and out in this lecture.

00:08.300 --> 00:15.200
We're going to explore how we can make our animations have a more natural feel to them rather than a

00:15.200 --> 00:16.880
robotic feel.

00:17.120 --> 00:23.520
And that can be done by changing how many frames we put at the beginning and end of an animation to

00:23.540 --> 00:27.990
make the movement feel more natural and convincing to the watcher.

00:28.850 --> 00:36.170
Now when it comes to any form of animation making something look like it's supposed to and a natural

00:36.170 --> 00:43.210
movement rather than a robotic movement is done through the mere method of slow ins and outs.

00:43.220 --> 00:46.490
If we go ahead and look at a given time frame.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.130
In two different aspects.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.810
The top one here.

00:51.810 --> 00:58.330
If we divide it up completely evenly we'll end up with about nine different slots.

00:58.350 --> 01:04.740
Think one two three four five six seven eight nine or rather eight if you count this one is your starting

01:04.740 --> 01:07.600
frame and this one is your ending frame.

01:07.740 --> 01:09.910
And these are relatively evenly spaced.

01:09.920 --> 01:15.830
So in the instance of a ball moving along it won't move quite smoothly across.

01:15.960 --> 01:22.150
And if we took my drawing literally it would judder a little here because the spacing is.

01:22.200 --> 01:30.160
Even so you do have to watch out for um even spacing because it can give a jittery effect to your animation.

01:30.180 --> 01:36.820
Whilst that may be desirable under certain circumstances unless you're doing it deliberately trying

01:36.820 --> 01:41.260
to keep things evenly space and there's another uneven spacing here.

01:41.490 --> 01:47.820
If we have a look at easing our our ball in this case in an outer we do exactly the same thing where

01:47.820 --> 01:52.990
we start dividing things up but we divide them up evenly.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.780
We get this sort of effect and what will happen is would start off the ball here.

01:57.990 --> 02:06.060
And even though it seems a bit counterintuitive saying these are evenly spaced but there is a consistency

02:06.300 --> 02:07.890
to the spacing.

02:07.890 --> 02:14.640
So what we'll see is it will move slowly here and then pick up speed and then slow back down again towards

02:14.640 --> 02:15.750
the end.

02:15.750 --> 02:20.130
Another way of looking at this is motion over time.

02:21.960 --> 02:29.060
And so in the instance of let's say dropping a ball it doesn't move much for a bit and then it moves

02:29.060 --> 02:33.980
suddenly until it hits the ground and then it might do this and settle down.

02:35.120 --> 02:43.730
Now with a ball being fired out of a cannon it may suddenly start quick and then slow down and then

02:43.730 --> 02:46.590
pick up speed again as it goes.

02:46.610 --> 02:52.970
If we imagine it being fired upwards it will go up and slow down and then it might pick up speed again

02:53.270 --> 02:56.660
as it tumbles back down towards the ground.

02:56.660 --> 03:02.660
So you can end up with different graphs like this but the important thing is it's never ever a straight

03:02.660 --> 03:11.620
line like that unless it's a robot or something robotic or mechanical that would naturally be like that.

03:11.750 --> 03:17.630
Most things in nature are not whether it's an inanimate object falling off of a shelf or whether it's

03:17.630 --> 03:18.970
a character moving.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.260
There's always a slow in and slow out.

03:22.400 --> 03:30.530
And yes you can exaggerate it if you'd like to really give the right appearance and with the adding

03:30.590 --> 03:33.700
of squash and stretch when something is going really quick.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.390
These can all compound to make a very convincing animation.

03:38.390 --> 03:42.340
The important thing is to use it naturally and sensibly.

03:42.620 --> 03:49.010
And for instance if I just clear this down for a second soak up my chart back a rockets being launched.

03:49.030 --> 03:54.600
It takes ages to get going and then it just moves quicker and quicker and quicker and quicker over time.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.670
So that's one example of something that just speeds up.

03:57.740 --> 04:05.050
You get some things that speed up and slow down like a like a bullet being fired out of a gun.

04:05.090 --> 04:12.680
A You have some things that's starts slow speed up and slow back down again like a ball dropping off

04:12.680 --> 04:13.600
of a shelf.

04:14.500 --> 04:22.060
And then finally is if something is launched going upwards it starts really quick slows back down and

04:22.060 --> 04:27.610
then its motion increases speed again as it falls back down towards the ground.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.710
So let's see now how this applies when were over in guimpe.

04:32.740 --> 04:39.550
Now there are two ways of doing this you can adjust the frame timing or you can adjust the position

04:39.670 --> 04:41.980
of an object over time.

04:42.050 --> 04:45.090
So they're both the so two sides of the same coin.

04:45.100 --> 04:50.980
However you do have to bear in mind the consequences of doing one might mean if your ex sporting this

04:50.980 --> 04:58.110
to another package afterwards the frame timing adjustments may not take effect elsewhere.

04:58.300 --> 05:03.280
So in order to do this I'm going to create myself a new image and I'm going to make this a hundred.

05:03.410 --> 05:07.480
Now I would make the 64 width by 128 right.

05:07.630 --> 05:11.410
That's fine a minute to set the size of my ball at 10.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.720
I'm going to use a ball again for this example.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.520
And there it is.

05:15.520 --> 05:22.930
So if we wanted a robotic ball moving from A to B we could literally evenly space it as it goes down

05:22.930 --> 05:24.200
in each frame.

05:24.250 --> 05:29.230
It will look well like like the ball is moving at a constant speed.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.570
And that's kind of how robots move about.

05:31.570 --> 05:37.390
If you've ever seen someone dance using that dance the robots they're very stiff they suddenly come

05:37.390 --> 05:44.000
to a stop and they suddenly start again without any extra sort of momentum to get going.

05:44.050 --> 05:49.240
Unfortunately most things in life do not do that so we go and play back this animation which I haven't

05:49.240 --> 05:54.610
gotten so that won't work Silly me but it will just go through and it will be really smooth.

05:54.610 --> 05:59.450
What we really want is then to be a bit more space the part.

05:59.470 --> 06:05.290
Now you can do the same thing by creating a series of layers and moving them about there.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.340
Let's go ahead and have a blank background let's add a background again.

06:09.340 --> 06:15.690
So back ground and make it whites who've got something that really makes that black blob stand out and

06:15.700 --> 06:18.420
going to create a new transparent background.

06:18.420 --> 06:23.530
Go and put the ball on it and then go to layer and auto crop the layer.

06:23.530 --> 06:28.230
So now I've got a tiny ball that I can move about very easily.

06:28.240 --> 06:33.970
So for the moment let's just get these nine or 10 balls on the screen that we need someone to duplicate

06:34.000 --> 06:36.970
the layer and with the move tool set on the move.

06:36.970 --> 06:38.270
The active layer.

06:38.280 --> 06:43.870
So I definitely know I'm moving the next layer down I'm going to evenly space a series of.

06:43.870 --> 06:52.090
In this case dots or balls down are seen and then what we can do is adjust the frame timing.

06:52.160 --> 07:00.070
Now ultimately the results are you get out at the end will be similar but will also be different at

07:00.070 --> 07:05.710
the same time you do get a slightly different effect if you're adjusting the frame timing opposed to

07:05.950 --> 07:08.730
the actual position over time.

07:08.920 --> 07:14.650
So there we go we've got all of our dots out now what we could do at this point is the first one we

07:14.650 --> 07:22.380
could declare that it's a slow mover so we could go to who on the end of it we could go 200 milliseconds.

07:22.570 --> 07:27.640
And then the next one slightly faster we could might go one seventy five and then slightly faster again

07:27.640 --> 07:32.620
one to five slightly faster again etc etc. and then slow you back down again.

07:32.650 --> 07:33.610
That is one way of doing it.

07:33.610 --> 07:39.730
The issue with doing it that way even though you get roughly the same outputs is you would have to recreate

07:39.730 --> 07:40.060
that.

07:40.090 --> 07:45.430
If you were then going use these individual frames in another package.

07:45.460 --> 07:52.700
Now that may or may not be possible depending on where you're sending your animation out to end.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.870
Either way you've still got to reconstruct it.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.190
The other other end.

07:56.290 --> 08:02.170
And what would be far better especially if the person the other end is just expecting a file that works

08:02.170 --> 08:08.280
for them and they don't have to do any fiddling about is to adjust its position depending on the time.

08:08.290 --> 08:13.120
So in this case we go back to the very beginning I'm going to remove that specification that's to much

08:13.140 --> 08:18.610
milliseconds and thinking about what we saw earlier if we wanted it and then see what happens at the

08:18.610 --> 08:23.080
moment now not put replace on the end of these so it would just build up on this play act.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.870
So go ahead and press play and it's either dead or dead in that order.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.990
It just rattles down in a very linear fashion.

08:28.990 --> 08:34.540
That's fine if something is going past at a constant velocity or as I mentioned before if it's a robot's

08:34.540 --> 08:40.660
moving that's also fine but if it's something natural it is important that the motion is eased in and

08:40.660 --> 08:45.130
out so we can go ahead to background too.

08:45.160 --> 08:50.970
And in this case move it up servais overlap almost well almost half half.

08:50.980 --> 08:56.560
In that case then we can go and grab this one and shift up a little maybe So just touching background

08:56.560 --> 08:58.230
for we can have that gap.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.060
Background five an even bigger gap.

09:01.210 --> 09:04.870
Now this is where I can start getting a little bit confusing as we're going to start putting ones on

09:04.870 --> 09:05.970
top of one another.

09:06.070 --> 09:10.930
Which is why it's important to have the move tool or move the active layer so we don't get confused.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.980
And this can go all the way down.

09:13.270 --> 09:14.890
Yes that's an even bigger gap.

09:14.890 --> 09:18.290
Let's put it all the way here and have that as our midpoints.

09:18.310 --> 09:22.830
Now we might actually be over the number of pixels for the midpoint but that doesn't matter.

09:22.870 --> 09:28.090
Now we go to the next one and we try and make it roughly the same matching point here which I think

09:28.090 --> 09:28.510
is about.

09:28.630 --> 09:34.240
There and then we go to background 7 and shift that answers one apart.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.680
Background 8 shift that down.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.560
Now I've lost track of where I am.

09:38.560 --> 09:44.380
I'm going to not use all of these some just going to do a few deletes and I can always duplicate again

09:44.740 --> 09:45.730
afterwards.

09:45.730 --> 09:48.980
Now you may get an error message like this come up.

09:49.120 --> 09:56.290
And if that comes up well that usually means that you've got the animation already running somewhere

09:56.650 --> 09:59.750
and it's trying to use something and you've just deleted.

09:59.980 --> 10:05.410
In this case I'm just going to go through and tidy up a background Several was the one I've just done

10:05.680 --> 10:11.440
so I'm going to go to my undo history the little yellow backwards icon at the top and just add that

10:11.440 --> 10:14.770
back in and let's see what's happening here we've got a big gap here.

10:14.770 --> 10:20.680
This next gap is not big enough but I'm also kind of running out of space a Perhaps it's slowing down

10:20.680 --> 10:22.090
creak of an accelerated.

10:22.090 --> 10:23.490
That's absolutely fine.

10:23.540 --> 10:30.290
I go back to my layers window here and duplicate again and have it's almost on top.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.740
And then finally down here it comes to a stop.

10:34.750 --> 10:39.850
Now if we go ahead and play that back it will look ever was a slightly different because of the spacing

10:40.010 --> 10:43.620
build look like it increases speed and slows back down again.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.580
And that is what were aiming for.

10:45.590 --> 10:52.810
Whenever we do any animation with the exception of robotics and it's that time again it's time for a

10:52.810 --> 10:54.000
challenge.

10:54.250 --> 10:58.540
Let's go make something a bit more interesting then a bouncing ball.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.700
We're going to go for a portcullis.

11:00.700 --> 11:07.330
If youre not sure one of those is thats that Gates that comes down on a castle to stop you going in

11:07.360 --> 11:08.220
spikey Gates.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.520
I will pull up a quick picture.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.560
And here we go.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.920
Here are a couple of images of portcullises.

11:14.920 --> 11:21.930
Of course you can do it in any style you want and I would suggest perhaps creating the the arch way

11:21.940 --> 11:24.250
that is the doorway in this case.

11:24.310 --> 11:30.640
I would suggest Cryn as a foreground item so you can move the portcullis up and down behind it and you

11:30.640 --> 11:36.790
could make your portcullises fancy or as plain as you like is entirely up to you and whether or not

11:36.790 --> 11:39.870
you use colour thats also up to you at this point.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.290
I'm probably going to do a silhouette to begin with.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.800
And of course once you've got the silhouette working and you're aware of what it is and what it's doing

11:48.070 --> 11:54.700
then adding the extra bits like colour and fancy bits around the edge whether it's spikes or anything

11:54.700 --> 11:58.690
else that is secondary to the main action.

11:58.690 --> 12:02.530
And then we're going to go ahead and make two animations.

12:02.530 --> 12:09.820
The first animation I want you to make it descend slowly and smoothly as if you've got a short time

12:09.820 --> 12:14.410
it's coming down you got to get through it so it's one of those sort of timed events in the game where

12:14.410 --> 12:17.910
you've got to get there but it's not going to slam down you.

12:18.040 --> 12:23.800
And that leads us on to the second animation I'd like you to show me that Paul Collier slamming down

12:23.830 --> 12:26.610
into the ground now thinking about it.

12:26.620 --> 12:34.750
There is an option here to squash and stretch to exaggerate the slamming down of the portcullis.

12:34.750 --> 12:39.480
And finally of course I'd love you to share your work over in the discussions.

12:39.700 --> 12:46.890
So that is your challenge spec you may have noticed there's not a size or a time or frames per second.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.490
I'm going to leave this up to you this time to decide how large it is.

12:51.490 --> 12:59.600
I would suggest staying small with your resolution and also how long the animation is as well.

12:59.620 --> 13:06.940
I'd still keep it under five seconds but otherwise you're free to choose those specifications and we'll

13:06.940 --> 13:10.690
go for the solution to this challenge in the next lecture.
