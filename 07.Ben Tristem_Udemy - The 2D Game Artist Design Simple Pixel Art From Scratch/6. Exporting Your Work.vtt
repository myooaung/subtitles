00:04.110 --> 00:09.350
In this video we're going to talk about exporting your work from guimpe to a novel format.

00:09.450 --> 00:13.500
Now you will want to do this you will want to keep your work purely in GIMP forever.

00:13.590 --> 00:18.330
You want to export it to a different format so you can either use it in your game share with friends

00:18.600 --> 00:20.060
etc. etc..

00:20.100 --> 00:25.590
And first of all we're going to go through the manual process of exporting and then we'll have a look

00:25.680 --> 00:33.900
at a plug in our first plug in really early in the course to help us export multiple images all in one

00:33.990 --> 00:34.620
lump.

00:35.500 --> 00:42.790
Okay so let's focus on exporting our work and we're going to start with what is your image destination.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.080
Now this is an important question because it's going to alter your end goal.

00:47.080 --> 00:54.520
So for instance if we were creating emoticons or imo GS You will have a target resolution that you'd

00:54.520 --> 00:55.810
be going for.

00:55.810 --> 01:01.830
And at the moment our images are 8 by eight and just resizing them can cause problems.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.220
And I want to show you that now as we go ahead and re size.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.230
But first of all what is the problem.

01:08.230 --> 01:11.920
Why can't we just share the image we've got in front of us.

01:11.920 --> 01:20.560
Well an eight by eight image is simply too small to actually share and we need to make sure we have

01:20.770 --> 01:29.770
a relatively straightforward method of not destroying our current work as well because the process we're

01:29.770 --> 01:34.690
about to do could be quote unquote dangerous to your files.

01:34.720 --> 01:41.110
Now before I've started this particular lecture and I'd advise you to as well is just to take a backup

01:41.170 --> 01:47.710
of your work so far copy the folder it's in and just pop it to one side in case you accidentally hit

01:47.710 --> 01:48.650
save.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.770
And this is the problem when it comes to exporting.

01:51.850 --> 01:56.340
We've got our original image here and eight by eight too small.

01:56.350 --> 02:02.800
And if we change its size we actually change the fundamental image ultimately we want to keep this as

02:02.800 --> 02:07.920
an 8 by image and not introduce any more complexity than is necessary.

02:07.930 --> 02:15.340
So in this case we're going to have to start off by showing you how to resize your image and we can

02:15.340 --> 02:17.920
do that through the image menu.

02:17.920 --> 02:25.450
If we go ahead now and go to image and go down to scale image once we've gone to scale image we can

02:25.450 --> 02:26.620
see we've got a width and height.

02:26.620 --> 02:31.840
Now both of these will change at the same time providing the link for little thing that looks like a

02:31.840 --> 02:35.330
chain link is actually linked together to the right of it.

02:35.480 --> 02:42.220
And let's set this to a target resolution of 32 which is about right for sharing unless it hit scale

02:42.220 --> 02:43.740
let's do nothing else.

02:43.780 --> 02:50.480
We have done a form of resampling law lets do control shift Jay.

02:50.530 --> 02:56.400
Now thats not the intended effect that looks like a chessboard after youve had too much to drink.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.250
Thats no good.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.900
So what has happened here.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.700
Well what we forgot and I'm going to undo here I'm going to go control in Z and undo.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.070
Doesn't matter too much because I've got my file backed up.

03:07.270 --> 03:13.360
But this is the danger here if you make a mistake like that and save and don't realize you could in

03:13.360 --> 03:15.440
fact ruin your original file.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.940
So demetri You've got to back up.

03:17.110 --> 03:18.960
Let's go back to scale image of this time.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.360
Where do 32.

03:20.770 --> 03:23.440
But this time where it goes down to quality.

03:23.680 --> 03:31.990
There's an option to interpolate between the actual pixels and if we set that 10 none and hit scale

03:32.380 --> 03:38.770
it will scale up and leave it not fuzzy it will actually just take a one to one representation and map

03:38.770 --> 03:42.620
it out and we end up with the perfect size.

03:42.640 --> 03:48.340
Now is not just in the program you need to worry about this or not necessarily worry but just be aware

03:48.340 --> 03:48.810
of it.

03:48.970 --> 03:56.380
If you just upload your image to a website and it's too small it might automatically and larger it and

03:56.380 --> 03:59.330
therefore apply its own resampling.

03:59.350 --> 04:04.040
But if we get it the right size to begin with that we want to share it at.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.950
Then there's not going to be any resizing and we can control that and make sure it doesn't end up fuzzy

04:09.220 --> 04:13.660
or blotchy or anything else it is as intended.

04:13.660 --> 04:20.080
And of course finally now that we have our image ready to export we do need to export it so we go down

04:20.080 --> 04:26.650
to file and go to export and we can see the shortcut there is control in EA.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.810
It gives us an export menu.

04:28.840 --> 04:36.730
Now you have to export it rather than save it as a p n g it says separates the paradigm between saving

04:36.730 --> 04:40.530
your work and creating an alternative version.

04:40.540 --> 04:44.760
In this case one without all of the options baked into it.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.160
So in this case we've got Checker's not P N G.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.270
That's absolutely fine.

04:49.270 --> 04:51.210
In fact it's defaulted to PRNG.

04:51.340 --> 04:56.530
If you go down towards the bottom you can select file type and change it and the reason we want to use

04:56.530 --> 04:59.050
a p n g is because it's lossless.

04:59.050 --> 05:05.320
If we use something like a j peg you will end up potentially with the same sort of artefact thing that

05:05.320 --> 05:09.750
we had earlier because j peg is a compressed format.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.610
It tries to shrink the image as small as possible.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.840
In this particular case we want to as accurate as possible.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.700
So we're going to use.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.150
A P N G.

05:20.560 --> 05:26.660
Now even create a new folder at this point and I am going to create a new folder and call it export.

05:26.680 --> 05:33.940
The reason why I'm creating a folder called export is because that tells me the creator that this is

05:33.940 --> 05:37.200
a volatile folder anything in it is just a cache.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.320
It's just an intermediate step from the original.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.200
Now once I've got this all laid out I can go and click export.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.930
And it gives us some further options at this point.

05:49.940 --> 05:53.310
I am just going to go ahead and click export.

05:53.510 --> 05:59.130
Now if we go ahead and go to open we can see there's a folder called export and there's a Checker's

05:59.280 --> 06:02.280
PRNG in if we open that up and zoom in.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.760
And I'm going to use control shift and Jay to do that.

06:05.850 --> 06:09.930
We can see if it is exactly how we intended it to be.

06:10.750 --> 06:18.460
Now this is a dangerous situation because I've now got a 32 by 32 image that if I accidentally save

06:18.820 --> 06:26.560
Well I could lose the whole feel of the 8 by 8 because if I now take my size my pencil down to 1 you'll

06:26.560 --> 06:34.660
notice that instead of there being one pixel per black or white square it's now four pixels per black

06:34.660 --> 06:40.230
or white square which is considerably different than what we had before.

06:40.240 --> 06:46.600
Now it does give you more granularity as we can see here I can colorin inbetween the spaces but that's

06:46.600 --> 06:51.970
not the idea and I'm going to undo that squiggle and with it like this.

06:51.970 --> 06:56.830
If I was to accidentally now save it I would overwrite my work and that is why I asked you to make sure

06:56.830 --> 06:58.700
you got a backup before you do this.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.200
So this isn't an ideal workflow.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.320
Is there another solution.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.740
Indeed there is.

07:05.740 --> 07:11.890
Because guimpe is open source there is in fact someone who's made an add on that will do some of this

07:11.890 --> 07:18.360
for us and prevent us creating duplicate files to make sure we don't overwrite are original work.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.040
So let's go take a look at that now.

07:20.050 --> 07:21.600
It's called been.

07:23.230 --> 07:24.160
An insteps.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.500
Our first AD on blimp.

07:26.790 --> 07:30.590
Now on a Windows system you can install it straight away from the installer.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.820
On other systems you will have to install it manually.

07:33.870 --> 07:38.970
So the great thing about the Windows one is you can go ahead and click straightaway installer for Windows

07:39.810 --> 07:43.140
and that is only three hundred and fifty one killer bytes.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.740
Shouldn't take too long to download.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.370
I'm going to make sure my gimp is shut down.

07:47.380 --> 07:52.790
Who's going to discard the changes I don't want overwrite anything and install of Windows that's downloaded.

07:52.800 --> 07:58.650
I'm going to open that up and install it once it has installed.

07:58.740 --> 08:04.210
We can see here has been successfully installed to use it's open up game farm a new batch.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.380
Image manipulation.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.250
Well let's give that a go.

08:07.460 --> 08:14.430
So as Go ahead here and re open gimp take a few seconds to do an file batch image manipulation it's

08:14.430 --> 08:15.870
there and ready for us.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.760
So go ahead and open that up.

08:17.790 --> 08:21.310
Now we've got ADD input files.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.510
Okay so that's clicked the add button.

08:23.790 --> 08:28.360
This is what's is going to happen to our file vs the process as it will go through.

08:28.410 --> 08:30.900
So we need to resize the image first of all.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.780
Sets an exact size in pixels.

08:33.990 --> 08:38.230
We can do 32 by 32 interpellation none.

08:38.340 --> 08:45.660
If we were to leave that as kubic we would end up with that fuzzy up sampling that we had before leaving

08:45.660 --> 08:48.030
it to none means it's a one to one up scale.

08:48.210 --> 08:54.670
And from 8 8 to 32 by 32 We should get a nice crisp final image.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.070
Okay that's fine.

08:57.210 --> 08:59.940
And then we need to export.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.240
Is there change formats.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.590
Yep there we go.

09:03.600 --> 09:11.580
Let's change it to a p n g o k that's that done output folder.

09:11.700 --> 09:16.140
Now I've not added any images yet because I want to make sure I've got everything set up and ready to

09:16.140 --> 09:16.630
go.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.650
Output folder.

09:17.670 --> 09:22.450
Well let's outputs it into my export folder that I created earlier.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.180
I don't need to create a folder just export app.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.020
That's a bit annoying.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.080
It disappeared under my start bar.

09:29.090 --> 09:29.620
There we go.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.920
There's the okay button.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.230
So I got everything set up.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.670
It's now time to add our images.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.480
I'm going to go to add images had single images add folders.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.290
So in this case I'm going to add single images as only four of them.

09:41.480 --> 09:46.250
And we've got Checker's heart bowling ball.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.680
Ah this is recently used.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.080
This can be confusing from time to time.

09:50.180 --> 09:50.720
Is my reason.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.960
The use is not actually the folder I've been working in.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.370
Let's go to that.

09:54.500 --> 09:59.660
And now where in that folder we can select the images and gomi you shift select to select all of them

09:59.930 --> 10:01.120
and I'm going to add them.

10:01.190 --> 10:04.880
And let's just click apply now that already exists.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.140
Do I want to override it.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.710
I'm going to say yes in this case X.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.710
Then we can see it's all done all the farr's have been processed with no errors.

10:12.860 --> 10:20.510
Let's just close that down now and if we go to open up in our export folder we will have bowling ball

10:20.510 --> 10:22.500
chequers heart and smile.

10:22.610 --> 10:29.060
If I shift select the lot and open them up and then we can literally dive in how we can see that it's

10:29.060 --> 10:34.310
already bigger because you can you can genuinely see it this time and having a look.

10:34.310 --> 10:41.300
If I blow it up to sixteen hundred percent by using the five key who will see here that those have all

10:41.300 --> 10:47.960
come across exactly how I intended to take them to and then at the right size to start sharing with

10:47.960 --> 10:48.880
people.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.810
And of course you know what time it is now.

10:51.050 --> 10:57.140
Of course it's time for a challenge and for your challenge I'd like you to export your three images

10:57.140 --> 10:59.180
that you made in the last lecture.

10:59.540 --> 11:05.360
Make sure you've upscaled your images to 32 by 32 and export them as a P N G.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.020
Now whether you choose to use Ben or you choose to do this manually.

11:09.020 --> 11:15.230
If you do choose it manually make sure you create a backup of your work so you don't inadvertently save

11:15.260 --> 11:22.760
the 32 by 32 We want the raw files the source files being 8 by eight all times and just a reminder that

11:22.760 --> 11:26.900
you can get blimp by even following the link at the bottom of the screen.

11:26.990 --> 11:32.150
You can click the link in the resources and of course you could use good old Google and type in the

11:32.150 --> 11:36.210
word bump and it will come up towards the top of a search results.

11:37.410 --> 11:40.530
And then please do show your work so far.

11:40.590 --> 11:43.430
So balls of video now and give that a go.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.270
Okay guys.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.210
Welcome back.

11:47.210 --> 11:48.170
How did you get on.

11:48.170 --> 11:51.720
I hope you posted that on the community site so we can all see it.

11:51.810 --> 11:55.380
And I am going to go post mine there right now.

11:57.770 --> 12:04.790
Okay so I've landed on the community site here and I'm going to go down to the gimp's section and if

12:04.790 --> 12:07.940
we go down to exporting your work.

12:07.940 --> 12:08.550
Excellent.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.790
There's an automatic post there saying oh you're the first person.

12:11.900 --> 12:17.420
So let's go ahead this reply to that and I'm going to attach an image and in this case I'm going to

12:17.420 --> 12:22.370
go find my image and drag it into the appropriate folder.

12:22.370 --> 12:28.330
So I've gone to my folder structure to show you what I'm doing here and into export.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.940
Those are my three.

12:29.990 --> 12:34.050
One two three and then drag them in in order actually man.

12:34.930 --> 12:36.970
Wants to spare loves.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.980
Bowling.

12:39.270 --> 12:40.160
Excellent.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.520
There we go.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.070
I'm just going to post that in.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.470
And that looks great.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.400
Hope you guys have done this too.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.870
I look forward to seeing yours on the forum as well.

12:50.210 --> 12:53.190
Take care and I will see you in the next lecture.
