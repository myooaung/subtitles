00:04.180 --> 00:09.340
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be able to take our sprites that we've

00:09.340 --> 00:14.040
made and in almost one click generate something like this a sprite sheet.

00:14.050 --> 00:18.880
Now you may notice in especially in this one the bouncing ball when we have a look at the auto generated

00:18.880 --> 00:21.910
sprite sheet when this is applied.

00:21.910 --> 00:23.140
It doesn't look quite right.

00:23.140 --> 00:28.450
So there's a little nuance to using the tool but we'll soon find out how fused layers can really speed

00:28.450 --> 00:29.550
up your workflow.

00:30.470 --> 00:30.900
OK.

00:30.910 --> 00:36.190
So now that we're over in gimp the first thing that we need to do is get ourselves an animation that

00:36.190 --> 00:40.500
we've already made but that still has the layers intact.

00:40.510 --> 00:45.310
So in this case I'm going to go and open up that bouncy ball the jello ball that we made earlier on

00:45.310 --> 00:53.170
in this section and I'm going to go straight away and go to filters combine and use the fuse layers

00:53.170 --> 00:56.230
that we installed moments ago when we go ahead and do that.

00:56.230 --> 01:03.490
It gives us an option just one single option and that's how many layers are going across the left.

01:03.490 --> 01:06.720
So in this particular case we have 20 layers.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.990
So if we make it five across it will be four deep five times four is 20 et cetera et cetera.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.120
So I'm going to just leave that as five.

01:15.130 --> 01:17.040
That's the one I've been playing with.

01:17.050 --> 01:21.060
If it was one it would be one high in 20 long et cetera et cetera.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.200
And this is a very rapid way of generating a sprite sheet like that.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.520
Isn't that wonderful.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.180
Now looking at it you may notice that it's backwards.

01:31.450 --> 01:36.460
So one of the downsides of this tool is it doesn't put things in the same order that you've assembled

01:36.460 --> 01:42.100
in animation you'd have should you have to go through your layers themselves and invert them putting

01:42.100 --> 01:43.870
them the other way.

01:43.870 --> 01:50.060
Now fortunately gimp has a built in way where we can flip all of the layers with one click.

01:50.170 --> 01:55.750
Very useful in this case because even though this is 20 frames long it's going to take a good two minutes

01:55.750 --> 01:56.620
to reorder it.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.110
I don't really want to do that.

01:58.240 --> 02:06.040
So we can flip the entire layout ORDER BY GOING TO THE LAYER menu and going to stack which is the stack

02:06.040 --> 02:10.300
of all of these items here and we've got reverse layer order.

02:10.330 --> 02:16.440
The moment we do that now when we go to our filters go to combine and do fused layers.

02:16.630 --> 02:21.690
We will get out the sprite sheets in the right order.

02:21.700 --> 02:26.950
Now the downside of doing this is we produce a sprite sheet that is not a power of 2.

02:26.950 --> 02:32.710
So if there's any MIP mapping or any compression that's going to be done on this Sprite that may cause

02:32.740 --> 02:37.930
issues and it may also cause issues with bleeding in and out of the particular sprites.

02:37.930 --> 02:44.110
Now in this case we do have a large area of white so it's very unlikely there's going to be any bleeding

02:44.110 --> 02:49.090
between the individual images but with different sprites that may not be the case.

02:49.270 --> 02:55.000
One of the things to bear in mind when you're doing this of course is you can make a power of two if

02:55.000 --> 02:57.350
you have the right number of images.

02:57.370 --> 03:03.550
So if we go back to our original hair and decide that we can completely cap the first two sets delete

03:03.580 --> 03:09.190
the first two and the last two we've now got 16 images.

03:09.580 --> 03:18.220
So if we go ahead with filters combine and fuse layers and have four because 16 we'll have four going

03:18.220 --> 03:21.300
down and then we have a look at the very top.

03:21.460 --> 03:30.460
We've got 512 by 512 and under image you'll see that you also have on the canvas size the 512 by 512

03:30.490 --> 03:31.090
as well.

03:31.210 --> 03:35.080
So you can go about it that way as well.

03:35.080 --> 03:40.570
So it's much much quicker making a sprite sheet that way once you've got the layers in the right order

03:40.780 --> 03:43.120
reading from the top left to the bottom right.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.490
However it does come with some caveats as most things do when they're automatic and one click.

03:48.610 --> 03:50.600
You just have to live with some of the effects.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.140
So there's a little bit of work to do.

03:52.270 --> 03:57.280
Just to remind you here the process if you've already made an animation you're going to have to invert

03:57.280 --> 04:02.230
the layer order with layer stack and reverse the layer order.

04:02.230 --> 04:07.490
Now in this particular case if we go to the one I made that ended up 640 by 512.

04:07.630 --> 04:14.170
What you can do at that point to make it a power of two is add in the space that's missing.

04:14.170 --> 04:18.940
Now in this case it's probably best to work out how many across you are going to need any way to reach

04:19.420 --> 04:29.120
1024 but we can at this point go to image canvas size and make this longest sized 1 0 2 4 and that will

04:29.120 --> 04:32.690
make the entire image a power of 2.

04:32.780 --> 04:36.030
As you can see there's a bit of dead space on the end.

04:36.080 --> 04:42.340
Now the way that this would be read by a game engine it would actually put blank frames in for three.

04:42.340 --> 04:43.850
It looks like three frames there.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.620
So if we have one two three four five six seven eight.

04:47.630 --> 04:54.620
So in this particular case if we go back to our original that we had I'm going to undo those changes

04:54.620 --> 04:55.820
going back to our base.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.560
Oh I do want to reverse the lower order.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.920
That's fine.

04:59.060 --> 05:07.370
And now if we go to filters combine and fuse layers and that she put eight in it will end up 1024 by

05:07.370 --> 05:09.230
3 8 4.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.840
Then we can go to image canvas size.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.990
Change this to five twelve.

05:15.140 --> 05:22.190
And lo behold we would have generated the same sprite sheet that we made in a previous lecture automatically

05:22.280 --> 05:24.220
and with less steps.

05:24.380 --> 05:27.410
It doesn't give us the control that we would otherwise have.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.160
But there you go.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.710
We've managed to put everything in order very very quickly indeed.

05:32.930 --> 05:37.630
And now you've got that knowledge of course we need to solidify that with a challenge.

05:37.670 --> 05:43.730
So go ahead create a spreadsheet using fused layers test that the sprite sheet works.

05:43.760 --> 05:49.130
Now you can use one of the online tools that we found before or indeed if you were capable of using

05:49.160 --> 05:51.910
a game engine and you're actually making your art.

05:51.920 --> 05:58.520
Now to go into a game engine then in unity or unreal whatever to test it in that as well as a sprite

05:58.540 --> 06:04.400
she really honed those skills bring it right through the graphics and art pipeline into the game engine.

06:04.550 --> 06:10.100
And how about practicing your skills so far and creating a new animation perhaps something different

06:10.100 --> 06:12.650
from what you've been working on so far.

06:12.650 --> 06:19.120
Go ahead pause video and give that a go Okay everyone welcome back.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.720
Let's go and create a new sprite sheet using fused layers

06:25.800 --> 06:26.140
okay.

06:26.150 --> 06:31.040
So back in Gimp I'm not going to go ahead and create something in this particular challenge example

06:31.300 --> 06:35.170
I'm going to go and find one of the pieces that I've used in the past.

06:35.180 --> 06:41.300
You may remember seeing the explosion and I'm going to go find that and incorporate it into a sprite

06:41.300 --> 06:43.180
sheet okay.

06:43.180 --> 06:46.840
So here we go I've got a lo fi explosion.

06:46.870 --> 06:49.240
It splits into multiple layers.

06:49.240 --> 06:54.190
However they're all in one layer group and that was so I could move them to a new place.

06:54.190 --> 07:00.160
So I'm going to have to first take them out of the layer group hopefully in the right order so that

07:00.190 --> 07:02.520
I can just join them all together and we can see there.

07:02.530 --> 07:09.640
I've got an uneven amount so that's go ahead we're almost done here and we've definitely got a layering

07:09.670 --> 07:11.810
issue here if I'm not careful.

07:11.860 --> 07:15.090
Call layer cop before is actually the first frame.

07:15.100 --> 07:19.050
So we've got a bit of a naming issue here as well if we're not careful.

07:19.330 --> 07:23.540
I can go in and rename those I'm not going to do that in this particular lecture.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.120
It's not about naming.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.280
I've got them all laid out there I can see it's 64 by 64.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.340
And I have 14 of them.

07:30.340 --> 07:35.640
So it's going to be probably four or eight across to make sure we get the right number in.

07:35.830 --> 07:40.440
I'm going to go to the layer stack reverse the layer order.

07:40.450 --> 07:47.200
So it starts at the beginning at the top and works its way down and then go to filters combine fuse

07:47.200 --> 07:48.780
layers.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.860
Now I said eight before I'm going to go for eight and that looks absolutely fine.

07:53.870 --> 08:02.600
I'm gonna go ahead and save that as an explosion sprite sheet is important to save you work regularly.

08:02.600 --> 08:02.990
There we go.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.420
And of course I need to export that.

08:05.430 --> 08:15.210
Let's export stars and then I'm gonna pop this in the same folder that I'm working in and export.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.130
Great.

08:16.170 --> 08:22.020
So now let's go ahead and see whether the sprite she animates as I would expect it to okay.

08:22.030 --> 08:28.210
So let's go ahead and load up my file now that that's loaded up 64 by 64 is fine.

08:28.220 --> 08:34.390
That looks like it's exploding and then stopping for some reason what was the reason for that.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.010
Well the frame count is not correct.

08:36.010 --> 08:38.170
Now I think I've got 14 frames.

08:38.170 --> 08:39.430
I did not count.

08:39.430 --> 08:43.540
I really should have done so let's go see and the numbers aren't going to help yes I am going to have

08:43.540 --> 08:46.320
to it's 1 2 THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT.

08:46.390 --> 08:49.950
I think we've got 15 in total so let's go back.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.140
Change this from 14 to 15 frame time Campbell.

08:53.200 --> 08:58.610
Let's make it a rapid explosion maybe make it 50 milliseconds in between.

08:58.610 --> 09:00.740
Boom you see that.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.340
That's that I think that's a little quicker shear.

09:03.490 --> 09:07.270
And I do think this was designed to be at 10 frames per second.

09:07.270 --> 09:07.750
There we go.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.300
Boom.

09:09.370 --> 09:10.900
I like how that's turned out.

09:10.900 --> 09:16.630
Let me zoom in so everybody can see it's a bit better because it is a small 64 by 64.

09:16.660 --> 09:16.930
Yep.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.290
I really like how that's turned out.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.920
How did you guys get on.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.020
I'd love to see what you guys have made and I will see you will in the next lecture.
