Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture where we are going to deal with a simple way to generate

00:10.110 --> 00:12.340
a repeating texture.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.940
Now there is a more advanced way where you can make things seamless You can repeat them over and over

00:17.940 --> 00:18.440
again.

00:18.450 --> 00:23.880
However there are some tips and tricks that you can employ So you don't have to spend a lot of time

00:23.880 --> 00:26.030
generating a texture that will repeat.

00:26.100 --> 00:32.790
Well right so before we get going let's talk about the principles that make this a very easy way of

00:32.790 --> 00:35.260
repeating a pattern or texture.

00:35.340 --> 00:41.490
Over and over again without having to spend too much time working on it it's especially important when

00:41.490 --> 00:45.630
you're working on prototypes and trying to get ideas together quickly.

00:45.740 --> 00:52.170
So I'm going to go ahead now and create a new image I'm going to make it 256 by 256 doesn't have to

00:52.170 --> 00:53.060
be that large.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.410
But that's the size that I'm going for at the moment.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.430
A control shift in J.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.310
So I can zoom in all the way.

00:59.610 --> 01:05.580
Now one of the things you can do really quickly is grab something like a pencil tool and just mock-up

01:05.580 --> 01:06.910
what you'll go into doing.

01:07.020 --> 01:12.350
So I'm going to have a wall area around here and there's going to be a floor.

01:13.350 --> 01:16.560
Now that by itself is potentially repeatable.

01:16.620 --> 01:22.800
However if there's a pattern on the wall it may not merge properly when you put another wall statement

01:22.830 --> 01:24.380
next to it.

01:24.390 --> 01:29.280
Now of course at the moment we're just talking about putting these images next to one another side by

01:29.280 --> 01:32.620
side rather than above and below as well.

01:32.620 --> 01:39.210
Now when you put images next to one another in this fashion that is called tiling and we need to make

01:39.210 --> 01:43.720
sure that in this case the image tiles without looking too odd.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.780
Now one of the things we can do is add something in on this side of the image.

01:48.780 --> 01:54.930
And then when it repeats over and over we've got a natural buffer on this side that make sure that the

01:54.930 --> 01:58.350
pattern is different on one side than the other.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.600
So just go ahead and work on that.

02:00.600 --> 02:07.980
Now we can do it very quickly using the buckets all the fill tool and also some patterns to really get

02:07.980 --> 02:09.200
it going quickly.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.630
So I'm going to go ahead now and create myself a new layer.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.060
I'm going to call this laser beam.

02:15.110 --> 02:20.310
Now I don't know if that's exactly right at the moment so let's go ahead and just create a selection

02:20.310 --> 02:24.550
so I can fill that in roughly the right size here.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.410
Now I'm pretty sure that's too big yes is too big.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.810
Down at the bottom here.

02:28.930 --> 02:33.670
So just moving the image round a little I can grab this handle here and move it up.

02:33.900 --> 02:39.620
And you can see that at the very bottom of the screen there's the dimensions of this selection.

02:39.780 --> 02:46.470
And we can see they're going to need to be 256 to be the right height for the image making sure that

02:46.470 --> 02:53.250
the active player is the beam player we can go to our fill buckets go to our pattern fill and find maybe

02:53.250 --> 02:57.140
something wooden since it is a beam we go ahead and put that in.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.810
You'll see that most beams do not have the wood with the grain running that direction.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.960
What's the solution to this will unfortunately we don't have the skills yet to edit and change patterns.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.540
However what we can do is a little bit of a workaround.

03:10.650 --> 03:18.150
We can rotate our image under the image menu transform and 90 degrees if a clockwise or counterclockwise

03:18.660 --> 03:25.320
then we put our wood in the grains going the right way and then go back to each transform and go the

03:25.350 --> 03:27.170
opposite way so went clockwise.

03:27.170 --> 03:34.230
The first time so counterclockwise and now we go we've got the been in a vertical position and now going

03:34.230 --> 03:38.180
to go ahead and create another layer and then keep it all beam.

03:38.190 --> 03:42.530
It's not the right name I'm going to call it Wall and we can build things up in this manner.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.810
Now I'm going to use a shortcut key control.

03:44.870 --> 03:51.800
I need to invert that selection you can also do that through a select menu and invert once that's done

03:51.840 --> 03:53.510
we can fill in the other area.

03:53.520 --> 03:59.130
Now I don't not pick anything specific here I'm going to pick something that looks roughly a texture

03:59.220 --> 04:01.040
a wall texture and there we go.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.590
We've got fat there ready to go.

04:03.630 --> 04:07.670
Now it would be a good idea to see how this would end up repeating.

04:07.920 --> 04:15.540
And what we can do here is go to filter's map and then go down to tile.

04:15.540 --> 04:22.650
When we do this we go on option and to create a new image I always suggest creating an image see don't

04:22.650 --> 04:26.180
accidentally overwrite what you currently have.

04:26.260 --> 04:29.280
We can set the width here maybe two to four times it's current.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.370
We're going to go for a thousand twenty force of the tanabe four of these repeated do make sure that

04:34.370 --> 04:39.480
the little chaneling there is disabled Otherwise you're changing in both the width and the height.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.410
Once we done that we can click okay.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.360
You start scratching your head.

04:43.380 --> 04:48.510
Well this is one of those tools that much like the other ones we've used so far you need to make sure

04:48.510 --> 04:52.540
things are in l.a. group to do to be able to work properly.

04:52.620 --> 04:59.190
So you go back to our original image create a layer group and I'm going to call it wall section so you

04:59.190 --> 05:01.440
can start building things up this way in a drag.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.540
The wall in and we're draped the beam in at this point in time it doesn't really matter which order

05:06.540 --> 05:09.750
they are because none not one of them's in front of the other.

05:09.750 --> 05:18.420
In this particular case with the wall selection wood the wall section selected in the layers we can

05:18.420 --> 05:21.360
then go to filter's map.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.380
Tile and then it hasn't remembered the previous ones.

05:25.380 --> 05:32.040
We had to go in one or two four and now it will repeat and we can see there that breaks up the flow

05:32.040 --> 05:33.470
really really well.

05:34.270 --> 05:39.430
Just a reminder here that if you've got a different one selected like the background it will export

05:39.430 --> 05:46.480
that instead to that new image so just to test it and verify doesn't matter what size we put in here

05:46.480 --> 05:49.220
really as long as it's larger and there we go.

05:49.360 --> 05:56.800
So it's repeating that first selected were ever the active selected layer will be or in this case the

05:56.800 --> 05:59.530
active selected layer group.

05:59.530 --> 06:05.740
Finally the more bespoke way of doing this would be to go ahead and create yourself a new image set

06:05.740 --> 06:09.540
to an appropriate height and width for what you want to do.

06:09.670 --> 06:14.740
In this case so I've got for going along just for testing purposes to make sure that these are going

06:14.740 --> 06:22.060
to gel together as we would expect them to and then go to our view turn on the snap to grid make sure

06:22.060 --> 06:28.440
that show grid is enabled and then on the image configure the grid to be an appropriate size.

06:28.450 --> 06:35.140
And we're working at 256 here so we need to go 256 256 click ourselves.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.030
Okay.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.650
Now we can go to our original image grab that wall section and pop it in.

06:41.470 --> 06:44.880
Then using the move tool a line it's the appropriate location.

06:44.920 --> 06:51.580
Now you may notice there I didn't have the layer group selected So it's moved everything else that select

06:51.580 --> 06:56.240
the lower group and make sure that move the active layer is selected as well.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.580
No we get that snaps into place.

06:58.810 --> 07:02.920
We can then go in and duplicate the layer group and move it to another location.

07:02.980 --> 07:08.550
And this is good if you've made up multiple sections that you want to see how they fit together.

07:08.740 --> 07:17.080
Or of course with it 1024 by 256 you could build up a base image that you're going to edit a bit further

07:17.430 --> 07:23.310
got a bit more variation to your wall because that would also be an acceptable pair of two game assets

07:23.310 --> 07:25.090
that you could use.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.840
And that's right it's now time for a challenge.

07:27.910 --> 07:35.050
I'd like you to go ahead a mock-up your own simple repeating wall section specifically for your dungeon.

07:35.050 --> 07:40.060
Now look at reference images not only to keep you true to what it should be looking like but also from

07:40.060 --> 07:47.370
maybe a bit of inspiration because I'd also like you to make at least two variations of your wall segments.

07:48.100 --> 07:53.530
Finally something that you should consider is what resolution is right for this mock-up.

07:53.530 --> 07:58.640
I suggest starting at a lower resolution and aiming for more of a pixel art.

07:58.660 --> 08:02.600
Look especially if you are brand new to this.

08:02.740 --> 08:09.670
I am probably going to downgrade to maybe as low as 64 by 64 providing Net gives me enough resolution

08:09.910 --> 08:12.820
that I can see details that I'm putting in.

08:12.820 --> 08:19.120
Remember you can always increase the resolution by going to the image menu and changing the canvas size

08:19.750 --> 08:24.440
so this challenge is likely to take around 10 to 20 minutes to do so.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.030
I will see you all in the next lecture.
