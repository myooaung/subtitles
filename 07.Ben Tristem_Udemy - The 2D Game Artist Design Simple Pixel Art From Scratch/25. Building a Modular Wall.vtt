00:04.660 --> 00:07.320
Okay so let's start by making our wall segment.

00:07.360 --> 00:14.920
I am going to build it up basically first and then if I need more detail I can increase the resolution

00:15.040 --> 00:16.290
as well.

00:16.300 --> 00:21.550
I'm thinking 64 by 64 be a good start point for this.

00:21.550 --> 00:26.420
And let's zoom all the way in and come back out just a not so I can see my borders.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.030
Now let's go to our colour palette.

00:29.050 --> 00:34.690
Note that just go to colour and block out where things are going so I'm going to try and get a a sort

00:34.690 --> 00:37.710
of a dirty brown for the actual ground itself.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.060
And I'm little you going to use the pencil tool I'm going to need a bit more than that maybe 10 pixels

00:43.580 --> 00:45.950
and block in the Ground segment.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.520
I feel can be a little more than that.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.980
And thinking about what else I can include on this particular layer.

00:52.990 --> 00:56.710
Remember I did have that port colour shutting that was quite fun.

00:56.710 --> 00:58.400
That might be able to be incorporated.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.540
Now it is a different size to this particular image.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.850
I think it was actually 128.

01:05.050 --> 01:05.560
I'm not sure.

01:05.560 --> 01:11.090
But anyway after this ground area there's the base of the wall itself.

01:11.090 --> 01:16.470
So let's go and find the base of the wall or at least the colour for it anyway.

01:16.540 --> 01:23.530
And then let's lower this down to may be all four pixels wide yet that looks about barite.

01:23.530 --> 01:25.500
So we've got this base bits at the bottom.

01:25.510 --> 01:28.140
And then we've got the bit above it as well.

01:28.150 --> 01:35.120
Now all of this of course is just to get the idea the block colours in place.

01:35.410 --> 01:38.830
And let's use the filter all to do the up a bit here.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.830
Now of course that's a pattern I didn't change it to a colour.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.180
I'm going to leave it like that for the moment.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.600
So back to the task at hand.

01:45.610 --> 01:52.090
You can see here on this background at 64 by 64 I've put in a little fill layer at the top using one

01:52.090 --> 01:57.370
of the Patons and I've drawn the bottom of the wall and then the floor underneath.

01:57.370 --> 01:59.020
Now this is a good starting point.

01:59.020 --> 02:03.100
What I don't have yet is currently the pillar that will go up and down.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.590
So let's go ahead and pick a colour for that because only going to be slightly darker there and then

02:08.760 --> 02:09.980
with the pencil tool.

02:10.060 --> 02:12.030
Again this is all blocking out at the moment.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.710
I'm only going to go to four pixels wide but this will go all the way down to the bottom and I am going

02:17.710 --> 02:20.620
to have to fill in this little area around the bottom.

02:20.620 --> 02:29.830
Now if this was a relief this was a pillar which is supposed to be it will actually come down at the

02:29.830 --> 02:31.650
bottom and then back out again.

02:31.660 --> 02:35.120
That's just the way it would work it would come out props.

02:35.260 --> 02:42.580
Not to that degree perhaps a little less than that but it will actually come out slightly below what

02:42.580 --> 02:44.450
we can see here.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.410
And again that's probably better.

02:46.660 --> 02:52.150
Oh wait a minute no it does need to be a little bit further down but that's the base of the wall and

02:52.180 --> 02:52.800
about that.

02:52.810 --> 02:55.250
Yes that's definitely sticking out a bit further now.

02:55.330 --> 02:58.150
Definitely looks like Papilla on the floor.

02:58.150 --> 02:59.710
Perfect.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.660
So now I've got the block work done.

03:01.660 --> 03:05.970
It is a matter of filling in the detail where it's necessary.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.530
And for that I'm just going to use all the tools we've learned so far.

03:09.550 --> 03:13.480
And before I do that I'm going to make sure I save my work.

03:13.480 --> 03:20.820
I've had a habit recently of forgetting to save what I've been working on until right at the very end.

03:20.920 --> 03:28.000
And whilst that doesn't really matter in terms of the output that we're currently doing what does matter

03:28.240 --> 03:30.790
is that you get into the habit of saving your works.

03:30.810 --> 03:34.720
Can I say this as wall section.

03:34.720 --> 03:40.580
Then once I've built up this section I can think go ahead and think about using this particular wall

03:40.600 --> 03:45.690
section again and producing a nother wall piece from it.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.320
Save me a lot of time.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.600
Some of the speed up the video.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.940
Now whilst I have the rest of the detail.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.380
Case I'm hopping back pin here.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.670
I'm going to have an overlay called brick work.

04:01.670 --> 04:08.630
In fact this one's going to be specifically for the pillar said brickwork pillar and then I can go ahead

04:08.660 --> 04:14.570
and add the detail for the brickwork just above its like.

04:14.690 --> 04:20.870
Even see here and then what that does mean is I've got a tiny layer that I can repeat and repeat and

04:20.870 --> 04:23.900
repeat and then merge back onto itself.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.290
So here I'm going to duplicate and grab the move tool.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.920
I'm going to zoom in so I can do some counting as well.

04:30.920 --> 04:37.790
We can see that's one two three four pixels up site a move that the four pixels up that it needs to

04:37.790 --> 04:45.110
be duplicate and do the same and then eventually once I've done a couple of them I can merge them down

04:45.960 --> 04:50.620
right clicking and merge down right click merge down.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.170
Now I can go ahead and when I duplicate.

04:53.180 --> 04:55.210
I've got three to play with.

04:55.460 --> 05:00.490
So it ends up being much faster to produce shit or artwork in that way.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.880
And again I can duplicate again and pull this up.

05:05.060 --> 05:11.660
Never find one there it will end up off the actual screen but that's absolutely fine.

05:11.750 --> 05:18.840
That's given me the affect that I wanted and I can merge that all down into the final layers.

05:19.010 --> 05:24.500
And once I've done that I can add in the other details or make sure that the right thing and then finally

05:24.500 --> 05:27.310
I can add in the other details when necessary.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.030
Okay so one thing that I've noticed as I've been playing about is I've inadvertently gone over the top

05:40.030 --> 05:47.380
of the brick work pillar itself and it's just a matter here of grabbing the eraser tool zooming into

05:47.380 --> 05:51.530
the appropriate location and just fixing those issues.

05:51.530 --> 05:57.970
Now it may be quite difficult to do that as you can see but because it's on a separate lay what I can

05:57.970 --> 06:05.410
do is grab a slightly larger brush size with the eraser tool setting it's a hard edged and finding the

06:05.500 --> 06:13.770
edge of that pillar and simply erasing down now now opes Hey you do that.

06:13.780 --> 06:14.670
It won't work.

06:14.830 --> 06:20.740
I have selected the wrong layer so let me undo that and then select the right layer and then that should

06:20.740 --> 06:23.370
clean up the mess I made earlier.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.790
There we go.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.510
So nice and tidy now we've got a hard edge along there.

06:29.630 --> 06:30.920
On the edge of the pillar.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.280
And we've also got one at the top as well.

06:34.280 --> 06:39.440
Now I'm not quite liking the mixture of textures here I'm not sure whether that works or not remember

06:39.440 --> 06:40.890
I turned the background off.

06:40.960 --> 06:47.430
I pretty much do anything I'd like evos but otherwise I quite like how it's looking.

06:47.450 --> 06:53.960
I am going to do something with this ground though at the speckling kind of works but it doesn't at

06:53.960 --> 06:55.950
the same time and not liking it.

06:56.300 --> 07:01.280
So going to go to my pattern fill and see if there's something else on the site she brick work in this

07:01.280 --> 07:02.110
pattern fill.

07:02.270 --> 07:07.130
Let's put that on the floor and see if that look okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.010
I'm not sure it does she know and I'll undo that and just see if there's anything else that would work

07:13.010 --> 07:14.710
really quickly ills.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.330
It's always worthwhile try these things out you know.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.780
Never quite sure how it's going to end up.

07:19.910 --> 07:23.180
There's probably a little dark house for these speckles that are on it.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.830
I am also not liking though.

07:24.830 --> 07:29.850
So it's time for the Erase tool and they go right over the top of this.

07:31.550 --> 07:35.130
Hopefully not erase anything important as I do.

07:35.390 --> 07:36.020
Okay.

07:36.020 --> 07:41.630
So we need to figure else down at the bottom here and grab the selection tool and select the appropriate

07:41.660 --> 07:42.530
area.

07:42.820 --> 07:46.480
It's good to have to be one pixel lower than that looking at it.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.630
And let's try some other options Phil tool.

07:50.660 --> 07:51.890
Let's try that.

07:51.940 --> 07:53.360
Do I like that.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.330
I think that's a good starting point.

07:55.460 --> 07:59.840
I'm not quite sure on that pilaro I think it needs a bit more shading along it but otherwise that's

07:59.840 --> 08:03.290
a great starting point for H duplication.

08:03.410 --> 08:09.900
So I'm going to add everything to a layer group can call that layer group wall.

08:10.280 --> 08:15.560
I'm going to call it a solid wall thinking about what I want to do next and I'm going to put everything

08:15.680 --> 08:17.250
in that group.

08:17.300 --> 08:22.120
Hopefully it will all appear in the right order of was a have this and reordering came as a great start

08:22.130 --> 08:25.940
and then I can duplicate the group and turn the other one off.

08:25.940 --> 08:29.070
So there's absolutely no confusion once I've done that.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.770
So this is solid solid.

08:30.780 --> 08:31.730
I forgot.

08:31.940 --> 08:37.960
That's obviously my typing I'm thinking and talking at the same time and I could call this maybe windows

08:37.980 --> 08:40.030
wall or something along those lines.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.930
And then obviously go about making a window.

08:49.470 --> 08:57.300
Now in order to cover this window in I am going to pick a similar colour that we've got where and I

08:57.530 --> 09:03.780
actually I didn't mean to put that pattern in but you know what I think that works that works better

09:03.780 --> 09:07.830
than the what I was going to do with the Pilla Excellent.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.460
Okay that's worked out relatively well.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.840
So I've now got my two wall pieces.

09:12.870 --> 09:16.740
Let's see how they all fit together in order to test these.

09:16.740 --> 09:22.300
I am going to go down the route of creating a new image that's going to be 64 in height.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.740
But the width itself I'm going to set it in maybe two five six.

09:25.740 --> 09:31.160
There's plenty of space to test these various labour groups and then I can go and grab the windowed

09:31.170 --> 09:38.580
wall and drop it in and then I can also go in grab the solid wall and dropped it onto here as well.

09:38.670 --> 09:42.120
Then it is a matter of arranging it so it makes some sense.

09:42.240 --> 09:49.860
Bring that in cross and we can see here that we've got a bit of a layer issue would be nice if it was

09:49.860 --> 09:51.810
all 64 by 64.

09:51.810 --> 09:58.050
So in that case a bit of optimization to be done is making sure that once we're happy with this I can

09:58.050 --> 09:59.250
save it.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.180
All section.

10:02.180 --> 10:02.840
There we go.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.130
And replace.

10:04.130 --> 10:09.200
And then finally I'm going to I could go in there and restrict the layers down that would be one way

10:09.470 --> 10:10.460
of approaching this.

10:10.670 --> 10:14.480
But instead of doing that for every single hour must save as and make this one.

10:14.490 --> 10:22.370
Flatow And now that it's flattened or it's not flattened yet but I can go in nerja the lower group emerge

10:22.460 --> 10:23.750
the other layer group.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.660
There we go.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.410
So these are now two images.

10:26.410 --> 10:30.490
We still have a bit of an issue with the overall size of the layers.

10:30.500 --> 10:36.650
So we go to our layers and we do layer to image size for both of these layers.

10:36.650 --> 10:42.440
Now I could have done that to each individual one has we went but I'm quite happy doing it in this manner

10:42.920 --> 10:45.770
then this is a matter of tracking it across and putting it on.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.960
And then we've got something we can work with.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.870
I'm just going to clear everything else that's on here.

10:51.170 --> 10:56.070
There we go we've got an empty canvas ready to receive as one.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.260
Here's the next one.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.440
And then these should go together relatively well.

11:05.770 --> 11:06.550
There we go.

11:06.550 --> 11:07.530
Perfect.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.580
How did you guys get on.

11:09.580 --> 11:13.800
There are several variations I'd love to make on this but this is a great start.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.780
We can see how these pieces would go together.

11:16.780 --> 11:21.090
And of course now we've got a much larger image as well we could work on this one.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.620
Hence building up from piece to piece as it goes.

11:24.670 --> 11:27.570
And I really like this window is completely an accident.

11:27.580 --> 11:32.080
I didn't even appreciate that was what I was going to put there because I wasn't paying attention to

11:32.080 --> 11:33.950
whether pattern was selected or not.

11:34.090 --> 11:35.830
But that worked out well in the end.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.410
How did you guys get on.

11:37.420 --> 11:41.000
I'd love to see your wall segments and how they're coming together.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.670
Make sure you share your work over in the discussions.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.260
And I will see you in the next lecture.
