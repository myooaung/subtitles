00:04.180 --> 00:08.900
Okay so continuing on from the last lecture we have a challenge.

00:09.040 --> 00:20.500
So create for new 32 by 32 images and use the selection modifiers in each one focus on the first one

00:20.500 --> 00:27.750
being the shrinks selection so in one of your images used the shrink selection in the next one use gross

00:27.750 --> 00:34.960
selection for the third use border selection and then finally use whatever you like in the fourth one

00:35.170 --> 00:39.180
that will really help hone your skills with this selection tool.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.020
And then finally of course I'd like you to share your work upscale its 64 by 64 and share it in the

00:46.030 --> 00:47.520
discussions.

00:47.590 --> 00:51.720
And here's an example of the type of image that I'll be creating.

00:51.730 --> 00:57.040
So we've got a shield inside a border and a little drop shadow behind it.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.450
Pause the video now and give that a go.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.300
Okay guys welcome back.

01:03.430 --> 01:08.160
Let's go ahead now and focus on news and selection modifiers when creating an image.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.260
Okay everyone so we're back over in guimpe.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.610
I have my reference shield over here.

01:14.750 --> 01:22.970
I have a brand new 32 by 32 image that I can work with and I'm going to combine everything into one

01:23.300 --> 01:26.170
so that this lecture remains relatively short.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.180
And of course then we've covered everything as well.

01:29.300 --> 01:35.090
So the first thing I'm going to focus on is a pretty border around the outside literally using the select

01:35.150 --> 01:36.230
and the border.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.780
I'm going to select everything in order to start with control and a selected everything then I'm going

01:41.780 --> 01:45.620
to go up to select and go to a border.

01:45.620 --> 01:49.930
Now how wide do I want someone to try to pick source and anglicare Okay.

01:50.690 --> 01:51.490
Excellent.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.580
Now I don't want to put this on the background.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.940
I'm going to make a new layer and I'm going to call this back grauer border.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.660
Border would make more sense than anything else.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.390
And there we go we got a baudelaire.

02:03.410 --> 02:04.700
And I'm just going to colour that in.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.150
I need to pick an appropriate Brown maybe a darker brown.

02:08.150 --> 02:08.930
There we go.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.390
And the fill so goes for the filter.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.780
And fill that in.

02:12.950 --> 02:16.330
That doesn't look like it's the fill foreground colour fill.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.370
Okay so immediately got an issue here.

02:19.370 --> 02:22.520
Biton get around round match straightaway set of going backwards.

02:22.520 --> 02:27.470
By going to fill hole selection and then it won't try and match any colours.

02:27.470 --> 02:27.950
There we go.

02:27.950 --> 02:28.900
That's that done.

02:29.060 --> 02:33.060
And going to combine that straightaway with a shrink operation.

02:33.060 --> 02:35.760
Some of the go to select and shrink.

02:36.170 --> 02:43.030
Then I'll have a little raised area one pixel is fine in the middle and I'm good to make that lighter

02:43.070 --> 02:47.340
since it is a raised area or certainly to give that effect.

02:48.390 --> 02:50.220
Maybe that's excellent.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.930
Okay so that's my border done I'm going to create a new laser straight away so I don't get confused

02:54.930 --> 03:03.320
with anything else and I'm going to call it shield outline and this is going to require a bit of drawing.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.890
There are a couple of ways I could go about making this of course.

03:05.970 --> 03:11.130
I'm going to make it as a silhouette to begin with just to make sure I've got the overall size correct

03:11.480 --> 03:16.080
and obviously at the moment if I try and draw anywhere I won't be able to because I've got this area

03:16.080 --> 03:22.790
selected around the border of my image so I'm going to go ahead and select everything by selecting none.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.530
With control shift in a.

03:25.460 --> 03:25.860
There go.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.190
I'm ready to draw now.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.400
Now gilberton the size of my brush up a little to begin with.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.800
Maybe it's 8 pixels.

03:31.840 --> 03:38.270
Yeah that looks reasonable and I'm just going to block this out ever so roughly.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.720
Can undo that last one and perhaps only go to there.

03:41.770 --> 03:42.400
Okay.

03:42.480 --> 03:48.700
And then we're going to go down to maybe there before coming in and then I'm going to turn my brush

03:48.700 --> 03:50.380
size all the way down.

03:50.500 --> 03:56.410
Now as always when it comes to working with a 32 by 32 image there is no direct Centre some only going

03:56.410 --> 04:04.290
to go down to the second pixel down there and then finally let's fill this in the finish off.

04:04.360 --> 04:04.820
Whoops.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.550
So one left whole selection turned on find similar colours.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.120
There we go.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.340
So that's a rough outline for the shield.

04:12.340 --> 04:17.040
There are a couple of other shapes she could go for of course and this is looking slightly lopsided

04:17.590 --> 04:20.120
and I'm guessing no.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.400
That's pretty good there.

04:21.400 --> 04:27.530
I'm guessing I've just gone too far with one of my selections so let's just try that again.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.410
So from here.

04:30.820 --> 04:34.010
Probably that but does look better now.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.130
Yes my eyes are going fuzzy.

04:36.130 --> 04:36.950
Looking at that.

04:36.970 --> 04:37.680
There we go.

04:37.930 --> 04:41.500
So this is a great start we've got a silhouette of our shield.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.200
Now I'm going to select that using the fuzzy Select Tool.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.780
And I don't actually want it.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.150
I've made this too big thinking about it.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.870
I don't want it touching the border.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.040
I want a slight gap spungen to do a couple of things.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.920
You can go about this of course a couple of ways you could start removing some of the edge or I can

05:00.920 --> 05:06.830
grab what selection I've currently got so I really retain that overall shape and shrink the selection

05:06.830 --> 05:10.880
again by one now is going to bring it up by two at the bottom.

05:10.880 --> 05:16.370
But otherwise it fits in and I can create a new layer and call this shield.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.640
Since it was just the outline I was focussing on before this new law is going to be the shield itself

05:22.090 --> 05:28.000
and literally pick any colour I want at this point just so it's stands out.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.430
And then I'm going to fill this area in.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.560
And there we go.

05:32.580 --> 05:37.680
Now what I don't like about this of course is that there's two at the bottom so old and clear my selection

05:37.680 --> 05:41.910
go back to the pencil tool and just fill in those two blobs at the bottom.

05:41.910 --> 05:46.760
And we've got an area at the back here the shield outline that I might be able to use in a moment.

05:46.770 --> 05:50.160
I'm going to turn it off so it's not in the way.

05:50.310 --> 05:53.330
Now we've got a few extra layers to do so let's go in.

05:53.340 --> 05:58.680
I'm going to find my shield and call this the supports for the Sheela.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.840
Suppose I had it again.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.550
It's probably got a technical name.

06:02.700 --> 06:10.470
And so we need a lighter colour going from the top to the bottom but not all the way at the top.

06:10.770 --> 06:11.670
Let's go.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.020
Yeah.

06:12.090 --> 06:19.390
From here to here and then back up again and then across from here to here and here to here.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.070
Now this is the style of shield that I'm going for.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.710
You can of course choose a completely different style.

06:24.900 --> 06:29.120
Now if I turn the outline back on we see ah there we go.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.700
That's what we can use this for.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.460
It's turned into an outline.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.390
Excellent.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.440
I'll leave it like that now.

06:35.460 --> 06:40.010
Let's fill in these last two bits down at the bottom making sure I'm still on support layer.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.460
Okay that's good.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.670
Now I'm going to put in a little.

06:43.710 --> 06:47.620
I suppose it's a rivet in the centre here.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.620
And in order to make that shape appropriate I'm actually going to use a growth tool.

06:52.620 --> 06:57.650
So I've got the rivets set there and then a select black for the moment just so I can see what I'm drawing

06:57.660 --> 06:59.570
I've got a little black area there.

06:59.610 --> 07:06.300
I'm now going to use the Select Tool to select it the fuzzy Select Tool and then I'm going to go select

07:06.390 --> 07:10.300
and grow that and that should give me two pixels.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.760
Yeah let's try two pixels.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.150
Yeah that's okay.

07:13.150 --> 07:17.420
And if you're ever in doubt of course you can try it if it doesn't work try it again.

07:17.580 --> 07:23.160
And then I'm going to just colorin this area essentially So it's all one colour and because it's so

07:23.160 --> 07:25.080
small not a bother turning up my breast size.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.600
Now Black is no good.

07:26.610 --> 07:29.250
So now it's all one colour I can go to the fill tool.

07:29.270 --> 07:33.440
What could any wakers at be selected so Club skip to step here.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.480
Never mind and go to the pattern fill.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.370
I'm just going to pick something from there that hopefully will look okay.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.880
Let's just try something like that.

07:42.950 --> 07:43.190
Yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.040
That standing out.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.090
Okay.

07:45.270 --> 07:48.830
Now the shield itself I'm going to fill that in as well.

07:48.870 --> 07:51.350
And again this is this is just a quick way.

07:51.480 --> 07:58.290
I need to turn off selection this is just a quick way of trying to work out whether or not it's going

07:58.290 --> 08:00.420
to work how you expect it to.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.550
I don't like that I want it to be darker.

08:03.630 --> 08:04.340
Numerous ways.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.610
Yes I like fat.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.120
I'm going to keep that one there.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.750
Finally we've got our support.

08:09.810 --> 08:14.530
I don't want it just being plain white or do I all try bright red.

08:14.630 --> 08:17.380
Shouldn't be so excited about that or maybe I should.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.610
Let's find a foreground colour.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.420
Make it bright red like an emblem for.

08:22.740 --> 08:23.680
Yeah.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.440
I like that.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.420
And I'm going it's going to try something here.

08:27.630 --> 08:31.710
I'm going to go ahead and duplicate that support.

08:31.710 --> 08:37.670
So at the bottom of the layers tab itself we got a few options if every go to the duplicates.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.510
We've now got two of them.

08:39.510 --> 08:42.330
I can now use my fuzzy select tool to select that.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.600
And I'm just going to grow that by one.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.840
So grow by 1 pixel.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.080
Okay.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.230
That's working out so far.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.120
And I'm not quite sure how to do the order here.

08:55.130 --> 09:01.270
What I might do is use those as guides for doing the rest because I'm pretty sure a go over the top

09:01.270 --> 09:03.610
of the image that I want here.

09:03.610 --> 09:08.340
So with the support copy I'm just going to go in here and add in.

09:09.240 --> 09:16.050
The areas that I could have probably done this now without having done any selection at all since it's

09:16.050 --> 09:20.060
relatively precise and I quite like that.

09:20.100 --> 09:24.300
Although at this point I feel like this sensual rivets should also be slightly larger.

09:24.540 --> 09:27.040
So go ahead with this rivets.

09:27.060 --> 09:30.590
Can I use a V fuzzy selectorial to get hold of that.

09:30.690 --> 09:36.390
Almost it's not quite selecting everything out however because it's on a layer by itself.

09:36.390 --> 09:43.680
I can go to the tool options and with sample merge turned off but select transparent 8 areas turned

09:43.770 --> 09:44.520
on.

09:44.520 --> 09:51.120
I can select everything that's in the background in verte that's using control and I now I can grow

09:51.120 --> 09:53.270
that selection once more.

09:55.150 --> 09:59.180
I one pick so tensity I'm not quite sure whether that's going to work.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.850
I'm going to give it a go.

10:01.090 --> 10:03.250
Let's go ahead and fill in.

10:03.390 --> 10:05.880
Using another pattern.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.110
Let's use the ground again.

10:08.110 --> 10:12.020
I think I used the dried mud last time and fill hole selection.

10:12.990 --> 10:13.870
Okay.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.540
Let's try gradient fill instead.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.420
And actually that's true of the black to white.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.830
Again this is just emphasizing here.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.950
Experiments on one try a radial coming out from here to here.

10:27.450 --> 10:29.290
And let's go the other way.

10:29.370 --> 10:32.030
So let's flip the colours the foreground and background.

10:33.350 --> 10:34.680
Should try that again.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.920
I need it brighter than that.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.280
Let's go for golden.

10:38.310 --> 10:41.070
Of course this is something you can play about to your heart's content.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.750
Ah that's much much better.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.280
I'm liking that already.

10:44.520 --> 10:44.880
Excellent.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.550
I'll leave that like that for the moment.

10:46.590 --> 10:53.460
So the final thing just to make this stand out just a little is to have some sort of perhaps shadow

10:53.460 --> 10:59.730
behind and what I can do here is I can find the shield outline and duplicate that and called it a shield

10:59.730 --> 11:00.580
shadow.

11:02.270 --> 11:07.580
And then once that's done I can go ahead and going to select everything for the moment and grab the

11:07.580 --> 11:08.780
move tool.

11:08.930 --> 11:14.240
This is a great example of how we can use them move tool to our effect shawk a key m of course with

11:14.240 --> 11:15.170
the move to all.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.590
I'm going to make sure is only selected on the active layer.

11:18.590 --> 11:23.720
It's very easy otherwise just to move something you didn't intend to come and move the active layer

11:23.960 --> 11:27.060
and just going to shift it down a little to about here.

11:28.180 --> 11:33.760
And then I'm going to just turn the pastie of that layer down and as I turn it down it will look more

11:33.760 --> 11:35.430
and more like a shadow.

11:35.710 --> 11:37.180
I'm happy with that.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.830
Apart from the shadow is now going over the top of the border.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.590
Now if you wanted to go for that effect sure.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.350
But at the same time I'd say perhaps make the shield pop out the top at the same time.

11:48.430 --> 11:49.970
I don't want that in this case.

11:49.990 --> 11:53.650
I want the shield itself to be inside a frame.

11:53.800 --> 11:58.790
So in that case I'm going to have to go down to my border and move it up a couple.

11:59.230 --> 12:04.060
So then it's sitting on top of that shadow rather than underneath it.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.400
Otherwise I'm quite happy with this and how it's turned out.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.630
How did you guys get on.

12:09.650 --> 12:15.010
Please show your work as always over in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
