00:04.280 --> 00:12.000
Both straight ahead and pose to pose are two ways of animating and both have the benefits and drawbacks.

00:12.050 --> 00:18.420
So to take an example that we've already seen in action where we've got let's say a shelf that some

00:18.440 --> 00:24.860
of it's going to fall off and maybe a ball and it will bounce and land on our our box here are just

00:24.860 --> 00:26.380
me in a box a little taller.

00:26.630 --> 00:28.030
So these are solid objects.

00:28.040 --> 00:37.080
The shelf etc. Now with Straight ahead it is very good for unpredictable things like flames smoke water.

00:37.430 --> 00:44.850
It works really well because it relies on the previous position to evolve our animation.

00:44.930 --> 00:51.950
Now in some cases if let's say the ball was going to drop on to the ground and then as it drops on to

00:51.950 --> 00:56.510
the ground it just goes into a million pieces.

00:56.570 --> 01:03.530
We won't necessarily know where those pieces go so it can be difficult to make them with pose to pose

01:03.530 --> 01:05.550
which we'll see in a few moments.

01:06.050 --> 01:10.590
Now you can mix the two with pose to pose And straight ahead.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.670
So this isn't an oar.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.390
It's not one or the other.

01:14.390 --> 01:21.200
You use whichever one best suits the situation you're currently involved in and you can certainly if

01:21.200 --> 01:28.180
this ball had more than one part do some of it with post to pose and some of it was straight to head.

01:28.190 --> 01:30.050
So what is straight ahead.

01:30.050 --> 01:36.470
Well straight ahead is where if we were following this path down we would draw each consecutive frame

01:36.500 --> 01:44.240
how we thought it should look as it falls onto the ground splats and comes back up again and we hit

01:44.240 --> 01:45.090
the wall.

01:45.530 --> 01:51.140
So this is an example where we can you straight ahead and when you're experienced you could probably

01:51.140 --> 01:53.480
get away with doing it this way.

01:53.480 --> 01:59.480
But what you can end up with is things wibberley wobbling their way down instead of falling in a nice

01:59.540 --> 01:59.950
arc.

01:59.950 --> 02:06.470
In this case or indeed hitting objects that they shouldn't have in the first place and that can ruin

02:06.740 --> 02:09.240
the sense of the animation.

02:09.270 --> 02:15.170
Now if I just undo some of those frames there with pose to pose it works slightly differently.

02:15.170 --> 02:20.390
And in fact I'm going to use some colours for this post to pose works by.

02:20.420 --> 02:26.140
First of all deciding where you going to start and then where you're going to end.

02:26.150 --> 02:28.410
These are called your keys.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.160
These are your key frames.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.070
Now arguably there's one down the bottom here as well.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.810
I'm going to leave that for the next one.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.750
The next ones are called extremes.

02:39.830 --> 02:40.610
Okay.

02:40.610 --> 02:43.380
Now these are the extreme positions.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.430
Your work is going to be in.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.600
Thank you windows for opening that up.

02:47.750 --> 02:53.630
So in this case there's going to be an extreme on its way down as it elongates have we using squash

02:53.630 --> 02:54.790
and stretch.

02:54.860 --> 03:00.260
There's going to be an extreme and a key kind of both down at the bottom here because that's at the

03:00.260 --> 03:06.650
lowest point and then we need to make sure that it comes back up and over again so we can draw all that

03:06.650 --> 03:08.180
in here as it goes round.

03:08.180 --> 03:14.100
So those are the extremes that would go in to actually go through the next one.

03:14.120 --> 03:18.830
And I don't never going to have enough space to scribble this is called a breakdown.

03:18.980 --> 03:26.000
Now break downs just go in between these particular frames and they allow us a bit more freedom.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.020
Now you probably noticed here we are really doing a pose.

03:30.020 --> 03:36.830
So we've got post a pose we've got the two red ones then in between those two red ones we've added three

03:36.830 --> 03:41.490
green ones now in between the green ones we can add some blue ones.

03:41.510 --> 03:48.500
So we're really doing pose to pose with in pose to pose and then of course afterwards you could go in

03:48.770 --> 03:56.090
and fill in the bits in between as you so wish now are not being accurate with these drawings but you

03:56.090 --> 03:58.440
can add these bits in-between now.

03:58.790 --> 04:03.440
There's obvious points here as I'm sketching and I'll just highlight them.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.940
We've got this ball here it's dramatically small I've not maintained volume.

04:07.940 --> 04:12.490
Hopefully I've got the point across that you can have these bits in-between.

04:12.530 --> 04:18.850
So we have our keys our extremes our break down and then the final one is in between.

04:18.860 --> 04:26.330
So it's like Po ception you're putting more poses within those poses to make the animations smoother.

04:26.330 --> 04:30.920
Now the great thing about this is we have the most control we know exactly where we're going to start

04:31.280 --> 04:34.940
and exactly where we're going to end which is incredibly useful.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.460
We know the whole action early on.

04:37.460 --> 04:45.380
So by the time we had reached the point where we had these bits of information we know that the animation

04:45.380 --> 04:51.320
could work and therefore it's a very lean way of working you not going ahead drawing in all the individual

04:51.320 --> 04:55.720
ones and you can imagine if it was something a bit more complicated than a ball you know.

04:55.850 --> 05:01.970
If we ended up here and hitting that wall how big a really rubbish animation you'd have to redo all

05:01.970 --> 05:02.970
of that work.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.390
Order to sort it out.

05:05.410 --> 05:06.760
And that can be a real pain.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.140
We really want the best workflow.

05:09.220 --> 05:12.860
That means we can get something out in a very quick manner.

05:13.300 --> 05:18.150
It helps keep the consistent movement throughout as we go through.

05:18.730 --> 05:25.670
And most importantly And I'll reiterate again it helps catch any problems early on.

05:26.790 --> 05:33.090
Now one final example that we could do here and we'll cover this much in much more detail later on is

05:33.090 --> 05:38.970
we've we can make the ball dropping and coming back up again using pose to pose now.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.730
If the ball had something else attached to it perhaps it was a ball and chain for instance and just

05:44.730 --> 05:47.550
trying to think of a colour here that will be suitable.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.800
I'll get rid of that line so we can actually draw on it.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.760
I'll just draw in black.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.510
That's absolutely fine.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.190
Now let's go blue and go blue.

05:53.430 --> 05:53.680
Okay.

05:53.700 --> 06:00.240
So as it's falling down we can actually have let's say a trail down there and we're animating this one

06:00.240 --> 06:08.750
kind of straight ahead because its previous position is reliant on where it was before.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.600
We can't necessarily predict where this blue thing is going to be.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.540
In fact in many cases this is two little frames to do the straight ahead but we can't really predict

06:18.570 --> 06:22.380
where this is going to be as it moves forward.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.060
We really need to do each frame in between.

06:25.350 --> 06:32.250
And then we start to get an idea as we're going where that particular string attached to our ball is

06:32.250 --> 06:33.530
going to be.

06:33.540 --> 06:40.050
Now this is a challenge of course when you've got so few frames so we definitely need our keys our extremes

06:40.110 --> 06:46.990
and our break down before we can start doing straight ahead part within our animation.

06:47.020 --> 06:49.380
Now of course it's time for a challenge.

06:49.410 --> 06:54.000
I'd like you to go ahead and write down the primary method that you would use for the following.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.690
Now of course I say the primary method because you could use both methods.

06:57.690 --> 07:04.250
So pick between post to pose or straight ahead how would you go ahead doing fire.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.070
How about a bouncing ball.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.320
Jumping a water splash.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.920
A door opening.

07:12.940 --> 07:17.370
And finally a frown to a grin on her face.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.670
And I'd like you to go ahead.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.830
Pause a video now and give that a go.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.370
Hello everyone and welcome back.

07:24.370 --> 07:28.630
Let's go through the primary methods that I would use for the following.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.970
So fire I would use straight ahead.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.040
It's an evolving thing.

07:33.040 --> 07:38.110
A You don't really know how it's going to end up and it can be very difficult trying to go from one

07:38.290 --> 07:43.990
post to another with in between is trying to get their fire is a naturally progressive thing it's a

07:43.990 --> 07:45.310
physical entity.

07:45.310 --> 07:51.760
I would recommend going straight to head our bouncing ball as we've demonstrated an example that is

07:51.760 --> 07:54.600
going to be best done with a pose to pose.

07:54.670 --> 07:58.300
Now there will be some instances where straight ahead may be more appropriate.

07:58.450 --> 08:00.080
But in general I would pick.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.430
Post Post jumping.

08:01.450 --> 08:07.120
I would also pick post to post because you need to know where the character is jumping from to where

08:07.120 --> 08:09.070
they're jumping to.

08:09.160 --> 08:14.890
And this is not only if you're doing them actually moving or if you're doing a static jump animation.

08:14.890 --> 08:21.280
It's good to know the stages that they'll be going through and then filling in in between a water splash.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.800
Well that is going to be straight ahead for me.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.710
A door opening.

08:24.720 --> 08:31.060
Now I would do this pose to pose as well as a definite sequence of a door opening you know exactly where

08:31.060 --> 08:35.170
it's going to be when it's open and where it shuts and I found to grin.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.270
Now this is kind of an organic one.

08:37.270 --> 08:44.680
Suppose the pose would allow you to have where the frown starts where the grin will end up being and

08:44.680 --> 08:46.510
then you can fill in in between.

08:46.510 --> 08:48.820
Again you can mix and match when you.

08:48.850 --> 08:53.580
I would certainly do pose to pose and then post those within that some transition.

08:53.680 --> 08:58.750
And then if I needed a bit of nuance with the grin or the frown then certainly a bit of straight ahead

08:58.750 --> 09:01.000
in that may help as well.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.520
Now if you've got answers different to this I would love to hear your comments as to why you picked

09:06.520 --> 09:09.350
something different over the discussions.

09:09.370 --> 09:15.410
Now there is not a right and wrong these are just my recommendations from my experience.

09:15.430 --> 09:20.290
You may decide when your doing an animation that that particular instance will be different and that's

09:20.290 --> 09:23.510
it for this lecture and I will see you in the next one.
