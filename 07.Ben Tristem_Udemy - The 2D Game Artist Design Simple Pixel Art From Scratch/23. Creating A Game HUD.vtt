00:04.320 --> 00:09.690
Hey everyone so we've reached the point where we're going to give you a very big challenge and that's

00:09.690 --> 00:14.730
to combine everything that you know so far in the form of an end of section challenge.

00:14.730 --> 00:21.530
So go ahead and open up the bottom hard from your resources attached to this particular lecture.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.160
Pick your abilities from the ability.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.610
Inspiration table.

00:25.620 --> 00:33.300
I will show you that in a few moments assemble your heads up display all your hard and obviously we

00:33.300 --> 00:36.180
want you to share it with us as well.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.380
Now there are a couple of things that are optional in this challenge.

00:39.540 --> 00:47.940
You can go ahead and edit out hard or make your own hard as well if you're feeling up to it or you can

00:47.940 --> 00:52.890
go ahead and invent your own abilities if you've got an idea or you've already created a game like on

00:52.890 --> 00:56.020
that you want to include no problems doing that.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.740
And when you go ahead and share it make sure you don't tell us exactly what's going on there.

01:01.740 --> 01:07.290
Be good to see where the people know what that button does by just looking at it or at least have a

01:07.290 --> 01:09.240
good idea about it.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.910
This is the sort of end goal that we're going for.

01:12.910 --> 01:19.020
Here we've got the hard and underneath are a day my condes that we've brought in now you'd only dare

01:19.170 --> 01:26.550
expand your game icons at all they will fit in at 32 by 32 in this particular hard then moving on to

01:26.550 --> 01:27.540
the ability.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.980
Inspiration list here is a list a short list.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.630
And I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more.

01:34.770 --> 01:40.610
But this is a list that you can pick from in order to create your own game icons.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.340
So go ahead pause every year now and create your own bottom hard.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.740
Okay guys welcome back.

01:49.740 --> 01:50.570
Let's go ahead.

01:50.580 --> 01:55.900
I'm going to combine some of these here in order to create my bottom hard.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.760
Okay so we're back over into guimpe here and leave first the unknowns ahead.

02:01.850 --> 02:08.950
Go ahead and do is just go and open up my hard arse that we've got here.

02:08.960 --> 02:09.490
That's fine.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.630
I'm going to lever as my base item.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.930
And I'm going to bring everything else into it.

02:15.930 --> 02:21.960
Now you see in the PAC itself we've got a black or green or better red or I'm going to go ahead and

02:21.960 --> 02:25.060
grab my green orb and my black orb.

02:26.160 --> 02:26.780
Let's go ahead.

02:26.860 --> 02:28.300
Oh not black red.

02:28.320 --> 02:28.970
There you go.

02:29.220 --> 02:36.100
So these I can simply click move over the top of my hard and drop them in.

02:36.270 --> 02:39.390
And then of course I can move them in a few moments.

02:39.960 --> 02:46.140
Grab the move to move the red one to one side and move the green one to another.

02:46.140 --> 02:48.030
Looking good so far.

02:48.030 --> 02:51.420
Now of course this doesn't have to be precise if you don't want it to be.

02:51.420 --> 02:56.530
But what is important is that it's behind the hard rather than on top of.

02:56.820 --> 03:04.590
And that looks much better you can see here how the HUD uses an alpha layer some transparency and highlights

03:04.890 --> 03:09.310
to bring out this three dimensional effect.

03:09.330 --> 03:11.050
And that's what's going on there.

03:11.100 --> 03:17.360
Now we have a series of squares that of course would be great for a special ability.

03:17.580 --> 03:25.410
Okay so in this first square in the left I do once myself a sword I think I'm going to put my sword

03:25.440 --> 03:28.610
there some going to go ahead and open up a sword.

03:28.620 --> 03:35.100
Now if my memory serves me correctly it was in the film challenge that I made my original sword.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.810
Yes with the alferd out background and also the shield and going open the sordin Shield at the same

03:39.810 --> 03:40.350
time.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.720
Go ahead open.

03:41.790 --> 03:46.290
And again I'm going to click and drag vose across and providing they are the right size which they are

03:46.290 --> 03:48.830
perfect 32 why suit.

03:48.960 --> 03:56.130
I'll be able to drag and drop them in and then of course I can move my sword and move my shield to the

03:56.130 --> 03:57.290
appropriate location.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.200
All of that swords actually gone bang in the right location.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.020
I will be impressed.

04:01.020 --> 04:05.190
I wasn't really looking and then zoom in and ashlar zooming in.

04:05.190 --> 04:11.640
I'm using my trackpad at the moment would pinch and zooms as not to be overly accurate but does a job

04:11.640 --> 04:11.940
there.

04:11.940 --> 04:17.700
Course you can use the conge a scroll wheel with the control key as well to zoom in just to remind you

04:17.700 --> 04:18.290
of that.

04:18.420 --> 04:25.290
And it does zoom in wherever your cursor is an icon then just did just that so it fits in the square

04:25.380 --> 04:26.940
nice and neatly.

04:26.940 --> 04:32.430
Now of course with the transparency there we get to see the hard in the background which is very very

04:32.430 --> 04:33.420
useful in that course.

04:33.410 --> 04:37.540
Now I can zoom back out and have a look at how it's looking.

04:37.590 --> 04:43.980
And remember control shift in J will just fill the available workspace with the image itself.

04:44.010 --> 04:49.860
So off to a great start here and I'm going to go ahead now and fill in my other ones as well as create

04:49.920 --> 04:52.430
a couple of new ones as well.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.700
Okay so welcome back and I'm almost there.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.540
I'm going to leave one slot free to demonstrate what's behind.

05:00.720 --> 05:06.630
However what I have noticed is there on a couple of the things that I'm working on at the moment.

05:06.710 --> 05:08.570
They're just a solid black background.

05:08.570 --> 05:14.490
I've forgotten to move across the transparency so I'm going to go back to my source image up here and

05:14.490 --> 05:17.870
remove the backgrounds that I have placed before.

05:17.970 --> 05:23.220
Then what I should be able to do if I click on the right thing is move across an appropriate fireball

05:23.490 --> 05:25.600
and then move it in.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.690
And of course still a black background there.

05:27.690 --> 05:34.680
I'll need to remove that from there and then we should be able to see the background underneath as well

05:34.710 --> 05:41.460
so I can move out the way that down and then this one wherever it happens to be.

05:41.460 --> 05:45.480
We can go ahead and delete it and there we go is gone.

05:45.480 --> 05:50.140
The other thing of course I need to do to make sure I am aware of whatever thing is such as klayton

05:50.150 --> 05:51.420
DRAG to move them across.

05:51.540 --> 05:57.840
But they're not named appropriately so of course going ahead and naming them such that you know what

05:57.840 --> 06:00.780
they are later on is very useful.

06:00.780 --> 06:08.620
Now one of the things that I had in my collection was this sword is ever so slightly to this sword.

06:08.790 --> 06:14.280
Ever so slightly different to that sword there simply because it's not a border around it so looks slightly

06:14.280 --> 06:17.760
smaller but it also has a bit more detail in it.

06:17.760 --> 06:23.250
You can see there's a mixture of colours and shades going across areas the gradient there and I feel

06:23.250 --> 06:29.160
like VAT is actually more in keeping with everything else that's currently here a post of this sword

06:29.280 --> 06:35.760
that's there someone a move that one out the way and then grab this sword and place it at the beginning.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.350
Now of course I've clicked and dragged the move the wrong thing.

06:38.370 --> 06:43.980
Undo will save me there and if I just drag it across I can place it in the right location.

06:43.980 --> 06:44.770
There we go.

06:44.790 --> 06:47.070
So there's that coming together really nicely.

06:47.070 --> 06:50.370
I just need a few more things to finish off these bits here.

06:50.380 --> 06:56.170
I'll be able to sort out and then of course we're all done and I'll see you back in a few moments.

06:57.950 --> 07:02.170
Now just zooming in literally zooming into a health potion I've created here.

07:02.300 --> 07:06.300
I did bring a across with its background turned on so I'd turn that off.

07:06.410 --> 07:12.110
But also this one happened to have a border around it as well so I'm going to remove the border as well

07:12.410 --> 07:16.730
and then move things across and into here.

07:16.790 --> 07:22.430
Now of course this needs going in the right location and that will be near the top rather than near

07:22.430 --> 07:23.200
the bottom.

07:23.330 --> 07:25.800
And this one will need to disappear.

07:25.830 --> 07:30.530
And that's the health potion being replaced now so I don't have to type and just kind of copy the name

07:30.980 --> 07:32.120
then hit delete.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.230
Come up to the top.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.690
Place that name in and then just move it to the appropriate location on here.

07:37.700 --> 07:42.830
That's also better because it's now not overwriting this orb on the side.

07:42.830 --> 07:48.040
The final one is this obliterate that I've got here now.

07:48.050 --> 07:53.180
I don't know whether it's going to work without a bought well border probably absolutely fine but without

07:53.180 --> 07:57.620
that background because it's the background itself that really makes it stand out.

07:57.620 --> 07:58.610
So let's try that.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.010
This is a life demonstration.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.960
What could possibly go wrong.

08:02.030 --> 08:07.370
That might work over this dark area here so I'm going to make sure I've got my obliterate and will copy

08:07.370 --> 08:11.930
the name the deletes and then move this back over the top.

08:12.290 --> 08:18.840
Yeah that kind of personal got the orange tint it had before but it still works as an explosion.

08:19.050 --> 08:21.260
Yet that's looking pretty good.

08:21.290 --> 08:21.740
Excellent.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.590
How do you guys get on.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.680
I'd love to see your HUDs and how they're coming together.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.150
Do remember to share over in the discussions.

08:29.150 --> 08:34.820
Especially if you've gone ahead and created as you see some of the extra ones I've made a health potion

08:34.820 --> 08:36.580
here I suppose you could call that healing.

08:36.660 --> 08:41.450
But if you have done something that's different from what I can see in front of me now please do share

08:41.450 --> 08:41.860
it with us.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.010
Can't wait to see what you've been up to.

08:44.090 --> 08:47.770
And of course as always I will see you guys in their necks really.
