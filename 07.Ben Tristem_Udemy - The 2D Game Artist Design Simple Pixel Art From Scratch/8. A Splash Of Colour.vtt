00:04.160 --> 00:08.930
Now I just want to draw your attention back to the Wikipedia article we had a look at in the last lecture

00:08.930 --> 00:09.760
about the value.

00:09.770 --> 00:14.720
Same article applies to Hue and saturation.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.970
If we go ahead and hop over into guimpe we can see that we've got the greyscale images that I was working

00:19.970 --> 00:21.060
on before.

00:21.140 --> 00:27.980
Now let's have a look at the colour area that I have made before and one of the best ones for having

00:27.980 --> 00:30.030
a look at Hugh saturation in value.

00:30.110 --> 00:36.410
Obviously the sliders are quite nice but I like this circle wheel here because it really hammers it

00:36.410 --> 00:38.470
home as to what is going on.

00:38.780 --> 00:43.120
So Hugh is just another just another word for colour.

00:43.220 --> 00:47.560
So hue is round the outside of this circle.

00:48.650 --> 00:55.610
Now value that's the up and down bit the white towards black and the saturation.

00:55.820 --> 01:04.020
Well if you probably guessed it already but saturation is how much of that colour there actually is.

01:04.460 --> 01:10.820
And that can be controlled by here so we can go from white all the way through to bright red.

01:10.970 --> 01:15.450
And another way of looking at this is with these slides so let's have a look at that at the moment.

01:15.500 --> 01:21.860
So the hue is what what tone what colour it actually is whether it's red orange yellow green blue indigo

01:21.950 --> 01:22.820
pink.

01:22.820 --> 01:28.060
And back to red against cycles all the way back round and starts again saturation.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.370
How much of it there is.

01:30.380 --> 01:36.110
So if you want something that's pink in colour you're going to have to have a red hue but not so not

01:36.110 --> 01:37.230
a lot of red.

01:37.460 --> 01:43.480
And then if you want a dark darker colour you can adjust the value and make something darker.

01:43.550 --> 01:49.320
And as you can see there you've got now thousands and thousands of colours.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.020
You could make from that.

01:51.610 --> 01:55.470
So one of the big questions of course is how do I go about picking a colour.

01:55.690 --> 01:59.580
Well some things are going to be relatively straightforward if you're emulating a tree.

01:59.590 --> 02:04.540
The trunk would probably be a brown and the leaves would probably be green.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.050
So it's nice and straightforward but if you're bit want to be a bit more artistic with it and especially

02:09.050 --> 02:12.080
at 8 by eight you might have to be a bit more liberal with it.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.400
It is often best to use what's known as colour theory.

02:15.400 --> 02:20.370
And there's once again another excellent article on Wikipedia about colour theory.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.700
I bring that across here.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.210
This is also included in a description.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.270
And it's linked in the resources as well.

02:28.390 --> 02:32.420
And this gives us an idea of how colours can be mixed together.

02:32.530 --> 02:37.540
What ones go well with one another what ones do not and we'll get into this in much more detail later

02:37.540 --> 02:37.900
on.

02:37.900 --> 02:44.340
If you want to get a little ahead do read about colour theory gives you an idea of how to use colour.

02:44.350 --> 02:49.440
For the moment we're just going to use it liberally and just make something that looks nice.

02:49.450 --> 02:55.250
So back over in guimpe we've we've discovered a couple of ways of selecting colour.

02:55.270 --> 03:00.030
We've now been unleashed before you only had black and white this scale here.

03:00.310 --> 03:05.830
Now we've got hue and saturation as well so we've got the whole gamut to pick from.

03:06.100 --> 03:11.290
Now before I go off and just tell you guys I've got another challenge and I want you to make something

03:11.350 --> 03:12.340
with colour.

03:12.340 --> 03:18.330
I just want to go through a technique when it comes to colouring in there can be very very useful.

03:18.340 --> 03:23.800
So let's go ahead now and create a new image and I'm going to try and emulate a pineapple.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.510
Now I'd like to call this sort of made everything bright green didn't mean to do that.

03:28.540 --> 03:34.800
I can very quickly just clear everything down as I go round foreground Alawite.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.080
Okay so I'm I'm going to make a pineapple.

03:37.090 --> 03:42.280
Now I want to call the technique dithering but it's not cool dithering it's not even like dithering

03:42.610 --> 03:44.590
but it's where you start laying down.

03:44.590 --> 03:48.060
I need a different colour there we get.

03:48.190 --> 03:50.050
So this is going to be a pineapple.

03:50.120 --> 03:58.560
Got to make it look somewhat like a pineapple or at least try to almost make my background colour white

03:58.660 --> 04:00.390
so I can use it.

04:00.850 --> 04:06.790
So we can make a pineapple here and we're going to use a technique where we alternate between certain

04:06.790 --> 04:07.630
colours.

04:07.630 --> 04:13.960
Now of course you could just stick with a colour like that and you may look at that and go colours like

04:13.960 --> 04:15.660
a chicken drumstick.

04:15.910 --> 04:20.500
But I don't really see the detail so we can start adding variations.

04:20.500 --> 04:25.690
Now usually you want to be quite close to the colour you've currently got so you want maybe a darker

04:25.690 --> 04:32.850
area on one side and a slightly lighter on this one perhaps but we mix and match the colours.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.350
We can end up and I'm going to use the colour picker here.

04:35.500 --> 04:42.450
We can end up with quite a nice array of well in this case leaves on our pineapple.

04:42.460 --> 04:50.050
Now to get across the look of a pineapple It is kind of chequered if you have a look at a pineapple.

04:50.050 --> 04:54.330
So what we can go ahead and do is make it slightly lighter on one side.

04:55.390 --> 04:59.410
I'm just going to literally put a check a pattern there and see what it looks like.

05:00.250 --> 05:00.830
Okay.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.700
Actually that looks pretty good.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.560
So we've got this chequered pattern here.

05:04.560 --> 05:11.280
Now we can go one step further of course and perhaps make one side ever so slightly darker as we go

05:11.280 --> 05:17.430
across and end slightly shade Ettin and that may or may not have the desired effect.

05:17.460 --> 05:25.050
So do be careful as you go through and add spurious colour you may find that actually going back to

05:25.050 --> 05:32.310
more of a flat shaded So it's not changing value across the surface might be better.

05:32.310 --> 05:36.860
The other thing that we can focus on now we've got colour is more of the background as well.

05:36.990 --> 05:43.160
So one of the techniques that you could do is let's say Blue Blue seems I think it's going to work here.

05:43.440 --> 05:51.240
But for instance I can build up a blue background here slowly coming up in shade as we go.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.200
Now notice are not just changing the value of this.

05:55.350 --> 06:03.000
I'm also changing the hue ever so slightly as I come up so that we get has a slightly better gradient

06:03.000 --> 06:06.550
than just looking like a lighter version of the same blue.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.000
Now I'm not sure if that's going to work.

06:08.010 --> 06:10.290
Having a look at the pineapple.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.660
Well is it a pineapple floating on the sea.

06:12.660 --> 06:13.620
Who knows.

06:13.650 --> 06:17.220
And indeed I could put maybe a beach at the bottom that might work.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.680
There's lots of things you can do.

06:18.680 --> 06:23.990
That's the exciting thing because we've crammed into this eight by eight space.

06:24.060 --> 06:29.340
It really starts to get as I've said before the creative juices flowing and makes you really think about

06:29.670 --> 06:35.880
the importance of placing that one individual pixel because there's not a lot of space to place them.

06:35.940 --> 06:38.060
Okay I hope you found that useful.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.080
And it's time for me to stop playing with colour and you start playing with colour in the form of a

06:43.080 --> 06:44.160
challenge.

06:44.550 --> 06:50.160
Okay so in this challenge I'd like you to create four more eight by eight images and we're going to

06:50.160 --> 06:51.210
use colour this time.

06:51.210 --> 06:55.340
So you've got full freedom of the entire colour space.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.570
Try flat shading.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.990
And the dithering type effect.

06:59.040 --> 07:05.170
See how you get on and try describing using these four images.

07:05.190 --> 07:11.570
An astronaut goes into space in a rocket pulls a video now and give that a go.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.260
Okay guys welcome back.

07:15.390 --> 07:22.050
Let's go ahead and see if we can destruct describe an astronaut going into space in a rocket.

07:22.410 --> 07:28.800
Okay so let's start off by creating the rocket because there's something here that I want to go through

07:28.800 --> 07:30.940
with you whilst I've got the opportunity.

07:31.200 --> 07:38.700
I'm going to set that back to its default and I'm going to go through the process here of actually creating

07:39.090 --> 07:45.440
the rocket from a black and white image through greyscale and to a rocket itself.

07:45.660 --> 07:49.380
And we can see the differences and the problems as we go.

07:49.410 --> 07:54.320
Now this is going to be a very simplistic rocket to begin with phase.

07:54.330 --> 07:58.870
Very difficult it's going to be a diagonal rocket as you can probably guess by now.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.610
They need to work with the space I have.

08:01.610 --> 08:08.710
Maybe they're in there and perhaps even getting rid of this middle lots along here.

08:08.790 --> 08:12.060
So maybe something along those lines looks kind of like a rocket.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.200
But it also kind of looks like a sword as well.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.660
How can we help with shading.

08:17.700 --> 08:22.420
Well rockets can sometimes have that sort of hashing effect on them.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.850
But we don't want to end up with something else like a stripy sword.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.200
We can use this negative space.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.520
We can actually add Grey into this background.

08:31.890 --> 08:36.850
And now instead of just being an outline we can actually have it dark on one side.

08:38.680 --> 08:44.930
And as we crossover we can have it getting lighter and lighter down the other side.

08:45.010 --> 08:48.510
In fact because I've now put on here.

08:48.670 --> 08:54.100
Let's use the colour picker and back to the pencil using own n.

08:54.110 --> 08:54.960
There we go.

08:55.510 --> 09:02.590
We can actually add white on to here as a highlight and that becomes part of the rocket itself and maybe

09:02.590 --> 09:03.460
a bit down the middle.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.500
And again it can be a bit confusing as to if it's a rocket or not.

09:07.510 --> 09:13.030
Now one of the ways we can get around this of course is by adding colour out to the back of the rocket

09:13.330 --> 09:15.220
will come.

09:15.430 --> 09:22.210
These are allergic to rockets that are really out of the back of the rocket would of course come some

09:22.210 --> 09:23.890
fire some flame.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.560
So we can actually add that in that's not very bright.

09:26.560 --> 09:33.670
Let's turn the saturation and the value up as much as we can so we can get some different cause I'm

09:33.670 --> 09:37.860
going to go right the way over to yellow here and put that in the red and yellow.

09:38.020 --> 09:41.430
And now it starts to look more and more like a rocket.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.260
Now I'm going to continue doing this perhaps in fact here.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.110
I'm stepping to one side.

09:46.120 --> 09:51.850
Perhaps I can make this bit darker to show that it's darker on one side and maybe slightly lighter on

09:51.850 --> 09:52.380
the other.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.090
Erica.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.930
So that's just one example of many.

09:55.930 --> 10:02.100
And of course it is time for me to go off and do a few more drawings now see back in a few moments.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.470
Hey so welcome back.

10:04.470 --> 10:09.240
I've improved my rocket just a little took some of the dark areas and thought well if it's going into

10:09.240 --> 10:12.620
space I'll just make space black in the background.

10:12.630 --> 10:15.150
And that really helps bring out the rockets.

10:15.150 --> 10:20.250
And I really like that rock that works out really well and I've made a little space man.

10:20.250 --> 10:25.080
He took a lot of tweaking to try and get right if I got it completely wrong.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.390
Originally I ended up what looked more like a motorbike than an astronaut.

10:30.390 --> 10:36.150
So again I went online and looked at the nassa website and lo and behold I had drawn a space helmet

10:36.150 --> 10:36.800
completely wrong.

10:36.810 --> 10:40.240
And this is the closest I could represent a particular spacesuit.

10:40.320 --> 10:46.330
And I'd like to draw your attention to the very subtle banding of colour across the face and the helmet

10:46.330 --> 10:48.160
it's not that much of a change.

10:48.270 --> 10:53.910
There is a sharp change on the top of the helmet here that perhaps would work better if it was more

10:53.910 --> 10:54.370
gradual.

10:54.390 --> 10:58.530
I don't know but I really like the way that this is turned out.

10:58.530 --> 11:01.130
That's the guy in the space suit the astronaut.

11:01.380 --> 11:05.620
And then I've got a Moon Now I'm not too sure about this one.

11:05.640 --> 11:10.240
I think we can probably have it not such a sharp change.

11:10.260 --> 11:15.050
In fact whilst I'm here and talking to you guys I can critique my own work.

11:15.180 --> 11:23.450
So perhaps if it was a little less or a little more abrupt actually in each change.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.760
Let's undo some of that.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.040
Use the colour picture.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.220
Maybe this lighter colour here.

11:29.300 --> 11:35.220
Now what tends to happen I think of overexaggerated the shadow itself.

11:35.450 --> 11:40.460
If you have a look at a picture of a planet or anything along those lines the Terminator line the bit

11:40.460 --> 11:46.420
between light and dark happens rather quickly actually doesn't happen as slowly as I had there.

11:46.940 --> 11:51.320
I like that version of my Moon better now moons have craters.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.230
So why don't I go and stick a kraatz or two in it as well.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.290
There we go.

11:57.290 --> 12:00.530
Does that work on this level yet that looks.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.180
That looks okay to me in the small one.

12:04.220 --> 12:07.160
I'm not sure we could play around with that for hours and hours.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.700
Our lives just the two spots in there at the moment.

12:09.740 --> 12:13.190
And finally he looks back and sees the earth.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.870
This was a really interesting one.

12:14.870 --> 12:22.170
So I've got a gradient defeated blue going across to have a light a lighter side and a darker side.

12:22.190 --> 12:26.690
It's still fully illuminated there's no Terminator line on this one.

12:26.690 --> 12:28.130
And we've got darker colours.

12:28.130 --> 12:30.200
We've got the deserts of Africa.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.220
I should have asked that.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.350
Which side of the planet do you think it is.

12:34.350 --> 12:41.120
Look North America here in South America we've got the South Pole Africa and then we got Europe and

12:41.120 --> 12:42.550
then we've got England.

12:42.590 --> 12:46.190
England takes up a huge proportion of this particular map.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.500
Now we've got the receding North Pole at the top.

12:48.500 --> 12:55.290
Sorry Asia you're not on this and noras Australasia OCR me or whatever it's called these days.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.730
That place down under.

12:56.930 --> 13:01.550
Sorry guys you didn't feature on this one but if you're from that area perhaps you have drawn your globe

13:01.550 --> 13:04.080
differently if indeed you've done a globe.

13:04.130 --> 13:05.390
Please share your work.

13:05.390 --> 13:10.200
I'm just about to go do that myself and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
