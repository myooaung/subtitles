00:04.150 --> 00:09.880
Hello and then this lecture your going to be learning all about layers and alfer so you'll be able to

00:09.940 --> 00:12.270
like this simple drawing of a house here.

00:12.340 --> 00:18.010
You'll be able to switch things in and out and change the house to your heart's desire based upon some

00:18.070 --> 00:20.470
other layers that you've made.

00:21.530 --> 00:25.420
Welcome to an introduction to layers and how far.

00:25.490 --> 00:32.710
Now before we get to the Alpha let's focus on layers and how they enable a non-destructive work flow.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.800
First of all we need to explain what a non-destructive workflow is and for that we sure use an example.

00:37.970 --> 00:45.050
Let's go ahead and I am just going to create a new file and I'm going to set it to 32 by 32 because

00:45.050 --> 00:50.930
that's what we are going to be working with this particular section Ungerman zoomlion with control shift

00:50.930 --> 00:51.720
in J.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.680
And I'm going to o.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.240
I've got a brush selected that's not the pencil.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.050
Never mind.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.720
I can still demonstrate this point.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.870
I'm going to switch to the pencil now.

01:00.940 --> 01:09.740
Now if I want to edit how that looks at the moment I'm going to have to basically destroy what's there

01:09.800 --> 01:10.550
overwrite.

01:10.580 --> 01:18.170
So if I wanted to let's put that back down to size one if I wanted to put these spots on I've actually

01:18.170 --> 01:19.720
changed that image.

01:19.940 --> 01:23.550
However what I can do is create a new layer.

01:23.930 --> 01:27.140
And on that layer put the six white dots.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.200
But that background image remains exactly the same.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.140
It remains intact.

01:32.240 --> 01:38.500
So if I change my mind later it's no problem at all to just remove those spots again.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.880
And now in order to do that we're going to have to create our first layer.

01:43.160 --> 01:48.740
Now as you can imagine with a program like guimpe there are several ways to create a new layer.

01:49.050 --> 01:51.110
Will do the menu option first.

01:51.110 --> 01:57.770
So along the top on your file menu there is one called layer and on that there's the option for new

01:57.770 --> 02:01.800
layer new from visible new leg group et cetera et cetera.

02:01.910 --> 02:05.150
We're just going to focus on the new layer option.

02:05.150 --> 02:11.870
Now if you've got a layers tab open you can also use that so we can see on the right hand side here

02:11.900 --> 02:15.230
I do have a layer's tab open.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.400
It's one that looks like a stack of papers.

02:18.420 --> 02:23.600
Now if we glanced down we can see that there is an icon at the bottom.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.250
This would be a list of layers.

02:25.250 --> 02:30.910
This empty white space here if we had more than one and there is a little piece of paper with the corner

02:30.920 --> 02:37.250
folded over and that button will also create a new layer or of course if you're a keyboard shortcut

02:37.250 --> 02:41.980
warrior we can use the keyboard shortcut control shift and end.

02:42.260 --> 02:47.090
Now for the moment I feel like clicking on this icon they will all do the same thing they will create

02:47.180 --> 02:53.780
a new layer and we can call this net layer something I can call it white spots because that is essentially

02:53.780 --> 02:55.370
what Im going to do.

02:55.430 --> 03:01.700
Now we have an option here of making the layer bigger or smaller than the canvas that we're working

03:01.700 --> 03:03.010
on for the moment.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.790
Im gonna leave it is 32 by 32.

03:06.260 --> 03:12.080
And here we have our first taste of Alpha with the laser filled type.

03:12.230 --> 03:15.290
We have the foreground colour which will fill it in white.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.350
We have the background colour which will fill it in black in this case.

03:19.460 --> 03:24.650
We have just a white in this which would be the same as the foreground colour.

03:24.710 --> 03:30.560
And then finally we have transparency and this will be your first taste of Alpha.

03:30.740 --> 03:40.040
If we go ahead and click okay with transparency selected what it has done is laid a clear layer on top

03:40.100 --> 03:42.050
of this black Splodge.

03:42.050 --> 03:51.080
Now if I go to my background and colour in those black dots again now you can see this is a great example

03:51.140 --> 03:53.680
of destructive workflow is going on.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.180
Those are still standing out.

03:55.180 --> 04:00.000
Thats fine I know where to put them at least when I go back to or are white spots layer.

04:00.140 --> 04:07.460
So it is important to realize that whatever layer youre on is where the tool is going to affect.

04:07.460 --> 04:11.900
So I've clicked back onto the background layer before I've coloured those in.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.230
Then I'm going to go to the white spots layer.

04:14.300 --> 04:21.200
It will highlight blue as you can see here and I'm going to change my foreground colour back to white

04:21.580 --> 04:23.710
and I'm going to colour in those spots again.

04:23.750 --> 04:27.870
So one two three four five six.

04:28.190 --> 04:34.070
So we've not completely destroyed that we've kind of repaired it a little but any time you can click

04:34.100 --> 04:41.540
this little to turn a layer on and off again and that can be incredibly useful as you can probably imagine

04:41.780 --> 04:43.450
if you're building something up.

04:43.550 --> 04:50.120
So if this here was a highlight I'm going to make sure am on the white spots layer and I'm just going

04:50.120 --> 04:55.340
to colour it in along the top there and perhaps a little bit here if those two were highlights and I

04:55.340 --> 04:56.830
didn't like those highlights.

04:56.870 --> 05:02.460
I have not destroyed the underneath object that I'm working on.

05:02.660 --> 05:06.050
And of course we're not limited to two layers.

05:06.050 --> 05:11.290
In this case we've got our white spots and the background and the white spots is currently invisible

05:11.300 --> 05:13.520
there's no icon in there.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.300
However we can re order those.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.740
So if I click and drag white spots we can see a black line appears underneath back.

05:20.990 --> 05:25.120
Round and now white spots is beneath that background.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.620
So it cannot be seen unless we turn the background off.

05:28.640 --> 05:33.930
And that's because the background has no Alpher we cannot see through it.

05:33.980 --> 05:41.380
So you can equate Alpha to transparency or we could also see those highlights.

05:41.450 --> 05:45.330
If we decrease the capacity of a particular layer.

05:47.680 --> 05:56.390
So with the background selected above it is a bar that's movable that ranges from zero to 100.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.050
That's the opacity bar.

05:58.120 --> 06:04.860
And if we lower that down we start to see that we can see the white taillights underneath.

06:05.230 --> 06:06.910
Now this is no good.

06:06.910 --> 06:13.030
In this particular example because it doesn't really change the highlights and the background image

06:13.030 --> 06:16.330
itself just fades out to nothingness.

06:16.330 --> 06:24.330
And if you can see there is a chequered pattern that is the standard for there being nothing there.

06:24.340 --> 06:32.970
So those white spots the only information is these white lines on the screen on the layer itself.

06:34.180 --> 06:34.410
Right.

06:34.410 --> 06:38.050
Bring the background layer back down by clicking and dragging.

06:38.070 --> 06:43.260
There is another way of course of reordering layers if you glance down at the bottom.

06:43.290 --> 06:47.150
You can raise and lower the layer with an up and down our own.

06:47.220 --> 06:54.810
If you want to and you can also access a similar thing under the layer menu under stack and we can raise

06:54.810 --> 06:57.840
the layer we can raise the layer all the way to the top.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.970
So if something has drifted down and you need it on top of everything else there is a shortcut to do

07:02.970 --> 07:04.530
it there as well.

07:04.530 --> 07:10.020
Now we still cant see our background layer at the moment so Im going to raise the A pastie back up of

07:10.020 --> 07:12.030
that layer so we can see it.

07:12.030 --> 07:17.490
But perhaps these white spots are a bit too intense but I dont want to edit them and make them some

07:17.490 --> 07:18.290
grey.

07:18.510 --> 07:20.270
I want to leave them as white.

07:20.400 --> 07:27.090
I can select the white spots and lower its capacity and it will make those white lines slightly transparence.

07:27.150 --> 07:32.460
Thats lower than down a little more and that will also have the effect of making them look not as bright

07:32.460 --> 07:34.010
as they were before.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.910
So finally just to reiterate.

07:35.910 --> 07:42.240
When it comes to importance of the labour order if youve got several layers Im just going to create

07:42.510 --> 07:43.740
a couple more layers.

07:43.740 --> 07:51.030
Now you can see with transparency selected it doesnt change our image weve essentially got another couple

07:51.240 --> 07:56.520
of transparent layers that we can draw on and the only thing we'll see from that layer is what ever

07:56.520 --> 07:57.900
we've drawn.

07:57.930 --> 08:04.200
Now if we selected a new layer and happened to have the foreground background colour all white on it

08:04.920 --> 08:11.940
and it was at the very top it just goes completely white because white is at the very top so everything

08:11.970 --> 08:14.070
underneath it can not be seen.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.520
There's no transparency on this layer.

08:16.590 --> 08:21.900
There's no party or there is a pasties or it's 100 percent it's completely opaque.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.240
You can not see through that layer.

08:24.450 --> 08:30.140
You can of course adjust that and bring it down but the layer order does matter.

08:30.150 --> 08:34.920
It is what determines which lay it takes precedence over all the other layers.

08:34.920 --> 08:41.640
Now if we drag white spots fall further down so that it's beneath the background it will no longer be

08:41.640 --> 08:44.900
making the background whiter or lighter.

08:44.910 --> 08:51.930
In this case and if you want to delete a layer which is inevitable there is a little bin icon on the

08:51.930 --> 08:59.100
far right at the bottom of the layers or you can go to the layer menu and delete the liar.

08:59.970 --> 09:04.820
Now if you go ahead with the layer selected and hit something like the delete key.

09:06.290 --> 09:13.970
Then you will end up clearing that layer removing all colour from it and leaving it completely transparent

09:14.450 --> 09:17.510
which is not the same as actually deleting the letter.

09:17.810 --> 09:22.610
And then finally if we go ahead and click delete layer you can see it just disappears.

09:22.610 --> 09:25.430
If we do white spots and click it it just disappears.

09:25.430 --> 09:32.750
So a warning there that when you hit that delete key it's done which is unusual of course because I

09:32.750 --> 09:33.990
would expect there to be a.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.560
Are you sure you want to delete this layer.

09:36.710 --> 09:37.250
There isn't.

09:37.250 --> 09:42.720
So if you've inadvertently deleted the wrong layer you will have to undo to get that back.

09:42.740 --> 09:46.410
And that can be done a file undo remove layer.

09:46.430 --> 09:47.970
There we go we've got that back again.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.020
I remove the wrong white spots.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.430
Of course there's also the undo history as well.

09:53.540 --> 09:55.990
So we can see everything that we've done.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.710
Now if you don't have that enabled it is great to have it there.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.010
It's also available under Edit undo history as well.

10:04.010 --> 10:07.250
And we can see all the things that I've recently done.

10:08.290 --> 10:12.850
All the way from the very base image so we could go all the way back to that if we have a look at the

10:12.850 --> 10:15.400
layers is all the way back at the beginning.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.150
Of course I don't want to do anything at the moment if I did.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.530
It would reset the history and it's gone.

10:21.530 --> 10:27.140
And if you undo you can only go back to that base image again.

10:27.170 --> 10:33.430
I can't go back to my previous state and Whoops I did not save my work so I can't go back at all.

10:33.590 --> 10:36.430
So that is a brief overview of layers.

10:36.440 --> 10:42.470
And in order to solidify that knowledge I've now got a small challenge for you and your challenge is

10:42.470 --> 10:49.110
to start with a 32 by 30 to canvas create a base shape.

10:49.130 --> 10:52.190
In this case I am going to go ahead and create a house.

10:52.190 --> 10:57.740
I suggest you follow along to the first time and then hap's revisit the challenge again with your own

10:57.740 --> 10:58.420
idea.

10:59.160 --> 11:05.240
Give it three different configurations that you can switch between using the layers.

11:06.690 --> 11:11.290
Hide the layers you do not want to appear in the export that were going to do.

11:11.400 --> 11:18.790
And then finally export your three variations at 64 by 64 and share it with us.

11:18.860 --> 11:21.450
Pause video now and give that a go.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.760
Okay guys welcome back.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.220
Let's go ahead and create a base shape.

11:27.230 --> 11:31.550
In this case I'm going to do a house and give it three different configurations.

11:32.160 --> 11:38.520
Okay so I have a nice blank image considering I just undid everything and I'm going to first of all

11:38.520 --> 11:40.420
just save my file.

11:40.470 --> 11:46.810
I am going to call it's just on the other windover and I'm going to call this.

11:47.730 --> 11:50.490
House or layered house.

11:50.610 --> 11:56.100
I'm going to call it something so I know what it's about so late word house recap.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.250
It's that's all saved and I'm going to want maybe more than three letters.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.110
I'm going to leave the background as it is for the moment.

12:04.130 --> 12:08.630
I'm going to go ahead and create a new layer and I'm going to call it house.

12:09.710 --> 12:14.770
And I'm going to literally just draw a nice iconic house.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.110
Where we've got let's see goes up.

12:19.110 --> 12:27.360
Now of course I'm not basing this upon reality I'm doing a representation of a house who made a mistake

12:27.360 --> 12:28.050
there.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.370
Hey let's go ahead and give it a roof.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.500
I'm going to do the iconic roof.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.000
That's like this.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.820
One two three four five six and then close it off.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.910
So that's my base shape of a house.

12:45.940 --> 12:50.030
It actually kind of looks like a box with prospective but there we go.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.120
It's going to become clear once we add a new layer.

12:53.290 --> 12:56.520
And I'm going to call this one variation or one.

12:58.160 --> 12:58.790
Whoops.

12:58.790 --> 13:04.330
I created a layer that was well wasn't transparent so it's gone all white.

13:04.340 --> 13:08.480
Now I've got a couple of options here I could delete the line or I could just clear the lay down and

13:08.480 --> 13:13.730
I'm going to do that because that's the quickest thing for me to do and that was by hitting the delete

13:13.760 --> 13:20.810
key not the backspace key the delete key and just a reminder for those on a Mac and perhaps some other

13:21.290 --> 13:25.850
computers as well you can hold down the function button as well as the backspace key and that often

13:25.850 --> 13:28.190
does the delete for you.

13:28.510 --> 13:34.700
Okay so we've got this box shaped thing let's go ahead and give it a door so I'm going to have a door

13:34.730 --> 13:41.450
in the middle of my house and I'm going to go ahead and just continue my variations on a theme here

13:41.720 --> 13:44.520
and I will see you guys back in a few moments.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.790
Okay guys welcome back.

13:46.790 --> 13:50.140
Let's have a look at the variations that I have made.

13:50.150 --> 13:52.220
Now one of them's a cheeky little variation.

13:52.220 --> 13:54.510
It's simply a chimney on the side.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.370
But I've got two main faces to my house.

13:57.370 --> 14:04.180
I've got one with the garridge and one without a garridge and a large room instead.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.050
So there we go.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.070
I've got mine all ready to go.

14:07.070 --> 14:10.580
And of course I need to export them now but before I export them.

14:10.580 --> 14:16.110
Just a quick one and we'll get to solving this particular issue in a later lecture.

14:16.250 --> 14:20.000
But if we have a look if we created ourselves a new layer.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.360
In this case and said it to the background.

14:22.430 --> 14:26.960
When it was my foreground colour my foreground covers currently blacks am going to set it as black obviously

14:26.960 --> 14:28.090
everything goes black.

14:28.090 --> 14:31.330
I'm going to drag that down so it's below everything else.

14:31.520 --> 14:38.000
I'm going to keep the house turned off but I'm going to add on my variation one you can see some white.

14:38.490 --> 14:44.510
Okay so where I have corrected because the backgrounds white I've just used white almost like Tippex

14:44.510 --> 14:45.800
or correction fluid.

14:45.800 --> 14:52.130
However that has left evidence that it was there and rather it been nothing and the same thing with

14:52.130 --> 14:57.420
the chimney Yes but this one absolutely fine didn't make any mistakes that I need correct that way.

14:57.590 --> 15:01.660
So let's turn back on the House and I've got the windows there.

15:01.790 --> 15:05.120
Okay so now with those two layers turned on.

15:05.270 --> 15:11.810
I just need to export my work now I haven't got blimp installed on this computer so I'm going to have

15:11.810 --> 15:13.760
to go around in either install it.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.900
I'm not going to do that in front of you now or of course you can do the long hand version which is

15:17.900 --> 15:24.740
making sure you've saved your work before you do anything and then scale it up so we can go to image

15:24.980 --> 15:26.130
scale image.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.260
Make it 64 by 64.

15:29.060 --> 15:33.390
And make sure that the interpolation is turned toward none.

15:34.470 --> 15:41.910
And just a reminder that big amp is the automatic exporting of our images for us where we can do the

15:41.910 --> 15:48.280
resizing or tomas's through the batch exporting so we can do multiple actions to an individual image.

15:48.300 --> 15:53.550
Now in this particular case thinking about so because we're just going to swap out our layers using

15:53.550 --> 15:59.300
blimp would probably be quite owner a swearers doing it the manual way will probably end up a bit quicker

15:59.300 --> 16:03.200
than trying to use something like bebop because we've not got multiple images.

16:03.270 --> 16:07.110
We just got multiple errors that will be switching in and out.

16:07.770 --> 16:16.330
No scale that scaled everything up and then I can export as and layered house and then call this layered

16:16.330 --> 16:17.110
house.

16:17.260 --> 16:18.330
Yeah just lay house.

16:18.400 --> 16:23.770
I think in this case and we need to make sure we've got pins selected it's remembered that from the

16:23.770 --> 16:29.260
last time I was exporting so I'm going to go ahead and export that's in the appropriate location and

16:29.320 --> 16:33.160
export what other variations do have shift control.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.460
J just to make sure I can see everything.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.540
Let's pop the chimney on.

16:37.540 --> 16:46.010
So again I'm going to export as an out we've got layered house with chimney s.h..

16:46.210 --> 16:47.070
There we go.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.300
Export.

16:49.340 --> 16:55.100
And finally we've got this one and I'm going to leave the chimney on as well and I'm going to export

16:55.160 --> 17:01.510
as led House for chimney and a garridge exports.

17:01.520 --> 17:08.360
Now of course Usually you won't be exporting things quite as rapidly as this often spending a bit more

17:08.360 --> 17:09.770
time on detail.

17:09.860 --> 17:15.700
And I suggest you now revisit the challenge again if you're comfortable with layers and doing this again.

17:15.710 --> 17:21.140
But perhaps with a bit more colour in there perhaps were a bit of shading entirely up to you.

17:21.140 --> 17:26.060
Do practice what you've just learned that is important to solidify it now I'm going to make sure at

17:26.060 --> 17:28.980
this point in time I do not save my work.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.520
Otherwise it will upscaled 64 by 64 and I do not want that I want it left at 32.

17:34.550 --> 17:39.920
I'm going to go to file and just close the view which is the current one I've got to open.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.740
Of course I can click the little cross on the tab as well.

17:42.830 --> 17:43.230
It's going to.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.020
After all I want to save the changes.

17:45.020 --> 17:49.910
No the only changes I've done is a scale and I do not want that saved.

17:49.910 --> 17:50.760
Perfect.

17:50.780 --> 17:52.610
How did you guys get on.

17:52.610 --> 17:57.220
Please show your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
