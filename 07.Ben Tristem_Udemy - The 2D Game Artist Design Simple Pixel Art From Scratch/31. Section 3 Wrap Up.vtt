Congratulations finishing this section.

00:07.010 --> 00:07.820
Very well done.

00:07.820 --> 00:12.110
I love going on the forum and seeing the animations it really brings things to life so keep it going

00:12.110 --> 00:13.090
keep it sharing on the phone.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.510
Really really fun to see.

00:14.570 --> 00:19.340
And it's amazing the transformation we've gone from having a simple bouncing ball coming off well.

00:19.370 --> 00:23.850
In fact just colours changing to this wonderful dungeon that you guys are putting together now.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.940
It's amazing the transformation.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.380
So now you got these animation skills.

00:27.380 --> 00:32.330
My first challenge to you is to go back to the emoji section I know sometimes we call them a mojie sometimes

00:32.510 --> 00:33.390
with emoticons.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.380
Frankly we didn't know the difference till recently.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.680
But go back to the emoji section and animator them use the skills you've learned makes an animated emerges.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.010
Why come up on the forum start using medder be fun.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.570
And then of course move on and do the game icons too it's important that you really hone your skills

00:47.810 --> 00:53.000
and reinforce them so having your animated game icons whether it's some lightning striking or whatever

00:53.000 --> 00:54.180
you feel like doing.

00:54.410 --> 00:55.250
Absolutely.

00:55.270 --> 00:56.820
And never thought for you.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.440
So maybe the animations we've made so far quite sure and made quite frantic.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.400
Here's an idea and maybe you go back and apply to those action icons and Michael mentioned earlier.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.550
Oh they can make a blinking eye that I could blink once every 10 seconds.

01:07.550 --> 01:12.110
Don't be afraid to make a longer animations with periods of stillness in them and introduce a bit of

01:12.110 --> 01:18.540
variety to pause just like a comedic pause or a pause in a public speech or pausing music or pause on

01:18.540 --> 01:19.510
the big dog.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.320
Maybe so remember to keep up the momentum here.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.470
And of course we'll see you all in the next section.
