00:04.470 --> 00:05.830
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:05.850 --> 00:09.210
Let's go ahead and talk about nested labour groups.

00:09.210 --> 00:14.220
Now these are going to be essential for managing animation with multiple elements in it like we've got

00:14.220 --> 00:15.390
in front of us here.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.620
And it also helps us keep these elements separated and organized.

00:19.950 --> 00:24.930
So the first thing that we can do here is the war statements at the back we can put them in a lay a

00:24.930 --> 00:26.980
group called wall.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.300
That's important that keeps them separated.

00:29.300 --> 00:34.620
Now I could merge this l.a. group into one big image that would be absolutely fine as well.

00:34.620 --> 00:40.320
However what I don't want to do is muck around with these just yet because it still gives me the option

00:40.320 --> 00:43.790
to move segments in and out if I want to.

00:43.830 --> 00:50.160
However in a moment we'll see that it is important to make a decision and that means no changes from

00:50.160 --> 00:54.820
there onwards without having to do quite a bit of work to potentially fix that.

00:54.870 --> 01:00.360
Of course if we've got something like the lower group wall that can always be updated and moved into

01:00.390 --> 01:03.660
a new frame later on if necessary.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.630
And then we've got the rest of this scene.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.350
They are all individual elements that's absolutely fine and they've got an order to them.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.340
Now this point in time if you're happy with what you're seeing in front of you you can go ahead and

01:14.340 --> 01:15.650
create a new lower group.

01:15.750 --> 01:20.850
In this case it's put it inside the wall we don't want that but I'm going to call this frame one so

01:20.850 --> 01:23.890
we can start building up frame one of our animation.

01:23.970 --> 01:27.660
So we're going to have the wall in that animation in fact we're going to have everything in this animation

01:28.020 --> 01:33.570
and be careful as you're dragging in because sometimes it will end up just dropping it underneath rather

01:33.570 --> 01:34.560
than in.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.760
And of course pay attention to the order of which things are coming in.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.640
Hopefully they will come in in the right order.

01:41.640 --> 01:47.520
Now this is where it gets important that you're happy with the static objects in the scene the ones

01:47.520 --> 01:48.870
that you're not go into annamay.

01:48.870 --> 01:55.530
In this case for me that's probably going to be the tables and the wall statements themselves if I'm

01:55.530 --> 02:02.870
happy with what I can go ahead and do is with frame one selected duplicate the entire layer group.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.390
Now I've got a frame too that I can work on.

02:05.430 --> 02:12.150
And with that I can go in to frame to make changes to let's say the flame itself we can move that one

02:12.150 --> 02:15.960
about and then we can find the other flame and move that one about.

02:16.010 --> 02:22.380
Notice if you use the blurred tool by the way you'll probably have to go into your other layer and also

02:22.380 --> 02:30.390
use it just to make it more consistent because there's a definite change between that and that you can

02:30.390 --> 02:35.890
see is one's got harsh and bright separation one's a bit more blurred.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.870
Again that's a design decision there's no right or wrong here.

02:38.880 --> 02:44.940
I can go into this flame blairites up a little and do the same to the other one and you can see here

02:44.970 --> 02:48.420
how you can very quickly build up an animation.

02:48.420 --> 02:55.170
Now if I toggle between these two frames we can see that that can be built up to actually look like

02:55.170 --> 03:01.470
quite a good animation were almost coming up to the final stage of creating your final animation.

03:01.740 --> 03:08.010
But before we do there is a quick challenge and the challenge is relatively straightforward one I would

03:08.010 --> 03:15.080
like you to organize your layers ready for animation pause video now and give that a go.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.790
Okay everyone welcome back.

03:19.900 --> 03:24.990
Let's just have a quick look at my organization and make sure everything is ready to go.

03:25.760 --> 03:31.610
So we've got our two layers here that we can alternate between and just make sure that the idea behind

03:31.610 --> 03:33.520
the animation is going to work.

03:33.530 --> 03:38.870
I'm happy with that but let's just have a closer look at the layer itself and make sure that we're not

03:38.870 --> 03:42.340
missing something or any optimization that's required.

03:42.350 --> 03:50.120
So the first thing that we can see is that the whole labour group this blue and black border is larger

03:50.180 --> 03:55.520
than the actual image itself so I think we can do a bit of optimization here because when we've got

03:55.520 --> 04:00.410
multiple frames going on we're going to start chewing through our available memory.

04:00.410 --> 04:05.360
I'm going to go ahead and delete frame too for the moment there's no value there at that at the present

04:05.360 --> 04:06.010
time.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.780
So our torch is quite tall.

04:07.780 --> 04:13.310
We can go through an auto crop the layer as necessary that that torch itself is fine.

04:13.310 --> 04:14.270
The flame looks fine.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.100
The flames scatter also looks fine.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.050
It looks like have optimized those.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.430
The table itself could probably be optimized a little more.

04:21.460 --> 04:21.820
Yeah.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.190
Certainly done that.

04:23.420 --> 04:27.170
And the same is true of these layers as well.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.640
Now are the flame can be reduced to little.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.740
It does depend of course how blurry you've made it with the smudge taut.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.910
If you've done that Bob demising these things will have benefits.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.960
Not necessarily at this moment in time but certainly later on.

04:42.080 --> 04:47.360
Another little tip and trick that you can do when animating is is go to layer and actually just transform

04:47.360 --> 04:51.890
that layer and flip it horizontally and then you just get a mirror image that you can alter a great

04:51.890 --> 04:54.810
way of adding variation to a scene.

04:54.970 --> 04:59.400
So you've got the candle on the table that's not got any animation on it at the moment.

04:59.420 --> 05:04.820
However when I do go ahead to animated there's going to realistically need to be in its own layer a

05:04.820 --> 05:08.040
group called candle group.

05:08.060 --> 05:14.060
I'm going to call it candle group because if I just call it candle then we're going to have issues because

05:14.060 --> 05:19.400
it's just going to end up with hash one on me and later groups and layers can not share the same name.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.060
You've got another table down here.

05:21.140 --> 05:26.860
I didn't check the candle the candles huge so we can alter crop that down table.

05:26.870 --> 05:29.910
I thought I'd done that's the sort of crop that down.

05:29.990 --> 05:34.340
And then finally the story here as well it looks like we can alter crop as well.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.260
So there we go.

05:35.260 --> 05:40.560
We've pretty much optimized everything that we need to optimize.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.430
I'm happy with frame one.

05:42.440 --> 05:47.270
I'm not going to make any other alterations to the background it is important if you're planning on

05:47.270 --> 05:48.180
doing that.

05:48.260 --> 05:54.620
You do do that as soon as possible rather than when you've made several frames because once you've made

05:54.620 --> 06:00.350
several frames you'll have to individually replace anything you change rather than just being able to

06:00.350 --> 06:04.740
go ahead and hit the duplicate button worth bearing that in mind.

06:04.790 --> 06:07.760
So I hope you're now all optimized and ready to go.

06:07.970 --> 06:11.590
And I'm getting excited now because it's almost time for the final challenge.
