00:05.630 --> 00:07.770
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:07.790 --> 00:16.680
Let's talk about frame rates frame rate is simply the number of images every second that will be shown.

00:16.810 --> 00:24.100
And often the more images that are shown every second or frames per second for smoother the animation

00:24.100 --> 00:24.980
will look.

00:24.980 --> 00:29.510
Now this may not be the style you're going for you may want it to be a bit more jerky.

00:29.510 --> 00:30.930
That's absolutely fine.

00:31.100 --> 00:37.500
Let's just have a look at a few frame rate comparison so we can have a handle on what's going on.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.750
So here is a bouncing ball at 10 frames per second.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.890
It's just looping around.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.360
It's just short of a second.

00:44.360 --> 00:53.090
The animation itself now with twice the amount of frames 20 frames per second you get a much smoother

00:53.150 --> 00:57.700
image much of bouncy a ball and it does look better.

00:57.920 --> 01:04.250
However there's twice the amount of work involved there are 20 frames in that rather than 10 in the

01:04.250 --> 01:05.620
other one.

01:05.690 --> 01:11.780
Now getting the frame rate right from the very beginning or not right but spect correctly for whatever

01:11.780 --> 01:15.150
you're working on is incredibly important.

01:15.170 --> 01:22.180
You cannot just nearly Willy change the amount of frames per second and expect it to work.

01:22.190 --> 01:28.790
So if we go ahead and for instance take the 10 frames per second animation and just double it to 20

01:28.790 --> 01:34.160
frames per second as you can see it looks completely different in fact its going twice as fast as the

01:34.160 --> 01:35.090
other ones.

01:35.210 --> 01:41.360
Again if you take the 20 and run it 10 frames per second you still end up with a smooth animation because

01:41.360 --> 01:43.450
there are more frames there.

01:43.490 --> 01:51.140
However it now looks like its in slow motion so you can see how just changing the frame rate itself

01:51.380 --> 01:56.710
will impact the animation and quite severely it no longer looks like a bouncing ball.

01:56.720 --> 02:04.280
Its either in heavy gravity or sped up hour or on the moon you know it doesnt look quite how you'd expect

02:04.280 --> 02:05.270
it to.

02:05.270 --> 02:12.100
So in short if you want to extend take something from 10 frames to 20 frames per second you're going

02:12.100 --> 02:15.440
to have to add extra frames in there.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.470
In this case double the amount.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.720
Now this might mean twice the amount of work as well.

02:20.720 --> 02:27.260
So you've got to bear in mind the higher the resolution i.e. in this case the time resolution the frames

02:27.260 --> 02:32.730
per second then it's going to take often more work to do.

02:32.840 --> 02:38.420
Now of the converse if you've made yourself a 20 frames per second you need to play it back slower with

02:38.480 --> 02:44.450
out changing the overall appearance the feel of the animation you're actually going to have to sacrifice

02:44.450 --> 02:46.050
half of those frames.

02:46.130 --> 02:49.600
And of course when you do that you end up with a slightly jerky image.

02:49.730 --> 02:54.650
Now I'm just going to move on from these bouncing balls for the moment and have a look at frame rate

02:54.710 --> 02:59.830
versus frame time frame rate is what we call the frames per second.

02:59.830 --> 03:06.680
How many images every second you are going to be showing on the right the frame time that's actually

03:06.680 --> 03:12.320
how long each individual frame will be displayed on the screen and I've just got some common frame rates

03:12.320 --> 03:12.670
there.

03:12.740 --> 03:18.710
The calculation you need to do is at the very top it's a thousand divided by the frames per second.

03:18.770 --> 03:25.130
So just for example 10 frames per second is 100 milliseconds each one is on there for only a tenth of

03:25.130 --> 03:26.400
that second.

03:26.660 --> 03:31.940
If you go to 20 frames per second that would be 50 milliseconds et cetera et cetera.

03:31.940 --> 03:39.080
And here you can see 24 frames per second 30 and 60 frames per second with 40 133 and 16 respectively

03:39.080 --> 03:40.370
milliseconds.

03:40.910 --> 03:49.130
So you can see that a higher refresh rate a higher f s you are going to have not only more work to do

03:49.130 --> 03:55.070
because there'll be more frames being shown every second but the amount of work that's there is only

03:55.070 --> 03:56.720
being displayed for 16.

03:56.720 --> 04:03.950
And in this section we will go through a series of tips and tricks that you can do to help you if you

04:03.950 --> 04:06.240
need to produce more frames.

04:06.260 --> 04:14.390
So let's go over into guimpe now and play with a short animation okay now with GIMP loaded up we can

04:14.390 --> 04:16.600
go ahead and create our first frame.

04:16.610 --> 04:21.980
Now I'm going to create an image that's 64 by 64 and presto Okay.

04:22.040 --> 04:30.400
So here we go here is our working Cambers that we've got now to make things a bit easier for myself

04:30.440 --> 04:31.250
at the moment.

04:31.310 --> 04:35.380
We can go ahead and literally start drawing our animation.

04:35.390 --> 04:40.010
There are a couple of things that you can do to help when youre actually making an animation.

04:40.010 --> 04:45.790
Now one of them of course is being able to see the previous frame or the frame in front.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.570
Now if we go ahead and just create a black blob I want the pencil tool rather than the air brush.

04:50.570 --> 04:56.360
There's our black blob that's a ball in this case let's say let's say we want to move it across well

04:56.420 --> 04:57.440
to create a new frame.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.330
We know we have to add a new layer now your layers themselves.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.530
If you have them with transparency you can.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.900
She sees through.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.540
It does cause a few niggles later on that you have to work around.

05:09.650 --> 05:15.400
But with the transparency turned on that is one way of being able see what the next frame is of.

05:15.410 --> 05:22.780
Go ahead and click new click okay next frame click new click okay and in the next frame you can see

05:22.790 --> 05:25.430
the ball is moving across the screen.

05:25.430 --> 05:31.590
If we go ahead now and want to view the animation we can go to filter's animation and play that back

05:32.340 --> 05:33.650
and when we play it back.

05:33.650 --> 05:35.390
It's a relative size.

05:35.390 --> 05:39.250
You can see one of the issues here is that it is building up.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.010
We'll discuss how to sort that out later Ron.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.200
And it's building up because of the transparency.

05:45.230 --> 05:52.310
One of the ways around that is to go to the particular layer and literally fill it in with the white

05:52.610 --> 05:54.950
and then you can not see through the layers.

05:54.950 --> 05:59.250
Now this might not be possible on some later animations that were going to do it.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.500
It just won't look right.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.900
If you do that however this is a good way for the moment of working that out.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.290
Now that I have that like that's when we go to animation and play back we see that each individual frame

06:12.290 --> 06:17.400
is shown with the other one being fully overwritten and not being seen through.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.610
Again this is at 10 frames per second.

06:19.610 --> 06:25.850
At one time speed if we go ahead and change that's a two it's not really it 20 frames per second it's

06:25.850 --> 06:30.950
got the illusion of being at 20 frames per second it will just playing back 10 frames per second at

06:30.950 --> 06:36.840
twice the speed as close that down for the moment and have a look at some other ways of seeing through.

06:36.850 --> 06:43.790
Now if the pastie of your layer is a little lower let's just say you knock it down to maybe 50 or 60

06:43.830 --> 06:48.820
first double click to type in 50 in this case and do that to all of your layers.

06:48.910 --> 06:50.790
Did I mean to go to rename there.

06:50.930 --> 06:55.570
So that's 50 this to 50 Kepler fats.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.020
And this here to 50 as well or thereabouts.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.470
There you go.

07:00.710 --> 07:01.090
Said.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.080
Five hundred.

07:02.090 --> 07:06.260
You can now see through but because you're layering on top.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.720
The older one is the most faded out.

07:08.750 --> 07:14.460
So that's a good way of seeing the history as well as where the previous frames were.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.520
Of course it would be prudent to turn that back up again mere opacity so that you have solid images

07:19.550 --> 07:23.180
if you need to concentrate on the frame you're currently working on.

07:23.180 --> 07:30.140
Incidentally if you do want to focus on a single frame you can hold down the SHIFT key as you're clicking

07:30.140 --> 07:32.930
on any of these eyes and it will so low that layer.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.630
So we're only seeing this second layer from the bottom.

07:36.650 --> 07:42.080
If I shift click the next one up it literally switches to that one so that's also a good way of hopping

07:42.320 --> 07:48.610
between your frames or your layers that you've created soloing them from everything else.

07:48.620 --> 07:53.510
Finally of course we've already done this one once with an export but what we'll have a look at here

07:53.720 --> 08:00.740
is how you can override the export setting so at the moment this doesn't really have any settings for

08:00.740 --> 08:01.090
it.

08:01.220 --> 08:05.330
We'll have a look at the syntax of things you can type on your layers in a bit.

08:05.450 --> 08:13.490
But until then when we go ahead and export and we can say this as a test animation just to test out

08:13.490 --> 08:14.140
what's going on.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.850
So we got four frames animates animation.

08:16.850 --> 08:17.530
There we go.

08:17.570 --> 08:23.360
Now there are a couple of ways you can select by file type and go down to the bottom the stropped down

08:23.360 --> 08:32.670
here and find the gif and animated gif or Jif and then dot gif on the end will also do the same.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.570
So you don't have to search for every time.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.170
I'm going to make sure I'm going to save this into the appropriate location.

08:38.510 --> 08:39.860
I'm going to export that.

08:40.010 --> 08:41.730
And it gives us some options.

08:41.750 --> 08:46.850
Of course we've already had a look at this once but now we have a look at the extra options further

08:46.850 --> 08:47.180
down.

08:47.180 --> 08:50.480
So I need a tick as an animation because that's what we're doing.

08:50.540 --> 08:57.600
The delay between the frames where unspecified Now we don't have any controls on the end of our Lares

08:57.600 --> 09:00.890
you will understand more about that in the following lecture.

09:01.220 --> 09:08.420
But these are unspecified frames so they're all going to have a hundred milliseconds to lay which is

09:08.660 --> 09:10.490
10 frames per second.

09:10.550 --> 09:17.450
So if you have four frames the whole animation is only going to last point for a second.

09:17.450 --> 09:24.160
Now each frame disposed where unspecified this is useful if your alferd out.

09:24.190 --> 09:29.870
So where we saw earlier where we had the ball on our four layers and moving across.

09:29.990 --> 09:36.170
That's a great way of animating but it does mean you've got a huge load of wasted space where really

09:36.170 --> 09:42.180
all you care about there is that black dot moving across what you can do here is either combine them

09:42.230 --> 09:45.440
which is not what we want to do but replace them.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.590
Each frame is individual.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.700
And I'll show you that in a couple of seconds.

09:50.260 --> 09:58.090
You can force this delay between frames for all frames so you can override anything that's been set

09:58.090 --> 10:03.340
elsewhere and you can also use the disposal settings as well so let's have a look at this disposal settings

10:03.760 --> 10:05.390
at the moment we.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.810
Let's just close this down.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.010
We have these layers here.

10:09.040 --> 10:16.640
Now if I was to go in and to each one amblin Use the same Fuzzy's select tool and just remove that background.

10:16.750 --> 10:22.770
Now this background itself is the background layer the one named background doesn't have an outflow

10:22.780 --> 10:28.380
at the moment so let's go ahead and add one so I'm going to right click on the layer and add our 4 channel.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.760
You can also do that through the layers menu.

10:30.760 --> 10:37.660
And now I can go ahead and select the area that's entirely white and just make sure that the ball itself

10:38.070 --> 10:39.030
opes.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.320
That's what you get for not having the hard layer active so you can see it.

10:43.330 --> 10:44.110
But there we go.

10:44.140 --> 10:51.100
We can now see that the layers all of them have our fire and we can turn the capacity up at this point

10:51.190 --> 10:52.840
as well.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.030
Now since you can't go over 100 you can just type in any number larger than a hundred and or set to

10:58.030 --> 10:58.350
that.

10:58.450 --> 11:03.540
We can now see all of our frames if we go ahead and just export as.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.880
And again I'm going to have to go to the appropriate location.

11:06.880 --> 11:13.070
Go to repo's in my case and in it animated sprites and call this test animation.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.860
And make sure it's a dot gif.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.510
In this case and won't we do that we get this option.

11:18.520 --> 11:25.990
Now if I wanted this to last an entire second I'd have to do as an animation and not a hundred seconds

11:26.300 --> 11:27.490
or a hundred milliseconds.

11:27.610 --> 11:36.340
We'd have to do a calculation we'd have to do a thousand divided by four frames and that would give

11:36.340 --> 11:37.370
us a whole second.

11:37.390 --> 11:40.540
So that'll be 250 milliseconds.

11:41.020 --> 11:45.800
So in this case it or go-between knees every 250 milliseconds.

11:45.880 --> 11:50.910
And I'm going to use that delay for all of these at the moment frame despose aware unspecified.

11:50.920 --> 11:57.040
Now if I don't care it's just going to use what is being predefined in in this case they will layer

11:57.040 --> 11:57.930
on top of one another.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.760
So let's see what that looks like.

11:59.860 --> 12:04.310
And that's also the same as combining in this particular case.

12:04.330 --> 12:11.920
So if we go ahead and export and go and have a look at that here we go here's my test animation.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.480
If we go ahead and open that you can see it building up.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.200
However with our flare president we can replace.

12:20.200 --> 12:26.050
So if we go ahead here when we export this time test animation again I'm just going to overwrite it

12:26.050 --> 12:31.250
someday and replace this time I'm going to one frame per layer.

12:31.270 --> 12:32.750
So that's a replace.

12:32.770 --> 12:40.630
And then when we export and have a look at the same animation again this time it's each one individually.

12:40.630 --> 12:46.720
So you can still have that Alpha layer present which is incredibly useful when you're building up an

12:46.750 --> 12:52.750
animation from multiple layers rather than the simplistic one at the moment which is just a black dot

12:53.110 --> 12:54.640
on a background.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.600
And of course that leads us nicely onto a challenge.

12:57.610 --> 13:02.830
So in this challenge I'd like you to create a bouncing ball so the ball is going to start up the top

13:03.220 --> 13:07.860
hit the ground or the bottom of your image and bounce back up again.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.630
Your animation must be 10 frames long.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.130
And I want it to last for two seconds.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.470
Export it as an animated gif and share it with us.

13:20.490 --> 13:21.250
Go ahead.

13:21.270 --> 13:23.460
Pause a video and give that ago.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.530
Everyone welcome back.

13:27.690 --> 13:30.680
Let's go ahead now and angry 8 a bouncing ball.

13:30.690 --> 13:34.380
That's 10 frames long and lasts for two seconds.

13:35.150 --> 13:36.870
Okay so back overing guimpe.

13:36.890 --> 13:41.420
We have got four frames already but I am just going to go ahead and delete those.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.610
And I'm going to delete the background as fast.

13:43.610 --> 13:44.640
Create a new layer.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.160
And I'm going to have it transparent 64 bice's for fine.

13:48.170 --> 13:54.040
We'll have a look in more detail about that later from different layer sizes.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.000
But for now let's go ahead.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.950
I'm going to create a slightly smaller ball in this case I'm going to grab my brush size and turn it

14:00.950 --> 14:02.570
down to 15.

14:02.810 --> 14:05.340
So just got smaller ball more opportunity to move it.

14:05.450 --> 14:07.320
And this is relatively straightforward.

14:07.400 --> 14:13.640
I'm going to go ahead create a black bull and new layer transparency black ball.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.950
New layer et cetera et cetera.

14:19.890 --> 14:28.620
And as the ball is falling I want it to increase its distance between which is absolutely fine.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.710
There we go it's falling rapidly.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.760
Then it hits the bottom which is about vapour.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.610
New frame.

14:38.610 --> 14:44.750
And we just finished this off it's going to bounce up quickly and then obviously slow down as it gets

14:44.750 --> 14:47.400
towards the top of its bants.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.870
I'm going to undo that last one.

14:50.920 --> 14:56.340
Slightly overlapping Is this a great thing about using the Alpher I can see how it's going.

14:56.470 --> 14:59.420
How many layers have we got we've got layer and then layer 1.

14:59.530 --> 15:03.310
So that's really less zeros so one more layer after this which is perfect.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.180
That's exactly what I wanted.

15:06.260 --> 15:07.080
And about that.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.100
Perfect.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.550
Okay so we've got our 10 frames.

15:10.570 --> 15:12.850
So it's 10 frames long the animation.

15:12.850 --> 15:15.560
I can just check this here if I go to animation.

15:15.610 --> 15:16.010
OK.

15:16.060 --> 15:16.580
Of mice.

15:16.580 --> 15:16.850
Nope.

15:16.870 --> 15:17.560
Here we go.

15:20.540 --> 15:27.010
If I just go down to filter's animation and play back we can go ahead and play that and see what it

15:27.010 --> 15:27.580
looks like.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.140
Okay.

15:28.150 --> 15:29.740
That is looking good.

15:29.740 --> 15:34.390
Now in this case I don't need to fill in the frames white or anything along those lines.

15:34.390 --> 15:37.670
I'm quite happy with that's the progression it's going to make.

15:37.810 --> 15:47.070
And in the export process itself I'm going to call this what it is and export it.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.030
Now here comes the bit.

15:49.030 --> 15:53.320
We need to pay attention to the delay between frames.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.940
I need it to be two hundred milliseconds.

15:57.940 --> 16:05.220
Two hundred times ten is two thousand two thousand milliseconds is ah whole two seconds.

16:05.290 --> 16:10.430
So that's fine grained despose aware unspecified I want it's replace.

16:10.450 --> 16:14.740
So I don't get the overlapping effect of them and hit her head and export that.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.280
And then of course immediately check it.

16:19.200 --> 16:28.020
Here we go bouncing ball and there ago 0 1 2 Perfect's takes a second to fall and a second to bounce

16:28.020 --> 16:28.440
up.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.570
Now this is a particularly great animation.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.380
There's things we can do to improve it.

16:32.520 --> 16:37.680
But as a principle and a proof of concept this is a great starting point.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.730
How did you guys get on.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.620
Did you do something slightly different.

16:40.620 --> 16:44.160
Did you make it curve down and bounce up in a slightly different way.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.370
And please do remember to show your work over in the discussions.

16:48.630 --> 16:55.920
Okay I'm back really quick here just to show you I've tidied up my folder structure as well as I faded

16:55.920 --> 17:01.350
out there just so I've got the project files that I've been working on and not examples that I've been

17:01.350 --> 17:03.680
setting up for you guys to see as well.

17:03.810 --> 17:08.300
So I've just tidied that up and I suggest you keep your area tidy too.

17:08.310 --> 17:12.470
Now I will say at this point that I've not named my layers in here.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.600
That's fine for this example.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.470
Otherwise you just say bouncing ball repeatedly rather than lay up.

17:18.510 --> 17:26.370
That's absolutely fine in this instance as we start to get more complicated layers and multi layered

17:26.580 --> 17:27.720
animations.

17:27.720 --> 17:32.580
Well then you can start thinking about your naming more appropriately so in this case we might name

17:32.580 --> 17:33.650
the black ball.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.650
But I will leave it as it is for the moment.

17:36.690 --> 17:37.770
Let's go ahead here.

17:37.800 --> 17:43.440
Make sure we've saved our work of course if you haven't done that can cause some issues and this is

17:43.440 --> 17:50.910
obviously the guimpe file itself says the X C.F. with all the information in the air we go just to finalize

17:50.940 --> 17:51.380
there.

17:51.390 --> 17:54.350
And again I see you all in their next lecture.
