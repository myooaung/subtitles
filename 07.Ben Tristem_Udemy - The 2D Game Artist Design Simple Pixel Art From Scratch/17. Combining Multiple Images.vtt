00:04.130 --> 00:06.030
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:06.050 --> 00:12.350
In this lecture you're gonna learn all the skills necessary to combine multiple images that you've already

00:12.350 --> 00:19.070
made into one final composite image as we can see here it's made from at least three other images that

00:19.070 --> 00:20.930
we've already gone through and made.

00:20.990 --> 00:23.820
And we brought them in to one final image.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.130
So let's go and learn about combining multiple images.

00:28.930 --> 00:31.860
Hello and welcome back over into guimpe.

00:31.870 --> 00:38.120
The first thing some going to do now is create a new image for other images to exist in.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.550
And I'm going to go to file new.

00:40.710 --> 00:48.070
And instead of creating a 32 by 32 image which wouldn't give us much room to manoeuvre these images

00:48.070 --> 00:49.530
as we bring them in.

00:49.570 --> 00:52.140
I'm going to make it 48 by 48.

00:52.140 --> 00:56.170
That should give us enough room around our images.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.070
So that with that created a.

00:59.080 --> 00:59.800
Zoom in.

01:00.080 --> 01:00.770
And there we go.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.270
That image is ready to go.

01:02.300 --> 01:09.080
And in order to demonstrate a couple of these methods I'm going to have to have some images open as

01:09.080 --> 01:14.090
well so I'm going to go to file from recent and I'm going to open up some recent ones that I've been

01:14.090 --> 01:14.980
working on.

01:16.270 --> 01:17.160
Shield.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.830
And then finally I'm going to open up the jewel swords as well.

01:20.900 --> 01:26.920
Okay so now that we have those open there is going to be more than one way of doing this.

01:26.930 --> 01:31.770
I'm going to show you two in this particular lecture for you to be able to do.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.800
Now we can see at the moment that this sword image this double sword images has three layers on it.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.570
The Shield has four layers on it.

01:40.730 --> 01:44.060
And the fire has two layers on it.

01:44.060 --> 01:52.520
Now the first method is simply to click and drag the tab at the very top of your image editor over to

01:52.520 --> 01:53.670
the new image.

01:53.690 --> 01:58.350
And then finally we do have to move it down onto the canvas itself.

01:58.580 --> 02:06.020
When we let go it appears now noticed that only one of those two layers has come across.

02:06.140 --> 02:12.360
And by one of those two layers what is done is taken those two layers and put it as one layer.

02:12.650 --> 02:18.880
And this means we cannot separate the black from the flame anymore the background and that flame simile

02:18.950 --> 02:21.220
here because I've already turned off the background.

02:21.230 --> 02:27.080
If I click and drag that over to our new image and then down onto the canvas before letting go.

02:27.830 --> 02:32.870
It appears but this time with the alpha it's ready to go.

02:32.870 --> 02:33.870
Brilliant.

02:34.040 --> 02:40.160
So from doing that we can see that when you click and drag it comes across exactly how it is and if

02:40.160 --> 02:46.380
it's made up of multiple layers it collapses those mosberg layers into what you see currently.

02:46.430 --> 02:49.310
You can also click and drag from individual layers.

02:49.310 --> 02:56.540
So if I just wanted this sword I could click the layer drag it across to our new image and drop it in.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.330
That would work absolutely fine.

02:59.330 --> 03:04.130
Now one of the things that you have to watch out for when you're just dragging things in like this is

03:04.130 --> 03:09.890
the laicised differences that we've already seen what happens when one layer is smaller.

03:09.890 --> 03:17.060
If you were to in like this top edge here you can see there's a harsh divide between what you'd think

03:17.060 --> 03:21.220
was the rest of the canvas and what the actual size of the layer you're working on.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.760
Now having layers of different sizes is very useful.

03:24.770 --> 03:30.790
Enables you to not use up too much memory and it's essentially an optimization.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.420
Now what we can do is we can make our sword copy lay.

03:34.420 --> 03:37.190
You can see here it's brought across sword copy.

03:37.190 --> 03:45.380
We have a look down here from sword however the others are called drop buffer so we can make this much

03:45.380 --> 03:51.830
larger than it currently is the layer itself can be larger than the canvas size or it can be smaller

03:51.860 --> 03:56.280
as we can see here or indeed as normal it would be the same size.

03:56.390 --> 04:03.290
If we go up to the layer menu not scaled layer as you might guess initially because that will blow things

04:03.290 --> 04:03.440
up.

04:03.440 --> 04:12.680
In fact if I do that now and change just to 48 by 48 with out any into place qan and there we go our

04:12.680 --> 04:19.730
sword now looks a bit rubbish to be honest because it's broken up are nice edges that we once had if

04:19.730 --> 04:25.020
I undo that was I really want to do here is change the boundry size.

04:25.190 --> 04:30.660
So this yellow and black ball that exists around it is the layer boundary.

04:30.740 --> 04:38.480
And I can adjust that and make that Forty eight by forty eight and I'm going to click the link here.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.760
All I need to make sure of are both the same.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.120
Before I do that otherwise it will fail.

04:44.120 --> 04:52.190
Now the first thing before we go and hit resize is I want the image to be in the centre of the expanding

04:52.190 --> 04:59.990
layer not to one side and conveniently they have a button the centre button on that's clicked your image

04:59.990 --> 05:05.140
is placed in the centre and the boundary will expand in all directions.

05:05.190 --> 05:13.700
In this case 48 by 48 with a click re size and we can see now the black and yellow border has expanded

05:13.700 --> 05:14.930
to fill the rest of the image.

05:14.930 --> 05:21.760
When We've got sword copy selected Now this black in yellow boundary can be annoying sometimes.

05:21.890 --> 05:28.300
See you can go in to view and show layer boundary you can turn that off.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.410
If it you find it distracting.

05:30.410 --> 05:35.930
And again you can turn it back on by just clicking show layer boundary at the moment we're dealing with

05:35.930 --> 05:39.350
relatively simple constructions with our images.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.290
However later on they might be a bit more involved.

05:42.290 --> 05:45.980
I mean this shield itself now consists of three layers.

05:45.980 --> 05:52.460
If we wanted each one of those layers across we could click and drag each one but that would be a bit

05:52.460 --> 05:55.110
too involved who was more than three.

05:55.160 --> 06:01.050
What we can do however if I go to file and go to open as layers.

06:01.190 --> 06:06.260
But before I do that let's make sure the destination image is selected first.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.100
There we go.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.470
Go file open as layers and go find my shield.

06:12.470 --> 06:18.590
In this case you see that the middle shield an outline have come across and the background that was

06:18.590 --> 06:19.650
turned off.

06:19.710 --> 06:26.670
We go here we can see middle shield outline and background says come across exactly how it was before.

06:26.800 --> 06:32.480
And this is of course very useful if you've got an image that's made up of a multitude of layers and

06:32.480 --> 06:39.200
you need them all to come across for further control over your image now the final way that you can

06:39.200 --> 06:45.430
get part of an image across from one image to another is by copying and pasting.

06:45.430 --> 06:51.470
Now if I just zoom in to my shield here we've got the outline selected as the active layer.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.970
If I go ahead and go edit copy.

06:55.650 --> 06:57.710
And go to my new image.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.540
I can go edit and paste.

07:00.780 --> 07:07.530
You'll notice that it has been pasted but as a floating selection it will deal with floating selections

07:07.860 --> 07:10.220
in greater detail later Ron.

07:10.600 --> 07:17.880
Bartz One of the important things is that if you do get a floating selection if you cut copy and paste

07:17.880 --> 07:24.850
or cut and paste something you cannot really do anything else in GIMP until you have anchored that layer.

07:24.990 --> 07:30.590
And this will catch a lot of people out especially if you tried cutting and pasting in the past.

07:30.660 --> 07:38.820
Now in order to anchor that layer as you probably guess you can go to layer and then anklebone we can

07:38.820 --> 07:41.610
see the shortcut key is control an H.

07:41.610 --> 07:48.450
You could right click on the liar an anchor of The Liar or indeed there's a little anchor button down

07:48.570 --> 07:50.900
at the very bottom of the layers tab.

07:51.090 --> 07:58.320
If you go ahead and anchor the floating layer it will then appear as a normal layer and that will enable

07:58.320 --> 08:01.910
you to start editing the rest of your file again.

08:02.100 --> 08:06.770
And that can be very confusing if you dont spot that it's a floating selection.

08:07.110 --> 08:13.350
Now the eagle eyed amongst you would have noticed that one of the things you can do here is go edit

08:13.800 --> 08:15.480
copy visible.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.110
And then go to our new image.

08:19.130 --> 08:22.670
And I'm going to get rid of a couple of the items here.

08:23.690 --> 08:26.750
I'm going to get rid of everything but just the background for the moment.

08:26.780 --> 08:34.060
Now if I go paste you can see that it's come as a floating selection like an anchor of that down.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.100
And now because of what the background turned off.

08:37.100 --> 08:37.820
There we go.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.190
That's come in.

08:39.290 --> 08:41.150
Exactly how it was before.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.540
Almost as if we're dragged and dropped it on.

08:43.730 --> 08:52.820
If I created a new layer first and then gone Edit Paste and then anchor that layer it comes across as

08:52.820 --> 08:54.440
I would expect it to.

08:54.500 --> 08:59.550
It's only because I pasted it directly onto the background that we had that white background again.

08:59.630 --> 09:03.270
But otherwise we got it in as an individual layer.

09:03.470 --> 09:11.070
Now the great thing about doing it this way is that our canvas size and layer size will be matched.

09:11.090 --> 09:20.140
So in this case 48 by 48 It had the same size dimensions as the original canvas does.

09:20.330 --> 09:28.550
So I go ahead and click okay here we got a 48 by 48 layer which means that when we go ahead and paste

09:29.460 --> 09:33.010
then anchor it comes in as we would expect it to.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.490
But there's no boundary size changes that need to be done.

09:38.540 --> 09:44.420
That's of course if that was something that was necessary to do to your image in the first place.

09:44.940 --> 09:52.150
One thing you can do of course is from your file system itself you could find something like Here file

09:52.240 --> 09:58.590
one and drag and drop that onto gimp and it will open it up as well.

09:58.590 --> 10:04.620
Now there is one thing to bear in mind when you do that and that is the fact that you cannot easily

10:04.620 --> 10:08.960
preview these without some third party applications.

10:08.970 --> 10:14.670
I won't go into that at the moment but certainly if we'd already condensed it into something that the

10:14.670 --> 10:21.270
operating system can see straight away like these p n gs that we exported earlier for instance this

10:21.270 --> 10:25.190
fire three I can drag that on and it will appear.

10:25.230 --> 10:28.110
Now you can see here this was one of my exports.

10:28.110 --> 10:35.070
So it is in fact larger than 48 By 40 I think we expanded to 64 by 64.

10:35.070 --> 10:41.130
But the actual layer is going to be 64 where 64 which means if I zoom out slightly and move it around

10:41.140 --> 10:46.440
what we can see the layer boundary is larger than the canvas but it does mean that none of this data

10:46.440 --> 10:47.090
is lost.

10:47.090 --> 10:50.770
The whole lot is there as we move it around.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.320
Perfect.

10:52.350 --> 10:55.820
So there are lots of options there for moving.

10:55.820 --> 11:02.340
Your image is about an between multiple guimpe files and I'm really looking forward to seeing what you

11:02.340 --> 11:09.450
guys do with this new found knowledge and you'll have an opportunity to test that knowledge in the next

11:09.450 --> 11:10.220
lecture.
