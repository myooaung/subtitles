Hello and welcome to using Panix for consistency in this lecture you're going to learn all about palettes

00:10.160 --> 00:16.400
what they're used for and at by the end of it you'll be creating your own palette like the one in front

00:16.400 --> 00:17.310
of us here.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.610
Hey and welcome back over into guimpe and this will be one of the first times that we're not actually

00:22.610 --> 00:27.140
going to create an image but we are going to create our own palette.

00:27.320 --> 00:34.490
Of course one of the first questions you might have is what is a palette a palette is simply a collection

00:34.490 --> 00:38.990
of colours whether they're completely random or they have a theme about them.

00:38.990 --> 00:46.400
We can use a palette to select individual colours really quickly so we can make the most out of our

00:46.450 --> 00:47.580
art.

00:47.780 --> 00:53.810
Of course at the moment we've got no access to palettes so let's go ahead and add pallets to our workspace.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.330
There are a couple of ways of doing this.

00:56.330 --> 01:01.550
First of all if you've still got the foreground and background colour tab open this lovely one here

01:01.550 --> 01:03.910
with multiple different selection methods.

01:04.040 --> 01:09.710
One of them at the very top is the fifth one along happens to be pallets and this is a selection of

01:09.740 --> 01:14.010
colours and that will have a specific palette set.

01:14.030 --> 01:19.070
I don't know what this one's called but we're fine now in a few moments and there are a couple of ways

01:19.070 --> 01:23.180
that we can add the palettes to our workspace.

01:23.180 --> 01:28.970
First one is going to Windows the menu at the top we're going to dockable dialogues and going down to

01:28.970 --> 01:30.370
where it says palettes.

01:30.440 --> 01:37.300
And if we click that it will add it to one of our set of tabs is added it here over on the right course

01:37.310 --> 01:42.920
we can pick up and move elsewhere the other way of adding them would be to use the little widget that's

01:42.920 --> 01:45.000
the at the end of all the tabs.

01:45.140 --> 01:50.000
And if you click on one of those it gives us the options add tab and we can go down to palettes and

01:50.000 --> 01:51.340
add it there as well.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.620
I don't want to open twice I'm just going to dismiss one of those.

01:54.620 --> 01:57.350
This one here will we finally win a close tab.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.260
And away it goes.

01:59.300 --> 02:04.220
So I'm going to detach the palettes tab from the right hand side so it's just sat in the middle so we

02:04.220 --> 02:06.480
can see what is going on.

02:06.470 --> 02:09.160
And I'm going to expand that so we can focus on it.

02:09.350 --> 02:14.900
So we have a series of pre made pallets here you can import more if you want.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.230
You can even make your own.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.350
But now we've added pallets to the workspace.

02:19.400 --> 02:26.240
We can select through them and we see we've got an absolute ton of different colours that we can pick

02:26.240 --> 02:26.650
from.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.720
And that is incredibly useful when you're working on a project.

02:30.740 --> 02:35.830
Now of course you can go ahead and edit these or even create your own.

02:37.270 --> 02:40.370
Okay so there are a couple of options as always.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.950
When it comes to editing our palates.

02:42.950 --> 02:48.970
Now if you know exactly what you're doing you can go ahead and edit them to your heart's content.

02:48.980 --> 02:55.280
However I'd always recommend either duplicating or creating a brand new palette to begin with.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.450
And if we look at the bottom of this palettes window.

02:59.380 --> 03:04.000
If we go all the way to the very bottom we can see that there are a couple of options there's an option

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
to edit the palette that you've currently got selected.

03:07.090 --> 03:14.170
I think this time is plasma and we can create a whole new palette we can duplicate the palette that

03:14.170 --> 03:19.580
is currently selected we can delete the currently selected palette and we can refresh the palette.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.490
If you've made any changes to it so we will update here as well.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.810
Atwood there are a couple of ways that you can go in and edit you can double click so if I double click

03:28.840 --> 03:34.040
plasma for instance we will end up with the palette editor becoming available.

03:34.180 --> 03:39.550
And of course we can drag that out or we can place it elsewhere and you will see the palettes Ed is

03:39.550 --> 03:45.460
very similar in how it looks to our foreground background colour tab.

03:45.720 --> 03:51.720
In fact we can actually manipulate how it looks over here by adjusting some of the settings.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.500
Now you can see at the top of the palette Ed there is a name.

03:55.510 --> 03:56.950
It's called plasma.

03:56.950 --> 04:00.440
In fact in this case we are just editing the plasma.

04:00.440 --> 04:06.250
The main ones are going to be careful here because I don't want to overwrite it in fact to be extra

04:06.250 --> 04:06.700
careful.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.770
Let's go ahead and duplicate it says.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.990
Close that down.

04:10.090 --> 04:15.940
I'm going to go to the duplicate button at the very bottom or indeed you can right click on plasma and

04:15.940 --> 04:17.420
it gives you a series of options.

04:17.410 --> 04:18.990
One of them is duplicate.

04:19.850 --> 04:24.550
So we go ahead and do that we get plasma copy now and click edit at the bottom.

04:24.610 --> 04:26.260
It's going to be bring up the palette editor.

04:26.260 --> 04:31.030
It was already open anyway and then drag that out switch just send so we don't you don't have to follow

04:31.030 --> 04:32.390
me we dragging it out.

04:32.530 --> 04:38.410
I have done that just so I can control how large it is on the screen basically.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.480
So our eyes are not distracted elsewhere so we're just focussed on that.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.630
Now we can see that I've made it far too big.

04:46.630 --> 04:48.280
See you guys can't see the bottom of it.

04:48.280 --> 04:48.970
There we go.

04:49.180 --> 04:54.670
So we have our palette editor here that mimics what the foreground background colour looks like at the

04:54.670 --> 04:55.240
bottom.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.320
We've got a series of options as do most windows here.

04:59.530 --> 05:02.780
And at the top we can see we've got the palette ed out.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.980
It's a plasma copy.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.670
So I'm going to call this plasma copy for testing.

05:10.930 --> 05:17.830
So I know it's a testing one and it can be binned afterwards if necessary and I can go about and change

05:17.830 --> 05:19.080
these if I want to.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.150
But let's change the view.

05:21.160 --> 05:28.450
First of all so we can zoom in and notice that this zooming in only affects the one in front of us.

05:28.510 --> 05:29.880
We can zoom out.

05:31.150 --> 05:34.160
And unfortunately you can't click and hold when it comes to that.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.980
We have a total zoom so it zooms everything in to fill the window.

05:38.980 --> 05:44.830
And this case it's made it very easy to select but be careful if you start editing the columns when

05:44.830 --> 05:50.020
you start editing the columns you can see that it changes what you can see in the foreground background

05:50.020 --> 05:51.150
colour as well.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.360
So I'm just going to increase that back up.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.450
So it looks nice again because that doesn't look so great.

05:56.470 --> 05:57.270
There we go.

05:57.580 --> 06:03.820
And of course once we've changed all of those we can go ahead and hit save and we'll save how it looks

06:04.200 --> 06:04.750
now.

06:04.900 --> 06:10.540
Each of these individual colours can also be named at the moment they're all named untitled if we have

06:10.540 --> 06:15.490
a look there's a little area of it you can names specific colours of I click this yellow one at the

06:15.490 --> 06:18.030
top and typed in the yellow.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.340
That's going to be very hard to categorize all of these.

06:21.340 --> 06:27.100
If you happen to have a specific colour scheme is useful to be able to know exactly what your colour

06:27.100 --> 06:27.690
is called.

06:27.700 --> 06:32.520
And if I call this one over here red won't we go ahead and select the yellow.

06:32.520 --> 06:38.390
It says a yellow one we go ahead and select the red it will say red.

06:38.410 --> 06:40.180
Nice and straightforward there.

06:40.180 --> 06:46.420
Now what happens if we actually want to go ahead and create our own palette absolutely fresh.

06:46.510 --> 06:51.070
In this case I'm going to actually get rid of this plasma copy for testing and we're going to create

06:51.070 --> 06:53.280
our very first palate.

06:53.380 --> 06:59.140
Now it may be tempting to hit the delete button at the bottom of the palette editor but that's for deleting

06:59.170 --> 07:04.060
a colour that you have placed so if I was to click on the yellow and click delete you will actually

07:04.060 --> 07:10.480
remove that colour from the pallor and you can see it shifted everything across and left a black space

07:10.520 --> 07:15.700
i.e. nothing in the lower right hand corner anywhere opening going to close that down.

07:15.700 --> 07:20.380
Now that window and just delete the plasma copy for testing.

07:20.380 --> 07:24.030
So the final thing here is to create a pallet of our very own.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.330
And this will be done in the palettes window or the pallet tab.

07:27.340 --> 07:34.360
If you happen to have it in tab form and at the bottom we've got editing at the palette and then the

07:34.360 --> 07:36.800
next one along creating a new palette.

07:36.820 --> 07:42.540
So when you go ahead and click on that and will get a palette editor up but it will be completely empty.

07:42.540 --> 07:43.480
I'm going to drag it out.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.930
So once again we can focus on it but for no other reason you may want to do this so you can focus it

07:48.970 --> 07:51.400
on your self as well.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.740
So how do we go ahead and add colours to this.

07:54.790 --> 07:57.370
Well along the bottom we have some further options.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.890
There's a new entry.

07:59.710 --> 08:05.770
Again it's that little pay per sheet with a folded over corner I think that's what it is.

08:06.010 --> 08:09.170
And that will add the foreground colour in this case yellow.

08:09.310 --> 08:13.890
And we see after clicking it appears and a whole line appears.

08:13.950 --> 08:21.190
Now if we wanted the background colour which is white at the moment we hold down control and click and

08:21.190 --> 08:22.860
that will appear as well.

08:23.020 --> 08:29.630
You can also click and drag the colour from the colour picker at the top here and drag it in.

08:29.770 --> 08:34.340
Or if you've got a different colour that you've selected are perhaps on your colour wheel.

08:34.630 --> 08:38.020
So let's go ahead and pick a green and drag that across.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.850
We can pop that in as well.

08:40.030 --> 08:43.510
Now eventually you're going to end up with a series of colours in this case.

08:43.510 --> 08:49.660
It's just for practice it can be any ones you want but often you will end up with themes or colours

08:49.660 --> 08:57.520
that group together or just your particular palette that you're going to use for any of your game icons.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.330
So what we can do here is just to see what this looks like in the palette view at the moment.

09:02.330 --> 09:09.670
Tall colours I might not want that I might just want it in one column and then we've got our four colours

09:10.000 --> 09:11.120
now in general.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.630
Four or five colours is a good number.

09:14.650 --> 09:20.890
Nice straightforward number to pick from when you're working with a basic colour scheme any more than

09:20.890 --> 09:23.790
that and you're pretty much just mixing between them.

09:23.890 --> 09:31.450
But if you have four or five main colours that can really help you create consistency within both an

09:31.450 --> 09:36.500
individual game icon or even a set of game icons as well.

09:37.360 --> 09:45.340
And this leads us nicely now onto a challenge and your challenge is to create your own palette of between

09:45.340 --> 09:47.140
five and 10 colours.

09:47.230 --> 09:51.420
Whether or not they have a theme at the moment that's entirely up to you.

09:51.430 --> 09:56.110
But at this present moment it's just to get the skill of creating your own palette.

09:56.170 --> 09:59.920
Later on we'll deal with colour fearing which colours go well together.

09:59.920 --> 10:06.180
If you've already got an intuition for that please do go ahead and create a pleasing palette.

10:06.190 --> 10:11.120
Take a screenshot of your palette once you've produced it and then finally share it with us.

10:11.120 --> 10:15.820
And if you have based it upon a theme Let us guess what that is.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.030
Pause a video now and give that a go.

10:21.010 --> 10:21.660
Okay guys.

10:21.670 --> 10:22.530
Welcome back.

10:22.540 --> 10:27.430
Let's go ahead and I'm going to create a palettes of my own.

10:27.430 --> 10:30.960
So I have at the moments two yellows are white and agree.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.860
Now that's no good.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.770
I do want to go for a theme myself.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.260
I'm probably going to go for fire.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.180
RA.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.800
So what do we need for fire.

10:41.860 --> 10:46.990
Well in this case I'm going to hit the Delete at the very bottom to delete the entries we currently

10:46.990 --> 10:52.040
have going to have to select them first in order to delete them and yellow yellows are a good start.

10:52.060 --> 10:54.100
I'm going to start completely afresh.

10:55.140 --> 11:01.290
And I'm going to call this fire at the very top is important to name things other ways.

11:01.310 --> 11:08.820
Later on you won't know what you were or why you even had this palette in the first place.

11:08.870 --> 11:11.470
So yellow is a good starting point.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.170
I would agree.

11:13.220 --> 11:18.200
So I'm going to just drag that in and drop it and I'm literally going to move round here and create

11:18.260 --> 11:21.350
a series of colours.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.840
Now I'm also going to slightly make it darker as well as we go around.

11:27.920 --> 11:35.090
Because I feel like fire itself as it gets sort of cooler it starts dropping off and then it starts

11:35.120 --> 11:39.470
turning a little bit to the purple side.

11:39.470 --> 11:42.800
All has made that bigger again so I can see what's going on.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.230
And I'm going to zoom in.

11:45.310 --> 11:49.330
So I've managed to put a darker colour in the wrong place.

11:49.330 --> 11:55.210
Can we drag and drop it elsewhere and just created a new one down there and this one here we can delete.

11:55.210 --> 11:59.650
So that's a nice transition in fact no it's not.

11:59.680 --> 12:05.940
That needs to go there and this needs to go there and then I need to do some tidying up.

12:05.950 --> 12:09.120
I really wasn't looking what I was doing when I was dragging and dropping those.

12:09.130 --> 12:12.070
And that can go in between.

12:12.070 --> 12:15.670
I'm really not doing well this in-between this year.

12:15.850 --> 12:21.710
So this is great because it's allowing us to practice using the guimpe interface.

12:21.730 --> 12:28.480
And maybe if I was just paying a little more attention to my colours as I was going through and adding

12:28.480 --> 12:30.690
them I was very haphazardly adding them.

12:30.700 --> 12:37.090
You know what I'm just going to delete that and that and that to me is a good transition.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.300
One two three four five six.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.880
Now I'm going to use my last set of colours.

12:43.900 --> 12:51.070
I'm not going to go any more for more of a blooey twinge because I want to be able to create some smoke

12:51.130 --> 12:53.790
as well so blue E Grey.

12:54.740 --> 12:55.920
Dark.

12:58.010 --> 13:04.430
And you know I haven't added white when a fire burns really hot.

13:04.430 --> 13:05.840
It is bright white.

13:05.990 --> 13:09.840
Now one could argue that black and white are incredibly accessible.

13:09.840 --> 13:16.760
I remember earlier on we can hover over our colour foreground and background colours and it just hit

13:16.790 --> 13:19.480
the D and white and black comes straight back.

13:19.610 --> 13:22.130
Then we can toggle X between the two.

13:22.130 --> 13:29.060
So in terms of black and white I think we can excuse them from our colour palettes that we're creating

13:29.060 --> 13:33.350
here because they're really easily accessible regardless.

13:33.350 --> 13:40.800
So I've got nine colours in there are 11 really if you can black and white by have nine colours in there.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.260
How does it look when it's selected in our palette.

13:44.270 --> 13:45.800
I quite like that.

13:45.820 --> 13:49.270
Does it look like with two columns that's kind of useful as well.

13:49.290 --> 13:53.590
Aha of course three columns for nine gives us a nine by nine grid.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.860
I like the way that looks.

13:54.860 --> 14:03.860
I'm going to save that and for fullness I could go through and label them yellow or heats or ember's

14:03.860 --> 14:05.680
or something along those lines.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.460
But in this case I don't know how I'm going to use each colour just yet.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.530
I just like the colour scheme that I've got there.

14:12.530 --> 14:15.250
