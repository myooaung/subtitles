Hey everyone and welcome back.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.390
In this lecture we're going to be talking about moving selections and why you would want to do that.

00:11.600 --> 00:18.440
Well you can think of a selection almost like a stencil that you can reuse in different positions.

00:18.440 --> 00:25.010
But of course once you've made a selection it is sometimes very difficult to remake the same selection

00:25.040 --> 00:25.890
again.

00:25.970 --> 00:32.010
So using that same selection and moving it to another location can have its benefits.

00:32.060 --> 00:36.590
First of all course we're going to need an image to get going some going to create myself a new image

00:36.950 --> 00:41.150
at 32 by 32 minute zoom all the way in.

00:41.180 --> 00:42.020
There we go.

00:42.020 --> 00:48.590
Now of course there are going to be several ways of generating your particular selection itself.

00:48.680 --> 00:55.940
In this example I'm going to use the circle the Ellipse selection tool and generate myself a perfect

00:55.940 --> 00:56.860
circle.

00:56.870 --> 01:01.790
I'm going to recreate something like the moon and I'm going to move the selection about now obviously

01:01.790 --> 01:02.770
with the Ellipse select.

01:02.770 --> 01:07.430
I've got the option to move around the selection as I'm making it.

01:07.490 --> 01:08.000
There we go.

01:08.030 --> 01:12.980
Now fills up most of the area so that is obviously one way of moving it.

01:13.070 --> 01:19.160
But once we start using the Selection we're going to lose the ability to move it around like that anymore.

01:19.340 --> 01:25.190
So I'm going to go to my layers and create a new layer and I'm going to call this I'm going to do another

01:25.190 --> 01:25.770
moon.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.210
I like the moon.

01:27.460 --> 01:30.030
I'm going to find in a yellowy colour.

01:30.080 --> 01:35.420
Initially I can obviously refine this later and I'm going to go to the paint brush tool and because

01:35.450 --> 01:40.880
we've now gone to a different talk you can see the manipulation widgets that were around the Ellipse

01:40.880 --> 01:42.410
selector that have now gone.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.360
I'm just going to colour that in yellow as you'd expect that's now coloured in.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.810
Now I have deliberately when I was doing that left it on the tool options and he Alea it.

01:53.960 --> 01:58.600
So I get a slightly fuzzy edge when I'm colouring that in.

01:58.730 --> 02:02.830
So now that we've got this particular tool here what else can we do.

02:03.110 --> 02:07.800
Well what we can do is we can invert that and use it as a mask.

02:07.820 --> 02:12.710
So I'm going to invert that now and after I've inverted it I'm going to create myself a new layer and

02:12.710 --> 02:15.660
I'm going to call this the Moon mask.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.050
Oh the moon mashed.

02:18.050 --> 02:18.410
There we go.

02:18.410 --> 02:25.730
Moon Musk now with the inverted selection I can go in and I can colour it in any colour for the sake

02:25.730 --> 02:26.350
of argument.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.010
I'm going to colour in black for the moment.

02:28.020 --> 02:30.830
I'm going to use the fill tool just to fill that in.

02:30.830 --> 02:36.190
So I've now got a circle and I've also got a mask.

02:36.260 --> 02:41.600
Now I'm going to create another layer and I'm going to call this the terminate or where we go at the

02:41.600 --> 02:45.170
basically the black end where where it's light and where it's not.

02:45.170 --> 02:47.030
Now I'm not going to go all the way down to black.

02:47.030 --> 02:51.690
I'm going to go to my pallet itself and select a dark grey.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.250
Now with the selection I'm going to invert that selection again control and I.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.970
And I'm going to move that selection.

02:59.090 --> 03:04.090
So we've got a selection now that we can use again in order to have an effect.

03:04.100 --> 03:09.160
Now if I go to my move tool and start moving.

03:09.200 --> 03:14.360
What will happen is the moon the active layer will move instead and undo that.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.690
Of course if you grab the mask layer that I've created.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.800
Well that will move instead as well.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.040
So how do we move this selection.

03:22.040 --> 03:29.480
Well if we go to the tool options we will see that there is a couple of options when it comes to moving

03:29.490 --> 03:30.370
at the very top.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.570
It's currently selected on layer.

03:32.630 --> 03:37.270
Now we change that to the Red Square which is the selection move tool.

03:37.430 --> 03:42.710
Now we can grab and move our selection and I can move that across ever so slightly.

03:42.710 --> 03:50.480
So maybe here and then with the Terminator selected I can go back to my paint brush tool and paint that

03:50.480 --> 03:51.210
in.

03:51.680 --> 03:58.280
Now that might be a little bit strong so I can come out and instead of doing that perhaps use the airbrush

03:58.280 --> 03:59.860
tool in starting here.

04:00.630 --> 04:01.140
There we go.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.450
Let's have it a bit more like that as we go.

04:04.530 --> 04:07.470
Now I've got my legs in the wrong order here.

04:07.500 --> 04:14.330
So instead of having my terminator beneath the moon mask is a barb so I can move that up.

04:14.370 --> 04:18.320
And there we go we've got a nice Chris edge in looking at my icon at the top.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.990
Well that is almost there but not quite.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.400
What else can we do.

04:23.400 --> 04:30.600
Well we can grow the selection itself so that this circle that I have is the original selection is slightly

04:30.600 --> 04:33.750
larger because that is too strong of a cut off.

04:33.750 --> 04:39.300
In fact with the leap that Terminator and I deem it rubbish and make it different one time I go to my

04:39.300 --> 04:45.720
selection I'm going to grow my selection by how many pixels I don't want to try five and then grabbing

04:45.720 --> 04:51.150
the move tool making sure its on selection move that a cross that looks a bit better.

04:52.490 --> 04:56.770
Im going to go back in and grow it by another five and then move its cross.

04:56.810 --> 05:03.380
Yes I'm liking that not as a strong curve moving across I'm going to use my airbrush tool again and

05:03.380 --> 05:04.370
come in.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.290
There we go.

05:07.290 --> 05:12.110
And of course I just have the hold still in one place in order for that to work.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.650
And I'm liking how that's looking.

05:14.730 --> 05:23.790
What I'm not liking of course is the it's such a harsh boundary between my selection and what I'm trying

05:23.790 --> 05:24.570
to paint on.

05:24.600 --> 05:32.340
So I'm going to go and blur the edge of my selection and we can do that with the Select Tool and with

05:32.340 --> 05:36.520
the feather this will blur the border so it's a bit smoother.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.640
How many pixels.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.140
Well probably three or so.

05:40.530 --> 05:48.300
Now when we come in and do that you can see that I've now got access to more of the area that's not

05:48.300 --> 05:51.430
selected in fact three pixels are now available.

05:51.450 --> 05:58.470
I'm going to feather that again by in a further three pixels and we can see it doesn't go any further

05:58.470 --> 06:01.800
than those three pixels so it's not an additive process.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.200
It is exactly three pixels.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.780
So if I go to Feather here if I wanted it six I'd have to type in six.

06:07.890 --> 06:15.660
And now that should go out a little further as we can see here all the way out to the sixth pixel from

06:15.660 --> 06:16.730
our selection.

06:16.830 --> 06:20.030
And that itself looks much much better.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.600
And now our loads are things you could use selections like this for.

06:23.610 --> 06:26.880
So we've taken a general shape like a circle.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.370
Of course you could use that for a drop shadow and several other things as well.

06:32.370 --> 06:38.450
Thinking outside the box and being creative with it can get you some really amazing results.

06:38.700 --> 06:45.270
So we have grown this selection now and one of the things that I might have done by growing it is destroy

06:45.270 --> 06:45.900
the selection.

06:45.900 --> 06:51.840
Let's see if that has happened so I'm going to go to some mice electable now and this time shrink it

06:52.070 --> 06:54.750
and I'm going to shrink it back down by six pixels.

06:54.750 --> 07:02.370
And yes you can see here there's not much of it left unfortunately when it's expanded out to the layer

07:02.400 --> 07:05.700
boundary it has effectively destroyed itself.

07:05.700 --> 07:10.680
We've we've seen this before and there's really no way of recovering that said something to bear in

07:10.680 --> 07:12.690
mind that if you expand it too much.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.450
Of course you may run into these issues now.

07:15.480 --> 07:21.990
I remember when I was creating my initial selection which I can now go and do again and it was just

07:21.990 --> 07:29.070
these adjusted in one on each side in fact a clip probably done that by just grabbing the two opposite

07:29.070 --> 07:31.150
and there we go that's the same selection again.

07:31.170 --> 07:35.340
So being able to recreate your selection is quite important.

07:35.520 --> 07:41.070
But what I want to show you now is of course I've shown you how to grow the selection we can of course

07:41.130 --> 07:43.010
shrink the selection as well.

07:43.050 --> 07:44.220
Oh I missed.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.420
They're clicking on one.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.590
One place and missing my selection.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.020
There we go.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.350
So we can go to the select menu and go down to shrink.

07:52.530 --> 07:57.180
And when we do that we get a similar How much do you want to shrink it by and transferring it by in

07:57.180 --> 08:04.560
this case six pixels and then on another layer I could for instance make a and an error at a high lights.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.020
Now this might be a bull's eye or something else that you're making.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.880
And I'm going to go for a light grey here then go to the paint brush still and just fill that in.

08:13.730 --> 08:14.270
So there we go.

08:14.270 --> 08:17.710
There's lots of options that you can do with the selection tool.

08:17.750 --> 08:22.160
And again I've got feathering turned on here because I want it to be slightly hazy.

08:22.310 --> 08:26.110
If I did not want that one I had to make the original selection remember.

08:26.210 --> 08:30.350
I would have had to go to my tool options and turn off that anti-aliasing.

08:30.530 --> 08:33.560
And we've got feather edges on top of there as well.

08:33.560 --> 08:38.740
If we wanted to if we turn that on we get the radius that we had before.

08:38.810 --> 08:43.850
When we're modifying the selection we can actually have a feathered radius from the very beginning as

08:43.880 --> 08:44.490
well.

08:44.570 --> 08:51.260
If you want to and that about wraps up this lecture on using selection tools manipulating them moving

08:51.260 --> 08:58.130
them and using them more or less like a stencil and using them to generate new imagery and we'll get

08:58.130 --> 08:59.770
to test your knowledge shortly.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.500
But that'll be over in the next lecture.
