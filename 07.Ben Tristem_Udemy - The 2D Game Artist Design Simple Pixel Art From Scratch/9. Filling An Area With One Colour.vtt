00:04.500 --> 00:08.970
Hey by the end of this lecture you're going to be able to use the bucket tool in order to fill areas

00:09.000 --> 00:11.420
either with a solid colour or a pattern.

00:11.430 --> 00:12.470
Let's crack on.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.360
Hello and welcome back.

00:14.370 --> 00:18.750
In this lecture we're going to be talking about the bucket tool that is the tool that we're going to

00:18.750 --> 00:26.340
use in order to fill in an area with just one colour or indeed a pattern as we see in a few moments.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.670
So first of all we need to find the bucket all.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.650
And there are a couple of ways of doing that.

00:30.650 --> 00:33.240
We can select it in our tool box itself.

00:33.390 --> 00:38.400
And if we find it here's the bucket it looks like it's just tipping over and a bit of paint coming out.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.070
So and we can see there that the short cut is shift and be.

00:41.430 --> 00:47.420
And we can also find it in the Tools menu under paint tools and we can see it's right at the top there.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.530
Bucket fill.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.680
And we can also see a useful list of the other options as well.

00:53.940 --> 00:57.690
And all this is useless of course unless we got ourselves an image.

00:57.750 --> 01:02.430
So I'm going to make sure I go to file new create a 32 by 32 image.

01:02.610 --> 01:04.650
And there we go we're ready to go.

01:04.770 --> 01:09.050
I'm going to zoom in we control shift in Jay so I can see everything we've currently got the airbrush

01:09.060 --> 01:14.190
tool selected some going to go ahead and click on the Phil talk.

01:14.670 --> 01:19.410
Let's go back over to our image and just click the once and it should fill with the foreground colour

01:19.470 --> 01:20.280
the black.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.140
And it does brilliant.

01:22.140 --> 01:25.750
Now we can talk well between the foreground and background colours.

01:26.010 --> 01:31.860
If we have a look at the tool options beneath the mode and capacity we have filled type and we can see

01:31.860 --> 01:33.520
it says control next to it.

01:33.660 --> 01:37.830
So there is a modifier to switch between the foreground and background colours.

01:37.830 --> 01:42.480
If I toggle background colour and come back over to our image and click it will go white.

01:42.510 --> 01:45.860
And if we go back to foreground colour it will go black selects useful.

01:45.870 --> 01:48.740
If youre filling in two colours.

01:48.750 --> 01:54.870
Now if you hold down control you will see that toggle actually switches between foreground and background

01:54.870 --> 01:57.360
colour so I can hold down control it will do the background colour.

01:57.480 --> 02:02.640
I can let go of control and click and it will do the foreground colour and that will speed up your workflow

02:02.640 --> 02:04.780
when you are working with the buckets.

02:04.980 --> 02:09.810
Now if we take a look back over at the tool options we see underneath foreground colour and background

02:09.810 --> 02:12.810
colour field we have pattern fill.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.390
We go ahead and click on that and come over.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.540
We will see that it fills in a pattern in this case.

02:18.540 --> 02:19.770
This pattern is called Pine.

02:19.770 --> 02:25.860
If you click on the little image it gives you a selection of different patterns and a cross on the right

02:25.860 --> 02:26.400
hand side.

02:26.400 --> 02:32.460
Here we see that I've got a tab called patterns if you dont have one you'll have that at it with the

02:32.520 --> 02:34.950
menu just to the right of those.

02:35.010 --> 02:39.150
And if we going to patterns you see it's exactly the same and you can pick different patterns.

02:39.150 --> 02:43.470
I'm going to stick with pine for the moment because it's going to enable me to demonstrate the next

02:43.470 --> 02:47.370
thing I want to cover which is the affected area.

02:47.370 --> 02:52.950
And if we have a look at the tall options you will see the affected area also has a modifier key shift.

02:52.950 --> 02:58.390
And if we press shift it will toggle between one and the other this one and this one.

02:58.410 --> 03:03.630
So the first one that is selected by default is feel similar colours.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.020
Now at the moment if we go ahead and click nothing will happen.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.940
And that's simply because we've got it set on pattern.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.780
If we go and select foreground colour I'm going to change the colour from black to something a bit more

03:15.780 --> 03:16.290
vibrant.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.250
I'm going to go with green.

03:18.270 --> 03:19.650
Very vibrant there.

03:19.770 --> 03:26.490
And I'm going to go back to the Tools Options Now Phil similar colours is going to be affected if things

03:26.550 --> 03:27.600
have a similar colour.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.050
Now that sounds like I'm just repeating myself there but we'll see.

03:31.230 --> 03:36.030
As I click through here anything that's a similar colour gets filled in and you will find that when

03:36.030 --> 03:41.130
you click on some places it's just a single narrow band and when you click on others it fills in more

03:41.130 --> 03:43.620
of that area and you may be wondering why.

03:43.830 --> 03:48.290
Well it means that those colours are similar enough that it's going to start filling across them.

03:48.300 --> 03:54.510
But notice it hasn't gone the same colour it's actually darker or lighter or faded in the middle just

03:54.510 --> 03:56.260
like it was before.

03:56.280 --> 04:01.260
So GIMP has done a crossover between the orange and the lighter orange and made it a green in the lighter

04:01.260 --> 04:06.240
green with kind of an orange tint because of course we're going over the top of that.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.610
Now the threshold between those can be controlled at the threshold.

04:11.640 --> 04:18.930
Dial and quite simply put the higher the threshold the more dissimilar the colours can be when you're

04:18.930 --> 04:20.310
filling stuff in.

04:20.310 --> 04:25.010
So if I set that down at zero I'm going I select the area.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.890
Press control in a and then type in zero rather than trying to slide that down.

04:29.910 --> 04:34.000
Now it means that this orange line going down here.

04:34.080 --> 04:39.410
Notice how it doesn't fill in the top but we have to select that because there's a threshold of zero

04:39.420 --> 04:49.020
so if it's not exactly the same then it will not work if we set up to 100 percent which is 2 5 5 you

04:49.060 --> 04:53.940
will notice that the threshold means that if I click it will fill in the entire image because it means

04:53.940 --> 04:58.620
that all colours in this case are similar to everything else.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.880
If we lower that back down to something sensible.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.420
Oh I've done that before.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.430
If you sometimes you will accidentally click and drag your tabs out.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.430
Not a problem we just put it back in.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.310
Riego.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.370
And if we have a pattonville that's put that pattern back again.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.370
Now we've got an option here to tone this down a little Let's go back down to 49 going to foreground

05:22.370 --> 05:27.740
colour and click that and you see that it fills in most of that because most of that of much of those

05:27.740 --> 05:29.630
colours are actually similar.

05:29.630 --> 05:35.090
And we can see that there are a few bits that are left out and a few bits that are slightly faded.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.300
But of course if we clicked again it would fill that in solid.

05:38.300 --> 05:46.700
Now the Browns to the very left are too dissimilar to actually be filled in from this green itself.

05:46.700 --> 05:51.390
Now it's the values underneath that make up that green that are controlling that.

05:51.470 --> 05:55.220
Now of course if we did want the whole thing to be filled in and we didn't want to mess around with

05:55.220 --> 05:59.580
the threshold we could change that by going back to the affected area.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.810
And so selecting feel whole selection when we go ahead and click it will just fill everything in that's

06:05.840 --> 06:10.070
on the current layer regardless of anything else that's in there.

06:10.070 --> 06:15.620
So if we go back and just pattern fill and come back and foreground colour fill it will just fill everything

06:15.620 --> 06:21.890
in regardless of the threshold setting in fact when you have fill hole selection the find similar colours

06:21.890 --> 06:24.310
in the threshold you cannot adjust them.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.720
It disables that functionality.

06:27.540 --> 06:33.720
Now there is a final option here which is finding similar colours and this will change how the fill

06:33.720 --> 06:34.590
tool works.

06:34.710 --> 06:37.630
And these two are quite fun to play with.

06:37.860 --> 06:41.870
But again they do not work unless you have Phil similar collars turned on some women.

06:41.910 --> 06:45.930
Phil similar colours and get a pattern fill again so we can play.

06:46.110 --> 06:50.310
And the first one is all about transparency so Phil transparent areas.

06:50.310 --> 06:55.650
Now we don't have any transparency at the moment so let's go ahead and create a new layer and we will

06:55.650 --> 06:56.290
see.

06:56.490 --> 06:59.310
I'm going to call this trans test.

07:00.140 --> 07:05.870
We've now got a layover is in just full transparent so let's go ahead with the filter.

07:05.870 --> 07:08.800
We've got Phil similar colours Phil transparent areas.

07:08.810 --> 07:13.090
We've got the tran's test layered turned on and active.

07:13.150 --> 07:15.390
Every click we'll find that it fills in.

07:15.410 --> 07:19.970
Now we've got pattern fill at the moment I'm going to go back to foreground colour fill and click that

07:20.270 --> 07:22.590
and it fills in the entire area.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.490
Of course that is not going to be transparent.

07:25.490 --> 07:30.570
So with that layer selected them to hit the delete key that's made it's cleared that layer.

07:30.830 --> 07:36.440
And now we can see if I turn off the background layer it is the transparent layer and that will now

07:36.440 --> 07:38.230
fill in.

07:38.270 --> 07:43.940
However if we have a delay I am just going to create just a new layer straightaway trans test that's

07:43.940 --> 07:47.280
fine that's exactly what we're doing is labelled it number one.

07:47.300 --> 07:54.200
Now I'm going to disable the viewing of trans test the first one we did and now turn off full transparent

07:54.190 --> 07:54.490
measures.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.980
And I bet you already guess what's going to happen.

07:56.990 --> 07:57.920
Absolutely nothing.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.450
It will not fill.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.080
If it's a transparent area.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.570
Now how can we have a bit more fun with this.

08:05.570 --> 08:13.670
Well we can use sample merged and this enables feeling based upon current visible layers that is important

08:13.680 --> 08:15.570
they have to be on and visible.

08:15.620 --> 08:20.690
Now at the moment we've just got this tran's test and we've got a trans test Anthony that I'm going

08:20.690 --> 08:27.410
to change this to blob because I'm going to make a blob on the screen I'm going to clear the layer make

08:27.410 --> 08:28.400
sure I can see it.

08:28.430 --> 08:31.940
I want to clear the air with the delete key so it's back to not being able to be seen.

08:31.940 --> 08:37.190
I'm going to grab the pencil tool and I think it's set to a larger size Yes it's set to 20 pixels.

08:37.190 --> 08:41.110
I'm literally going to make a blob on the page nothing else.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.250
Now that's done.

08:42.350 --> 08:45.920
If we go up to tran's test one making sure that's selected.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.280
Go back to the fill tool and let's pick a different colour.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.490
What goes well with green will red.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.550
Why not.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.640
And let's go back to the tool options and make sure that sample merge has a tic on it.

08:57.650 --> 09:07.570
Now if we go ahead and click in the BLOB itself we will find that it fills in only the blob in red.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.950
That's kahney use.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.520
What else can we do.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.890
Well we can't fill in the transparent layer yet.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.660
I'm going to go ahead and find a different colour.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.590
I'm going to go for blue.

09:15.620 --> 09:16.680
Red green and blue.

09:16.910 --> 09:19.570
And then tick fill transparently.

09:19.580 --> 09:25.040
So not only is it going to look at the other active layers to see what it can fill in but it's also

09:25.280 --> 09:28.700
going to only fill areas that are similar.

09:28.730 --> 09:35.960
And if it's alferd out if there's transparency it will now fill in the transparency but not touch anything

09:35.960 --> 09:36.740
else.

09:36.740 --> 09:42.380
Now this I put on the same layer some can undo that for the moment just for full demonstration.

09:42.440 --> 09:48.230
I'm going to create a new layer again again tran's test is absolutely fine and I'm going to click in

09:48.230 --> 09:55.670
the transparent area and we'll see that now as I turn these off its left the area that was on a completely

09:55.670 --> 09:58.350
different layer empty.

09:58.430 --> 10:02.170
And what we have essentially done here is created a mask.

10:02.180 --> 10:07.390
The area that is now blue is covering the rest of our image it mythili there's nothing here yet.

10:07.400 --> 10:12.540
If we were to go ahead and turn the background image back on you would see only the background image.

10:12.550 --> 10:18.320
But where it's not masked off by that blue layer that wraps up an overview of the buckets all quite

10:18.320 --> 10:18.770
well.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.920
And of course that leads us nicely onto a challenge.

10:22.130 --> 10:27.130
Okay so your challenge is going to be to create four separate images.

10:27.200 --> 10:33.270
Now the first one to get your teeth into filling something in is just to create a simple flag.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.820
It can be made up one it can be a based upon a real one.

10:36.830 --> 10:37.940
It's entirely up to you.

10:37.940 --> 10:41.630
I'll show you some examples in a moment as to what I'm going to do.

10:41.720 --> 10:48.940
But you guys of course can take your own path if you want to create an offensive weapon for a game.

10:49.130 --> 10:57.470
Create a defensive weapon Icom and then use the fill tool to create a mask for one of your images as

10:57.470 --> 10:58.420
well.

10:59.030 --> 11:04.550
And finally of course I want to see what you guys have been up to so share your four designs at 64 by

11:04.550 --> 11:06.710
64 over in the discussions.

11:07.440 --> 11:13.320
And in front of us here we have four examples I've got my simple flag on the left an offensive weapon.

11:13.320 --> 11:19.920
In this case a sword of course you could pick an axe a bow a gun anything you would like to there.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.600
And then I've got a defensive weapon.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.930
I've used the pattern fill there as you can see and I've created myself a shield.

11:26.040 --> 11:31.500
And then finally I've got a moon I call it werewolf power or whatever you like.

11:31.590 --> 11:38.160
But that moon there has been made with a mask around it so the edge is nice and Chris pulls a video

11:38.160 --> 11:39.950
now and give that a go.

11:41.690 --> 11:42.920
Okay guys welcome back.

11:42.950 --> 11:48.720
Let's now go over into game and go through what I've done to create my examples.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.700
Okay so I have already finished off creating my flag.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.630
And in this one I'm going to jump straight to the masking one.

11:55.760 --> 12:01.190
I'm going to attempt to do a moon a nice a simple one nothing too detailed.

12:01.330 --> 12:01.900
Hmm.

12:01.910 --> 12:06.200
And in this case I need a black background to begin with.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
I've already got a background.

12:08.210 --> 12:13.600
When I started the new file I could have said it black straight away but since I'm already got the filter

12:13.620 --> 12:17.030
all in front of me bam background colours done.

12:17.330 --> 12:25.220
Now in this particular case I want to make a cut out of the moon initially and then from there fill

12:25.220 --> 12:26.610
in with the rest of it.

12:26.780 --> 12:34.250
So I'm going create a new layer and that's going to be my moon and I'm going to have the moon a full

12:34.250 --> 12:35.490
moon initially.

12:35.750 --> 12:36.680
So it's go ahead.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.160
I'm going to grab my pink brush tool.

12:39.350 --> 12:43.900
I'm going to set the sides of that paint brush tool to 32.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.510
So it's the entire image width.

12:46.780 --> 12:52.220
And we can see that it's there and I'm just going to click a couple of times to get a nice moon that

12:52.220 --> 12:55.460
fills up the screen quite well.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.360
Perfect.

12:56.420 --> 13:03.860
The next layer I'm going to do I'm going to use the filter all to make a moon mask.

13:03.950 --> 13:10.790
And what this is going to do it's gonna mean that in a moment when I start painting I won't need to

13:10.790 --> 13:13.290
worry about the areas that are black.

13:13.550 --> 13:16.570
And you'll see this work in a few moments I'll turn it on and off.

13:16.580 --> 13:22.010
So you can see the different effect because I want this border to remain totally black.

13:22.010 --> 13:22.970
So I have.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.030
What have we got set.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.000
I need it to fill transparent areas.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.150
Sample merge is absolutely fine that's what I wanted to do.

13:29.270 --> 13:34.640
And just a reminder that sample merge will have a look at everything that's visible to every layer that's

13:34.640 --> 13:35.360
visible.

13:35.360 --> 13:40.540
And then in this case feel based upon everything that it can see.

13:40.790 --> 13:46.580
I'm going to turn off the background layer because I don't need that layer when it's coming to this

13:46.750 --> 13:48.220
feel transparent errors.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.870
I need more areas and I need that set to black.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.830
Now we fill it in.

13:53.840 --> 14:01.520
We have this outline which is brilliant because this means I can use that as a mask which means that

14:01.520 --> 14:06.800
no matter what happens I won't be able to draw over the top of this providing.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.040
That's at the very top.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.590
So I'm going to create a new layer and call it Moonshadow.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.300
So this is a great example here how building it up is non-destructive.

14:15.300 --> 14:19.880
Now Moonshadow is at the very top I'm going to lower it down so the moon mask is always at the very

14:19.880 --> 14:20.590
top.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.360
Now the Moonshadow I am going to use an airbrush to do this.

14:24.410 --> 14:28.300
That's a bit too small I don't want a sharp Cresent like that.

14:28.310 --> 14:34.430
I want it to be a bit straighter So I'm going to increase the size of my brush here not to 900 but to

14:34.460 --> 14:36.210
something like 66.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.970
And this is because I've practiced.

14:37.970 --> 14:42.140
I know that's roughly the right size and I've zoomed down to a little now what's the foreground colour.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.820
It's going to be a black brain.

14:44.840 --> 14:49.730
I'm going to turn on the background again just so I can see it in its total.

14:49.730 --> 14:55.880
Now the reason I'm using the airbrush is so I can click and hold and when I reach about the right area

14:55.910 --> 14:58.260
I can just turn it off and just stop.

14:58.620 --> 15:03.140
I like I like how that's looking I'm going to add a little more darkness to one side.

15:03.140 --> 15:08.300
Now the final thing I'm going to do is make the moon a slightly yellow tinge So I'm going to go ahead

15:08.360 --> 15:13.710
and add in a new layer and are going to call it moon.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.950
And of course you could change this to a red or you could change something else.

15:17.970 --> 15:22.130
Now with the moon tint I am going to set it to a yellow.

15:22.130 --> 15:27.990
And again using the air brush I'm going to make sure my cursor is right in the centre otherwise.

15:28.020 --> 15:32.690
Well that's where the main flow comes from unchecking to click a couple of times now you will notice

15:32.750 --> 15:39.500
that as I've done that it's made the dark area around yellow as well a very dark yellow bellies still

15:39.500 --> 15:41.210
made it yellow nonetheless.

15:42.010 --> 15:48.010
Now because I turned on the moon mask if I turn that back on you'll see that it makes the edge of the

15:48.010 --> 15:48.380
moon.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.540
Sharp once more.

15:49.690 --> 15:50.960
So that's like a hazy night.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.660
And this is a shot.

15:53.090 --> 15:59.090
And now if we have a quick look at our moon in the thumbnail that looks pretty good.

15:59.110 --> 16:00.730
Now the moon shadow itself.

16:00.730 --> 16:02.790
Does it matter if it's at a different place.

16:02.830 --> 16:04.900
Yes it makes a huge difference.

16:04.900 --> 16:09.930
So again the shadow I'm going to turn up or rather put it higher up the chain.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.240
So we've got the moon mask on top of everything.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.780
The shadow underneath that the tent the main bulk of the body and the background.

16:16.930 --> 16:19.590
Now the background doesn't need to be there because it's.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.770
If I turn it off you can see it doesn't look quite as good.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.740
If I turn on.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.390
Much much better.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.910
Okay so I'm going to go ahead here and start making our shield.

16:30.070 --> 16:37.360
Now we don't know too many tools as of yet but there is a way that I can make it relatively straightforward.

16:37.360 --> 16:47.560
So I'm going to start with a new layer on my image and I'm going to basically turn the size of my brush

16:47.710 --> 16:51.300
up until it roughly fills the area.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.490
Now I can't see my brush.

16:52.510 --> 16:56.560
I'm going to turn on the outside again and we can see what's going on and to make sure it's the colour

16:56.590 --> 17:02.200
is black going to make sure I'm on my own outline layer and I need to draw a circle so let's just go

17:02.200 --> 17:02.620
ahead.

17:02.620 --> 17:03.990
I'm happy with that.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.050
It doesn't matter that it's not smack bang in the centre.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.560
That's fine for the moment.

17:08.560 --> 17:16.150
Now we need to go ahead to the eraser at all at this point and find a size that will erase but remembering

17:16.150 --> 17:23.500
to have a hard edge turned on when we do that we should end up with a nice outline for Shield.

17:23.530 --> 17:29.290
And then finally I'm going to make sure it's the eraser tools on one pixel and it's on hard edge and

17:29.290 --> 17:32.780
I'm going to go round now and just need to lay it up so it looks a bit more crisp.

17:32.980 --> 17:39.090
Okay so I have the outline all sorted there and I'm going to go to a new layer and call it a shield.

17:39.090 --> 17:43.370
In this case the main bulk of it is go to the fill.

17:43.510 --> 17:45.640
Now I could actually do a pattern fill.

17:45.710 --> 17:49.550
Let's see if there's anything that fits that is pretty cool.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.860
I don't think I need to do anything else as a shield.

17:52.130 --> 17:58.100
Our Shield needs something in the middle he supports and is going to call it middle.

17:58.330 --> 18:00.220
They probably have a technical name.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.930
I don't have a clue what it is.

18:02.200 --> 18:08.240
And again because this is built up in layers it enables us to adjust it left right and centre.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.960
Let's go back to the pencil tool.

18:09.970 --> 18:11.830
I want this to be absolute.

18:11.830 --> 18:15.120
I've just adjusted it roughly.

18:15.160 --> 18:15.780
Plonk.

18:15.970 --> 18:16.550
Yeah.

18:16.810 --> 18:20.230
I like fat changes to white.

18:23.310 --> 18:23.910
I can see it.

18:23.910 --> 18:24.200
Yeah.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.250
I'm happy with that.

18:25.250 --> 18:30.150
Now I need because I've made this coloured pattern on the edge.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.770
I need something else that fits in the middle here.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.090
Absolutely fine.

18:34.170 --> 18:36.420
Now let's have a look again for the film.

18:36.420 --> 18:41.730
So in options is there anything that roughly Sue turse that one there.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.140
Let's see what that looks like.

18:43.230 --> 18:44.720
That's perfect for me.

18:45.060 --> 18:45.700
Okay.

18:45.780 --> 18:46.510
There we go.

18:46.530 --> 18:49.290
Managed to make some quite detailed objects there.

18:49.350 --> 18:53.780
Now these because they're separate it does enable us at any point to go well background.

18:53.820 --> 18:58.340
Well shall we have a straight green background.

18:58.390 --> 19:01.800
And you just plonk things in or it you to use the wrong tool.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.760
Remember you've got foreground colour and pattern there we get.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.880
So that enables us to go to our background layer and.

19:11.870 --> 19:17.900
Fill it in with different colours obviously something bright like that might not work.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.760
Probably be a bit dimmer if anything.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.640
And again brown on brown is going to make it difficult to see.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.330
So perhaps a different colour like that.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.420
But it all depends on what your spec calls for.

19:28.510 --> 19:30.550
But I'm really happy with how that shields worked.

19:30.550 --> 19:32.910
I'll never change the background colour back to white.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.800
And of course that can be turned off at any point so we've got our transparency there as well if necessary

19:37.800 --> 19:41.610
and it goes for our sword as well as great.

19:41.700 --> 19:42.840
How did you guys get on.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.730
Did you have fun playing with the fill tool.

19:44.790 --> 19:51.300
I hope you can see now that it enables you to fill in vast areas of your image very very quickly not

19:51.300 --> 19:54.580
only with solid colours but with patterns as well.

19:55.430 --> 20:00.790
Make sure you post your results over on the forum and I will see you guys in the next video.
