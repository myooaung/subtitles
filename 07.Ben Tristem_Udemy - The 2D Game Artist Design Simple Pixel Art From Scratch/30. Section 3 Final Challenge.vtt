00:04.900 --> 00:08.560
Hello everybody and welcome to the end of section challenge.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.010
This one's going to be a bigger challenge than normal so brace yourselves for some epic work.

00:14.060 --> 00:20.260
Now this is going to bring together every bit of knowledge you've learned so far in section 1 2 and

00:20.260 --> 00:24.800
3 we're going to bring it all together now and produce a wonderful animation.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.370
So I'd like you to go ahead and produce a final animation for your scene.

00:29.590 --> 00:32.570
Make it between two and five seconds long.

00:32.570 --> 00:40.270
I'll let you use the judgment when it comes to what frame rate you want to be able to play it back at.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.470
I would suggest a minimum of around 10 frames per second.

00:44.500 --> 00:51.160
Finally keep it simple keep it organized so you don't get lost when making it and keep it straight forward

00:51.220 --> 00:52.420
as well.

00:52.450 --> 00:56.720
And of course once you're done I'm eagerly waiting to see what you come up with.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.920
So please do share it over in the discussions.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.530
Pause video now and give it a go.

01:04.420 --> 01:05.920
Hello everyone welcome back.

01:05.920 --> 01:06.330
Right.

01:06.340 --> 01:11.560
Let's go in and I'm going to go through the final challenge myself and produce a two to five second

01:11.560 --> 01:14.320
long animation of my scene.

01:16.050 --> 01:21.490
Okay so the video you're watching here is slightly sped up so we can talk you through what I'm doing.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.190
So I've got guimpe in front of me here.

01:23.220 --> 01:30.060
And the first thing that I'm going to do is just rename my file so I'm working on a new section so the

01:30.060 --> 01:31.940
end of section challenge in this case.

01:32.040 --> 01:38.610
And then after that I'm thinking about what I'm going to do and I really want to limit my canvas size

01:38.610 --> 01:40.280
some working in the right way.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.690
I inadvertently cut it the wrong way at this point and I don't notice but that's okay because remember

01:45.690 --> 01:49.540
any point you can undo and go back again.

01:52.370 --> 01:56.280
So I go back here and change it but this time keeping the other side.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.660
I think I wasn't quite sure whether to have the large table small table.

01:59.660 --> 02:04.980
I think the smaller table did work better especially underneath that window there.

02:05.030 --> 02:09.470
The next thing of course to do is to start just making sure everything is organized and in the right

02:09.500 --> 02:15.200
position and of course there's a load of stuff there that needed to be removed at this point.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.820
Then it was a matter of going through and just optimizing all the stuff by shrinking those layers down

02:19.820 --> 02:21.060
to the image size.

02:21.140 --> 02:26.720
Then I know that when it comes to making the animation itself it's not going to cause me a headache

02:27.200 --> 02:32.030
with any memory problems or at least I hope it won't do anyway.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.280
OK.

02:33.310 --> 02:38.710
This point is ready to start creating these first frames so it's putting everything in double checking

02:38.740 --> 02:43.200
everything's ready to go and then I can go ahead and make my frames.

02:43.210 --> 02:50.980
Now in this case I've thought about it carefully and I decided to go with just a rapid duplication of

02:50.980 --> 02:56.170
the number of frames I want to work on and then adjusting it accordingly self always got a base that

02:56.170 --> 02:58.880
I can go back to at any point.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.380
So I've gone for 10 frames here.

03:01.390 --> 03:07.870
Obviously this will be a a one second image but I've got an idea at the end of using blender especially

03:07.900 --> 03:11.540
the animation blend filter especially with fire.

03:11.590 --> 03:17.110
That's going to be much easier now it's just a matter of going through and tweaking the flames and the

03:17.110 --> 03:24.940
light reflection on the ground and the candle as well as the light around there so you'll see now under

03:24.940 --> 03:29.890
the speed that the video a little bit more as I go through each one of these and literally I'm just

03:29.890 --> 03:35.650
using the smudged tool going through smudges in it slightly and then towards the end I realize that

03:36.190 --> 03:42.840
I've smudged them all quite a bit and I need to smudge the first one as well so all matches.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.660
Okay so that took a few minutes to do.

03:48.790 --> 03:54.380
I'm just going back here and doing the final ones making sure that they're all working.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.800
And then it's a matter of playing it back and checking it works.

03:57.820 --> 04:03.490
Now of course it's really small at this point so I go into image after saving it.

04:03.490 --> 04:07.660
I do remember to save it first before altering the file drastically.

04:07.810 --> 04:13.940
And then I save it as a scaled up version just I can keep these changes as well.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.750
But go ahead here and scale it up quite a bit.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.830
And I've got a memory error.

04:18.850 --> 04:21.120
So I go and sort that out.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.890
I'm pretty sure I changed this already but I'm going to go into the preferences so edit preferences

04:27.280 --> 04:32.980
go to the environment and turn up the amount of memory in this time give it a whole gigabyte which is

04:32.980 --> 04:34.680
a thousand and twenty four.

04:34.750 --> 04:40.120
After doing that scale in the end which results in it actually working I can play back and test what's

04:40.120 --> 04:43.800
going on and it looks really really nice.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.370
Finally after I've done that of course it's time to scale it.

04:51.380 --> 04:55.030
Now I've got a target platform resolution of 500.

04:55.040 --> 05:02.090
I give that a go on a bit dubious of whether it's going to work or not but it does fortunately not artefact

05:02.090 --> 05:02.630
too much.

05:02.620 --> 05:07.880
I get the warning about cropping the image because there's some layers that are outside of the canvas

05:08.530 --> 05:10.230
and I get an error.

05:10.250 --> 05:14.350
Yes I've forgotten to collapse my images so go down.

05:14.360 --> 05:21.020
Admittedly at this point I was not just focussed on exporting and I'm working on a scaled up version

05:21.020 --> 05:27.620
and not the original but I do remember after doing it immediately to save my work.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.560
Now I go and export it this time.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.960
Let's have a look at the results.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.210
There we go.

05:32.210 --> 05:33.560
It looks really good.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.400
I'm really pleased with how it's turned out.

05:35.510 --> 05:40.820
But it is a bit jittery and I think we can do a little better than that.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.200
And I recall the blend.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.810
It's also not long enough at the moment even though it's List linked.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.840
So I think the blend would work really well with this.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.030
So go and open up the file again the original file.

05:52.830 --> 05:58.040
And then set the image size a slightly larger this time 1 0 2 4.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.460
Want a really good animation that I can show off.

06:00.600 --> 06:06.420
And again with the interpellation off and then finally go into animation checking that that works it

06:06.450 --> 06:08.130
does going to blend.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.290
Now this was a tough decision but I went with three individual frames.

06:12.330 --> 06:18.180
This is probably the longest time I had to wait while it process that I ended up with 36 frames in total

06:18.540 --> 06:20.280
and we playback the animation.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.330
It looks far better.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.450
And let's see what that looks like now.

06:24.660 --> 06:27.640
Without it being sped up so you can see it properly.

06:31.550 --> 06:37.370
So go ahead an exporter after calculating it needs to be around the 40 millisecond time before between

06:37.370 --> 06:41.720
the frames and we end up with an animation that looks like the following.

06:41.870 --> 06:42.880
And I'm really.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.260
Oh no it crashed.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.130
No worries.

06:46.160 --> 06:51.770
I'm just saving as a separate file this time rather than overwriting the original one and this time

06:51.770 --> 06:52.130
round.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.000
It works.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.070
Don't know why it didn't work the first time around.

06:55.070 --> 06:59.720
Don't worry if GIMP does do that of course you can always try again.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.350
Then once that happened I have my final animated image.

07:04.670 --> 07:05.470
Excellent.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.500
I'm really proud of how that's come out and I'm sure you are with yours too.

07:10.520 --> 07:16.670
Please do share your work over on the forum and I will see you all in the next lecture.
