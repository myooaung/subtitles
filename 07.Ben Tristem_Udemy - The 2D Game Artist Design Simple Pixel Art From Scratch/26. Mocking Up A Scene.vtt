00:05.060 --> 00:11.540
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to start putting together a mock-up of

00:11.570 --> 00:17.810
our scene which then we can go ahead an animator to give ourselves an idea of what this scene in a game

00:17.930 --> 00:19.100
might look like.

00:20.940 --> 00:26.700
Okay so here we are back over in GIMP and I have laid out my wall sections like this.

00:26.700 --> 00:32.290
Now if you have happen to make a couple more wall sections then of course at them in as well that's

00:32.310 --> 00:35.610
going to be brilliant seeing what you guys come up with with this.

00:35.610 --> 00:41.520
So there are a couple of things as you saw in that previous bit there was a torch on the wall and there

00:41.520 --> 00:44.080
was also a table too.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.070
Now in this particular lecture I'm going to focus on getting this torch and also looking at its effects

00:50.130 --> 00:52.410
on the environment as well.

00:52.500 --> 01:00.150
So I'm going to focus in on just one area and taking into account this is a 64 by 64 square Our torch

01:00.180 --> 01:05.520
probably doesn't need to be that big but we'll start off with a 64 by 64 layer.

01:05.580 --> 01:10.500
So we've got a bit of breathing room around it and I'm going to call that torch straightaway so I know

01:10.530 --> 01:11.550
I'm dealing with.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.710
I'm also going to create a layer group straightaway.

01:14.820 --> 01:22.530
Now if try and call a labour group the same as a layer then it will just put dasch or hash one afterwards.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.680
I'm going to put the torch in the torch layer.

01:24.950 --> 01:29.580
And the reason for this is because we're going to build up the torch through a series of.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.340
Layers and I just want them to be all together.

01:34.690 --> 01:37.650
So the first thing to focus on is actually what the torch looks like.

01:37.660 --> 01:44.530
And again this can be rough and ready for a mock-up if we get a right size brush and having a look online

01:44.560 --> 01:51.070
at torches one of the best designs I found is that the cradle type 1 you can go ahead and I'm going

01:51.070 --> 01:51.530
to do that.

01:51.530 --> 01:54.790
Now I'm going to draw a torch.

01:54.790 --> 01:59.150
Now when I start drawing here do you remember the layer ordered does matter so far.

01:59.160 --> 01:59.770
Bring that up.

01:59.770 --> 02:05.190
Now we can see our torch and I can go ahead and draw in those details.

02:06.220 --> 02:09.830
Okay so now I have drawn my torch here on a separate layer.

02:09.850 --> 02:13.990
We need to start thinking about what it might look like overall.

02:14.050 --> 02:19.480
So the torch actual base itself where we're going to stick the fire that's going to be at the foreground

02:19.480 --> 02:24.350
so all the other loads are going to be beneath that and going to create a one called flame.

02:24.390 --> 02:27.290
It's a good name for it that need to be underneath the torch layer.

02:27.430 --> 02:32.650
And what that will mean is as we start building it up not going to find a good pallet to do this that

02:32.650 --> 02:38.620
we will find that it will look like the fire is within normally used the paint brush for doing this

02:39.190 --> 02:46.230
and probably a little larger a size of brush and pop that in.

02:46.450 --> 02:52.570
And then of course build this up with some other colours as well perhaps some reds in here has to be

02:52.570 --> 02:53.280
come up.

02:53.290 --> 03:00.330
Now it doesn't have to be perfect at this point because now I can go in straight after with the smudged

03:00.330 --> 03:06.130
tool and I actually quite like that style of flame but you could go with the smudge tool and just make

03:06.130 --> 03:09.930
the flame a little more blended in like that.

03:09.940 --> 03:16.540
So you got a good starting point here now one of the things that were kind of missing is some lighting

03:16.570 --> 03:16.990
effects.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.400
What would this do.

03:18.670 --> 03:23.800
So let's go ahead and add a bit of a lighting effect and I'm going to call it a lighting effect.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.160
Remember to call things something that makes sense.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.720
Now I've made this again far too large the layer or just noticed it wasn't sixty four but it's four.

03:31.810 --> 03:35.170
But that's a car can shrink the lay down in a bit.

03:35.170 --> 03:40.860
Now I want the lighting effect to kind of be on the back of the wall and on the floor underneath.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.990
Again I'm going to use the paint brush and just add a bit of colour.

03:43.990 --> 03:48.490
It doesn't really matter at this point in time how detailed you are with it.

03:48.530 --> 03:52.750
There's going to be a reflection on the floor and there's going to be an area behind now behind I'm

03:52.750 --> 03:57.850
going to grab myself a much larger brush probably even two.

03:57.900 --> 03:58.490
Yeah.

03:58.810 --> 04:06.750
And the air brush because the air brushes a little more subtle I can add a glow to our flame.

04:06.790 --> 04:10.860
Now the lighting effect again needs to be beneath everything else.

04:11.670 --> 04:14.140
Because it's the effect on the wall itself.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.410
Now you could go ahead and start highlighting and I'll demonstrate it here.

04:18.420 --> 04:24.750
We can start highlighting some maybe the edges around here as well that are being reflected and dark

04:24.750 --> 04:25.590
in other areas.

04:25.590 --> 04:31.200
If you wanted to I mean the possibilities here endless depending on how detailed you want to be after

04:31.200 --> 04:37.500
you got those rough areas then we can do a bit of a Rooney and just make it look a bit on the smooth

04:37.590 --> 04:38.430
side.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.650
That's entirely up to you.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.850
How much detail you want to go into.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.680
But that's a great start.

04:43.680 --> 04:49.390
I think the reflection on the floor might be too strong but we can deal with that in a bit.

04:49.420 --> 04:55.460
The other thing that tends to happen is corners tend to be darker so we can add in on not on the torch

04:55.470 --> 05:02.010
layer itself but perhaps the the solid wall layer itself we can add a layer group in there and start

05:02.040 --> 05:06.360
adding some shadowing in so we build things up along those lines.

05:06.360 --> 05:13.670
The other way we could do this is to create a brand new layer and I'm going to call this a gradient.

05:13.670 --> 05:19.710
It's a darkened gradient where things lower down a darker and put that just at the top but underneath

05:19.710 --> 05:25.560
the torched layer I'm going to grab a darker colour so from this palette I can go for a darker sort

05:25.560 --> 05:32.910
of blue and then go into the gradient feel tool options under the gradient itself.

05:32.910 --> 05:36.980
We can pick it going from the foreground colour to transparent.

05:37.200 --> 05:42.180
When we go ahead and select bats I can drag up and I'm going to use control to make sure it's completely

05:42.180 --> 05:47.470
vertical and you can see it adds in a nice fade to a scene that's far too strong.

05:47.520 --> 05:53.040
So it again at this point we just need to turn down the a pass to maybe a 50 per cent but it gives the

05:53.040 --> 05:58.860
whole wall a different dynamic when we do that and is certainly looking quite good now with these reflections

05:58.860 --> 05:59.400
here.

05:59.400 --> 06:04.860
Now of course when it comes to animating this later on we need to bear in mind the more layers and fancy

06:04.860 --> 06:10.070
bits that we add we'll end up causing ourselves exponentially more work to do.

06:10.200 --> 06:16.980
So there are a couple of tricks to getting around that and that is perhaps oscillating between two different

06:17.280 --> 06:17.790
things.

06:17.790 --> 06:25.140
So for instance if I copy our torched layer here and literally all I need to do to animates this flame

06:25.200 --> 06:33.500
would be to select the flame layer under the lay a menu transform it and flip it around horizontally.

06:34.590 --> 06:40.340
Now we can see this is one of the issues with having the wrong size layer is it's flipped it around.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.710
On the other side this would be a good time of course to shrink our layers down to the right size.

06:45.780 --> 06:51.540
The auto crop that low and I'm going to auto crop all of these large layers surveyor around the right

06:51.540 --> 06:56.880
size that also means they're not going to take up too much space and gives us far more control over

06:56.880 --> 06:59.390
the rest of production as well.

06:59.400 --> 07:05.100
What we don't want to do of course is run out of RAM halfway through making a more complex animation.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.610
This is one of the most complicated ones we've done so far.

07:08.610 --> 07:11.220
Now I'm going to go to the flame that I was working on.

07:11.240 --> 07:16.080
I flipped round and I'm going to move it across here.

07:16.080 --> 07:21.380
And then you can see that we can oscillate between the two as we're animating it.

07:21.450 --> 07:25.790
And again this is it doesn't have to be a high fidelity animation.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.160
This is to give an impression of what the area all looked like.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.690
Now of course you could also do similar things with the lights reflection on the floor.

07:33.690 --> 07:38.640
Now this reflection on the floor I still think is far too light.

07:38.660 --> 07:43.380
And part of that is because we've got these two torch labour groups on top of one another so when you

07:43.380 --> 07:48.990
are working on one remember to turn off the others otherwise you get a not very good impression of what

07:48.990 --> 07:49.770
it's looking like.

07:49.770 --> 07:55.010
In fact it'll end up much brighter but down on the floor I'm not liking this reflection.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.590
I think it's too bright.

07:57.600 --> 08:04.750
Basically someone go to the smudge tool again and that she smudge it out just a little bit more.

08:04.890 --> 08:05.750
And there we go.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.430
I'm starting to like how that's coming together.

08:08.430 --> 08:14.970
Of course now you can go ahead and this we saw if I go and grab my previous incantation of it we can

08:14.970 --> 08:22.080
go ahead and add other elements like tables and another torch in the scene with a slightly different

08:22.260 --> 08:25.010
ground effect you can see they both got different ground effects.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.680
I decided to put a candle on this table.

08:28.700 --> 08:34.350
No lighting effects but I thought it would be pretty awesome if both the candle flickered and the inside

08:34.410 --> 08:41.370
of this window or so had a bit of illumination mean lots and lots you can do to try to bite off too

08:41.370 --> 08:47.910
much perhaps even start off with one square and build up from there it's entirely up to you where you

08:47.910 --> 08:54.180
take this particular project because we're coming up to the point now where you guys are going to have

08:54.450 --> 08:59.000
to create your own mock-up for end of section challenge.

08:59.250 --> 09:03.590
But before we do that it's time to finish the mock-up of the scene.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.600
And that's right it's time for a challenge.

09:06.770 --> 09:13.010
I'd like you to finish off fleshing out our mock-up that we're doing no animations just yet.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.020
I know it's tempting to dive straight in.

09:15.020 --> 09:20.730
But what we want to do is make sure that our mock-up is quote unquote right.

09:20.780 --> 09:25.590
Obviously it's a mock-up but it gives us a good idea of how the scene is going to lay out what we don't

09:25.630 --> 09:32.750
want to do is start doing animations without knowing what's going to impact what in our scene do.

09:32.750 --> 09:38.360
Go ahead and add some interesting elements you've seen some examples maybe a candle a table etc. and

09:38.390 --> 09:45.510
perhaps something on the wall perhaps a statue is up to you but do make this your own dungeon scene.

09:45.580 --> 09:51.040
It's a chance to take that reference material and see what you can incorporate into your own scene.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.100
And finally there are lots of options you can add.

09:54.110 --> 09:57.420
I would recommend that you keep it simple.

09:57.470 --> 10:02.380
It's very tempting to add loads of stuff into the scene if it's going to be static.

10:02.390 --> 10:09.230
That's fine but if you're planning on animating Let's keep the animated areas to not a minimum as such

10:09.260 --> 10:11.910
but to a manageable level.

10:11.930 --> 10:14.860
Go ahead pause a video now and give that a go.

10:17.630 --> 10:18.230
OK everyone.

10:18.230 --> 10:19.030
Welcome back.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.860
Let's go ahead now and have a look at what I've done with fleshing out the mock-up.

10:26.780 --> 10:30.720
Okay so here we go I've spent some time going through.

10:30.770 --> 10:36.170
It took about half an hour or so to put everything together here would just scroll across and have a

10:36.170 --> 10:42.920
look at how it's all put together for the moment it's also subject to change and compounding together

10:42.920 --> 10:45.810
where necessary or put together societally.

10:45.830 --> 10:49.570
So the first thing obviously is the background we've got all the background pieces in place.

10:49.580 --> 10:53.210
But I have not combine them into one layer just yet.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.530
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

10:54.530 --> 10:59.430
Now while some thinking about it lay a group called it background.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.550
And then just put all of these solid wall bits in the background itself.

11:05.550 --> 11:13.060
It is tempting at this point and perfectly valid if you're 100 percent happy sticking all of these into

11:13.060 --> 11:18.330
one law just one particular layer itself so it's perfectly fine to collapse them down.

11:18.340 --> 11:24.130
I'm going to leave them separately for the moment just for some control as I'm still developing this

11:24.670 --> 11:30.820
then above that I've got a fade as you can see here it just makes the whole scene slightly darker.

11:31.090 --> 11:34.820
Now of course you can go in an ad even further shadowing.

11:34.870 --> 11:38.170
I've not gone ahead and done anything on the pillars.

11:38.410 --> 11:39.970
I kind of want to.

11:39.970 --> 11:44.920
But at the same time I'm aware that it's going to increase the animation workload as well and I don't

11:44.920 --> 11:48.240
think it's going to add that much to our scene.

11:49.210 --> 11:56.700
Now the actual glow on the background and the floor and around the actual window and benefit candle

11:56.700 --> 12:00.880
if we have a look of added a little highlight underneath for candle as well so you've got the candle

12:01.120 --> 12:05.830
and underneath it is the candle lighting so that the object itself is always prominent.

12:05.830 --> 12:09.770
Now the candle lighting you can probably see there the layer boundary is pretty large.

12:09.790 --> 12:15.190
So at this point in time it's also worthwhile going through and just cropping your layers down to their

12:15.190 --> 12:19.450
appropriate size and pretty sure the candle is absolutely massive as well.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.650
So underlayer auto crop player then it's only around the area.

12:22.870 --> 12:28.640
It needs to be saving you a lot of time and effort superhuman human it comes to animating it's udorn

12:28.700 --> 12:33.160
to be animating a huge scene and it will take ages to process.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.730
If it's too large as well.

12:34.940 --> 12:40.360
I've also on our as you can see here the torches there a slightly different design I didn't like the

12:40.360 --> 12:47.180
vertical bit so I made it slightly diagonal opposed to going straight up and I've added a little shadow

12:47.180 --> 12:49.900
over this area but I'm just drawn on.

12:49.930 --> 12:56.620
I didn't want to this area just underneath the torch has an area of shadow it's very subtle but it does

12:56.620 --> 12:57.810
stand out.

12:57.850 --> 13:02.540
And of course when you've got bright lights like a flame you can have harsh shadows.

13:02.680 --> 13:08.080
So one of the things that does stand out about these tables at the moment is there's no shadowing being

13:08.080 --> 13:11.680
done and that might be something worth while looking into.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.990
I don't know yet whether I'm going to keep these.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.900
This is a mock up that's the whole point of doing it.

13:17.020 --> 13:20.050
But otherwise I'm liking how that's all coming together.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.210
How did you guys get on I'd love to see your mock ups and what you were going to do coming up when it

13:25.210 --> 13:26.980
comes to our animations.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.120
And I will see you all in the next lecture.
