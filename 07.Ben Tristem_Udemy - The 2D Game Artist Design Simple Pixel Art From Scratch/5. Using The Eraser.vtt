00:04.420 --> 00:05.260
Hello everyone.

00:05.260 --> 00:11.560
And by the end of this lecture you'll be able to remove the background completely from your image so

00:11.560 --> 00:18.640
that when you export it this part that's currently in this sort of chequered state is completely transparent

00:18.680 --> 00:20.690
and you can see what's behind it.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.110
Hey welcome back.

00:22.120 --> 00:30.610
And I was about to show you guys about the eraser tool and whilst I was playing about I basically destroyed

00:30.700 --> 00:32.080
my layered house.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.630
I know I haven't saved or anything.

00:33.730 --> 00:38.530
So I could equally just close the file without saving and reopen it.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.920
However there's a very quick way of doing that process.

00:40.930 --> 00:43.390
It's called reverting the gimp file.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.600
And we can do that via the file menu under revert and that'll take us back to the same state of how

00:49.600 --> 00:52.060
my led House was before.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.510
My playful antics destroyed it.

00:55.510 --> 01:02.140
So there we go we're back to the basic House now where I'm going to show you the eraser tool so if you've

01:02.140 --> 01:05.810
not got your house open yet go ahead and open it up.

01:05.830 --> 01:10.380
Or perhaps one of the other projects you've been working on so we can practice with the tool.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.650
So first of all we're going to have to make sure it's selected it is in my case.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.920
It's this pink square type object.

01:18.070 --> 01:23.800
And the shortcut key for it is shift and E for eraser I suppose.

01:23.800 --> 01:31.030
And by default it's got a couple of settings that makes it a little difficult to work with in this low

01:31.030 --> 01:32.640
resolution that we've currently got.

01:32.650 --> 01:33.520
And I'll show you why.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.510
Let's go ahead.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.520
Well the house itself now notice that we've got several layers here.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.710
I've selected the House lierre because that's the layer I want to affect.

01:41.890 --> 01:49.370
If I just start erasing that isn't what part of it expected I'd have expected it to just go solid black

01:49.600 --> 01:51.910
because that's what we used to at the moment with the pencil.

01:51.910 --> 01:56.910
So when we use the pencil tool it just puts down a solid pixel of colour.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.190
The Eraser is not quite like that by default.

02:00.190 --> 02:04.810
It has a brush types and we can go and have a look at that now.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.780
So if we have a look at the tool options itself if it's not got this tab open you're going to have to

02:10.780 --> 02:12.270
open it to follow along.

02:12.490 --> 02:18.940
And we have a brush Now you'll notice that little image in the square box is very similar.

02:18.940 --> 02:22.590
We glance over to the right hand side of the screen to this image.

02:22.590 --> 02:25.120
In fact it's the same set.

02:25.270 --> 02:29.860
If we go ahead and click on that little square we see there opens up to reveal something very similar

02:30.130 --> 02:31.990
to what we can see down there.

02:32.050 --> 02:34.620
And this is your type of brush.

02:34.660 --> 02:39.240
Now when it comes to brushes themselves we'll go into that in a bit more detail.

02:39.250 --> 02:45.430
But there are three circles right next to one another that's a varying degrees of hardness.

02:45.430 --> 02:51.130
So we've got a 25 percent and we can see it says to hardness 25.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.350
And then it goes all the way up to two hardness 100.

02:54.490 --> 03:00.880
Now when you've got a brush hardness of 100 it does not have soft edges like this does.

03:00.910 --> 03:04.660
If we go ahead and use the same tool again you can see this time.

03:04.690 --> 03:10.810
Yes it's still a bit on the feathered side where it's not completely black and I'm expecting it to go

03:10.810 --> 03:11.100
black.

03:11.100 --> 03:16.260
By the way because of the layer that's underneath the house layer is completely black.

03:16.270 --> 03:23.080
But it still got this sort of gradient between black and the whites that we're raising but it's much

03:23.080 --> 03:23.440
stronger.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.960
So that's much more useful.

03:25.090 --> 03:31.600
And the reason for it doing that is simply because we're not placing our brush exactly on top of each

03:31.600 --> 03:34.230
pixel as we start to erase.

03:34.270 --> 03:40.750
But this tool allows you to manipulate more than one pixels at any one time as we can see if I get exactly

03:40.750 --> 03:46.270
in the middle of four pixels which is roughly there and click all of those four pixels change at the

03:46.270 --> 03:47.150
same time.

03:47.320 --> 03:54.400
If I just catch on an edge it changes them all differently and that that can just be frustrating when

03:54.400 --> 04:00.650
you try and to a raise a line like this one here when you start erasing things either side of it.

04:00.670 --> 04:05.360
Now the first thing that I'm going to do here is just get rid of this black layer.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.060
It's not going to help me at all.

04:07.110 --> 04:12.660
I'm going to delete it only to clear it or anything else then of course it just looks like it's just

04:12.790 --> 04:16.560
automatically repaired itself and all that erasing has gone but it hasn't.

04:16.570 --> 04:25.340
If I hide the background you see that we've started adding some Alpher by raising to this house layer.

04:25.630 --> 04:31.300
Now our re-emphasize at this point the layer you have selected is the one you're actually currently

04:31.330 --> 04:32.800
affecting.

04:32.830 --> 04:41.590
Now I've also on variation 1 and 2 got little white dots on them that otherwise could be removed because

04:41.650 --> 04:45.620
that was my sort of fake erasing before I learned about the eraser tool.

04:45.970 --> 04:52.000
Let's turn one of those on and we can see that the door itself and the windows there.

04:52.090 --> 04:58.710
If I was to go ahead and try and erase this area here where the white is you'll find.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.930
But nothing's happening at the moment.

05:00.930 --> 05:01.880
Why.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.590
I've got the wrong layer selected.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.060
It's very easy to have the wrong is selected.

05:06.190 --> 05:13.390
Let's go back and try to start erasing all of erase the wrong bit because it's not snapping to the pixels

05:13.390 --> 05:15.220
like the pencil tool did.

05:15.760 --> 05:23.080
However we can make this tool and many others snap to individual pixels by enabling a hard edge that

05:23.080 --> 05:24.650
is under the tool options.

05:24.670 --> 05:31.030
If we look down that says hard edge no matter what size of eraser you decide to use.

05:31.210 --> 05:36.280
If you've got hard edge selected it will actually snap to the individual parts.

05:36.280 --> 05:41.380
Now on this chequered background it's very difficult to see as I'm going to turn the house back on and

05:41.380 --> 05:47.410
you can see here that chequered Square which is the size of the brush is now snapping to each individual

05:47.410 --> 05:51.030
pixel much like the pencil tool does.

05:52.020 --> 05:57.300
If we turn hard edge off we can see it's much smoother across the surface of our image.

05:57.300 --> 06:03.860
Now with hard edged turned on you'll notice now I've got the wrong layer selected back to the house

06:03.870 --> 06:10.560
there you will notice that it acts very much like the pencil tool and actually does a full erase and

06:10.560 --> 06:15.000
that doesn't matter what size the brushes are naghma up the size to six hundred.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.030
Let's go here and make it size 4.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.540
It's now four pixels across.

06:20.620 --> 06:27.210
We can see is erasing much more at the time but it's also still snapping to individual areas.

06:27.210 --> 06:30.120
Now we set the brush hardness down to 25.

06:30.150 --> 06:33.230
You'll notice that it still does exactly the same thing.

06:33.240 --> 06:41.130
Now the brushes changed shape ever so slightly but it still removes 100 percent.

06:41.130 --> 06:45.400
It's not faded like it is when you go to a hard edge and remove it.

06:45.420 --> 06:51.280
Not only does it no longer snap but it's much more gradual with the effect of that brush.

06:51.510 --> 06:53.550
Now the eraser is a powerful tool.

06:53.580 --> 06:59.810
Obviously it's for erasing but it can be used quite constructively as well.

06:59.820 --> 07:05.940
If I was to go ahead and turn on the chimney layer here making sure the house is still selected for

07:05.940 --> 07:10.000
instance I could add an effect that looks a bit more smoky.

07:10.020 --> 07:17.730
Now of course you may have gathered but at this point that the eraser is like an alpha brush it increases

07:17.880 --> 07:24.750
the transparency as you use it enabling us to see through onto the other layer.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.680
In this case just the white background underneath.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.530
If it was turned on.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.410
Armed with that knowledge it's now time for a challenge.

07:35.140 --> 07:40.260
And your challenge using the eraser tool is to open up one of your previous projects.

07:40.270 --> 07:44.590
Now if you don't have one for whatever reason perhaps you're starting this course again after a few

07:44.590 --> 07:46.930
months or weeks do use mine.

07:46.930 --> 07:49.860
It's in the resources against this lecture.

07:50.200 --> 07:55.840
Save a copy of that file because what we're about to do is destructive to that file.

07:55.930 --> 08:00.480
Remove the background and then export and share with everybody.

08:00.490 --> 08:04.030
Now you may be wondering what I mean by Remove the background.

08:04.030 --> 08:08.870
I mean going from an image like the one on the left to one on the right.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.840
So it's just the house itself.

08:10.840 --> 08:17.140
In this case that is visible the rest of it is completely transparent and you can see what's behind

08:17.140 --> 08:17.660
it.

08:17.680 --> 08:26.170
When you export your image export it to the forum at 64 by 64 balls video now and give that a go.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.100
Okay guys welcome back.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.790
Let's go ahead and remove the background from our image so that it goes completely transparent.

08:36.150 --> 08:43.260
Okay so I've gone head and reopen my layered house so I'm starting from a fresh stance and there are

08:43.260 --> 08:44.880
a couple of ways I could go about doing this.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.540
The first thing that I'm going to do is decide how it's going to look at the end.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.840
I think I'm going to go with the garridge in this case.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.620
Here we go.

08:52.810 --> 08:57.460
Now I'm not going to get rid of that other layer but what I will do is clean it up.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.490
So the first thing I'm going to do is just hide all of the other layers bar the ones I want to clean

09:02.490 --> 09:08.850
up so and make sure that I've got that layer of variation too in this case actually selected.

09:08.850 --> 09:11.330
Otherwise I'm not going to be able to clear it up.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.480
Let's have a look.

09:12.480 --> 09:17.380
I need the eraser to selected hard edge fine pixel size one.

09:17.630 --> 09:20.730
Excellent So those are those two white bits gone.

09:20.730 --> 09:24.380
You've got another layer of visible variation one now just selecting the.

09:24.450 --> 09:26.110
Does not enable the layer.

09:26.130 --> 09:30.420
So that's a variation one make sure it's selected it's highlighted blue.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.210
Of course when you click away it's no longer highlighted.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.850
I do wish you would stay highlighted but it is.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.710
I suppose it is a little bit highlighted but I do like it when it is bright blue because I keep selecting

09:40.710 --> 09:41.400
the wrong letter.

09:41.580 --> 09:46.800
Okay I am going to go to the pencil tool at this point to do a bit of neatening at this point.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.020
With the door I'm going to do the same with the garage as well.

09:51.030 --> 09:55.040
This is really just an optional extra rather than anything else.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.390
So there we go.

09:57.670 --> 09:59.510
So that's all sorted there.

09:59.650 --> 10:00.910
And then finally the House.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.860
Now the house itself is on a white layer.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.860
I'm going to get rid of this variation.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.820
Three complete Blackfin.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.830
Okay so the House has been drawn on a white less.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.970
I'm going to have to use the eraser tool that's fine.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.400
Hard edge is selected.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.570
Now the tools do remember whilst we're at this point.

10:18.640 --> 10:25.270
What we did last so because I haven't shut down the gimp yet it's remembered all of the tool settings

10:25.270 --> 10:26.920
that were previously enabled.

10:26.950 --> 10:31.360
Now there are numerous ways you could go about clearing this down.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.980
I'm simply going to follow the instructions and use the eraser at all because I don't know about anything

10:36.040 --> 10:40.020
else fancy at the moment and would say that to maybe size 5.

10:40.120 --> 10:45.980
That's good and then it'll give me plenty of opportunity to whiz across and remove the extras.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.090
Ah be back in a few moments.

10:49.580 --> 10:53.570
OK so just got the last few bits here and that's done.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.540
Okay let's add on the chimney hat.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.090
Do I want to see through a chimney.

10:58.110 --> 10:58.370
No.

10:58.410 --> 11:01.920
I'm going to go back to variation too which is where the chimney is.

11:01.950 --> 11:06.740
In fact I am going to rename this point chimney because it's not really a variation.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.320
It's in addition to the house.

11:08.550 --> 11:09.780
And it is a chimney.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.060
And let's go to the pencil tool.

11:12.060 --> 11:19.110
White is the foreground colour and my brush is huge that set it back down to one pixel and I will go

11:19.110 --> 11:20.770
through and just colour in the rest of that.

11:20.790 --> 11:21.080
Okay.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.750
That's looking good.

11:23.160 --> 11:23.910
Excellent.

11:23.910 --> 11:28.630
Now the one thing I didn't do was the first thing on the challenge list is save a copy.

11:28.650 --> 11:36.360
Fortunately I have not saved yet otherwise destroyed the previous version I'm going to go to file save

11:36.360 --> 11:42.650
a copy and save it as a layered house with transparency and obviously I've done that before.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.310
Show you guys what's going on.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.360
And there we go.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.210
That is my lead house with transparency.

11:48.210 --> 11:50.750
I'm going to once it's saved.

11:50.910 --> 11:54.420
Are we still on lad house notice so I still don't want to save.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.740
I'm going to go ahead and open.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.480
My layered house with transparency.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.780
So that is now open control shift.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.440
Jade's zoom all the way in.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.460
He says there we go.

12:06.730 --> 12:11.050
That's the one I've been working on led House with transparency of confirm that the top I'm going to

12:11.050 --> 12:13.700
get rid discard changes.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.730
Okay so I've definitely got that one open and that's the one I'm working with now.

12:17.740 --> 12:27.010
I can go ahead and scale that up ready for sharing to 64 by 64 and I will install been at some points

12:27.010 --> 12:32.590
I can do this automatically although with my changing around of layers you can't do that so I still

12:32.590 --> 12:34.220
have to get it all set up any way.

12:34.220 --> 12:42.260
I dont mind doing this step is all scaled up hopefully no that doesn't feel like it's scaled up that

12:42.320 --> 12:43.760
scale the image.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.540
I dont know what happened there.

12:45.910 --> 12:48.810
I think I must have inadvertently clicked the wrong thing.

12:48.820 --> 12:49.270
But there we go.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.850
Thats definitely scaled up now.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.680
We dont want that level of detail of course being kept.

12:53.770 --> 13:00.940
But I do now want to export so export events remembered I want to pay in G with transparency that is

13:00.940 --> 13:04.490
important and garridge.

13:06.970 --> 13:11.900
There we go with transparency and garage and just giving you title case threw out.

13:11.900 --> 13:18.430
In that case and you go exports or take a few moments to export and there we go.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.930
I'm now going to go ahead and share those.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.710
Over on the forum I hope to see yours there as well.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.660
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
