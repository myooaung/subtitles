00:04.310 --> 00:09.440
Okay so here's a reminder of the challenge speccy itself we're going to be making a portcullis with

00:09.440 --> 00:14.990
two animations one descending slowly and smoothly and the second one slamming down.

00:14.990 --> 00:20.370
Let's go over into Gib now and do this challenge now that we're covering him.

00:20.390 --> 00:23.180
The first thing we need to do is decide on our campuses.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.340
I'm going to work.

00:24.350 --> 00:29.720
No larger than 128 by 128 for this particular project.

00:29.750 --> 00:36.400
I'm going to zoom in all the way and then start thinking about how I can easily construct my background.

00:36.410 --> 00:39.030
In this case it can be a foreground.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.650
So let's change that straightaway to foreground.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.600
So what are we going to do we're going to have like an archway here.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.410
And this is one of those things where you can create a new layer.

00:50.450 --> 00:56.300
And I'm going to call it archway for the moment and you can go ahead and produce an archway how you

00:56.300 --> 01:00.140
like and you can only produce half of it.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.250
And then we can duplicate that half and reflect the layer.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.760
And by doing that we save ourselves a lot of time.

01:07.910 --> 01:12.740
So I'm going to go ahead now speed up the video as I construct the archway and I'll slow down again

01:12.770 --> 01:14.810
when it comes to the mirroring.

01:19.230 --> 01:24.270
So there we go I've constructed an arch where needed to go back and do that again.

01:24.290 --> 01:27.700
I thought that two pixels wide on the brush would have been fine.

01:27.780 --> 01:32.700
Doesn't work out that well as you probably saw their vision shift key and just during a series of straight

01:32.700 --> 01:34.330
lines to create my curve.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.030
I'm happy with the overall shape.

01:36.150 --> 01:42.930
Now there is something here that I do want to add I want to add a couple of bricks to give this a bit

01:42.930 --> 01:45.270
more life to it's going to take a bit longer.

01:45.270 --> 01:50.680
I'm going to zoom in to do those and obviously I'm going to be working on only one side.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.990
I'll see you guys back in a moment.

02:00.590 --> 02:01.120
Okay.

02:01.130 --> 02:01.920
And there we go.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.700
Got a rough outline here.

02:03.830 --> 02:09.530
And as you can see I started by making some pretty straight bricks and I thought you know what.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.620
It's not really going to be like that.

02:11.630 --> 02:16.170
I may need to modify this top bit but that's half the work done there with the archway.

02:16.310 --> 02:20.130
I can now go to layer Auto kropp the lassus and much much smaller.

02:20.150 --> 02:25.160
Now one of the issues I've got here of course is the ground that I drew goes all the way across.

02:25.340 --> 02:28.240
And that actually isn't ideal in this case.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.700
So I'm going to grab the eraser with the hard edge and erase that line that I originally drew and for

02:34.700 --> 02:39.390
the moment I'll pop the ground on a different layer and I will call it ground.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.260
And this is one of the great things about splitting it up.

02:42.260 --> 02:50.360
It enables you to just make even temporary things to temporary layers that can come back and be merged

02:50.390 --> 02:52.520
in almost immediately afterwards.

02:52.520 --> 02:57.710
So autocross below it gets much smaller which is what I was expecting I'm going to duplicate that layer

02:58.040 --> 03:04.730
and then in the layer transforms literally flip it horizontally grab the move tool moving the active

03:04.730 --> 03:07.960
layer and then it's just a matter of lining it back up.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.300
How are we doing there.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.760
That looks pretty good.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.090
Now comes the option of whether or not emerge down at this point.

03:16.290 --> 03:20.160
Now am I going to make any sense any other symmetrical alterations.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.560
I don't think I am.

03:21.570 --> 03:29.670
So I'm going to merge the ground down submerged down merge the archway down and merge that final archway

03:30.000 --> 03:33.810
down onto the foreground so now I have a white background.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.960
Now I need a cut out here for the poor commerce to come down.

03:36.960 --> 03:43.440
So I'm going to go in with the Fuzz's Select Tool schauffler has no boundaries and then when I hit the

03:43.440 --> 03:45.860
delete key it will clear it for me.

03:45.930 --> 03:51.050
Now it must be said that this is only working because this layer has an outer layer.

03:51.060 --> 03:57.720
If it doesn't you need to right click and make sure that you have an alpha channel on the layer.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.720
Otherwise you won't be able to perform this action.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.890
So now we can see through there is a matter of constructing our poor colour.

04:05.070 --> 04:11.790
And again if you imagine this is a spight Gate and it's got a lot of repeating patterns on it.

04:11.790 --> 04:17.770
So this is also something that I can make one or two pieces and just duplicate it several times.

04:17.880 --> 04:25.620
Also because the portcullises going to be hidden behind this foreground it means that we've got a few

04:25.620 --> 04:29.020
more options on being a bit sloppy.

04:29.070 --> 04:33.810
I will use that term and not have clean edges on our poor colour.

04:33.810 --> 04:37.280
Some going to go ahead now and construct that on a new layer.

04:37.470 --> 04:45.330
I'm going to put it on a transparent air that's fine and port colours there ever go so I can start constructing

04:45.330 --> 04:48.710
that now and I will see you back again in a few moments.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.530
And now I have one of the vertical bars made.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.840
I just need to decide on the horizontal ones as well now.

05:00.850 --> 05:09.950
I've gone for a pixel width of five for my brush type here and what I can do is I can put in the edges

05:10.010 --> 05:17.300
straight away so I can decide that I'm going to go there and then maybe here and just have this going

05:17.390 --> 05:20.260
up a regular distance I hope.

05:20.510 --> 05:26.130
And then I'll be able to just duplicate this layer lots and stick it all together and that will be support

05:26.200 --> 05:27.440
colours made.

05:31.430 --> 05:34.520
Okay so I think that's finished off there.

05:34.520 --> 05:40.700
I'm going to go in and make it a bit smaller with auto prop player so we've got the lay a boundary around

05:40.700 --> 05:41.110
it.

05:41.250 --> 05:46.180
Well I'm going to duplicate that and hopefully when I move it to the side.

05:47.870 --> 05:48.970
Excellent.

05:48.980 --> 05:55.610
We can make ourselves the rest of the portcullis and again duplicate it now naming at this point.

05:55.610 --> 06:01.700
I don't need to tidy up the naming until the very end because I'm going to be merging them back together.

06:01.860 --> 06:07.670
Now I do need to make sure that we've got consistent with here as I'm putting this together and assembling

06:07.670 --> 06:08.120
it.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.790
I'm happy with that.

06:09.890 --> 06:13.540
Now of course there are a couple of ways I can continue doing this.

06:13.550 --> 06:20.300
I am literally just going to carry on duplicating and moving and then I will merge down at the very

06:20.300 --> 06:21.120
end.

06:21.560 --> 06:27.290
So I've gone for slightly rectangular holes rather than square holes mainly because that's how I started

06:27.290 --> 06:27.980
doing it.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.370
So I'm going to finish doing it that way as well.

06:31.520 --> 06:37.160
So one more duplication and we've got ourselves the portcullis and this is what I mean by being a little

06:37.160 --> 06:38.120
bit sloppy.

06:38.350 --> 06:43.730
That's the way the gate is probably like fat in the background anyway and in the runners so that's absolutely

06:43.730 --> 06:44.360
fine.

06:44.480 --> 06:50.330
But the foreground will be on top of it all and will not have any capacity so it will sit there nice

06:50.330 --> 06:51.170
and neat.

06:51.170 --> 06:58.130
Finally I do need to put all of these and this case I don't think I need any modularity so I will just

06:58.130 --> 06:59.770
merge them all down.

07:03.240 --> 07:08.700
And there we go we have our port colours that we move up and down and start animating.

07:08.700 --> 07:09.470
Excellent.

07:11.230 --> 07:16.310
So this is where we can start thinking about our first animation which is slow and steady.

07:16.390 --> 07:20.170
I'm going to create myself a layer group.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.030
You know I haven't done at all.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.620
That's do a save.

07:23.620 --> 07:24.630
First of all.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.120
And my Save dialogue popped up on another window.

07:28.120 --> 07:28.870
Here we go.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.520
And I'm going to call this what it is 12.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.070
Yes.

07:32.080 --> 07:37.360
She empey Practice 13 port colours and I'm going to call this portcullis.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.010
They had these.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.180
So I know what it is.

07:40.330 --> 07:47.200
And at the same time because I don't want to have to undo and just move layers about that can be very

07:47.200 --> 07:48.250
confusing.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.370
I'm going to call this one fast or slam or something along those lines.

07:52.390 --> 07:54.140
That's the strip descriptive.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.550
So now we got that there.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.150
We've got a foreground.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.080
Background in a layer group.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.810
Let's put them the right way round and let's call this frame number one.

08:04.970 --> 08:06.820
Excellent so we've got all the basics there.

08:06.950 --> 08:13.310
And it is just a matter now of moving this portcullis and hopefully we'll be able to make maybe a two

08:13.310 --> 08:15.760
second animation of it coming down.

08:21.150 --> 08:26.980
Okay sevak is looking pretty good so far I'm asking to save my work.

08:27.180 --> 08:32.960
And then I need to export it and see what it looks like.

08:33.030 --> 08:36.060
So I'm going to save as and put flaten on the end.

08:36.160 --> 08:41.980
Oh we've been working on the slam one too ably spot my liberator mistake there.

08:42.070 --> 08:45.600
So this is portcullis steady.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.070
And then flaten.

08:50.830 --> 08:55.100
And before I do anything else I save as an overall rights.

08:55.950 --> 08:59.650
The steady one because that's what it is.

08:59.700 --> 09:04.100
And then I go ahead and sort out the slam one in bit.

09:04.500 --> 09:10.870
So let's go and flatten me down so merge the lower group for all of the active labour groups.

09:15.510 --> 09:25.270
A case of the exports let's export it's obviously as a Giff not happy Giff But if there were no exports.

09:25.320 --> 09:32.040
And we get an error message and if we read the error message it's just warning us that we will lose

09:32.040 --> 09:38.990
information in the format for the areas of the image that are outside of the canvas.

09:39.100 --> 09:44.420
So I'm absolutely fine with it being cropped as an animation tenth of a second that's fine.

09:44.430 --> 09:51.750
It's coming down over a second and delay between frames is fine but I do want to replace each frame

09:51.930 --> 09:55.290
and go ahead and export and then we can go and have a look at that.

09:55.410 --> 10:01.850
And here we go here it is coming down nice and steady animation one done and on the slam one.

10:02.800 --> 10:09.070
So let's go back over into gimping going to go ahead and open up recent and open up my slab.

10:09.190 --> 10:09.760
There we go.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.960
Close the other one down.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.720
Yes I do want to save.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.410
So what do we do here.

10:14.410 --> 10:21.510
Well I'm going to tidy up first of all and go back to for just having frame one and doing the same thing

10:21.510 --> 10:23.310
that this time thinking about it.

10:23.320 --> 10:30.170
Picking up speed and then moving quickly before eventually slamming into the ground.

10:30.220 --> 10:32.710
And I think of something like that's going to slam into the ground.

10:32.710 --> 10:38.870
It's going to bounce a little at the very bottom and I'll see by just placing these individual frames

10:39.190 --> 10:43.840
whether or not I can get it looking as I expect it to be.

10:47.950 --> 10:53.770
In this particular case I am actually counting the number of pixels are moving something.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.910
So the next one is 24 pixels of all these things that go through.

11:00.110 --> 11:04.420
Starting point to an omelette she going one two three four.

11:04.490 --> 11:13.040
Now the question is if I elongated this layer by stretching it in height will actually look better and

11:13.040 --> 11:18.470
we can we can cross tests that are make it unstretched then I'll do a bit of squash and stretch afterwards

11:18.530 --> 11:19.890
if I've got the time.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.810
So that's go ahead it's hit the ground there that's do the next layer and have it bounce up just a little

11:26.810 --> 11:27.450
bit violent.

11:27.450 --> 11:34.250
They had to about that level I think and then come back down again.

11:34.430 --> 11:35.460
One two.

11:38.660 --> 11:47.220
One two three four six accelerating again another layer one two three four.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.010
And it's on the ground any way.

11:49.400 --> 11:54.530
And that's are 10 frames as well so that matches perfectly with the length of the other one that's go

11:54.530 --> 12:00.250
ahead and say fats and go ahead and save as.

12:01.050 --> 12:05.910
Then we need the flattened version to the test and one day I will spell flatten correctly.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.100
It skews that.

12:07.380 --> 12:07.870
Okay.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.940
So let's merge these labour groups.

12:13.880 --> 12:21.130
Now that they're all merged down I'm going to save the work and export its And name it properly here.

12:21.200 --> 12:27.530
I'll go through and rename those horrible spellings flatten that case again it's warming up.

12:27.530 --> 12:30.320
Happy to crop it's remembered the previous settings go.

12:30.310 --> 12:31.910
Go and explore those.

12:31.910 --> 12:35.670
So let's just see whether the slam is more effective.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.800
And here we go.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.760
Here it comes and slamming down and bouncing.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.380
Yes that's exactly the effect I wanted.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.640
I'm really glad it's come out like that.

12:44.750 --> 12:51.860
And finally I don't think looking at this animation whether stretching it is going to make that much

12:51.920 --> 12:52.620
of a difference.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.300
I'm going to give it a quick go and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

13:00.080 --> 13:06.610
And looking at our frames themselves what we've got to bear in mind here is where it impacts the ground

13:06.670 --> 13:07.700
frame six.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.460
That's where it's going to be the most stretched.

13:10.460 --> 13:14.720
So we go to layer scaling that particular layer.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.540
We can see that.

13:16.610 --> 13:21.830
Why don't we just really exaggerate this and take out 256 in height.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.710
And I've run into a slight issue here.

13:28.710 --> 13:33.320
I don't know where that was before so I'm going to undo the scale duplicate the layer.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.480
So I've got a reference layer there.

13:35.640 --> 13:41.590
Then go ahead with the layout and scaling the layer to I dunno 170 this is an arbitrary number.

13:41.670 --> 13:44.610
Forgotten So click that chain link again.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.280
Don't worry if you do that.

13:46.430 --> 13:48.450
So round one 70 scale.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.770
Now I've got an active layer that I can line it back up with.

13:51.810 --> 13:55.040
I'm going to move it slightly to the side and then move it back across.

13:55.050 --> 13:55.590
There we go.

13:55.590 --> 14:00.080
Now I can delete the port colours for completely and I've got a stretched there.

14:00.090 --> 14:05.490
So we've got that we've got the one above it that's absolutely fine and I'm just going.

14:05.570 --> 14:08.440
I don't think those top ones are going to be stretched at all.

14:08.490 --> 14:12.350
But above that's way it hits the ground.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.400
Well let's see what that looks like.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.250
It's got a bit of stretch in it.

14:16.350 --> 14:18.000
There's no squash.

14:18.330 --> 14:25.330
I'm happy to saturate the fall by making it stretched thin as save as slam stretch.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.390
And then.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.600
Save as.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.080
Slam.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.890
Stretch.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.910
Flatten.

14:32.950 --> 14:38.620
Now we can go ahead just flatten these down and hopefully it will all work out.

14:43.260 --> 14:50.530
To got everything there that's go ahead and save that one small and then exports export and will have

14:50.530 --> 14:53.030
remembered all of the previous options.

14:53.030 --> 14:57.290
Go ahead click export and of course test that.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.310
And here we go with the stretch.

14:59.350 --> 15:02.240
I don't think it adds anything to it.

15:02.290 --> 15:09.630
I think in this case my my my gut feeling when I was watching it that the port colours slam.

15:10.540 --> 15:15.910
It's self because it's a rigid body anyway that looks much better than trying to stretch.

15:15.910 --> 15:16.910
In this case.

15:17.160 --> 15:17.860
Excellent.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.540
How did you guys get on.

15:19.540 --> 15:22.320
Looking forward to seeing your work over in the discussions.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.090
And as always I'll see you in the next video.
