00:04.140 --> 00:06.690
Hello everybody and welcome to this challenge video.

00:06.690 --> 00:12.360
By the end of it we'll be going through everything necessary to make a sunset like the one you're seeing

00:12.360 --> 00:13.520
in front of you here.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.260
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:16.260 --> 00:21.340
Here is a reminder of the challenge itself were going to make our own sunset.

00:21.380 --> 00:24.240
I might not change the scene itself.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.910
I may keep the one that we saw in the example.

00:27.210 --> 00:33.450
But if you wanted to you could go ahead and add street lamps houses lights coming on at dusk et cetera

00:33.540 --> 00:34.310
et cetera.

00:34.530 --> 00:38.910
And just an idea of where I'm going with this is this animation here.

00:38.940 --> 00:42.460
The sun setting and then dipping below the horizon.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.970
So without any further ado let's get into it.

00:47.610 --> 00:53.320
OKC opening up gimping getting into it straightaway it's go create a new image now thinking of a sunset.

00:53.320 --> 01:00.730
I think it would be much better if it was a wider aspect than we do 1 to 8 by 64 I don't think I need

01:00.730 --> 01:02.870
that much in the way of heights.

01:02.950 --> 01:06.790
Now I'm going to create a new layer and called it the sky.

01:07.060 --> 01:13.190
Now once it's called Sky I'm gonna use a gradient fill and pick a blue type colour.

01:13.780 --> 01:16.870
And that the sky tends to be blue or directly above.

01:16.870 --> 01:20.050
So we can mimic that by doing something along these lines.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.390
Oh wrong way remember foreground to background.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.990
So there we go the elongate that fits and what.

01:25.990 --> 01:28.610
Right now I am happy with that as the sky.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.180
Now the ground itself there are a couple of ways of managing this.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.140
In this case I'm going to create a new layer.

01:34.150 --> 01:42.250
And because the ground's going to maybe be up to half way up and reduce the height down to 32 when I

01:42.250 --> 01:49.330
go ahead and pop that on I can now go and move the actual source layer itself and making sure we move

01:49.330 --> 01:50.500
the active layer.

01:50.650 --> 01:53.000
Move it down to this half here.

01:53.020 --> 01:57.720
If I don't do that and then do a gradient fill for the ground as well.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.220
Let's do this now.

01:59.350 --> 02:04.520
Let's go and add a darker green just a little bit darker.

02:06.230 --> 02:09.500
Out there it's foreground to the background.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.600
Remember the way it goes.

02:12.190 --> 02:18.690
So this is going to be the background colour so the further away light agreeing now I can go from here

02:18.690 --> 02:20.840
to here and will get that gradient filled.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.570
So that's great.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.030
This is it.

02:22.040 --> 02:29.280
In fact a bit too much in the way of you know the ground it's taking up far too much of my scenes and

02:29.280 --> 02:34.500
going to move the active player and just move down ever so slightly maybe trying to get in the lower

02:34.500 --> 02:37.250
third of our screen.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.090
So there we go.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.980
There's our layers there.

02:39.990 --> 02:46.160
Everything else is going to be in between all the scheme That's called it groundlessly my layers appropriately

02:46.610 --> 02:49.180
to our ground here.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.140
And then we need our sun as well.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.800
Let's go ahead and make a sun.

02:54.990 --> 03:03.270
Now in this case I know I'm going to end up blurring it just because I've done this before in with that

03:03.270 --> 03:09.720
in mind I'm going to make it 64 by 64 so I've got a bit of extra space around my son as you can see

03:09.720 --> 03:17.040
here it's taking up quite a large portion of the screen but it also helped me keep my file sizes down

03:17.040 --> 03:18.670
as well just as I'm developing.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.020
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to plop a big yellow sun in the scene.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.810
I'm quite happy with being there.

03:25.810 --> 03:31.540
Perhaps a little higher if we're doing a sunset or maybe even a little lighter as well if I'm going

03:31.540 --> 03:34.630
to go to my fire code palette at this point in time.

03:34.690 --> 03:39.160
So I've got a much better selection of colours so I'm going to make this a little bit lighter at this

03:39.160 --> 03:39.990
point.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.240
I could have raised it but I'm just going to go smack bang on the top and put that under here.

03:45.250 --> 03:50.400
And then I'm just going to test moving the active layer making sure it disappears below the horizon.

03:50.650 --> 03:51.100
Excellent.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.880
I'm not gonna bother with any clouds in my scene at the moment.

03:54.010 --> 03:59.800
I'm simply going to grab what I've got here and remove the background and make sure we don't need any

03:59.920 --> 04:08.320
superfluous layers and I'm happy with that as my basic layers so I'm going to call this frame hash one

04:08.800 --> 04:12.440
and puts everything in the appropriate way into that frame.

04:12.460 --> 04:18.010
Finally I'm going to grab the frame itself so I can see the one behind it so I can have a better progression.

04:18.010 --> 04:24.030
I'm going to lower the capacity of that frame basically so I can just see the room.

04:24.190 --> 04:27.310
Each one as I go and I unlink sky.

04:27.460 --> 04:33.100
So now it's just a matter of producing the extra frames with the sun going below the horizon.

04:33.250 --> 04:36.700
And to do that is a matter of duplicating the frame.

04:36.850 --> 04:39.760
Finding the sun itself and then moving it.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.620
And of course I can see the previous frame through that layer.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.980
I I'm not going to bore you with doing this on screen.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.860
However I will just speed up the video so you can see me go through the process.

04:54.930 --> 05:02.100
Okay now this point here I've done about five frames and what I'm really thinking of at this point in

05:02.100 --> 05:10.110
time is whether or not I'm going to have the sun changing colour as it goes down and whether I do that

05:10.110 --> 05:12.660
now or in a bit.

05:12.960 --> 05:18.720
Now I am hoping that the overlay that I'll put on some of these as it's dropping behind in fact about

05:18.720 --> 05:24.180
here is the time I'm going to do the overlay So create a new layer at this point and I'm going to call

05:24.180 --> 05:26.000
it darkness.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.260
It does need to be the full size of the image because it's going to change everything which it will

05:31.260 --> 05:31.520
be.

05:31.530 --> 05:38.310
With that now this darkness is an overlay on top of everything else and I'm going to start by giving

05:38.310 --> 05:44.490
everything a slightly orange tint of course when I fill it in it will disappear completely.

05:44.490 --> 05:49.260
Now this is going to be the challenge here I must remember that the past he says 60 the only to turn

05:49.260 --> 05:50.060
it up.

05:50.070 --> 05:55.390
So get a realistic feeling of what's happening within this dark with this darkness layer.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.850
Because if I've already got a pastie on the top one I'm not to see what's really happening.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.540
Glenn said that darkness lay here.

06:03.540 --> 06:06.930
Let's try it at maybe 10 percent.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.360
And then I'm going to flip between the previous frame.

06:11.630 --> 06:16.710
Again I'm going to have to ramp that up to a hundred percent so I can see what's going on.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.050
So that's that one.

06:18.050 --> 06:19.400
And then that's this one.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.250
And there is a very subtle difference.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.030
I'm happy with that difference.

06:23.210 --> 06:30.480
Then as I go ahead and duplicate the rest in fact in this case I am going to continue moving the sun

06:30.560 --> 06:36.970
and I'll worry about changing the darkness as I go making the tint.

06:36.990 --> 06:41.390
I think that's the way I'm going to approach this so that's carry on duplicating these frames and then

06:41.390 --> 06:43.970
moving them to the appropriate location.

06:48.160 --> 06:55.180
Now as I'm doing this one of the things I am doing is athome going and progressing and changing those

06:55.180 --> 07:03.180
colours as I go down to the darkness layer that I've got is actually changing colour each time.

07:03.400 --> 07:08.680
Whether or not I changed the sun at the same time perhaps perhaps to the same colour.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.810
It is an option.

07:10.870 --> 07:14.310
Fortunately I'm just going down here on the colour palette itself.

07:14.470 --> 07:18.930
The worse that happens is that it doesn't work out.

07:18.940 --> 07:24.100
Now the question is whether or not I can see those changes remember any point you can solo particular

07:24.460 --> 07:29.190
sections and make sure that as it's changing it's changing appropriately.

07:29.290 --> 07:34.540
By the looks of this as some flicking between knees I am going to have to increase the capacity of this

07:34.540 --> 07:37.280
darkness layer as it goes up.

07:37.340 --> 07:42.100
I'll worry about that in a bit but I will continue changing the colour of the darkness and the colour

07:42.130 --> 07:45.200
of the sun as it drops below the horizon.

07:45.200 --> 07:50.500
Now I don't think I'm going to get deep enough red at this point but I will say it's Carry on duplicating

07:50.500 --> 07:51.800
and I'll see you again soon.

07:56.740 --> 08:01.750
Now a matter to frame 15 here for Sun has dipped below the horizon.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.300
I do not need any more sunlight.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.130
Some going to delete.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.040
That's the next time I duplicate it.

08:07.210 --> 08:08.380
It's not going to be an issue.

08:08.380 --> 08:15.600
Finally it's a matter of just controlling this darkness layer as I go through and making it progressively.

08:15.700 --> 08:21.970
The increase in that capacity and making increasingly dark at this point and don't do a rapid progression

08:21.970 --> 08:27.550
up to my 20 frames that I've arbitrary decided am going to do 10 frames per second so I end up with

08:27.760 --> 08:30.460
two seconds worth of information.

08:30.460 --> 08:36.580
Now here I can go through and say and in this case work backwards from what I want the darkest frame

08:36.580 --> 08:37.790
to look like.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.780
So go ahead make that dark and raise this up.

08:40.790 --> 08:43.430
I can still see the horizon but not white.

08:43.600 --> 08:50.350
Then this darkness here I'm going to move it's slightly bluer and then add that in and then preview

08:50.350 --> 08:53.040
it here and oscillate between the two.

08:53.040 --> 08:58.570
It is important that you go between two states that are close to one another and make sure that it's

08:58.570 --> 09:01.010
not going to make a horrendous jump.

09:01.130 --> 09:05.860
So here I'm going to make sure the darkness is slightly different.

09:05.860 --> 09:08.650
In fact I think a just coloured in the wrong one.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.170
How here is going to have an increase.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.150
The pastie as well.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.370
And this is going to be the case all the way through.

09:15.400 --> 09:19.390
As the sun starts setting obviously not too strong.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.130
That's darker.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.190
This gotta be lighter.

09:21.190 --> 09:24.460
This one's gotta be lighter again but not that light.

09:24.950 --> 09:28.060
Let's just increase the A pastie and switch between these two.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.800
That's too close.

09:29.890 --> 09:35.740
So what do we have here with the a passive t e is at all why else only to watch.

09:35.740 --> 09:40.580
Further down that the A pastie of these frames is unjust and I think I did switch it up beforehand.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.200
I will just double check.

09:42.370 --> 09:47.650
So that one is fifty six and this one is kind of the same.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.760
So we need to it's 54 So yes it's very close.

09:50.910 --> 09:54.180
We'll go for around 40 on that one to switch between the two.

09:54.520 --> 09:59.940
Yes I'm happy there and we're getting to the point now where the sun did disappear and that's one sense.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.030
This is fine.

10:01.060 --> 10:01.960
Lift this up.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.090
I think we got the colours about right here and see what that looks like.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.350
So the sun is setting and faded away that's apsey fine.

10:11.390 --> 10:17.390
Now the frame 15 lets go through and I'm just repeating this now ad for the sunset must see.

10:17.390 --> 10:19.130
Back in a few moments.

10:24.660 --> 10:30.750
Okay so I have an idea of frayn's now as I'm going through I'm going to test my animation by going to

10:30.750 --> 10:37.080
the animator and just seeing how it plays back and I'm going to play it back at a slower speed.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.670
So I've got a good time to appreciate each individual frame as it goes down.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.390
Now that's actually looks really nice.

10:45.390 --> 10:46.460
I'm happy with that.

10:46.510 --> 10:52.380
And something weird happens on something on frame nine days thing happened.

10:52.380 --> 10:58.470
There are the capacity's and everything I do and turn those back up to a hundred percent now that I

10:58.470 --> 11:03.540
finished looking at each individual layer and the next thing I would need to do or don't need to do.

11:03.650 --> 11:08.430
It's not really a necessity but I do want to add some stars into my scene as well.

11:08.430 --> 11:13.380
Some good attorneys up to 100 percent and I'll see you back in a few moments where we start doing the

11:13.380 --> 11:14.170
stars.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.720
Found the issue here I changed the darkness of the past the values of the darkness.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.290
Here in the wrong order so that one should be the five.

11:27.290 --> 11:31.040
This one should be the ten Not sixty four that would look odd.

11:31.220 --> 11:36.290
Miss when I'm gone for ten again let's increase that to maybe 20.

11:36.290 --> 11:39.920
This one is at twenty's Well let's go for 30.

11:40.010 --> 11:42.400
This one is at 30 that's go for 40.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.160
And again this is all about experimentation at this point.

11:45.170 --> 11:48.530
Is it going to work for what youre doing at the time.

11:48.530 --> 11:49.390
It might not.

11:49.460 --> 11:55.760
Then 50 40 in an it comes back down again because these colours these dark darker colours are going

11:55.760 --> 11:56.990
to show through a little bit more.

11:56.990 --> 12:03.980
So lets go and test that again and then its a matter of going through and adding Yeah thats much much

12:03.980 --> 12:05.980
smoother now thats good.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.390
So lets go through an ADD stars.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.710
So we need to decide Im on which frame do the stars actually appear.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.440
So the sun itself isn't set.

12:15.450 --> 12:21.590
Intill frame 14 something about frame 15 all note that's still too light.

12:21.590 --> 12:28.760
That's still too light I think framed 16 is going to be the right one and I'm just going to get my pencil

12:28.760 --> 12:37.160
tool and then go for a white subs a star the lower the size of that brush down to one and then of course

12:37.280 --> 12:38.360
put a dot.

12:38.360 --> 12:44.570
Now I don't have a star's layer at the moment so let's go ahead and create that stars layer.

12:44.900 --> 12:49.970
Now the stars layer itself is going to be the same size as the Cambers so I can put stars anywhere I

12:49.970 --> 12:53.560
want Unger put my first star up there.

12:53.890 --> 12:59.990
Now in duplicate that stars layer and move it up to the next frame since it doesn't exist there already

13:00.500 --> 13:03.290
said Now I have an existing star there.

13:03.650 --> 13:09.230
I can bring out another two stars perhaps and then I'm going to duplicate that layer again and just

13:09.230 --> 13:11.670
fill in these final three frames.

13:14.950 --> 13:21.910
And there we go I've got my final Starfield So let's go have a look at how the animation plays out and

13:21.910 --> 13:24.830
then of course it's just a matter of exporting it.

13:25.210 --> 13:26.250
Yeah there we go.

13:26.260 --> 13:32.080
If I think he looks better than before so I'm going to go ahead and save my work which I haven't done

13:32.080 --> 13:32.440
yet.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.080
GS Well under in these challenges I'm bad at saving.

13:35.080 --> 13:42.320
I do apologize and let's go through here and while I don't know which lecture were unfit or fourteens.

13:42.340 --> 13:43.090
There you go.

13:43.260 --> 13:43.750
15

13:46.030 --> 13:49.670
sun sets and stars.

13:50.190 --> 13:53.630
So there we go there's my gimp file saved.

13:53.710 --> 13:59.380
I'm going to have to compress these down so I'm also going to make a new farce straightaway by saving

13:59.410 --> 14:02.100
as and call this flaten.

14:02.230 --> 14:08.290
Now I always recommend making this flaten file as a separate FA because the worst thing in the world

14:08.290 --> 14:14.800
to do would be to suddenly compress all of these labour groups together and then literally be unable

14:14.800 --> 14:21.400
to edit them easily because once you've done this for instance manipulating the stars position or just

14:21.700 --> 14:25.650
changing a frame around is going to be next to impossible.

14:25.660 --> 14:30.730
In fact what we've done here with all this blending this darkness this overlay that we've got there

14:31.060 --> 14:34.690
it would be literally a wouldn't be impossible.

14:34.690 --> 14:39.760
I'm not going to say that but it would be a lot of hard work to try and fix that where you could have

14:39.760 --> 14:41.590
avoided it in the first place.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.230
Always be thinking forward.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.330
Never be afraid to use loads of layers.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.210
That's absolutely fine.

14:48.290 --> 14:52.090
Now in this particular case I could go through and optimize it further.

14:52.090 --> 14:59.620
I'm not going to at this point that's a conscious decision but I am going to go through and now save

14:59.710 --> 15:07.300
the flattened version and then export as and call Its which is opened up elsewhere and call it the same

15:07.300 --> 15:14.500
thing dot Giff and now contains layers extend the and the actual borders that's fine.

15:14.510 --> 15:19.690
Just warning me under to lose information by doing this and the delay between the frames and I'm going

15:19.690 --> 15:22.030
to make sure I'm replacing.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.680
And let's have a look at what that looks like.

15:25.690 --> 15:26.320
So here we go.

15:26.320 --> 15:32.380
That looks pretty sweet to me but what I will do just to make sure that everybody can see it properly

15:32.380 --> 15:33.630
is at this point.

15:33.770 --> 15:41.230
I'm going to turn up my image size with the interpellation turned to none and I'm going to make sure

15:41.230 --> 15:47.620
it's linked together and how can I make it five 12 in size and scale that is now going to be much bigger.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.780
But I still have that pixel art feel about it.

15:49.780 --> 15:55.000
I'm going to export to overwriting the previous file so I don't have to change any of those settings.

15:55.010 --> 15:56.800
Take a few seconds to do.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.570
And now there we go it's much bigger and you guys can see it more clearly.

16:01.570 --> 16:02.380
Excellent.

16:02.380 --> 16:03.750
How did you guys get on.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.170
Love to see what you did with your sunset's or whether you went on a slightly different tangent and

16:08.170 --> 16:12.350
bought a house there with the lights coming on and off Wall Street lights etc..

16:12.490 --> 16:18.090
Love to see it do share your work in the discussions and I will see you old in the next lecture.
