00:02.700 --> 00:04.280
Why.

00:04.820 --> 00:08.480
Hello everyone and welcome to a colour change over time.

00:08.540 --> 00:12.100
A great example of that is this sunset we can see in front of us.

00:12.230 --> 00:16.430
Not only is the sun changing colour but the whole scene changes as well.

00:16.430 --> 00:19.460
This is relatively straightforward to do now.

00:19.510 --> 00:23.320
We will also have a look an error message you can get.

00:23.360 --> 00:30.740
I've upscaled this image chaser's easy to see if I go ahead and try and make my image size itself by

00:30.740 --> 00:32.110
scaling an image.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.940
1 0 2 4 by 1 or 2 4 and try and scale it.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.980
We get an out of memory error and we'll discuss how to sort that out as well.

00:41.450 --> 00:47.870
Okay so before we get into the nitty gritty of what's going on in this particular image just a quick

00:47.900 --> 00:51.480
autopsy of the whole thing as it currently stands.

00:51.590 --> 00:54.360
To kind of get an idea of what's going on.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.110
Now obviously the animation start at the bottom so we can scroll all the way down.

00:58.170 --> 01:04.370
If we start from frame 1 and isolate it we can see there's a sky there's a ground and there's a horizon

01:04.670 --> 01:10.520
and the sun slowly lowers through the sky as the sun lowers through the sky you've all seen a sunset

01:10.550 --> 01:16.520
before it changes colour as it goes down eventually causing a bit of a haze as it comes towards the

01:16.520 --> 01:25.010
horizon and you can see the vullo groups themselves start to get more and more complex as we go up.

01:25.010 --> 01:26.780
There's more detail going on.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.990
We've got overlays making the whole thing dark.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.490
Now we've got the sunsets.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.070
And as the sunset comes out you know what I thought would be a great addition.

01:35.180 --> 01:41.630
A couple of stars coming out until finally it just gets dark over those 20 frames and we can see all

01:41.630 --> 01:43.280
the stars in the sky.

01:43.430 --> 01:49.300
Now not only do we have 20 frames in this particular animation but there are multiple layers on here.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.340
Not all of them have been optimized.

01:51.380 --> 01:58.670
When I was working with the sun itself I had a problem because the layer size itself the lower boundary

01:58.670 --> 02:00.750
was just around the sun itself.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.320
And when you have something like that when it comes to blurring and we're have a look a blurring as

02:06.320 --> 02:12.170
well it was just blurring inside that Square and obviously the sun is not a square.

02:12.230 --> 02:14.470
It is a circle so a have a closer look.

02:14.480 --> 02:21.050
That's the same sort of things applies to something like a candle for instance how colour change over

02:21.050 --> 02:24.650
time or colour change over the surface depending on the temperature.

02:24.710 --> 02:28.870
This is all part of making a convincing animation.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.940
Okay so now we've had the autopsy of the image out of the way let's take it back a little and have a

02:34.940 --> 02:41.360
closer look at building something like that up from scratch and a few other tools and tips as you go

02:41.360 --> 02:41.970
along.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.330
So first of all of course we need an image.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.100
Let's go ahead and create a new image.

02:46.100 --> 02:51.280
In this case I'm going to make it 64 by 64 to demonstrate what's going on.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.930
Now I've got a brush here.

02:54.020 --> 02:59.150
Let's go for the pencil tool and I'm going to make this about 20 in size.

02:59.210 --> 03:03.570
Now for the pallets itself I'm going to pick four fire code pallete.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.020
So I've got a nice selection of white all the way through to a black.

03:08.030 --> 03:13.580
But going through the yellows oranges and reds as well as the name suggests this is good for anything

03:13.940 --> 03:15.530
that burns.

03:15.530 --> 03:20.970
So in this case I'm going to go pick an orange and dump an orange circle in the middle.

03:20.990 --> 03:27.470
Now one of the tools I use a lot whether it's to make something slightly blurry or to smudge it into

03:27.470 --> 03:34.960
a certain shape is the smudged tool that is the picture of a finger on the tool shelf we consider shortcut

03:34.990 --> 03:42.110
keys s if we go ahead and use that what we can do is we can change the way our image looks and you can

03:42.110 --> 03:45.850
see you can make a ball of fire very easily using this.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.350
They did have the bear in mind in this particular layer.

03:48.350 --> 03:52.440
I can move white in as well because White is the background there.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.030
So you always have to start where there's a bit of colour and then move it about.

03:56.030 --> 04:00.570
Now you can build up a flame as you can probably see very quickly with this technique.

04:00.570 --> 04:05.990
Now you can lay down with the brush or pencil you know bang in the middle and start smudging again and

04:05.990 --> 04:11.990
this is just one way of building up something like a flame or a fireball or anything else along those

04:11.990 --> 04:13.970
lines it doesn't have to be fire.

04:13.970 --> 04:18.410
It just happens to be the colours that I'm using at the moment that make the most sense.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.170
And then finally I can make a circle in the middle a bit smaller and a bit of white white means it's

04:24.170 --> 04:25.790
going to be really hot.

04:25.850 --> 04:31.460
And then once again kind of smudge that in and there we go we've got a flame.

04:31.490 --> 04:36.320
Now of course you can do a very similar thing if you've got a that let's see the paint brush tool instead

04:36.320 --> 04:37.620
of smudging it in.

04:37.670 --> 04:41.500
We can have a low pass city on our paint brush.

04:41.620 --> 04:46.790
If we have it set too high and we go in let's say try and create a red border around this.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.740
It's going to look quite horrible.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.630
However what we can do is turn down the capacity and then it's going to take many many more strokes

04:53.900 --> 04:56.600
in order to lay down that border.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.170
And this is where we can get some fine control over our artwork.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.330
So one of the things.

05:02.490 --> 05:08.640
I was considering when I was making the sunset was how is the what's the quickest way that I can do

05:08.640 --> 05:12.510
this sunsets with out spending too long doing it.

05:12.510 --> 05:13.970
I don't know what it's going to look like.

05:13.970 --> 05:16.470
I want to be experimental and quick about it.

05:16.470 --> 05:22.410
And with most things it is a good idea to be as quick as you can about it to get a good idea of what

05:22.410 --> 05:23.320
you need to do.

05:23.460 --> 05:31.350
And that goes with art especially it's very easy to end up doing a lot of work for not a lot of gain

05:31.360 --> 05:35.550
you know you start tweaking something making it look better in this way make it look better in that

05:35.550 --> 05:36.060
way.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.150
To be honest it doesn't really matter.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.920
On the first pass as long as you get a good idea of the rough shape the form how it's going to look

05:43.920 --> 05:45.820
how it's going to move in the turn.

05:45.870 --> 05:49.570
In the animation terms then that's a good starting point.

05:49.860 --> 05:55.450
If I go ahead now and create a new image we can start building up something like the sunset straight

05:55.450 --> 05:56.310
away.

05:56.310 --> 06:01.300
Now I had a horizon that I had made using the gradient fill.

06:01.410 --> 06:05.190
I'd found one called land and I literally drew that on there.

06:05.190 --> 06:08.180
That's my background at this point.

06:08.190 --> 06:12.660
I wanted to separate the sky and the ground from one another.

06:12.660 --> 06:19.790
So I got this retain give a select tool and cut that bottom bit out created a new layer.

06:19.920 --> 06:25.110
In this case I'm going to call it ground and we can rename the other one the moment paste it in and

06:25.110 --> 06:29.540
then anchor it in such as reinforcing what we've been over so far.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.180
Then of course we've got the sky now the ground itself.

06:33.180 --> 06:39.840
We need that to be on top of any sum that actually happens or as it comes down so there's the sun in

06:39.840 --> 06:44.190
the sky Let's create that on a new layer and I'm going to call it Sun.

06:44.310 --> 06:49.440
So we're just piecing together our particular layer here there's the sun and what we should be able

06:49.440 --> 06:55.410
to do is making sure we move it we can see that it disappears as it goes below the horizon.

06:55.410 --> 07:02.610
Now what I didn't know before I showed you the image we had earlier it was what I was going to do with

07:02.610 --> 07:05.930
the sun with all the smudging that I was doing with it.

07:05.970 --> 07:10.130
So I ended up going to layer and auto cropping the layer to small.

07:10.130 --> 07:16.140
And obviously if you do that then smudge you end up with the smudgy square rather than being able to

07:16.140 --> 07:23.310
smudge it out so I had to go through each of the ones that I was smudging about and go to layer and

07:23.310 --> 07:24.600
layer to image size.

07:24.600 --> 07:30.270
In this case just so I could smudge it out a little more and in fact you know I could put clouds floating

07:30.270 --> 07:35.730
through the sky would be an example here using that Smudge tool I've created a fluffy white cloud.

07:35.730 --> 07:42.270
And again you could go in and let's say with the brush tool just add a few dark spots on the underside

07:42.390 --> 07:48.060
and you see how that starts giving it a bit of three dimensionality because we've included some value

07:48.090 --> 07:54.960
in this cloud it's now got a shadow underneath it and that's the way that our brains do perceive things

07:54.960 --> 08:00.090
shadow tends to be underneath and highlights and light tends to be on top.

08:00.180 --> 08:07.070
If you don't conform to that it can be confusing for the viewer who is looking at your work.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.520
Now once of course you've got your basic layers.

08:09.530 --> 08:14.760
And so I've got a cloud there now so I'm going to create a new layer and called it Sun change the sun

08:14.760 --> 08:19.270
layer back to cloud because all that is bad let's try that again cloud.

08:19.320 --> 08:19.910
There we go.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.240
And we've got a sun that's just name it properly.

08:22.290 --> 08:26.700
Now we can go ahead and create a layer group and I'm going to call that as always frame hash.

08:26.700 --> 08:32.670
Once I can build up hot necked the ground is going to be on top of everything because it's in the foreground

08:32.730 --> 08:37.560
that's important it's at the front of the image as the sun comes down which there isn't one yet so I

08:37.670 --> 08:42.870
put the sun for instance on going makes like the yellow to make it stand out and use the pencil tool

08:42.870 --> 08:44.290
so that's really bold.

08:44.340 --> 08:49.760
Now I want the cloud to be in naturally in front of the sun some sorting out the order here as well

08:49.770 --> 08:52.680
as I build up my labour group.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.750
So I'm just put everything in the lay group initially.

08:55.860 --> 09:02.670
We go all sky has gone on top it's not it's the background the ground itself needs to be on top of everything

09:02.760 --> 09:05.870
else because it goes below the horizon it's off there.

09:06.020 --> 09:12.930
You can see here now got this cloud I can move the cloud about as part of the animation as well all

09:12.990 --> 09:15.510
bringing it together rather well.

09:15.510 --> 09:21.730
Finally as the sun was setting there were a couple of things that you could potentially do now.

09:21.750 --> 09:28.790
One of them is to just have a film layer over the entire lots of we go ahead and create a new layer.

09:29.160 --> 09:34.620
And in this case I'm going to call it the darkness because essentially that's what it is or you could

09:34.620 --> 09:40.160
call it a gradient it's entirely up to you but this darkness goes over absolutely everything.

09:40.190 --> 09:46.690
If I go and grab my fill buckets and just let's say khara in black obviously the whole thing go black.

09:46.890 --> 09:53.310
But this time I can adjust the pastie of the layer and you can see that's what you could do jobs that

09:53.550 --> 09:56.490
look a tiny bit odd with the sun still in the sky.

09:56.490 --> 10:01.920
So forgive me for that but you can see you could have a frame like this and as the sun dips down you

10:01.920 --> 10:02.140
can.

10:02.210 --> 10:07.880
Make it progressively darker and darker and darker until it goes really dark.

10:07.880 --> 10:14.910
And if you change the colour of this you can give everything perhaps a red tint to it or indeed and

10:14.930 --> 10:19.400
you can see he you can drag and drop a colour over to a layer and it will fill in with that layer as

10:19.400 --> 10:20.020
well.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.840
So you could give the whole world an orange tint.

10:22.840 --> 10:27.340
It's a very quick way of experimenting with slightly different colour schemes.

10:27.350 --> 10:34.310
In fact in this case you could almost give something a sepia type effect just adding in a bit of a yellow

10:34.310 --> 10:40.450
or orange tint to it and turning that up and suddenly you've got maybe a Western type scene.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.340
Obviously wouldn't have the green grass at the front as well.

10:45.380 --> 10:50.300
And then of course the next thing to do was to go through and duplicate the frame as we've done before

10:50.540 --> 10:56.310
and then have a good think about how you want things being visible and how you don't want to be invisible.

10:56.330 --> 10:59.720
In this case as I was doing the sun I would select.

10:59.750 --> 11:07.910
But in this case down here I'd select the sun don't layer and auto crop the layer round so I've got

11:07.910 --> 11:14.570
the border of that sun and then the next sun itself I know where to place it because of the previous

11:14.630 --> 11:15.190
outline.

11:15.230 --> 11:16.970
Of course you can do this in numerous ways.

11:16.970 --> 11:24.200
One of the easiest ways again would would be to actually grab the frame itself the whole layer group

11:24.530 --> 11:26.480
and reduce its opacity sir.

11:26.540 --> 11:32.330
Let's lower it down to 50 percent and then you can see through to the previous one as well and they

11:32.330 --> 11:34.160
will build upon one another.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.870
So in this case I could have it 50 percent for everything at the frame.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.600
The topless said 50 I'm pretty sure it did.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.160
So we can see it under there.

11:42.350 --> 11:48.380
And then I can go and grab my son and the move tool and making sure under the tool options were moving

11:48.380 --> 11:56.060
the active layer only I can move it down there and then I can duplicate that frame again find my son

11:56.300 --> 12:03.680
move it down here etc etc. As soon as that setting has given changed the colour of the sun as well.

12:03.680 --> 12:09.710
And of course adjust the other parameters for everything else perhaps move the cloud across and then

12:10.040 --> 12:16.040
when you go to your animation and play back you can see that we've got a very short three frame here

12:16.040 --> 12:20.930
one where the sun is dropping and the cloud is just shuffling backwards and forwards not the greatest

12:20.930 --> 12:27.170
of animations but it's the beginnings and the building blocks for something that will end up really

12:27.170 --> 12:28.640
really good.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.350
Now finally one of the issues you can have when you've got a load of layers.

12:32.450 --> 12:37.260
First of all try and optimize them so once you had once you've done with everything go in and layer

12:37.340 --> 12:43.520
auto crop the layer bring it back down to a sensible size that uses less memory then.

12:43.670 --> 12:50.720
But one of the other things you can do is go to Edit preferences and this is where you can start playing

12:50.720 --> 12:52.140
about with your options.

12:52.250 --> 12:55.160
So maximum new image size.

12:55.160 --> 12:59.750
Now we're starting to work with many many layers and on larger images as well.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.400
You're going to start hitting some bottlenecks.

13:02.420 --> 13:09.650
So in this case what I can do is go to my maximum new image size and to demonstrate this live I'm going

13:09.650 --> 13:16.400
to go to a project that does require some go hope head and open up my sunset so I've made I'm going

13:16.400 --> 13:22.070
to go to my layer and actually invoke that error message that came before me as a scare.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.070
No I'm not Moscow.

13:23.140 --> 13:29.200
And on a scale the entire image it's going to scale up to one to four.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.390
And when we do that we get the error message.

13:32.450 --> 13:36.620
So you're trying to create an image with a size of 490 megabytes.

13:36.620 --> 13:42.440
Now this is actually quite large considering it's basically pixel art at this stage but it is because

13:42.440 --> 13:48.260
of the multitude of layers that are being used at this point and scale in the image to the chosen size

13:48.260 --> 13:54.280
or make use more memory than what is configured as the maximum image size in the preferences dialogue.

13:54.290 --> 14:01.750
So if I go ahead and scale that it will actually work but it'll exceed that memory requirement.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.160
And we can go ahead in edit once it's finished doing it.

14:05.420 --> 14:08.270
Now some tasks in GIMP do last longer.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.900
There we go it's finished doing that.

14:09.990 --> 14:12.780
If we have gone in I'm going to undo that.

14:12.920 --> 14:19.100
The Undo is going to go back to the base image and now this time go to preferences and change the new

14:19.130 --> 14:20.300
image size.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.790
Let's Trush try five 12 in this case.

14:22.790 --> 14:29.640
Now I don't suggest that you go in change fees unless it's absolutely necessary at this point.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.670
What you can accidentally end up doing is making guimpe unstable or unusable.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.660
If you don't have much RAM on your computer.

14:38.560 --> 14:43.700
So now that I've done that change in the preferences I can go to image scale image.

14:43.730 --> 14:53.010
Now when I do the 1 0 2 for scaling it should work because 490 is less than 512.

14:53.020 --> 14:56.190
And we can see it doesn't complain about it anymore.

14:56.350 --> 15:02.890
And there we go we've got ourselves a nice sunset all scaled up ready to share with people.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.980
And that leads us nicely now on to a challenge.

15:09.290 --> 15:12.620
And your challenge is going to be to go and make your own sunset.

15:12.740 --> 15:16.180
Now you're going to have a bit of free reign with the length of your animation.

15:16.190 --> 15:23.060
Again I suggest you keep it under five seconds if nothing else for your own sanity and your resolution.

15:23.150 --> 15:26.470
Go for around 128 by 128.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.170
Now feel free to change the scene.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.080
Put your own spin on it.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.380
At this stage in the course you're more than capable of putting your own spin on it and making these

15:36.380 --> 15:38.430
challenges more of your own.

15:38.450 --> 15:44.360
Obviously following a long and completing the challenge see you've got the work done is important but

15:44.360 --> 15:50.450
equally what's important is being able to take what you've learnt and reapply it and make sure you do

15:50.450 --> 15:53.900
do your own mini projects in between these challenges.

15:54.010 --> 16:00.050
An example of makee perhaps your own would be to maybe add some street lamps or indeed houses lights

16:00.050 --> 16:06.920
coming on at dusk and just give you an idea of what I had gone for in my example.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.700
We got stars coming out of the sun setting.

16:09.740 --> 16:17.240
I've made that slight blur as it drops below the horizon and the whole tint changes to a deep red before

16:17.240 --> 16:19.490
going and fading darker again.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.770
So there we go there is your challenge.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.660
Good luck.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.250
I shall see you on the other side.

16:24.250 --> 16:29.110
Looking forward to seeing your work and I will see you all in the next lecture.
