00:04.030 --> 00:06.220
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:06.220 --> 00:10.360
This is going to be a challenge in making a composite image.

00:10.480 --> 00:15.650
So were going to be bringing two or more images into one new image.

00:15.790 --> 00:20.980
Remembering of course that you can create your new image slightly larger than 32 by 32.

00:20.980 --> 00:27.400
In order to accommodate the extra information that's coming in I would suggest 48 by 48.

00:27.400 --> 00:33.490
And of course you can go all the way to 64 by 64 if you've got enough information to fill that space

00:33.490 --> 00:34.010
up.

00:34.180 --> 00:37.510
And finally I cannot wait to see what you guys come up with.

00:37.540 --> 00:42.880
Do remember to show your work with us because I love seeing what you've created and some of the stuff

00:42.880 --> 00:43.840
you've done so far.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.810
It's absolutely blown me away.

00:45.820 --> 00:51.760
I wouldn't have thought at 32 by 30 or even less would be able to get some of the quality work you've

00:51.820 --> 00:52.900
already been showing.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.540
So thank you for showing.

00:54.610 --> 01:01.440
So now go ahead pause a video and go and bring two or more images together into a new image.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.740
Okay welcome back.

01:05.740 --> 01:11.680
Let's go ahead now and I'm going to go through and make my composer image using all of the skills that

01:11.680 --> 01:13.530
we have learnt so far.

01:15.130 --> 01:20.450
Okay so we're back over in Jim and the first thing I'm going to do is create my new image where the

01:20.470 --> 01:22.470
composing image is going to be made.

01:22.630 --> 01:27.050
I'm going to make it 48 By 40 I think it's going to be a good size at this point.

01:27.070 --> 01:30.850
And then you do control shift in Jay to bring it up full size.

01:30.850 --> 01:31.490
Excellent.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.910
So now that that image is ready I need my other images that I'm going to bring across.

01:35.920 --> 01:40.490
I'm going to go through and open recent and again open my dual swords.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.340
I'm going to open up my fire.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.620
I do like that fire.

01:43.630 --> 01:50.230
And then finally I'm going to open up my shield as well so I've got my three main items that I'm going

01:50.230 --> 01:52.930
to move across into the new image.

01:52.930 --> 01:57.430
Now I'm going to start with this fire because it's going to be the background and when you drag things

01:57.430 --> 02:01.180
across of course they're going to come in in the order that you drag them.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.900
And I want the fire to be first so I don't have to reorganize it.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.990
I'm going to turn off my back ground because I just want the fire itself and not the black background

02:10.990 --> 02:12.270
coming across.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.390
With that in mind I'm going to click and drag through that cross and drop it in.

02:17.410 --> 02:18.600
There's one fire.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.890
Now I'm going to be lean as I do this.

02:20.890 --> 02:26.220
I'm going to rename this fire straight away so that I know what it is.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.040
Obviously I can see what it is as well.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.640
And I'm going to move it roughly into the right position.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.390
I'm going to pop it at the bottom of my screen.

02:33.490 --> 02:40.200
Kate next thing to move across will be I'm going to do the shield first An And that's already set up.

02:40.210 --> 02:45.640
I'm happy with it being compressed from these three layers into this one.

02:45.640 --> 02:51.970
I'm going to move that across and I'm going to lift that up a little maybe two about the.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.080
And across a little more maybe there yet that's in the centre.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.350
And this one's not in the centre.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.480
So I'm going to try and the line them as best I can.

03:01.630 --> 03:05.350
And of course I need to rename that appropriately.

03:05.620 --> 03:10.300
Now the reason why I've left this saud's Till last is because I'm going to do something slightly different

03:10.300 --> 03:10.810
here.

03:10.840 --> 03:17.380
I will want the ability I think I'm not sure but to move these swords individually so I'm going to click

03:17.380 --> 03:24.190
on their layers themselves and move them across into the new image that we're creating.

03:24.190 --> 03:28.980
Now of course we might not need do that but just as a starting point there we go.

03:29.300 --> 03:35.980
Now with moving I'm going to make sure pick a layer or guide is on to begin with and that will enable

03:35.980 --> 03:43.830
me to just move these independently of each other and very quickly allow me to rearrange the image and

03:43.830 --> 03:50.740
will zoom out just one level and use the control key and the mouse will to do so course I can use the

03:50.740 --> 03:57.250
percentage indicator at the bottom as well if I want to and this gives me an overall idea of how this

03:57.250 --> 03:58.150
is looking.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.950
Now I'm going to see if I can spread these swords out to little more.

04:00.950 --> 04:08.490
Remove it to pixels that way in two pixels this way and maybe a couple more pixels down.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.450
Now of course this doesn't have to be perfectly aligned.

04:11.530 --> 04:18.610
However I'm quite liking that going to bring in maybe a couple more pixels that will enable us to see

04:18.610 --> 04:22.400
more of the actual shilled behind here.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.720
I'm liking that arrangement at the moment.

04:24.760 --> 04:30.820
It seems quite equal around so in order to make sure that I don't ruin that I'm going to go ahead and

04:30.820 --> 04:35.770
just click the two linked items unhappy happy with the shilled position Israel's I'm going to link that.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.810
Now this fire what can we do.

04:37.810 --> 04:38.470
The fire.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.810
It looks a bit small.

04:39.970 --> 04:41.880
I might be able to make it bigger.

04:42.130 --> 04:45.020
And another way of making it bigger would be to have two of them.

04:45.110 --> 04:53.080
Going to select my fire layer and then go and duplicate it has obviously become a little bit darker

04:53.120 --> 04:57.830
Whereas alferd out before but this will now enable me hopefully because it is 32.

04:57.830 --> 05:02.050
By 32 I should be able to spread these fires out.

05:02.170 --> 05:08.890
Unfortunately even though I selected the other layer I managed to select the appropriate fire.

05:08.890 --> 05:16.990
There we go that spread out nicely across the back now with there being a white background that does

05:16.990 --> 05:19.810
not suit our image at the moment that's all.

05:19.910 --> 05:23.740
So I'm going to go ahead to my background and with the blend tool.

05:23.740 --> 05:29.170
I'm going to create a blend from the bottom to the top and I'm going to hold down control just to make

05:29.170 --> 05:31.940
sure that's completely straight and vertical.

05:32.210 --> 05:37.870
Okay so our initial attempt here has kind of worked but I'm not.

05:37.870 --> 05:42.910
I'm not getting it is not dark enough for long enough some good to go from about half way and then go

05:42.970 --> 05:44.070
up from there.

05:45.390 --> 05:47.100
Okay that looks pretty good.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.600
I'm much happier with how it's darker for longer.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.040
And also that the shield itself stands out at the top.

05:54.060 --> 05:57.240
And of course the fire stands out at the bottom.

05:57.770 --> 06:04.150
Now finally just to top this off I think I want a border around my scene itself.

06:04.170 --> 06:05.220
I've got set up.

06:05.390 --> 06:10.810
I'm going to just link in the fires as well so if I decide to do anything and move things about I can

06:10.810 --> 06:13.220
do I can move the whole lot at once now.

06:13.730 --> 06:16.260
So that's a great position to be in.

06:16.730 --> 06:18.730
I hope I've put that back in the centre.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.120
Looks about right to me.

06:20.390 --> 06:20.800
Okay.

06:20.870 --> 06:24.110
So now that that's done I can go ahead and create my board.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.670
I'm going to quit in New Labour to do that.

06:25.670 --> 06:31.610
I want it 48 and I'm going to name it border straightaway and then lift that right to the top because

06:31.610 --> 06:34.270
I want the border on top of everything else.

06:34.430 --> 06:36.710
Now there are a couple of ways of doing this.

06:36.740 --> 06:40.220
Grab the pencil tool and just draw a board around the edge.

06:40.220 --> 06:46.540
I'm going to just select everything go to select border and set it to one pixel.

06:47.240 --> 06:47.530
Click.

06:47.550 --> 06:48.350
Okay.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.510
There we go we've got a board a selection around our object.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.450
I'm I'm going to fill that in with black for the moment.

06:54.450 --> 06:59.580
I might choose to do something else later and it's quite interesting how just a simple board like that

06:59.940 --> 07:01.580
really does focus.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.350
It does.

07:02.370 --> 07:09.630
If I do that for a second it really does make the rest of it stand out as an individual icon.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.150
I'm liking how that's looking.

07:12.150 --> 07:12.830
Excellent.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.550
And of course because I am happy with that I will want to go ahead and save my work.

07:17.550 --> 07:19.470
So let's go and save as.

07:19.560 --> 07:24.600
Now I'm going to save it as something very specific because then I know exactly what it is you will

07:24.600 --> 07:27.450
name yours appropriately to whatever you're doing.

07:27.930 --> 07:28.470
Excellent.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.950
How how did you guys get.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.500
I'm sure you've created something much better than this.

07:33.570 --> 07:37.660
Please do share your work over in the discussion so we can see how you're getting on.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.340
And I will see you all in the next lecture.
