Hello and welcome.

00:06.660 --> 00:11.190
First of all we need to make sure that we've got guimpe installed on our computers.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.440
Now if you've already got it installed and you know it's version two point eight point twenty you'll

00:16.440 --> 00:17.850
want to jump forward.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.920
Otherwise let's make sure we've got it installed.

00:21.060 --> 00:26.610
Now gimp comes as standard on a lot of Linux distribution so you may already have it installed and you

00:26.610 --> 00:28.510
might have an old version installed.

00:28.650 --> 00:32.750
And because this course is going to start in version two point eight point to zero.

00:32.850 --> 00:36.360
It is important that you have that version or greater.

00:36.510 --> 00:43.680
So you can follow along with the course now because GIMP is a free program and its open source.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
That means that someone can grab the gimp program and make it into their own whatever.

00:49.650 --> 00:56.160
And there was a version of guimpe called guimpe shop a few years back and that is still around and it

00:56.160 --> 01:04.320
was kind of stolen from the original developer and is full of narced these so I would avoid it and just

01:04.320 --> 01:07.120
get the standard gimp installation.

01:07.130 --> 01:14.160
Now when you go to WW dump gimp dot org you will find that the the landing page has a big red button

01:14.160 --> 01:18.460
on it with saying on it saying download two point eight point to zero.

01:18.490 --> 01:24.960
We go ahead and click on that we get a couple of other options and we can download gimp.

01:24.960 --> 01:31.950
Now if you are on a Mac or Linux you'll have a different page or if it's detected your operating system

01:31.950 --> 01:36.970
incorrectly you can show downloads for the other operating systems.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.880
There now is around seventy four megabytes in size.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.370
It will vary depending on the platform that you're installing it for.

01:44.370 --> 01:52.170
But once it has downloaded go ahead and click the installation and start going through the usual process

01:52.200 --> 01:53.190
of installing it.

01:53.190 --> 01:56.330
If you install it to a customized location that's fine.

01:56.430 --> 01:59.750
I am going to do a stock installation.

01:59.910 --> 02:04.620
So we just let that install and I'd like you to do the same as well.

02:04.620 --> 02:10.410
Now after a few minutes has passed you should have gimp installed on your computer and throughout this

02:10.410 --> 02:17.610
course you will often be presented with the challenge and I whole heartedly encourage you to take the

02:17.610 --> 02:23.970
challenge by the horns and do it even if it seems simple at first because it really does solidify your

02:23.970 --> 02:30.780
knowledge and the challenge for this particular lecture is I'd like you to install the latest version

02:30.780 --> 02:34.950
of gimp and then go ahead and start the program.

02:34.950 --> 02:40.280
Now if you already have gimp installed do check its version if you've not got the latest version.

02:40.350 --> 02:45.480
Install the latest version of gimp and then I'd like you to jump straight into the next lecture.

02:45.660 --> 02:51.420
Now the reason for that is rather than doing anything in GIMP is gimp itself on its first launch can

02:51.420 --> 02:55.330
take several minutes to open on my computer.

02:55.350 --> 03:01.710
The one I'm recording this on it took about two minutes to start and my older Mac threw in the other

03:01.710 --> 03:02.310
room.

03:02.310 --> 03:08.170
It took about 10 to 15 minutes I had to go grab a cup of tea as we do in England.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.830
Whilst I was waiting.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.370
But we have some important information that's useful for you in taking this course.

03:14.370 --> 03:18.310
So let the next lecture play and I will see you again shortly.
