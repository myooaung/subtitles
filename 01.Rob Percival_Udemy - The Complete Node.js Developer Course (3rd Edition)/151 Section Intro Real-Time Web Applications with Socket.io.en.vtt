Welcome to Section 17 on real time applications with node j s in this section.

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.070
You're gonna build the fourth and final app for the class.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.230
That is our chat application.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.860
So with a chat application and other apps like it we need real time data transfer.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
So as soon as User 1 sends a message.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.260
User 2 should be able to see it.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.550
We want as little delay as possible between user 1 sending the message and user to seeing it.

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.680
So to get that done we are going to create a real time no J.S. app and along the way we'll be exploring

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.340
web sockets and the very popular socket dot I O library that's going to give us everything we need to

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.990
set up real time apps with node j s so let's go ahead and get started.
