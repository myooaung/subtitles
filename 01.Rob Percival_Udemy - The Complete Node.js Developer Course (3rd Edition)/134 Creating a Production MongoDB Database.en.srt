1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,570
In this lesson we're going to start the process of deploying the task manager application to production.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,120
Now this was originally going to be a single video and I actually filmed it but it got a bit complex

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,290
and a bit long.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,370
So I'm redoing it breaking it up into two lessons in this lesson.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,240
The goal is to get a production ready Mongo DB database and then the next lesson will actually set everything

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,670
up on Heroku to get our application deployed and working with that new database.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,150
But as mentioned step number one is to get a production ready database in place.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,920
Right now the only database we have is the one running locally on our machine and that's not going to

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,380
work for when we deploy our application to Heroku.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,480
We want to use a mongo D.B. hosting service to get a database up and running that our Heroku app can

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,400
connect to.

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,740
Now there are dozens of different companies and services that offer Mongo D.B. database hosting and

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,750
the Mongo DB organization.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,930
They actually have their own solution called Atlas and that's what we're gonna be using for this class.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,640
So let's get started by heading over to the browser and we're going to work through all of this together

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,320
because getting it set up for the very first time can be a little tricky and I don't want to leave you

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,680
hanging with the setup process.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,330
So over here in the browser WE'RE GONNA GOOGLE Mongo D.B. Atlas.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,270
This is going to bring us to the Mongo D.B. Atlas home page and it should look something like this.

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,440
That's Mongo DB.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,030
Dot com buzzwords slash cloud forward slash Atlas.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,610
Now once again there are plenty of different solutions we could have gone with.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,510
I'm using this one because it's created by the Mongo D.B. organization so everything is always nice

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,500
and up to date and they have a generous free tier so we can get started for free forever and then upgrade

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,020
when we have a lot of users.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,210
And it actually makes sense right here we're gonna go ahead and get started for free by clicking start

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,260
for free and that'll bring us down to a sign up form down below.

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,120
Now as mentioned the setup process can be a bit tricky so we'll go ahead and work through everything

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,020
together starting by just registering for an account right here.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,160
Let's go ahead and get that done.

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,260
I'll pick a password

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,480
and then we're gonna go ahead and agree to the terms of service and we'll click get started for free.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,230
Now once again no need to provide anything like a credit card to get started.

34
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,380
You can get started just by creating an account.

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,210
We can go ahead and close the little welcome screen and actually dive into the configuration.

36
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,850
Now by default all of the options picked are gonna allow us to stay on that free tier although we could

37
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,720
easily customize things to move into a paid plan.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,450
So we want to be a bit careful when navigating this page making sure we always see free down below.

39
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,810
Now you'll notice terminology related to creating a cluster as opposed to creating a database.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,560
A cluster is nothing more than a Mongo DB database with multiple servers which can allow you to have

41
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,950
a nice low latency around the globe.

42
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,240
So if we scroll down we can pick options such as the cloud provider.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,060
We'll stick with a W S down below that.

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,450
We have our regions so we can choose our primary region and currently only 4 actually support the free

45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,190
tier so you can pick the closest free tier region to you.

46
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,050
For me North Virginia is pretty close.

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,620
Down below we have more things we can customize about the tier additional settings and the name.

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,800
We're gonna leave all of those at their default value.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,280
We are on what's known as the m 0 plan and that is the free database plan which comes with half a gig

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,000
of storage which will be plenty for us as we test and build out our app.

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,010
Then in the future we could always upgrade as we start to get paid users.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,370
So down here we're going to create this cluster.

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,020
Now the actual process of creating the cluster does take some time.

54
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,630
You're gonna be redirected over to your dashboard page where you're hit with a lot of information all

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,720
at once they have a little checklist of things you need to do in order to connect to your database for

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,080
the very first time we can just go ahead and minimize that for the moment and in the background.

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,610
Our sandbox instance are free tier instance.

58
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,160
This is being created as we speak.

59
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,840
Now this can actually take between 7 and 10 minutes.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,340
So what we're going to do is just cut the video I'm going to wait until the cluster is created and this

61
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,620
Connect button is enabled.

62
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,120
Take some time to wait for that and when you're done just come back and click play

63
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,190
all right.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,830
We're back.

65
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,790
So our instance has been created and we now have some graphs to keep track of statistics about the database.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,050
Now currently there are no connections there are no operations and there's no storage.

67
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,660
So these graphs are particularly useful but these will start to change as we actually connect read and

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,430
write and store data.

69
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,170
Now on the left hand side in order to get started what we need to do is click this Connect button.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,020
This is going to walk us through a little one time setup for this particular cluster.

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,850
So right here we're seeing a warning.

72
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,740
You can not connect yet set up a firewall access and use your security permissions below.

73
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,980
So we just have to work through this page.

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,150
It's really short.

75
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,570
Then we'll be ready to actually connect to the database both from a gooey and from Visual Studio code

76
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,850
in our project.

77
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,950
So right here let's go ahead and add a different IP address and we're going to provide the following.

78
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,890
That's zero dot 0 0 0 forward slash 0.

79
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,080
This is going to white list all eyepiece.

80
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,040
That's going to be our IP for your local network.

81
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,410
And that's also going to allow this database to be connected from the Heroku because Heroku is going

82
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,500
to change that IP over time.

83
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,110
And we want to make sure we can always connect when it comes to security.

84
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't worry we will have a user name and password as well which we'll be configuring down below.

85
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,080
So with this in place for the IP address we can go ahead and click Add IP address which is going to

86
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,740
add it and we can see we've completed one of those steps over here and the next thing to do is to create

87
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,400
a database user.

88
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,190
This is someone who can connect to the database and we're gonna go ahead and pick something that makes

89
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,410
sense for us.

90
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:37,470
I'll go ahead and say task app as my user name and then I'll also go ahead and provide a password when

91
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,700
you provide the password.

92
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,320
Take a moment to write it down or remember it as this is going to become important in a couple of seconds.

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,890
You can always use the Atlas interface to get the password you set later on but we don't want to have

94
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,640
to go back and forth between all the windows.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,120
So right here we're creating the first user for the database which will have access.

96
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,560
We're going to go ahead and click Create Mongo DB user and that's gonna be it for this page.

97
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,400
The next thing we can do is actually connect to the database.

98
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:14,820
And right here if we continue on to the next step in our little three step wizard it is choose a connection

99
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,360
method and we have three options available connecting from the terminal connecting from our application

100
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,910
or connecting from what's called Mongo D.B. encompass Mongo DB compass is Mongo D BES official gooey

101
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,690
tool.

102
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:37,910
So it's similar to robo 3D though it's released and maintained by the Mongo DV organization itself.

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Now we're actually going to take a quick moment to switch over to mongo DB compos as robo three ti currently

104
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,270
cannot connect to mongo D.B. Atlas databases which is obviously a problem for us.

105
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,670
Hopefully they address that in the future but for the moment we'll just switch to this other gooey.

106
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,060
It's also free available for all operating systems and we can get started right away just as easily

107
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,060
as we were able to with robo 380 and they do the exact same thing and allows us to see and manage our

108
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,750
data.

109
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,690
Right here I'm going to go ahead and grab the download for my operating system that's going to start

110
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,450
the installation process well more like the download process and once it's downloaded we're gonna take

111
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,710
a quick moment to set it up connecting to those two databases one to our local host database and then

112
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,940
two to our Mongo D.B. Atlas database.

113
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,420
Now down below it's showing us to the connection string options we have available.

114
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,800
We are going to go ahead and use this first one that is compass one point 1 2 or later.

115
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,740
And down below we have the connection string which we will eventually copy to the clipboard.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,390
But before we get ahead of ourselves let's go ahead and just get Mongo DB compass setup now like with

117
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,670
all software programs the installation process will be different depending on what OS you're running

118
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,360
on.

119
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,050
For me on a Mac I just need to take the application and drag it over to the applications directory from

120
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,400
there.

121
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,530
I'm going to open the applications directory and we're actually going to boot the program up so I'll

122
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,570
scroll down to M for Mongo D.B..

123
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,200
And the program is called Mongo D.B..

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,930
Campus community so the community addition is there free edition and that we'll be able to access right

125
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,550
now.

126
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm going to go ahead and crack that open and we'll take a quick moment to connect to our local host

127
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,550
database first.

128
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,640
Right here it's asking me if I do want to run this software from the Internet.

129
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,030
Of course I do.

130
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,550
And then we're gonna be brought to the Mongo D.B. campus community application now right here we have

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,000
a quick since agreement to agree to and then will be brought to a quick wizard.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,070
We can close that down as we'll work through the setup process together.

133
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,490
We can choose if we want to send those statistics and crash reports.

134
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,760
I always do.

135
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,480
And now we are at any connection screen now by default.

136
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,850
All of the information here.

137
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,920
All of those default values they're going to allow us to connect to the local host database.

138
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:15,280
It's already local host on Pt. 2 7 0 1 7 so down below we actually don't need to fill or change any

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,740
of these fields.

140
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:26,120
All I'm going to do is pick a favorite name for this one and I will choose local host Mongo D.B. database.

141
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,370
I'm going to create that as a favorite so I can easily connect to it from right here and then we'll

142
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,090
go ahead and click connect to connect to our local host database.

143
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,630
Right here we have the task manager API.

144
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:45,260
We have our tasks and users collections and we could crack those open to see the data exactly like we

145
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,820
would be able to in robo 3 T.

146
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,700
So right here I have the documents.

147
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,450
I can also view them in a table view and once again I can manipulate the data.

148
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,820
Insert new documents.

149
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Search the documents and do anything else I'd want to know that this is working.

150
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,710
Let's go ahead and connect to the production database as well so up above what I'm going to do is go

151
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,870
to connect and then I will disconnect from the local host database.

152
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,860
That brings us back to the connection screen and we're going to go ahead and create a new connection

153
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,750
over here in the sidebar.

154
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,120
Now we do have to fill out all of these details and the information we'll be using is information that's

155
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,790
stored in that connection string over in the browser.

156
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,780
So this contains the data we need.

157
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,080
Now it does not contain the password.

158
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,260
But we can go ahead and get started.

159
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,560
What I'm going to start with is just grabbing this right here.

160
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,570
The host.

161
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,700
That is what's after the at sign all the way up to mongo D.B. dot net.

162
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,470
I'm going to copy that to the clipboard.

163
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,970
I'm gonna head back over to Mongo DB compass and paste it in right up top.

164
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,290
Now when it comes to the port we do want to go ahead and stick with the standard port.

165
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,900
And I do want to enable s r v record which we'll talk about in just a little bit down below for authentication

166
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:08,210
we do have to authenticate and we'll be using a user name and password combination right here.

167
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,880
We have to provide that user name and password we created in that little setup wizard when we clicked

168
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,520
that connect button.

169
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,970
So for me I had called it task app and then I set up my password.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,660
And this is the one that I told you you need to remember for this step down below that we have our authentication

171
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,250
database.

172
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,280
We're going to leave that as is.

173
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:37,310
We have other information which we don't need SSL that's already set up correctly for Atlas deployment.

174
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,030
SS H tunnel none.

175
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,580
And then down below that our favorite name.

176
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,510
So for this one I could pick something like a production Mongo D.B. database.

177
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,490
I can create that as a favorite.

178
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,210
And then we can go ahead and connect to that as well.

179
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,020
Now when we connect we're not going to see our data because we haven't created any collections and we

180
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:05,010
haven't inserted any documents but we will get to that in the next video when we finalize the deployment.

181
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,440
For the moment the goal is to just make sure we can actually connect it to the database from outside

182
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,670
of the Web site.

183
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,510
So whether it's from the composite application or from our project in Visual Studio code.

184
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,670
So here we can see that we were able to connect successfully.

185
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,450
Now there is no task manager api database showing up but that will change when we actually connect and

186
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,470
create the database from our application in the next lesson.

187
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,370
So now we can go ahead and disconnect from this as well and we can use Mongo DB compass in the future

188
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,240
to manage our data either locally or in production.

189
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,260
So over here on the left hand side that means we no longer need robo three TI.

190
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,250
We can go ahead and close that program down.

191
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,630
Now there are two quick things I want to talk about first up S.R. v records.

192
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,730
Those come from the DNS world.

193
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,890
They are not specific to mongo D.B. Mongo D.B. Atlas or compass in any way whatsoever.

194
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,730
That is what maps this right here the host to the correct IP and port.

195
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,570
And down below if you forgot the password you created for your user.

196
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,290
You can use the web interface to actually find it.

197
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,390
So over here we're actually done with this whole little modal showing us how we can connect.

198
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,840
We can close that down and start to manage our data from the interface.

199
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,250
What we're going to do is head over to security and here we have Mongo D.B. users.

200
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,680
This contains that user we created in that little setup modal.

201
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,220
We also have IP whitelist over here.

202
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,630
This is where the IP we set up now lives.

203
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,550
Let's go ahead and go back to Mongo DB users will go to edit we'll go to edit password.

204
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,850
Then you can click Show to view the password that you created for your user.

205
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,240
You can then use that when connecting from Mongo DB compass.

206
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,050
If you forgot what the password was.

207
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,140
So now that we have this in place we have a production ready database and we're able to connect to it

208
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,100
from a gooey tool in the next lesson.

209
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,470
We're going to focus on getting everything set up on Heroku.

210
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,290
We need to create the Heroku application.

211
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:23,130
We need to figure out how to set up environment variables on Heroku and then we need to deploy our code.

212
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm really excited to get to that.

213
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,160
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next lesson.
