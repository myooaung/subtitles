Welcome to section number six on a synchronous No J Yes.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.340
Now if you read a few articles about what node is you're likely going to see these same four terms pop

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.180
up over and over again asynchronous non blocking single threaded and event driven.

4
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.320
Now all of those are indeed accurate ways to describe no J.S..

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.530
The question is what exactly do those terms mean and how are they going to impact the node apps we're

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.360
building.

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.700
Well in this section we're going to move on to our second of four applications our weather web application.

8
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.830
So this application is indeed gonna have a front end in the browser where the user provides their location

9
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.490
behind the scenes and no J.S. we're going to communicate with third party services to convert that location

10
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.460
in to a forecast.

11
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.660
We're then going to send the forecast back to the browser so we can render the data for the user to

12
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.450
see.

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.380
So in this section we'll end up using asynchronous no J.S. in a few different places and we're actually

14
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.710
going to kick off the section with a quick presentation.

15
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.900
We're going to talk about those four terms and figure out how exactly they fit into the node apps we're

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.610
building.

17
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.270
Let's go ahead and jump right into that.
