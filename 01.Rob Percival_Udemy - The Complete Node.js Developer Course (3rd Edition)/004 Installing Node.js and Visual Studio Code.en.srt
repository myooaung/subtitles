1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,430
Before we talk about what no J.S. is or explore why it's a useful tool.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,240
We're gonna go ahead and install it.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,940
And the reason we're installing it first is because we're actually going to use a little bit of node

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,110
j s in this section to answer those two important questions in this video.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,680
We're gonna install no J Yes it's a super easy process and we're also going to make sure you have a

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,960
text editor on your machine so we can use it to write our scripts throughout the class.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Let's go ahead and get started by installing node we can find it over at the official node Web site

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,800
node j s dot org.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,660
Right here on the Node J.S. home page we have the download section for our operating system.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,140
Right here.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,750
I am indeed running on a Mac and down below.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,110
I have two node versions I could choose to install on the left I have version eight point twelve point

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,280
zero which is the current L2 yes version that stands for long term support and on the right I have version

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,700
eleven point zero point zero which is the current release with the latest features and that's the version

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,720
of node we're going to work with throughout the class.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,820
This is Andrew from the future with a quick update.

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,770
You'll notice that now the LTE version is ten point fifteen point three and the current release is 12

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,790
point one point zero.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,430
I've updated the class and to get the most out of the course it is now recommended that you use version

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,770
twelve or greater.

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,460
All right that's it for this quick interruption.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,460
Let's get back to the course now if you're seeing a more recent current version.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,680
Please go ahead and install that.

24
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,700
I'm frequently updating this course to always support the latest node features.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,240
So as you move through the class I recommend installing the newest version of node possible once again

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,870
for me.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,950
That's currently eleven point zero point zero.

28
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,790
So I'm going to go ahead and click that big green button that's going to download the installer.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,930
And it's one of those really easy click Next installers.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,480
So let's go ahead and run through it right here.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,240
There's no need to customize anything we see we'll click continue a couple of times we'll agree to some

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,980
stuff we're not going to read and we'll choose where we want to install node from here.

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,350
All we have to do is authenticate.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,160
I'm going to provide my password.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,910
And after just a couple of seconds.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,480
No J.S. will be installed on your machine and there we go.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,520
The note installer is all done.

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,850
It says that node was successfully installed and all we're going to do is test that by running a single

39
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,760
command from the terminal on your machine.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,640
We're going to make sure that node was indeed wired up correctly to do that.

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,440
Let's go ahead and first close down the installer.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,870
We're all done with this.

43
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,130
I am going to go ahead and move it to the trash.

44
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,340
It is no longer necessary.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,730
And what we're going to do now is open up the terminal on our machines on my Mac.

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,980
I'm gonna get that done by cracking open spotlight and searching for the terminal applications.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,760
If you're on Windows you can use the Windows key to bring up the search bar and search for the command

48
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,470
prompt application.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,870
If you're on Linux the exact name and location is going to depend on your distribution you're looking

50
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,320
for something like the terminal the command prompt or the command line.

51
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,460
Now we're going to go ahead and crack this open and what we get regardless of our OS is the same thing.

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,090
Stylistically it's going to look a little bit different but it is a place for us to type commands.

53
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,640
We can then hit enter to run those commands and we'll see the results right here in this screen.

54
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:48,350
Now when we installed node j s we didn't get a gooey application with fields and buttons and taxed instead

55
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,140
what we got as a command.

56
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,810
We can now run from the command prompt.

57
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,920
We're going to be using this command hundreds of times throughout the course and we'll learn a lot more

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
about it and how it works throughout the class.

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,910
For now though we're going to use it in one way to check for the node version installed.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,850
So right here we're gonna type out what seven characters to start we will run the node command.

61
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:21,260
So we're gonna type out node and oh d e followed by a space and we're going to provide a argument to

62
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,960
this command telling it that we just want to know the version of node that's running.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,430
So right here after that space it is a hyphen followed by the letter V.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,500
Now if we go ahead and run this we are going to get the version of node we just installed right here

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm seeing version eleven point zero point zero which is indeed the version I installed a few minutes

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
ago right here.

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,050
You might not see the same version I have but you should see the same version you just installed.

68
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,790
Now what if you're not getting that.

69
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,480
Well if you're not getting a version that likely means node wasn't installed correctly and to simulate

70
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,760
what this looks like I'm just going to miss type node so I'll type node with two E's as an example.

71
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,080
Then I'll try to use this the argument to ask for the version but there is no node command with two

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,820
E's So what do I get.

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,450
I get an error saying something like command not found if you're seeing something like this when you

74
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,570
run the correctly spelled command and that means that node wasn't installed correctly and that we need

75
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,880
to address that before you can continue on to do that.

76
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,600
All you have to do is crack open a question in the course Q and A and I'll work with you to get node

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,220
installed correctly.

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,640
So at this point we've installed node j s and we've confirmed that we can actually use it on our machines

79
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,350
and that's where we're going to stop with the terminal for now I'm going to leave the terminal open

80
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,290
as we'll be using it in the next several videos.

81
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,810
And if you don't have any previous terminal experience don't worry we'll cover all of the commands we

82
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,740
end up running no terminal experience required.

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,630
That's all we're going to do with node 4 now to wrap up the video I want to make sure we all have a

84
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,970
text editor we can use to write out our node scripts.

85
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,170
So to do that let's go ahead and explore a couple of different options throughout this class.

86
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll be using Visual Studio code.

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:25,140
You can find and install this over at code dot Visual Studio dot com.

88
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,500
Now there are a few reasons I love Visual Studio code.

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,470
It is free it is open source and it's available for all operating systems whether you're running on

90
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,550
Mac Windows or Linux.

91
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,890
It also has one of the best EDS I've used in a while with a fantastic ecosystem of extensions and themes

92
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,700
allowing you to really customize the editor to fit your needs.

93
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,470
And we're going to do just that with node j s with Visual Studio code.

94
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,900
We can actually debug no J.S. Right inside of the tool which is a great feature.

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,390
You don't always see from text editors.

96
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,320
Now there is no reason you have to use visual studio code.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,490
It is just the editor.

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
I'll be using throughout the class.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,240
You're more than welcome to use any editor you're comfortable with if you already have one that supports

100
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,940
javascript and you're already good to go.

101
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,190
But if you're looking for something new and you want to try out what is a very cool tool I definitely

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,120
recommend checking out visual studio code.

103
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,040
Now there are plenty of other options out there as well.

104
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,870
In the past I've used the atom text editor in my classes.

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,420
It's also a great free open source editor available for all operating systems and there are some good

106
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,770
paid editors out there as well.

107
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,050
Examples of that would be sublime text 3 and web storm.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,340
Now web storm is definitely more of an IED e than a text editor but it's also a tool worth checking

109
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,210
out.

110
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,700
So all we need is to install one of these if you want to follow along exactly and use these setup I

111
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,150
use.

112
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,120
I recommend installing visual studio code.

113
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,900
So take a moment to get that done.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,590
You can pause the video then come back when you have it installed and we're going to wrap up the course

115
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,480
by just cracking it open.

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,080
So I'm going to open up from Spotlight visual studio code and right here we're not going to actually

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
do anything with the editor.

118
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,170
I just want to make sure we have it installed and we can actually crack it open.

119
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,940
So we have node installed.

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,780
We've checked that the command works and we have a text editor where we can now write node scripts.

121
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,310
That is it for this installation video.

122
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,720
We're now ready to continue with the rest of the course in the next two videos.

123
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,920
As I mentioned we're going to focus on answering two important questions.

124
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,310
What is no J S and why is no JSA a tool worth using.

125
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm excited to talk about both of those.

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,450
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
