00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.450
In this lesson as promised we'll be setting up rendering for our location messages to render a link

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.070
instead of showing the entire.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.970
You are real.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.860
Now to get that done we're gonna want to render a separate template which means we're gonna want to

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.340
create a separate event that the server sends to the client so we can have separate logic for that.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.440
So instead of message we'll use something else like location message.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.350
Now getting this done is gonna be your first of two challenges for the lesson and the reason I'm breaking

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.910
it up into two challenges is that the second challenge already contains quite a bit.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.830
So this first one will be a little light.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.560
Then the second one will contain a bit more work for you to do right here.

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.880
Your goal is to create that separate event for location sharing messages so the server is going to omit

12
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.270
the location message event when it's trying to share one of those Google Maps.

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.720
You are owls and it should omit the event with the U.R.L. like it's doing now.

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.070
Then on the client in this file you want to set up a listener that runs some code when it receives the

15
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.430
location message event and what you want to do for the moment is just print the you are real to the

16
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.590
console.

17
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.790
Now that's not rendering it in a new template.

18
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.840
That is the second challenge we'll get to that shortly down below.

19
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.260
Test your work so you should be able to share a location and you should no longer see it showing up

20
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.170
up above you should only see it showing up in the console down below.

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.440
Since when you share a location it should fire your new event handler and not the one right here.

22
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.730
So take some time to knock that out and test your work when you're done come back and click play.

23
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.420
All right.

24
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.260
How'd that go.

25
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
Let's kick things off by making that change to the server.

26
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.030
So over in index dot J S we get the location somewhere over here send a location.

27
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.210
This is what we want to change right now we are emitting message from server to client and we use that

28
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.730
for a lot of other things where we have text we want to show.

29
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.810
In this case the data is a bit different so we're going to emit a separate event that would be location

30
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.970
message.

31
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.560
Now that's the only thing we need to change over here.

32
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.070
Not too bad over in chat.

33
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.840
Not J.S..

34
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.010
We have to listen for that event and I'm going to add that just below our listener for message.

35
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.430
So that would be socket dot on right here.

36
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.680
Location message.

37
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.010
Then we set up our function and we get access to our data which I will call you RL or you could call

38
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.210
it something similar like maps you RL and then down below.

39
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.950
The only thing I wanted you to do was just print it to the console.

40
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.030
So that's exactly what we'll do now with this in place we can test our work.

41
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.870
What I'm going to do is refresh the browser I'll send a regular message and it works as expected.

42
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.780
I'll then try to share my location and I should not see it up above.

43
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.800
I should only see it in the console down below.

44
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.100
And that is exactly what I'm getting which is great.

45
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.220
So now we've proven that our other event handler is running when we are getting a location that's been

46
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.790
shared with us and since we have separate code to run we can render a separate template including a

47
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.470
link with custom text and that is what we're going to focus on for the second of the two challenges.

48
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.960
So right here I'm going to remove the old challenge comments and I'll take some time to paste in the

49
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.720
new ones right here.

50
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.500
Your job for this second challenge is to render a new template for location messages.

51
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.260
We're just going to show a link that links to the Google Maps page when someone clicks it.

52
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.700
So right here you're gonna start by duplicating the message template in index dot HDMI all and changing

53
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.460
the I.D. to something that makes sense for that template as you're going to need to select it from inside

54
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.200
of JavaScript.

55
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.000
Next you're going to actually alter the templates content in that paragraph.

56
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.810
What you're gonna do is add a link using the A anchor element and the text for the link will be static

57
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.820
something like my current location and the you are real.

58
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.850
The H ref attribute will be dynamic.

59
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.090
So for the value of that you want to make sure to use that curly braces syntax.

60
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.520
Next up you want to move into chat not J.S. and selectively template from javascript and you want to

61
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.000
render the template with the Google Maps U.R.L. so that you are all that I have right here that should

62
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.130
find its way into the H ref attribute for the link we're creating in the new template.

63
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.250
Finally you're gonna make sure that template gets appended to the message list and you'll test your

64
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.070
work.

65
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.010
So over here if I send off a text message that should show up.

66
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.770
If I send off my location I should see a blue clickable link that brings me over to the Google Maps

67
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.910
page.

68
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.500
All right.

69
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.030
Take as much time as you need to get that done.

70
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.770
I know there are quite a few steps when you are done come back and click play.

71
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.560
How that go.

72
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.420
Let's get to it by first creating that new template and setting it up with the link.

73
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.670
So over in index dot HDL we'll be taking our current script element.

74
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.250
I'll be copying it to the clipboard and down below.

75
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.100
We're gonna go ahead and paste it in and right here we'll just do a little reformatting bringing it

76
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.910
back to what it was before.

77
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.580
And we do have to change the I.D. so we can target these two separately.

78
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.900
I'll call this one something like location message template.

79
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.080
Perfect.

80
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.610
Now when it comes to actually altering the template what I wanted you to do was to put a link inside.

81
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.680
So for that I would go ahead and setup and a tag opening and closing it and I would put the link text

82
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.800
right in between the opening and closing tags.

83
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.900
And for this one something like my current location would get the job done that you could have used

84
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.200
different text that would have been perfectly fine.

85
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.690
Now the attribute you have to configure is each ref.

86
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.470
This is the link where someone goes when they click that link.

87
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.370
And in this case we want them to go to a dynamic U.R.L. that will be provided to the template which

88
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.070
means you needed to use this syntax right inside of these double quotes.

89
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.870
So right here to opening curly braces followed by two closing curly braces.

90
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.590
And I will eventually pass in a you are well value.

91
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.810
Once I render this template.

92
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.170
Now with this in place we're actually done.

93
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.890
But there's one more change we can make.

94
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.850
It wasn't part of the challenge right here.

95
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.830
You can go ahead and set target equal to underscore blank.

96
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.180
That's going to open the link in a new tab which means that you won't leave the chat room by default

97
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.420
the same tab will switch from the chat room over to Google Maps which is probably not what you want.

98
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.520
So take a moment to add that in it's a nice user interface improvement.

99
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.170
Next up in chat dot Jay Yes we can move on to step number three.

100
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.450
We have one in two done.

101
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.850
We just have to select that template before we can render it.

102
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:30.760
So right here a new constant I'm going to call this location message template and I will grab it using

103
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:41.140
document dot query selector I'm going to select by I.D. and the I.D. I just picked was location message

104
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.110
template and then we'll go ahead and use the inner HDL prop..

105
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.410
Perfect.

106
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.160
Now that we have the template selected it's time to actually render it so down below inside of on location

107
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.030
message.

108
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.940
We want to compile the template with the data and then get it showing up at the bottom of our list.

109
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.750
So right here a new constant HDL equals.

110
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:15.800
Once again we need to use much dash dot render to render the template that is the location message template.

111
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.880
And remember we said that we're going to pass in the U.R.L. so we have to pass in our object with a

112
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.760
U.R.L. value.

113
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:29.710
Now we have a parameter with the same name up above so we can use the shorthand syntax for that.

114
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.170
And from here all we need to do is to add this HDL to the document.

115
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:43.890
So like we did above that as messages dot insert adjacent HDMI all we're going to insert our HDMI well

116
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.190
before the end.

117
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:51.880
So at the bottom of the list and I have the HDL in the H2 UML variable up above.

118
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.140
Now with this in place we should be all done and we can test our work.

119
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.620
So what I'm going to do is remove the challenge comments right here.

120
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.210
I'm going to save that chat.

121
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.710
J Yes and make sure my other files are saved as well.

122
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.150
And in the browser I'm going to refresh things.

123
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.350
Now I'll start with a standard message.

124
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.710
Something like a regular text message which does show up and don't worry I'll show you how to disable

125
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.970
the autocomplete since it doesn't really make sense for this field.

126
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.610
We'll cover that a bit later and then we're going to click send a location to test our new functionality.

127
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.100
Now it takes a little bit of time to get that location but once it's fetched we have our link.

128
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:39.520
And if I click that it brings me over to Google Maps in a separate tab over here I still have my chat

129
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.270
application in place which is great.

130
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.320
Now the location over here is close enough to where I actually am.

131
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.850
It is definitely pretty accurate.

132
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:55.240
So now that we have this in place we have a separate template rendering for those location messages

133
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:03.310
allowing us to render a nice link to the user as opposed to just dumping the U.R.L. text to the screen.

134
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:09.520
With this in place we are now done with the two challenges for this lesson and we're going to continue

135
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.590
on to the next lesson where the focus is going to be on timestamps.

136
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:20.230
We're going to talk about how we can set up timestamps for the messages and then get some useful time

137
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.740
information for when all of the messages were sent.

138
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.180
I'm excited to get to that.

139
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.700
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
