00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.700
In this video it's gonna be up to you to add validation for the end point that's going to allow users

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.320
to upload their avatars to upload their images.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.420
So over here I'll paste in the challenged comments for getting that done just below the existing code

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.160
from the previous challenge.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.420
What are you going to do.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.210
You're going to add validation to the Avatar upload route.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.830
We want to limit the Upload Size to one megabyte and we only want to allow the following files.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.080
JP G.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.150
JP e.g. and P energy images.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.070
Everything else should be rejected.

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.370
Finally you want to test your work upload larger files even if they're images.

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.580
Those should fail and then upload non images and that should fail as well so take some time to knock

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.180
this out.

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.520
Don't forget to test your work when you're done come back and click play

15
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.040
how'd that go.

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.750
Let's go ahead and kick things off.

17
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.890
Up above inside of our call to Malta where we're going to set up all of these options.

18
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.990
The first one is going to be the file size limit so I'll set up limits alongside of dest and right here

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.190
we'll go ahead and provide on that object file size.

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.540
Now to restrict it to one megabyte that is 1 million.

21
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.430
A one with six zeros afterwards.

22
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.720
Perfect.

23
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.480
Next up we only want to allow JP G.

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.050
J pegs and PSG files.

25
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.840
We're going to do that by setting up file filter like we had before.

26
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.980
Now there are two ways you could have done this.

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.880
You could have copied that code and repurposed it or you could have written things out from scratch

28
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.470
either approach is fine.

29
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.930
Right here we have file filter with request file and the callback and we're gonna go ahead and set that

30
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.820
function up from scratch so we'll start with our condition.

31
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.490
If that condition doesn't run we'll use callback to go ahead and accept the given upload.

32
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.850
Now if this thing fails that means it wasn't an image and we'll use callback with return to make sure

33
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.170
the function stops and an error gets shown to the user right here.

34
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.910
That's a new error and we'll go ahead and use the following message.

35
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.840
Please upload an image.

36
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.200
Excellent.

37
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.370
Now the only thing we have to focus on is the condition itself.

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.640
We'll be using the logical not operator to make sure that we reject when it's not one of the following

39
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.890
extensions and right here we'll be using the file dot original name and property once again and we're

40
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.760
going to use match to provide the same regular expression we used before with an extra extension tossed

41
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.690
onto the list.

42
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.030
So right here that is backslash dot in parentheses then followed by a dollar sign and right here we

43
00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.400
have all of our file extensions separated by the vertical bar so we can start off with J P G then J

44
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.250
P E G then finally PMG and if there's other types I wanted to support I could add those on as well.

45
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
Now with this in place we should be all done and we can test our work.

46
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.170
What I'm going to do is remove the challenge comments down below.

47
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.230
I'll go ahead and save the changes we made to our call to motor and we'll head back over to postmen.

48
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.860
Now in this case I do want to head over to the upload Avatar request and I can kick things off by uploading

49
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470
profile picture.

50
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.250
This is indeed an image and it is much smaller than one megabyte.

51
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.240
So this should be accepted.

52
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.770
I'll send that off the server did indeed accept the upload.

53
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.460
Now let's go ahead and try the fall.

54
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.660
JP file.

55
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.010
It's an image but it's too large.

56
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.400
Right here we can see that failed.

57
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.320
And finally we'll upload something that's not an image at all right here.

58
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.470
I'll go ahead and upload the PDX document in that directory I'll send that off to the server and down

59
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.390
below I can see my error please upload an image.

60
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.490
Now that we have this in place we're gonna go ahead and continue on with other topics in the next lesson

61
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.050
we'll talk about how we can handle the errors from Malta and send back a Jason response instead of sending

62
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.310
back this HDL page with a ton of unnecessary information we don't want to expose.

63
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.200
We're gonna go ahead and cover that in the next lesson.

64
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.480
I'm excited to get to it so we'll see you then.
