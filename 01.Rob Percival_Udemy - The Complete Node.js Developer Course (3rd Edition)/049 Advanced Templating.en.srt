00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,210
In this video as I promised twice before you're going to learn about partials with handlebars partials

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,740
as the name suggests allows you to create a little template which is part of a bigger web page.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,880
That's where a partial comes from.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,190
So think about parts of the web page that you're gonna end up reusing across multiple pages in your

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,990
site.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,720
This would be things like headers or footers where you want the exact same thing showing on every page

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
to give your site a nice unified feel.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,420
It feel really terrible if you went from one page in a site to another and the header kept switching

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,720
how it was structured or how it looked with partials.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,690
It's gonna be really easy to create a header and reuse it without needing to copy markup between all

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,580
the pages in your site.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,050
All right.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,020
The first thing we have to do to work with partials is actually load in HP s for the first time and

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,540
configure it just down below I'll load HB s in const HB S equals we're going to require the module grabbing

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,170
it by providing the module name and once we have it what we need to do is tell handlebars where we are

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,660
going to put our partials.

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:19,230
These are also files with an HP s extension similar to the ones we have down below.

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,290
Now we want to keep them in different locations so we want one directory for our views that we use with

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,990
render and we want another directory for our partials which will learn how to actually use shortly.

20
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,380
So what I'm gonna do is this we're going to leave the templates directory in place but we're actually

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,050
going to put two directories inside of there.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,690
One is gonna be called views and the other is going to be called partials.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,780
Now these three files we currently have in templates those actually belong in views so I'm going to

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,050
take all three and drag them over and all we have to do to get things to work is to change the views

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,880
path from forward slash templates to forward slash templates forward slash views.

26
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,800
Now if I was to save things the old stuff is still going to work as expected I can refresh this site

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,610
and I still see my view correctly rendered from here though we can now tell HP yes that we're going

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,700
to put our partials in this partials directory then we can actually add some stuff inside of there.

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,130
So right here we're going to create a another path.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,750
Const partials a path equals.

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:39,030
I'll use path dot join to once again join together dir name with a string that will end up creating.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,590
So I provide dir name as the first argument and our string as the second.

33
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:51,770
And right here dot dot forward slash templates forward slash partials which is the folder we just created.

34
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,120
So this path is going to get handlebars to the right directory.

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,320
Now we can actually configure it and I'll do that in our little section for setting up handlebars.

36
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:12,820
Now we actually use HB S. here HB S. dot register partials register partials takes a path to the directory

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,750
where your partials live.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,430
We don't have any just yet but we can still provide that path.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,730
The partials path variable contains the path that the handlebars module needs.

40
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,830
So that's the configuration side.

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,550
That's the boring stuff now that we have everything set up.

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,160
Let's go ahead and create a partial and see what all the hype is about.

43
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,550
I'm going to define a new file in the partials directory and I'm going to create a partial for the header.

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,550
This is a header that we're gonna show on all of the pages throughout our site.

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,230
So I'll call this something like header dot H B S so with our partials we're still using the handlebars

46
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,600
extension and we can still take advantage of all of those handle bars features.

47
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,260
Now what goes inside of here what goes inside of partials isn't a complete H T and L document like we

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:12,430
have here where we set up the doc type and then set up our HDL element instead it is just part of a

49
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,510
web page.

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,890
So right here as an example we can go ahead and just create something like an H1 element H1 opening

51
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,280
and closing the tag and then we can put some text inside of here.

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,040
I'll say something like static header dot HB s text for the moment and this will allow us to explore

53
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,640
how to use our partials.

54
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,180
Then we'll continue to expand on the header.

55
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,050
Actually putting a dynamic title Inside of here with the partial in place we can now use it inside of

56
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,930
our other handlebars files which means that we can have this partial loaded in at the top of all of

57
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,320
these pages.

58
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,440
Let's go ahead and get that done and I'll start with the help page which is the page I currently have

59
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,230
rendered in the background.

60
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,380
Now I'll leave the current H1 in place for the moment but up above what I'm going to do is render the

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
partial to render a partial.

62
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,900
We still use those two sets of curly braces like we did when we wanted to add a value into the template

63
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,530
in a specific location for a partial though we have to add one additional character which is the greater

64
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,000
than sign right here in the middle.

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,350
Then after the greater than sign we provide the partial name which is just the file name.

66
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,210
You don't need to provide the complete path and you don't need to provide the file extension.

67
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,030
So for us that would just be header.

68
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,520
Now we can go ahead and save help dot HB S. but I'm going to clue you in ahead of time.

69
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,150
Things are not going to work as expected.

70
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,410
I'm going to refresh the application in the browser and what do I get I get a really long error message.

71
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,090
The actual message being the partial header could not be found now to talk about why this is happening

72
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,900
we have to talk about when node mine is restarting our application right now node mine is only monitoring

73
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,760
files with that JSA extension like app dot J S so if I save the file even with no changes made you can

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,950
see the server is going to end up restarting down below.

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm gonna go ahead and save the file.

76
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,600
It restarts I save the file again and it restarts again.

77
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,080
The same is not true with our handlebars templates.

78
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,930
If I save one of those files which I just did you can see the server has not restarted down below.

79
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,630
And that's a problem because HB S. and express they need to load those templates in and if the server

80
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,320
doesn't restart when new templates are created the server is never going to pick up on that.

81
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,010
Now we can easily address this by customizing our node on command.

82
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:55,750
We can have node man restart when our J S files change end when our HB S. files change and to do that

83
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,480
we'll make a small tweak to the command we've been running so far.

84
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,950
I'm gonna use control C to shut down the existing process then I'll use clear to clear the terminal

85
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,580
output from here the command is going to start off much the same node mine space source a forward slash

86
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,000
app dot J asked which is exactly what we were just running the changes that we're gonna add the E flag

87
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:27,220
which is short for extensions this allows us to provide after the space a comma separated list of extensions

88
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,410
that node man should watch we're going to provide.

89
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,560
Jay S. comma H B.

90
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,360
S..

91
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,520
Now if I run the program we can see that the behavior has changed.

92
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,880
If I save my apt J.S. file these servers still restarts which is great.

93
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,070
Now though if I save one of my HB S. files like the partial or any of my views you'll notice that the

94
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,750
server once again restarts which is fantastic.

95
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,340
Now if I was to refresh the page we would no longer get this error.

96
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,570
Instead we get our rendered document with the title up top from the header partial static header dot

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,340
HP s text.

98
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,690
Now let's take our header one step further and make it a bit more useful.

99
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,960
Currently we have three pages we have help index and about all three of those have their own each one.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,780
What we're going to do is remove those and have that rendered in the header instead.

101
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,770
Now you'll remember that we have the value the title to show passed in for index and for about and that's

102
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,530
OK.

103
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,630
We can continue to use those values in partials as well.

104
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,620
So to kick things off.

105
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,540
What I'm going to do is make a quick change to all files help.

106
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,180
HB Yes already has the header in place.

107
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,690
I'm gonna remove the H1 save the file.

108
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,180
Next up we have index dot HB S..

109
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:56,730
I'm gonna remove that H1 and I'm going to set up the partial so open and close two sets of curly braces.

110
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,960
Then the greater than sign and followed by the partial header.

111
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,050
Next up we'll do the same thing in about J S removing that H1 and swapping it out with the header partial.

112
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,630
So right here two sets of curly braces.

113
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,780
Greater than sine header.

114
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,000
And now if we visit any page on our site we're gonna see the exact same text.

115
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,250
We are going to see static header dot HB s text.

116
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,170
Here it is on help I'll refresh the page and it still shows up.

117
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,830
We then have forward slash about where we see it.

118
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,750
And finally the root of the site where we also see it.

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,580
Now what we're gonna do instead of displaying this static text is to grab the title value so inapt.

120
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,420
J S for the route we pass in title and name for about we pass in title and name.

121
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,800
And for help we currently just pass and help a text.

122
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,010
I'm going to modify that to also pass in title and name.

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,370
So right here.

124
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,900
Title for this page could equal uppercase h help.

125
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,740
And then I'll provide name.

126
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,000
And I'm still the one who created this page.

127
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,370
And I'd like credit for it.

128
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,030
So I'll provide my name and you can put your name in there.

129
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,940
Now that we have those three set up.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,100
All pages have access to Title and now it can be used in the header.

131
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,270
So right here instead of a static value we are going to open and close two sets of curly braces and

132
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:29,530
we are going to reference title right inside like we were previously doing from our other view files.

133
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:36,010
Now if I refresh the home page what do we get I get whether if I go over to forward slash about what

134
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:43,390
do I get I get about me and then forward slash help I'm going to end up getting the help title showing

135
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:50,080
now that we have the header in place we can add stuff inside of this file that we want to show on every

136
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,500
single page like a navigation bar with links that allow you to switch between the pages on the site

137
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,860
just down below the H one in the header partial we're gonna get that done I'm gonna start by opening

138
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,020
and closing a div tag for the div element div being short for division.

139
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,720
This is going to create a section of content below the H1 and what we're going to put inside of there

140
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,110
are three links.

141
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,090
So I'll be using the A anchor element for that we are going to set them up and inside of the element

142
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,640
between those two tags we provide the text we would like to show for the link and I'll just use the

143
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,200
page title which would be whether for the first one about for the second and help for the third.

144
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:40,810
So right here I have weather and I am going to set up h ref which is the attribute we set up to specify

145
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,190
where this link should go to.

146
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,080
We're gonna send it to forward slash the root of the site.

147
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,360
Now we can do the exact same thing for our two other pages as well.

148
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,130
I'll set up a I'll provide the text.

149
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,510
Let's link to the about page for this one and I'll set up the H ref attribute to forward slash about

150
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,880
which is where we can view that page.

151
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,010
And lastly we'll do the same for help the text to display is help.

152
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,200
And the H ref value is going to be forward slash help.

153
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,900
Now if I save things we're going to see this navigation bar on every single page I'll refresh the help

154
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,560
page and it shows up I'll click over to the about page and I see it there finally a click over to the

155
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,610
home page and it shows up there as well.

156
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,690
So being able to use a partial makes it really easy to set something up once and use it everywhere.

157
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:42,180
And if I was to make any changes to the header I would just change this one file and it would automatically

158
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,770
update on all pages where the partial is used which is fantastic.

159
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,610
Now it's your turn to create a another partial for the footer.

160
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,030
So over in act J S I have some challenge comments which I'll paste in up top outlining what I'd like

161
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,040
you to do right here.

162
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,140
Your goal is to create a partial for the footer like I mentioned and step one of that is to set up the

163
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,820
template for the footer partial.

164
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:14,340
The goal is to just render a paragraph and print text saying created by followed by some name where

165
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:21,120
some name would get replaced with whatever the name value passed in is for me it's Andrew Meade for

166
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,280
you it's likely something else.

167
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,590
Now once you have that template in place you want to make sure to actually use it at the bottom of our

168
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:36,300
three pages about help and index and finally test your work visit all three pages and make sure you

169
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,460
see your footer showing up at the bottom.

170
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,280
Take some time to knock this out.

171
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,220
Test your work and when you're done come back and click play

172
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,130
how'd that go.

173
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm going to kick things off by creating the partial.

174
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,020
So the partial needs to live in the partials directory and I can call this whatever I like.

175
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm gonna call it footer.

176
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,320
HB Yes but if you picked a different name that's fine as well.

177
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,550
Next up we want to add some content inside of here.

178
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,710
And the goal as mentioned is to just print some text in a paragraph so I'll open and close my paragraph

179
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:19,370
tags for the paragraph element then created space by space.

180
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,250
Right here is where I want to put the value so I'll open and close two sets of curly braces and I will

181
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,890
reference a name right inside which matches up with the property passed in.

182
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,200
Name name and name.

183
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,530
So that is step 1 step 2.

184
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
We have this partial.

185
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,120
It's time to use it.

186
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,510
So I'll start with help dot.

187
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,360
HB Yes I'm going to put it at the bottom just before I close the body so I'll open and close two sets

188
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
of curly braces.

189
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll set up the greater than sign and then provide the partial footer.

190
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,440
Perfect.

191
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:03,430
Now let's go ahead and knock this out for index down below that is going to be a footer and finally

192
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,930
we're gonna knock it out for about right here footer.

193
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,210
Now you'll notice that for about end index we do have the old text in place.

194
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,830
I didn't mention to remove that for the challenge.

195
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,900
Maybe it did.

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,850
I am going to go ahead and remove it.

197
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,030
If you did it remove it.

198
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,560
Take a quick moment to do just that.

199
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:29,340
So now in about we have these three things in index we have just to add in help.

200
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,480
We have the three items we had earlier now that we have this in place and we don't have any duplicate

201
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,280
footers.

202
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,450
Let's go ahead and test things out.

203
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm going to save help Dot.

204
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,510
HB Yes I'm going to refresh the page here I'm on the home page and I see my footer.

205
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,530
I'll go over to the about page where I also see it.

206
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,800
And finally the help page where it's showing up.

207
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,460
So that is it for partials partials can be used throughout your application to make it really easy to

208
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,070
render the same thing over and over again as we saw.

209
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,780
We can still inject values inside of them.

210
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,920
We did that for the name in footer and for the title in header.

211
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,780
Now that we have that all wrapped up and we've tested our work I'm going to remove those challenge comments

212
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,410
and that's where we're going to stop for this one in the next video.

213
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,950
We'll continue to learn more about our server and express.

214
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,860
So stay tuned and I'll see you then.
