1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,280
In this video I promised we'd be connecting to our database from to J.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,330
S I'm actually going to push that off to the next video as there's one more important thing we need

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,320
to install before it really makes sense to interact with the database using Node.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,630
What we're going to install in this video is a mongo D.B. admin tool.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,940
This is gonna be a gooey a graphic user interface for managing your Mongo DB database and the data it

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,860
contains.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,350
The goal of the database admin tool is to provide us with a nice visual interface for managing our Mongo

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,720
DB data.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,390
It's not meant to serve as a replacement for connecting to your database from node j s we're still gonna

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,190
do that.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,050
The whole point of the admin tool is just to provide us with an easier way to manage our data as developers

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,470
as we're building out the application.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,820
Now we can find the tool that we're gonna be using by heading over to a new browser tab and we are going

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,720
to Google robo three ti.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,850
Now the reason I'm having you Google the product name as opposed to entering an explicit U.R.L. is because

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,180
they recently rebranded themselves.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,360
This tool was formerly known as robo Mongo.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,060
It has since been renamed to robo three t and this is the Mongo D.B. addon tool.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,520
We're going to use as a companion throughout the class.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,370
Now this is a free tool available for all operating systems.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,190
So let's go ahead and get it installed right here as we head to the robo 3 home page.

22
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,740
They have two product offerings they have studio three T and they have robo 380 robo 3D is the Mongo

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,080
D.B. gooey the tool that we want to install.

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,870
Studio Three T has more advanced features that we're not gonna use in the class.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,700
Everything that we need to manage our database is available in their free offering.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,210
So right here I'm going to click download robo 3 T.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,460
Which just brings me over to another page where I have to click the exact same button and once I click

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,660
it a second time I'll be able to view the installation options for Linux for Mac and for Windows for

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,170
Windows.

30
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,710
You get an E XY executable for Mac you get a DMV installer and for Linux you get an archive.

31
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,240
So right here I am on a Mac.

32
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,820
So I'm going to take a quick moment to actually get this installed so we can set it up together in this

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,420
video.

34
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,610
I'm going to download the DMV file and once that's downloaded we'll take a quick moment to install it

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,590
and set it up.

36
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,570
Take a quick moment to grab the correct installer for your operating system right here for the Mac.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,430
Once I open up the DMV all I need to do is drag the application file over to my applications folder.

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,780
Then we can start it up.

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,330
So right here I have robo 3D.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm gonna drag that over to applications then I'm going to open up applications and navigate to R for

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,680
robo 3 T and down below.

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,560
I have the program sitting right here.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,420
I'm gonna right click it to open it and I'm doing this for the first time to confirm that I do want

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,070
to open an application downloaded from the Internet as opposed to one downloaded from the Mac App Store.

45
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,510
I'm gonna confirm it and this is going to open up the robo 3 tee program right here.

46
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,920
Robo 3 T is bringing up this Mongo DB connections panel where we can connect to our local Mongo DB database.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,910
Take a quick moment to get robo 3D installed and opened.

48
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,820
Then you can come back and continue on with the video.

49
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,700
So right here it's asking us to manage our connections we don't have any.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,120
So we're gonna go ahead and actually create one when we create a connection.

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,490
There are a ton of different options we can configure up here.

52
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,280
We have a whole bunch of tabs for more advanced setups and we'll explore some of these as we setup a

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,180
production Mongo DB database a bit later in the class.

54
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,000
For now for our local host setup the only thing we need to change is right here name.

55
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,660
This is a label for the connection and we can call this literally anything we like.

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,990
I'm gonna call this local Mongo D.B. database now down below on this first connection tab I also have

57
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:14,070
address and port address is correct the database is running on local host and the port is also correct

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,280
it's using the default Mongo DB port which we saw in our connection message when we first started up

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,210
the server.

60
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,450
We saw that the server was listening on Port 2 7 0 1 7 and here that's the port we're trying to connect

61
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,020
on.

62
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,070
Now before we actually say of the connection we can test it out if we click this test button over here.

63
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,050
We should see green checkmarks for everything allowing us to actually confirm that the connection settings

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,310
are working.

65
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,130
We can now close the connection test panel I can click save and we can connect to our database for the

66
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,320
first time.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,850
Right here we can just double click that connection to connect and as long as you're not seeing an error

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,690
pop up.

69
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,450
That means things were connected correctly.

70
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,290
Now for the moment there's nothing interesting to look at because we haven't inserted any data into

71
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,330
the database.

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,380
We'll get to that in the next video.

73
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,110
For the moment though we are going to run a single command on the database asking for the version of

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,010
Mongo DB it's running as long as we get the version back then we know for certain that robo three ti

75
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,240
was able to connect to the database successfully to do that.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,340
Oh we're gonna do is right click our connection over here in this left hand panel and we're going to

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,090
click open shell.

78
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,560
This is going to allow us to run a command directly against Mongo D.B..

79
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,010
And in this case we're gonna use the following.

80
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:43,180
That's D.B. dot version which we're going to call as if it were a method on the DB object.

81
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,510
Now right here what we have looks a whole lot like Javascript and that is because it is javascript when

82
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,540
we're working with Mongo D.B. and interacting with it via the Mongo DB shell.

83
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,480
We're just using JavaScript to manipulate the database.

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,830
So in this case we are asking for the version of Mongo D.B. that's running.

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,800
If we fire this off we should get the correct version back confirming that our connection was able to

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,770
connect to the database and that the database was able to respond right here to actually run this.

87
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,020
We just click that green play button.

88
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,420
It's going to fire off the command and down below we get our version back here I get the version of

89
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,750
Mongo D.B. that I installed for point zero point for you.

90
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,270
You should see the version of Mongo D.B. that you installed with this in place.

91
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,980
We've confirmed two things.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,290
We've confirmed that our database is up and running correctly and that robo 3 T is up and running correctly.

93
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,710
And now we're going to continue on to the next video where we're actually going to connect to the database

94
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,060
from node j s and insert our very first documents into Mongo D.B..

95
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm excited to get to that.

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
