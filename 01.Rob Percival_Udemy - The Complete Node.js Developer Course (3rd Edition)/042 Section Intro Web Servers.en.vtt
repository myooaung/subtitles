00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.280
Welcome to section number seven on web servers.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.800
So far in the class all of the applications we've created have only been accessible via the command

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.420
line.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.140
Now that is a great way to get started but it's not realistic for users.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.570
It would be much better if a user could simply Type A you are all in the browser to pull up and interact

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.040
with our applications.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.170
And that is exactly what we're going to start to work towards in this section in this section you'll

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.400
be learning about one of the most popular NPM libraries out there.

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.380
That is Express Express makes it really easy to create web servers with note these servers are going

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.620
to allow us to serve up all of the assets for our web application.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.890
This includes H2 UML we're going to render to the screen see SS to style our application and client

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.040
side JavaScript so we can set up all sorts of awesome user interaction now using Express.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.310
We're also going to be able to serve up Jason data.

14
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.190
That's what's going to allow us to get the location from the user convert it into a forecast and then

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.720
send the forecast back to the browser to have it rendered to the screen.

16
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.880
Now that's a lot of stuff but don't worry as always we're going to cover all of that in detail step

17
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.230
by step.

18
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.380
Now most courses start here with express but I think that's a rough way to go getting started with the

19
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.600
fundamentals of node is important.

20
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.750
Otherwise it can be hard to differentiate between what is node and what is Express.

21
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.980
Now that you're already familiar with the fundamentals of node it's going gonna be so much easier to

22
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.140
learn and master Express.

23
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.670
Let's go ahead and jump right in.
