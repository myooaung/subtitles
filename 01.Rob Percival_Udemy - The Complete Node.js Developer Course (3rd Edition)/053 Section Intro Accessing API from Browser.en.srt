00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,310
WELCOME TO SECTION NUMBER 8 where you're going to learn how to create your own API endpoints and you're

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,060
going to learn how to access them from the browser.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,490
So right now we have these two distinct applications on the back end.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,060
We know how to take an address and convert that into a forecast.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,630
And on the front end we know how to get our web application up and running in the browser.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
The real question is how do we integrate these two together.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,420
What we need is for the browser to be able to communicate with the server passing and address along

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,670
then the server needs to convert that address into a forecast and pass it back to the browser.

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,730
So the browser can actually render forecast data to the screen to get that done.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,830
You're going to learn how to create your own H TTP Jason end points with Express.

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,940
I'm excited to get to it.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,980
So let's jump right in.
