00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.400
You now have express serving up the contents of the public directory in this video.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.520
I want to take a break from adding anything new to the node j s application and I want to focus on how

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.580
we could continue to build out the public folder adding our other assets into the mix and using them

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.490
in our HDL files.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.250
So things like CSX style sheets to style the application client side JavaScript to add some dynamic

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.270
user interaction and images to show on the screen.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.150
Now let's go ahead and kick things off with the CSX.

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.670
We're going to add if you're not familiar with CSX that's OK we're only going to use a little bit of

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.680
CSX in this class and they CSX.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.530
We do use.

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.770
I'll walk you through.

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.590
So let's go ahead and kick this process off now.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.240
The file that we're going to create needs to be loaded by the browser which means it needs to go in

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.020
the public folder as this is the only directory set up to be exposed by the web server so we can put

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.790
our CSX file in the public folder.

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.380
And I'm actually going to stay organized and create a sub directory called CSX for all of my style sheets

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.610
though for the moment we'll only have one inside of here.

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.190
We can create our brand new style sheet.

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.690
I'm going to call this Stiles dot CSX for now.

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
We have very simple Web pages where we just render a title for each page since we only have one thing

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.570
showing up.

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.270
We should probably add a style to that so we can actually see if our style sheet is loading correctly.

23
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.160
All we're going to do is change the color of the title.

24
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.990
We're seeing to start we define which elements we're trying to style in this case.

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.710
It's just our H ones.

26
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.890
So I'm going to type out a one followed by an opening and closing curly brace in here we define all

27
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.680
of these style properties we want to apply to those headers and for the moment we're just going to apply

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.120
one which is going to be color.

29
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.590
Color allows you to set the text color right here after the colon.

30
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.660
I'm gonna type out gray followed by a semicolon and there we go.

31
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.570
We have a completely valid style sheet.

32
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.080
Now just because we have it created in the public folder doesn't mean it's actually going to be used.

33
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.640
If I were to head over to local host three thousand the root of the site we're gonna see that it's not

34
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.600
visible here and it's not visible on any of our other pages as well.

35
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.360
The title still shows up in black as opposed to gray.

36
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.180
That's because we haven't loaded it in in our HDL files.

37
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.350
So let's go ahead and do that starting with index done HDMI out right here.

38
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.300
I'm gonna go ahead and setup a new element inside of head.

39
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.660
This is link right here less than link greater than and the link is an empty element which means it

40
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.190
actually does not have a closing tag like we see with H1 and its closing tag here or body and its closing

41
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.990
tag down below link sits just like this.

42
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.840
Now we set up on a link to attributes these are key value pairs allowing us to define specific values

43
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.330
link to set up a style sheet expects those two to be set right here.

44
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.510
The first is Rel which is short for relationship.

45
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.770
What exactly are we linking in in this case style sheet.

46
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.700
Is the value we have to apply then each ref This is the path to the file.

47
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.160
We're trying to load.

48
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.480
Now it's important to note that this path is relative to our current location and it's absolute start.

49
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.060
Is the public directory.

50
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.520
What do I mean by that.

51
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.650
Well dot forward slash is obviously going to leave us in this public directory where index dot HDL lives.

52
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.690
From there we could use C Ss forward slash styles dot CSX and that would indeed work.

53
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.340
This is a relative path.

54
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.410
So if I go ahead and refresh things I can see that now my title is great which is great.

55
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.480
Now that's the relative path version.

56
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.200
We can also use an absolute path the absolute path starts with a forward slash.

57
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.120
Now typically if you started a path with a forward slash on your machine that would bring you to the

58
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.780
route of the hard drive.

59
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.920
But this is being accessed in the browser and thank God it doesn't have access to your hard drive otherwise

60
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.820
anyone could put up a Web site that reads files you wouldn't want them to read.

61
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.490
This is relative to the web server route which we set up as the public folder.

62
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.250
So that would be forward slash CSX forward slash styles dot CSX.

63
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.350
And this is that you are well we're going to end up using now if we were to save things and refresh

64
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.360
things in the browser we can see that once again we do still indeed have the gray style showing up.

65
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.460
So we created a styles sheet in the public folder.

66
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.290
We loaded it in and we were able to style our application from here we could add other style sheets

67
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.920
and we could add more content to these style sheets to create a complex dynamic web site.

68
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.330
Now from here we could take the link element.

69
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.780
We can copy it over to our other files to make sure these style sheet loads there as well.

70
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.130
I'm going to paste it into both HDL files and I'll go ahead and save things as well.

71
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.990
So that's loading in the style sheet.

72
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.640
I also want to show you how you can load in a client side JavaScript file to get that done once again

73
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.030
and we're gonna have to add a new file to the public folder.

74
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.920
And this is gonna be a J.S. file like we did with our style sheets.

75
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.940
I'm going to create a new folder in the public directory called J.

76
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.760
S and in the J S directory we can just make a single style we can call this one something like app J

77
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.180
J.S. and this is a javascript file which will actually fill out a bit later to do something meaningful

78
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.260
for the moment.

79
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.060
We're just going to do something not meaningful and print a message to the screen so we can at least

80
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.800
see if it's loading up right here.

81
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.440
Client side JavaScript file is loaded.

82
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.950
Perfect.

83
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.700
So go ahead and print some message in your javascript file.

84
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.530
We can then go ahead and actually close that down as we're not going to make any changes to it for a

85
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.880
few lessons and from here we're going to make sure that it gets loaded in to index dot HCM out.

86
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.660
We're actually not going to load it into the other pages and you'll learn why a bit later.

87
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.330
So right here how do we get that done to do that.

88
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.000
We use a script tag in the head.

89
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.970
Now script is not an empty element which means we do setup an opening and closing tag which you can

90
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.090
see that Visual Studio code automatically completed for me.

91
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.300
And then we provide the path to the file.

92
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.000
Much like we did in the H ref attribute though we do it with the script tag via the source attribute.

93
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.840
So source equals right here.

94
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.710
That would be forward slash J.S. forward slash app dot J s perfect.

95
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.460
Now that we have this in place we can make sure that our message shows up when we run the HD CML file.

96
00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.410
Now it's not gonna show up on any browsers page but it will show up in the developer tools.

97
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.870
We can open those by going to the settings menu more tools developer tools.

98
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.940
And once we're here we're gonna see something pretty similar though a little more complex than what

99
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.180
we had when we debug node j s we're just looking for this console tab where we can view things that

100
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.160
were output it to the console and right here I have my message client side JavaScript file is loaded.

101
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.900
So we have a CSX file we have a javascript file.

102
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.630
Let's go ahead and wrap things up by adding an image into the mix as that's one of the last common assets

103
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.940
you would definitely end up using if you were building pretty much any kind of Web site out there.

104
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.800
This means we are going to need an image we can load into one of our H2 PML files.

105
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.210
We're gonna get a profile picture of ourselves and put that on the about page.

106
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.500
So it shows up under some description about what the Web site is all about.

107
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.280
Now if you have a picture of yourself you can go ahead and bring that into the public directory.

108
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.910
I'm going to use a picture of myself at links dot Meade dot I O forward slash.

109
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.210
Pick one.

110
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.450
Now obviously you probably don't want to use a picture of me but if you don't have a picture of yourself

111
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:16.720
handy you can always use what I have at links dot Mead dot I O forward slash pic to.

112
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.760
This is a picture of a robot and you can use that for your application.

113
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.740
So either image would work just fine or an image you have on your machine.

114
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.200
I'm going to go ahead and grab the picture of myself and once I have that downloaded I'm going to make

115
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.520
sure it gets into the right directory.

116
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.420
So I'm going to open up my finder or the file explorer on Windows.

117
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.050
I'm going to navigate to the downloads area and find my picture from there.

118
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.920
We have to get it into the desktop file.

119
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.840
So I have to copy it to the clipboard.

120
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.390
I'm going to use the keyboard shortcut but you can always use the right click copy image and then I'm

121
00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:00.390
going to go to desktop followed by that into the node course directory where we have web server then

122
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.130
we go into the public folder.

123
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.660
And right here we don't have a place for images.

124
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.650
We could just stick it right here alongside of our HDMI file but we could also create a new folder for

125
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.730
those right here I am G inside of there.

126
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.880
I'll paste in that file I copied before.

127
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.850
So now that we have the image in the images directory in the public folder it's going to be accessible

128
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.060
to anyone who has an internet connection.

129
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.690
I can see it showing up right here and we can actually load it in to our page to do that right below

130
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.840
the H one.

131
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.390
We are going to setup an image element.

132
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.300
This is also an empty element.

133
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.010
So there is no closing tag.

134
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.560
And we specify the path to the image using these source attribute like we did with the script.

135
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.890
So forward slash image forward slash me dot PMG is going to get the job done.

136
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.590
Now if we save things we can pull up the about page and make sure it's actually showing up over in the

137
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:04.960
browser I'm going to go to forward slash about Dot HDL and what do I see.

138
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.390
I see the title with the picture of me down below.

139
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:13.600
If I were to head over to the other pages I would not see this picture as it's only listed here.

140
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.290
Now we could always go ahead and target this AMG element if we wanted to.

141
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.130
Over in these styles file.

142
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.430
Let's go ahead and add a couple of new lines and we're gonna set up another set of styles.

143
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.040
This time I'm going to target my image elements.

144
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.340
We just have one.

145
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.430
I'm going to set up the curly braces and we're gonna make the image a bit smaller than it currently

146
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.140
is.

147
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.340
I'm gonna say that I want the image to be two hundred and fifty pixels wide.

148
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:51.110
So with equals so right after with we have the colon space then 2 5 0 p x 4 pixels followed by the semicolon.

149
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.190
And we're done.

150
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:59.140
Now we can go ahead and refresh the page and we can see our image shows up at a more reasonable size.

151
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.430
Now that we have this in place we've taken a little tour of all of the different assets we can include

152
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.040
in our web server as we're building out our Web sites.

153
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.600
That's where we're going to stop for this little tour of the front end.

154
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:18.520
We have h to UML javascript CSX and images all being loaded in with our server in the next video.

155
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.490
We're going to turn our attention back towards node j.

156
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:26.050
S and we're gonna continue to build out and expand on our application.
