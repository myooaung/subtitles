Welcome to s..

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.970
Number three in this section we'll be diving right into no J Yes.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.390
And we'll start to create our first of four applications.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.110
That first app is the note taking app.

5
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.300
Now in this section in particular the focus is going to be on one of the most fundamental features of

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.500
node which is the node module system.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.830
This is what allows us to load functionality into our app and use it to do interesting things.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.210
So as an example if you want to go ahead and read or write from the file system if you want to connect

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.160
to a database or start up a web server all of those are going to require you to use the node module

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.060
system.

11
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.120
Now we're going to learn how to use it in three different ways.

12
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.130
You'll learn how to load an core node modules.

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.690
These are modules that are included with your node installation.

14
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.880
You'll learn how to load in third party modules written by other developers and you'll learn how to

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.240
load in modules that you yourself have created.

16
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.460
I'm really excited to dive in and to start this first app.

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.310
So let's get to it.
