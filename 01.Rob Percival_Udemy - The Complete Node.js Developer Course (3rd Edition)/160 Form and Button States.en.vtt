00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.330
In this lesson you're going to continue to expand on our knowledge of acknowledgements by wiring up

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.840
our form and our send location button to be a little more helpful for the user.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.620
So for example if I type a message in and I click send the message is indeed sent but the forms not

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.190
cleared and I'm not refocused on the input.

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.770
The same thing is true with send location depending on how recently it's been fetched it can take up

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.520
to two seconds for the location to be fetched and the user interface doesn't let the user know that

7
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.110
anything's actually happening.

8
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.140
So what we're gonna do is mess around with the input from our code and we're also going to enable and

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.330
disable our buttons so a user can't send to the location again until the previous send a location action

10
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.490
has finished.

11
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.130
So let's go ahead and knock all of that out by making some changes in Visual Studio code.

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.440
Now the first thing we're gonna do is enable and disable event form during the process where the message

13
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.700
is being sent.

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.970
So right here this is when we want to disable the form and then down below in the acknowledgement.

15
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.780
This is where we are going to re enable it.

16
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.530
So there's no reason to send a message until the previous one has been sent.

17
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.940
That's also going to prevent accidental double clicks where someone sends the same message twice and

18
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.470
will end up doing a similar thing with send a location a little bit later.

19
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.610
Now we're gonna end up selecting these same elements over and over again.

20
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.540
So instead of typing out the same code over and over again Up Above we'll create variables for the elements

21
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.220
that we're going to be working with.

22
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.070
So right here I'm just going to create a little comment for this section called elements and we're going

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.730
to create maybe three different constants one for the form one for the input and one for the button

24
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.690
so we can manipulate all of them in the code down below.

25
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.320
So right here what I'm going to do is prefix all of these with the dollar sign.

26
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.760
So the first one will be dollar sign a message form.

27
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.620
Now the only reason I'm doing this is as a convention.

28
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.740
Letting me know that what I have in this variable is an element from the dom that I've selected.

29
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.950
You don't have to do this.

30
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.540
It is merely a convention to make your code a bit easier to pass and then over here will select it.

31
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.010
So just like we have down below we're gonna use document dot query selector and we'll grab it by its

32
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.530
I.D. That is message hyphen form.

33
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.520
Now instead of needing to type this out down below I can just reference the variable so I'll remove

34
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.480
what I already have up above and just reference message form adding add event listener right on to it.

35
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.750
Next up we're going to also set up elements for the input and the button right here.

36
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.000
Const that's going to be a message of form input equals and we'll actually start with message form and

37
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.680
on there I'll use query selector to find something inside of the form.

38
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.900
And in this case an input is what I'm looking for.

39
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.120
Next I can do the exact same thing for the button.

40
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.070
So const message form button equals.

41
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:29.450
Right here I will select from message form the following query selector grabbing the button.

42
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.400
Perfect.

43
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.350
And now that we have this in place we have everything we need to start manipulating our button our form

44
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.640
and our input.

45
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.840
Right down below now the first thing we're going to do is disable that submit button.

46
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.450
That's going to disable the entire form.

47
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.570
You won't be able to submit it by clicking enter and you won't be able to submit it by clicking the

48
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.410
button.

49
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.060
So right here that is message of form button and we're gonna do just a little bit of Dom manipulation.

50
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.020
So dot set attribute allows us to set attributes on our H2 UML elements.

51
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.110
And right here what are we going to do.

52
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.280
We're going to set disabled to disable it and the value is the same as the actual attribute name.

53
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.370
So disabled for the value as well.

54
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.490
So this line of code just disables the form once it's been submitted.

55
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.650
Now we're not re enabling it at all.

56
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.020
So let's see what this looks like.

57
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.020
And the browser.

58
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.310
I'll give my browser a refresh.

59
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.390
Right here I'll type a message in I'll click send and we can see that the button has been disabled I

60
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.160
can't click it again and if I try to hit enter over here nothing's happening either.

61
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.510
The message is not getting sent more than just once.

62
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.450
Now that we've successfully disabled the button we do want to make sure that we eventually reach enable

63
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.940
it and we're going to re enable it in our acknowledgement callback down below.

64
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.700
Now I want to re enable it regardless of whether or not we got an error.

65
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.820
So I'll add that right here that is a message of form button and we are going to use remove attribute

66
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.490
to remove an attribute we remove it by its name and the name is disabled.

67
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.670
Perfect.

68
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.320
Now if we go ahead and rerun things once again I can type a message in I can go ahead and click send

69
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.560
it's disabled for just a moment then it's re enabled.

70
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.500
So I can send off more messages.

71
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.220
Next up I want to make sure to clear that input after the message has been sent.

72
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.770
So right here will add a little bit of code to get that done as well what we're going to do is start

73
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.210
with message form input.

74
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.270
And here we're going to set value to set the value for the input.

75
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.390
And I'm gonna set it equal to an empty string to clear it.

76
00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.050
We can also move the focus back to the input by using the focused method available on message form input.

77
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.690
So right here let's reference it just one more time and we'll call focus to move the cursor inside of

78
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.930
there.

79
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.870
Now that's going to give us a pretty good setup where we enable the button after the event has been

80
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.920
acknowledged.

81
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.370
I'm going to go ahead and remove those comments and we'll test things out.

82
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:25.620
So right here I'm going to save chat dot J S once again I'll be refreshing the browser and I'll go ahead

83
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.940
and type something in my message I'll click enter and I can see that I do have an error message from

84
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.690
input I have a small typo there.

85
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.330
So let's go ahead and just fix that over here.

86
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.360
I can see I typed Frome instead of form I can save the program and I can run things again.

87
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:52.060
Now we'll try another message hit enter and we can see everything works as expected.

88
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.620
The input was cleared and my focus is right here.

89
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.120
Now if I type a message in and move my focus away from the input and click send the focus is brought

90
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.560
back which is great.

91
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.010
This allows me to type messages really quickly.

92
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.620
So one two three back to back like you would expect.

93
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.700
Now with this in place for the form you're going to do something similar for send a location.

94
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.030
We want to disable that button.

95
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.710
Well we're fetching the location and sending it to the server will re enable it.

96
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.600
Once the event has been acknowledged down below I have some challenge comments outlining what I'd like

97
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.330
you to do.

98
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.140
So let's quickly go over them and then I'll set you loose.

99
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.080
So right here you're going to disable these send location button Well the location is being sent.

100
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.720
Step 1.

101
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.980
You want to set up a selector at the top of the file just like we did for the other three elements.

102
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.740
We've been working with then you're going to disable that send location button just before the current

103
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.130
position is fetched.

104
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.000
So right here after we know that we're actually going to fetch it because they have geo location but

105
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.630
just before we actually start that fetching process.

106
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:08.180
Then from there you'll real enable the button after the acknowledgement callback fires.

107
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.760
So once we've confirmed the event has been sent Will we enable it allowing them to send their location

108
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.520
again.

109
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.210
Then you're gonna go ahead and test your work.

110
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.600
So in the end of the day the button should function very similarly to what it's doing now.

111
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.220
But during that process where the location is being sent the button should be disabled.

112
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.720
All right knock that out and when you're done come back and click play

113
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.350
Oh right.

114
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.130
How'd that go.

115
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.620
Let's kick things off with step number one.

116
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.410
We're gonna stay organized by selecting our elements.

117
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:48.920
Now right here we are using send a location the button and we'll end up using it a bunch more.

118
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.960
So what I'm going to do is copy this to the clipboard and bring it up top up here.

119
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.630
We'll create a new element and you could have called it whatever you wanted to but dollar sign send

120
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.900
location button seems like a pretty good name.

121
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.340
And right here we'll paste in the exact selector we had before.

122
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.980
Now that's it for Step 1 down below what I'm going to do is just refactor this right here.

123
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.730
It's no longer necessary we can just reference our variable instead and we're still using ad event listener

124
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.170
correctly.

125
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.600
So next up we want to disable the button just before getting the current position.

126
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.150
So that's right here.

127
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.790
There's no need to disable it before we check if we're even gonna be able to fetch the location.

128
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.250
So right here we will once again reference send location button.

129
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:43.490
That's why I wanted to break it out into its own variable and then we will go ahead and use set attribute

130
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.760
to disable it.

131
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.750
Setting disabled equal to disabled.

132
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.790
Now from there we want to make sure that we do re enable it in the future.

133
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.500
But let's go ahead and test things out as they are.

134
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.430
So far I'll refresh the browser.

135
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.250
I'll click send location.

136
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.670
It is indeed disabled.

137
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.410
I cannot click it again.

138
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:09.290
All we're gonna do now is make sure that it gets re enabled after the location was fetched.

139
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:15.950
So right here let's get that done down below in our acknowledgment either before or after our console

140
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.630
dialog we're going to enable the button once again.

141
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:28.670
So that is send a location button this time using remove an attribute and removing disabled.

142
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.840
Excellent.

143
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.290
Now the last thing left to do is to test our work.

144
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.360
So I'm going to remove these challenge comments and make sure everything is functional from inside of

145
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.460
the browser.

146
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.860
I'll save all of my files refresh the browser and attempt to send to the location.

147
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.890
Right here I'll send the location and I can see the button is now disabled.

148
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:55.160
Well it's fetching that location and once the location prints the button is re enabled allowing me to

149
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.180
click it again and send to the location again.

150
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:04.160
Now that we have this in place we just have a slightly nicer user interface for our users giving them

151
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.310
clearer feedback as to what's happening with this in place we're going to continue on to the next lesson

152
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.940
and focus on getting our messages rendered to the user interface as opposed to just showing up in the

153
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.650
console down below.

154
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.880
I'm excited to get to that.

155
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.310
So let's jump right in to the next one.
