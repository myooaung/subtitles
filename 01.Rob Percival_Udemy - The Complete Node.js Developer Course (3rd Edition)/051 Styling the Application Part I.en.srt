1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,270
In this video we're going to wrap up our introductory section to web servers by adding some styles to

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,470
our application.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,520
So right now it is mostly unskilled and it's not looking so great.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,160
By the end we'll have a much nicer looking styled version of the app now to kick things off.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,300
I want to close all open editors and collapse all expanded directories.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,210
We're still working with the contents of the web server but I want to start from a nice clean slate

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,020
without having a dozen different files open to kick things off.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,280
We're going to focus on two files.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,400
We're going to focus on these styles file in public forward slash C Ss that is styles dot C Ss and we're

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,650
going to focus on one of our views.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,770
So in the views folder we can grab a file like index dot HP s.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,750
The goal is to write some styles that's going to make this page look better than the same styles will

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,430
get used throughout all of our handlebars templates creating a nice unified feel for the site.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,450
Now if we are going to start by styling this home page let's go ahead and actually pull that one up

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,580
in the browser.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,420
This is the weather page.

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,740
Now we're ready to actually make this site look a little nicer since this is primarily a back end.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,480
Course we're not going to spend a ton of time focusing on CSX.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,910
So if you're interested in actually learning about CSX and how it works and all of the different ways

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,290
it can be used there are plenty of great Udemy courses on the topic.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,750
The goal in this video is for me to just give you some basic styles that's gonna make the application

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,510
look a bit nicer but the stuff we're actually going to learn about pertains to node servers and the

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,580
back end.

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,340
With that said let's add a few styles into the app to get started.

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,070
We're going to add some styles for the body element that's going to allow us to setup some global styles

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,300
for our funds and it's also going to allow us to center our site content.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,010
Let's go ahead and kick things off in styles dot SS by completely wiping everything we have.

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:08,820
So far all seven lines we're going to end up writing maybe 40 or so lines in this file in this video

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,400
and we're going to kick things off by selecting the body and setting up our curly braces.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,810
Now we'll end up putting a few different properties inside of here to start though.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,140
Let's focus on some font related items.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,580
We're going to start with color now when we set color on the body.

33
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,790
We're setting the color for the entire site not just for a single piece of text to show you what I mean.

34
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,850
Let's go ahead and set color to read it temporarily.

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,410
That's not the value we're going to use in the long run.

36
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,060
But if I refresh the page I can see that I now have a red header and a red paragraph in the footer.

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,010
Now you'll notice that the text links those are not showing up in red.

38
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,620
That's because anchor tags have their own custom colors.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,960
They are blue by default and purple when they've been navigated too though don't worry we'll learn how

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,630
to style the colors for those as well.

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,050
A bit later in the video now we're not going to use red.

42
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,010
Instead we're going to provide a hex code a hex color code that starts with the hash sign which is shift

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,510
3 followed by our hex code which in this case is going to be the number three six times one two three

44
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,790
four five six.

45
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,700
Now if you're not familiar with hex codes it's just a way to represent a color and if you're using design

46
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,880
tools like sketch or photoshop you're going to end up working with colors in this hex format and then

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,710
you can translate them from that design tool over to your style sheets.

48
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,110
In this case though I'm providing the hex code for you.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,180
Now this particular hex code is still a pretty dark gray.

50
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,760
So it's going to look kind of like what we had before.

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,460
But a little nicer if I refresh the browser.

52
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,250
What do we get.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,650
We can see that it's not quite black but it's definitely pretty close.

54
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,040
So now that we have that in place let's go ahead and customize the font family that is the actual styles

55
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,760
to the individual characters font family is going to allow us to get that done and we're going to start

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,940
with a very simple font available on most machines which is just aerial.

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,740
This is a nice sans serif font which is going to get rid of those little syrups on the individual characters.

58
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,640
If I go ahead and refresh things we can see we now have a nice clean look from here.

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,030
We're gonna go ahead and continue to add some styles to body.

60
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,530
The goal is going to be to center our content so it's not pushed right up against the left hand side.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,740
Now to do that we're going to end up setting a few different properties.

62
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go ahead and start with one that is Max hyphen with max width allows us to set a max with for

63
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,210
the site so I can use a value like six hundred and fifty pixels as an example 650 P X and this is going

64
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,560
to constrain how wide our content can be.

65
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,860
Now if we refresh the browser we're going to notice there's zero change even though behind the scenes

66
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,580
something has changed instead of our content taking up the whole with it now stops right about here.

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,270
The goal is to take this block from here to here and center it.

68
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,460
So it goes from about here to about here.

69
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,630
We can do that with a couple properties down below what we're gonna do is set up margin.

70
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,030
So margin is one of two spacing properties will end up using to style or applications.

71
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:38,020
And in this case we're going to use it to evenly distribute space on the left and the right of the body.

72
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,140
So all of that content shows up in the center.

73
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:48,100
Now to get that done we provided two values here zero space auto followed by a semicolon.

74
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,550
So zero is the margin value we're applying to the top and the bottom.

75
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm not trying to add any additional space above or below the content so we're going to leave that as

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,990
zero an auto is going to evenly distribute the space on the left and the right.

77
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,390
So the first value is the margin value for a top and bottom.

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,120
The second value is the margin value for left and right.

79
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,830
Now if we go ahead and save the content we are going to notice a difference.

80
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,260
It is now centered.

81
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,540
So we have a block going from about here to about here.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,510
And it's showing up in the center of the browser.

83
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,910
Now if I was to make the browser window smaller we'll see that our content adjusts correctly.

84
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,930
The only problem is that it's jammed up against the left hand sidebar.

85
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,190
We can address that with a another sizing property down below.

86
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,710
We're going to go ahead and set up padding.

87
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,800
We are going to define two values like we did for margin.

88
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,760
The first is going to be zero.

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm not trying to add any additional space above or below.

90
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,550
And the second is going to be a value like 16 pixels.

91
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,990
So in this case we're putting 16 pixels between our body content and the side of the browser window

92
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,690
that's going to prevent things from getting jammed up against the edge of it.

93
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,170
And if I refresh the browser what do we get.

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,910
I can see there's now a little more breathing room making the site look a little nicer.

95
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,850
Now let's bring that browser window back to its full width and we'll go ahead and continue styling our

96
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,340
site.

97
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,030
The next thing we're going to style is the footer and there's a reason that I'm diving into the footer

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,310
before diving into the header.

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,980
Now the footer markup that lives in footer.

100
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,850
HB Yes.

101
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,610
And over here we are going to make a small change before adding any styles H2 UML provides us with a

102
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,810
footer element which we can use to house our footer content.

103
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:44,290
So right here I'm going to set up footer and all I'm going to do is take our paragraph and I'm going

104
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,150
to move it right inside.

105
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,130
This is going to allow us to easily expand the footer adding more content inside of there.

106
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,430
Now that we have our footer element set up let's go ahead and move into styles Don CSX and target it

107
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,870
down below.

108
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,550
We are targeting footer.

109
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,830
We are providing a list of style is we want to apply and to kick things off.

110
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,850
I want to talk about the differences between margin and padding if you're not familiar and the best

111
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,590
way to illustrate this is to give our footer a background color.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,250
So right here background.

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's go ahead and use something very obvious like blue.

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,200
Now we're not actually gonna keep this in place.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,860
We're just going to use it to explore a new concept.

116
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,900
So right here we have our blue black round for the footer and you can see that all of the text is sitting

117
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,180
right inside.

118
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,310
Now we have two ways we can space things.

119
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,610
We have the margin and we have the padding the padding is going to put space inside of this box.

120
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,500
And the margin is going to put space outside of the box between the box and other items.

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,400
Let's check this out.

122
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,410
So to kick things off what I'm going to do is set up padding.

123
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,130
I'm going to set padding equal to a single value when we use just a single value.

124
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,320
It gets applied on all sides.

125
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,240
So in this case I'm going to use something like 16 pixels.

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,580
Now if we go ahead and refresh the page by adding padding we're putting space between the edges of the

127
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,790
box and the content inside.

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,280
So between the edge of the blue and our text if I refresh things that's exactly what we get.

129
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,780
We have a much bigger box.

130
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,790
Now the margin it's going to put space between these things outside of the box and the box itself.

131
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,830
That would allow us to put some space between this blue box and the header links above.

132
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,660
So right here let's go ahead and explore that.

133
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:41,010
That's gonna be margin and I will set the value equal to something like 16 pixels I'm then going to

134
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,090
go ahead and save the style sheet.

135
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,520
And now I can see we have space outside of the box on all sides.

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,890
So that's the difference between margin and padding and we'll end up using both throughout this course

137
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,300
and we're actually going to use both right inside of footer to start though.

138
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,880
Let's go ahead and wipe all three styles we set up and we're going to start by setting up color once

139
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,790
again in the footer text color is going to be a bit lighter than the rest of the content making it not

140
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,600
pop quite as much and for this we'll use another hex color code that is the number eight six times which

141
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,500
is a slightly lighter gray than what we had before.

142
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,570
Next up we're going to set up a border.

143
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,530
So we're gonna have a border at the top of the footer by setting border high thin top.

144
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,650
Now you have border life and left border hyphen right and border hyphen bottom for those other borders.

145
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,180
In this case though we don't want all four borders.

146
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,900
I just want a single one.

147
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,840
So we're only going to set up a single one right here.

148
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,240
We provide three values for the border.

149
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,360
It's with I'll use one pixel the type of border like dashed or solid I'll use solid and then the hex

150
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,050
color code.

151
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,250
We'd like to use.

152
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,870
I will be using a very light gray.

153
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:01,290
That is the letter E six times one two three four five six.

154
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,780
Before we go any further let's go ahead and save the style sheet refresh things in the browser.

155
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:13,080
And now we can see we do indeed have our border and we do indeed have our lighter text color from here.

156
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,330
Let's go ahead and set up a bit of spacing using padding and margin.

157
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm going to start off with margin and we're only going to set the top margin that is going to be space

158
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,560
between the box which in this case ends with the border.

159
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,150
And what's above it which in this case is the NAV items.

160
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:37,180
Now we could use margin but there's also shorthand for margin top left bottom and right.

161
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,660
So right here I'll just set margin top since that's the only value I actually want to configure and

162
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,220
I'll use 16 pixels for that.

163
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Next up I'm also going to set up the padding.

164
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,850
So I'm going to have a little bit of padding inside of there.

165
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,780
Right here I'm going to set up 16 pixels for the top and the bottom and I'll do zero for the left and

166
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,830
the right.

167
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,360
Now with this in place let's go ahead and refresh our styles to see what we get.

168
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,410
In there we go.

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,050
We have a nice styled footer now.

170
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,890
Currently it's still pushed up near the top of the page a bit later.

171
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,960
We'll learn how to make that stick near the bottom where you'd expect the footer to live.

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,030
But now that we have the footer styled for the most part we're going to focus on the header.

173
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,900
Now the mark up for the header that lives in a different file that is in header dot HB Yes.

174
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,060
So let's take a moment to crack that open and make a couple of small modifications HDMI l provides us

175
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,550
with a header element that we can use to house our header content and that's what we're gonna use.

176
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,520
I'm going to remove the div in our current tag and swap it out with header and I'll do the same thing

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,210
in the closing tag down below and we're gonna do from here is take the H1 and put it right inside so

178
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,790
I'll cut the H1 out down below I'll add it right in and there we go.

179
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,370
This is the final structure.

180
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,540
We're going to end up using for the header now by default.

181
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,190
This isn't going to change the look of the site at all.

182
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,200
But now we can actually target everything with C Ss and customize the look and feel to get started over

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,140
in styles dot C Ss.

184
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,560
I'm going to setup a style targeting header and we are going to provide just the margin.

185
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,110
So the goal here is to add a little space between the header and the content below and between the header

186
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,530
and the top of the browser window up above.

187
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,010
So we want to set margin top and margin bottom.

188
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,200
I can do that using margin hyphen top.

189
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,150
I'll use a value of 16 pixels for that.

190
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,620
Then I can also set margin I thin bottom using a bigger value.

191
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,560
Let's go ahead and use something like forty eight pixels not forty seven.

192
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,610
That was a typo.

193
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,650
Perfect.

194
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,540
Now we have a nice set of styles provided.

195
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,400
And if I refresh things we have just a bit more space surrounding our content.

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,670
Next up we are going to target our header that is the H one element and we are going to make the font

197
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,660
much bigger.

198
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,270
And we're gonna give it a bit more spacing.

199
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:12,180
So right here I am going to set up font size to customize how big the font is.

200
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,860
And in this case we're going to use something much bigger like 64 pixels.

201
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,350
I'll also set up margin hyphen bottom to but to put some spacing down below.

202
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,270
Perfect.

203
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm going to save the file.

204
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,380
Give things a refresh.

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,060
And now we can see our headers really starting to come together.

206
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,590
The next thing we want to style are the navigation items.

207
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,030
So we have our three links in here we want to customize these styles for each.

208
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,210
Now there are a few different ways we can style our links.

209
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:49,880
One approach would be to just head into styles Don CSX target the a element and then set up our styles.

210
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,200
Now the problem with this is that if we have links anywhere else in our site like somewhere as the help

211
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,990
page content they're going to take on the exact same style as our NAV items which is likely not what

212
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,900
we want.

213
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
So we're going to go ahead and customize things just a little bit.

214
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,930
What I'm going to go ahead and do is target using the following selector.

215
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,940
So I'm targeting header then inside of there.

216
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,410
That's what the space does.

217
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm looking for any links.

218
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,550
So here we are just targeting our links inside of the header.

219
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:29,910
And now we can target those specifically without changing links throughout the entire site right here.

220
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,630
Let's go ahead and add a couple of styles for our navigation items.

221
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:41,770
First up we are going to change the color I will use the Hex Code 8 8 8 8 8 8.

222
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,950
Then we're going to set up a margin property margin hyphen right to put some space between all of these

223
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,630
items.

224
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,920
We can use something pretty small like 16 pixels.

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,070
And then lastly we want to remove that underline.

226
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:03,080
Well it's a stylistic choice and I'm choosing to do that and we do that using text hyphen decoration.

227
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,750
You can set text decoration equal to underline to underline pretty much anything you'd like.

228
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,960
But in this case we don't want to set it to underline which is the default value for our links.

229
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,490
Instead we're going to set it to none which removes that underline.

230
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:25,130
So now we should see links in a lighter color with a bit of space between them without the underline

231
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,810
showing.

232
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,740
And if I refresh things that is exactly what we get.

233
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,440
Now these sites are really starting to come together.

234
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:37,310
I can navigate between the pages and I can see that my header and footer styles come with me.

235
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,170
So now that we have the header and footer styled that's where we're gonna stop for this one.

236
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,700
There's a few more things we'll be adding but I don't want this video to get too long as I'm going to

237
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,760
break it into two parts in the next video.

238
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,370
We'll finish this little bonus on styling the application and we'll finally wrap up the section.

239
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,350
I'll see you next time.
