1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,040
In this lesson you'll be integrating styles into the chat application.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,720
Now much like we did for the weather web application I have these styles pre created and in this lesson

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,150
we'll be downloading them and integrating them into our existing HDMI l document.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,260
Now for the moment we only have one page for the chat application.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,750
A bit later we'll be adding a second one where a user can provide the name of the chat room they're

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,860
trying to join and their own personal user name.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,360
But for now we'll focus on just styling the actual chat page.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,840
The content shown here you can download all of the assets we're going to need for this one over at links

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,220
dot Mead dot I O forward slash chat assets when you visit this link it's going to redirect you over

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,330
to a different U.R.L. and this is where you'll be able to grab the zip download that is chat assets

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,650
dot zip.

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,350
So I'm going to take a quick moment to actually download it to my machine then we'll navigate over to

13
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,650
the finder and integrate this into our project.

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,550
So navigate to your finder or your file explorer depending on your operating system on one window.

15
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:23,380
I have the chat app project folder on another I have my downloads directory right here what I'm gonna

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,530
do is expand chat assets and in there we have two folders.

17
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:36,120
We have a CSX directory this contains a style sheet for the chat application as well as a Minnifield

18
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,320
version which is the same thing.

19
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,580
Just not meant to be read or edited by humans.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,780
It's a little smaller and runs a little faster and the other directory we have is an image directory.

21
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,420
In here we have a fave icon that's going to show up in the browser tab right here.

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,850
So let's go ahead and take both of these directories and we're going to bring them over to the public

23
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,800
folder of our chat app.

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,070
So I have the chat app with the public directory.

25
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,980
I'm just gonna grab these and move them over there.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,960
Now in public we have both of those directories and we're done with the finder.

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,150
We can go ahead and close things down and focus on actually integrating these assets into our project.

28
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,380
So I'm going to close this tab and close down the little downloads panel at the bottom.

29
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,830
I'll navigate back over to the chat window and we're going to spend the rest of our time in index dot

30
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,120
H2 UML.

31
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,540
We're gonna work through this file from top to bottom making the changes necessary and the first set

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,340
of changes will happen right here inside of the head tag.

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,320
First up let's go ahead and use title to set up a title for this document.

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,750
And I'm going to use something like a chat app.

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,220
This will show up in the browser tab instead of what currently shows up which is local hosted three

36
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,610
thousand and then from here.

37
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,810
We're gonna go ahead and link the five icon as well as our style sheet exactly like we've already done

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,790
before.

39
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:15,800
So I'll use link for both to link in the icon the relationship the real attribute has a value of icon

40
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,810
then the H ref attribute is the path to the icon that is forward slash image forward slash right here.

41
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,280
The only file we have is fave icon dot PMG.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
Perfect.

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,020
Next up we'll take a quick moment to load in the style sheet.

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,100
Also using link this time though the relationship is that of a style sheet.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,790
So right here.

46
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,920
Style sheet and then a draft will be the path to that file.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,350
Now you could go ahead and load in either of the files inside of there if you want to add new features

48
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,430
to the app and customize these styles later you could always switch to this file the unmodified version.

49
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,260
But for now let's go ahead and load in the Minnifield version as it'll load a little faster.

50
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:12,420
So right here H ref forward slash C Ss but words slash styles dot Min don't see ISIS.

51
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,400
Perfect.

52
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,210
Now with this in place we should see some pretty drastic changes to our application.

53
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,330
So far.

54
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,800
I would expect the title and the icon to show up as well as some styles.

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,830
Now the styles aren't gonna look great just yet because we'll have to alter the structure of our document

56
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,220
and add some classes into the mix but we should at least noticed some change over in the browser.

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,120
Let's give things a quick refresh and right here what do we see.

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,210
1 I see my icon too I see my page title and three things definitely look different now.

59
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,400
Once again things aren't completely styled although there are some styles being applied.

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,500
For example if I send my location I can see the disabled style makes the button look different until

61
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,900
the location is actually sent.

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,080
But now what we're going to do is integrate the classes that these style sheet uses to make all of this

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,920
look like it's actually supposed to look so over inside of index dot HDL.

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,610
That means we'll be making changes to what's right here inside of body.

65
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,270
We're gonna add classes and do a little bit of restructuring adding a few elements into the mix strictly

66
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,850
to get the layout we're looking for.

67
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,160
The first thing we're gonna do is add a couple of new divs just to create the layout we want.

68
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,080
We're gonna have a side bar on the left and the main chat content on the right.

69
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,960
So the first thing we're gonna do is create a div element with a given class right here.

70
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,900
Let's go ahead and set that up.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,010
The class for this one which is used in that style sheet is called Chat.

72
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:59,880
Now inside of here we're going to add two new divs one for the side bar and one for the main chat content.

73
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,340
So right here let's go ahead and create both of those.

74
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,280
The first one is not going to have any content for the moment we'll focus on populating that sidebar

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,820
a little bit later in the course.

76
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,430
So right here we set up the class chat underscore underscore sidebar for that.

77
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,280
And once again no content inside.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,620
Down below the last div we're going to put in this chat layout is for the main content.

79
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,990
Class equals chat underscore underscore Main and what's going to go inside of here.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,990
Well everything that we have down below not our templates but our messages div our form and the button

81
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,150
for sending the location.

82
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,360
Now these things will change a little bit too but for the moment let's take these three elements.

83
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,790
The div the form and the button we're going to cut them out of their current location and paste them

84
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,540
right here inside of chat Main.

85
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,280
Then we can go ahead and just in-depth them to the proper level and down below we're going to remove

86
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,610
our little chat app title we'll bring a page title back in a little bit later that'll end up showing

87
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,300
up in the sidebar.

88
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,860
Now the only thing we have is our chat div and its contents.

89
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,740
Then down below that are templates and the scripts where loading in from here.

90
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,740
We're going to focus on adjusting what's inside of chat Main.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,960
Now before we do that we can actually see where we've gotten so far with these styles.

92
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,320
So over here in the browser I can give things a quick refresh and we can see the page is starting to

93
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,390
come together.

94
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,490
We're gonna have this dark side bar on the left with the main content on the right.

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,080
Now the next style is we're going to apply will ensure that everything related to composing messages

96
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,960
is sitting down below and the messages take up most of the screen which is currently not what's happening.

97
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,740
So right here we're gonna make a few small adjustments to what we just put inside of chat.

98
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,570
Main first up the message is div.

99
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,280
This has an I.D. allowing us to easily target it from javascript.

100
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,300
We're also setting up a class for this one that is chat underscore underscore messages.

101
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,720
That's going to make sure it takes up the necessary space.

102
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,990
And down below what we have is our form and our button.

103
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:28,300
And obviously the forms contents all of this is going to go in one more new element we'll be creating

104
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,100
right here another div just to make sure that we can set up the layout as needed.

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,870
And this one right here is going to have a class of compose sense everything inside of it is specific

106
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,390
to composing new messages.

107
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,040
We're going to take this we're going to copy it and paste it right inside of that new div adjusting

108
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,020
the levels as needed.

109
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,210
So there we go.

110
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,450
This is the final setup we need for index dot HDL.

111
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,930
As of now we have the main chat area.

112
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:08,790
We then have our sidebar right here we have the right hand side here we have our messages up top followed

113
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,240
by the composition elements down below.

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,520
Now let's make sure that we saved our mark up and from the browser we're going to refresh things one

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,410
more time and we should see some major changes so far so good.

116
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
We now have our messages down below.

117
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,380
We can send those off and they show up up here as you might expect.

118
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,020
Now there are a couple of more adjustments we're going to make to wrap this video up.

119
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,380
I've also provided you with some styles for the actual messages and to the markup for those lives in

120
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,240
the templates down below.

121
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,950
So let's make a few small adjustments to these as well.

122
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,750
Right here we have the root div all we're going to do for this one is add a class onto that and the

123
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,550
class for the message is called appropriately enough.

124
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,820
Message.

125
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,330
Now in the paragraph right here is going to stay as is but it's no longer going to contain the timestamp

126
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,480
that's going to live just above in a separate paragraph.

127
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,590
So right here it will create that separate paragraph setting up the opening and closing tag and inside

128
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,670
of there we're going to add to span elements which will be styling.

129
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,990
The first one is going to be for the user's name.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Now currently there's no way for a user to set their name.

131
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,530
We'll fix that in a few videos.

132
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,130
And the other is going to be the date which we already have.

133
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,930
So right here I'll go ahead and set up the first one and we can just put a dummy name inside some user

134
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,280
name as an example just to make sure we see some content showing up.

135
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,360
This will be dynamic later and then we'll create a second one down below for created at right here adding

136
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,880
it in exactly like we had it up above.

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
Excuse me down below.

138
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,690
Now we can go ahead and close the span tag.

139
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,390
Perfect from here.

140
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh we need to do is set up classes on both of these right here for the first one.

141
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:12,120
That is a class equal to message underscore underscore name and down below for the second one.

142
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,050
That is class.

143
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,850
Message underscore underscore Metta.

144
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,130
Now with this in place are text based messages should be completely styled and we can give that a test

145
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,510
before continuing on.

146
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,470
So I'll refresh the page.

147
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,800
We can see our styles showing up.

148
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,190
I'll type something else and try that perfect.

149
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,350
Now here I was able to send a message with no content.

150
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
We'll fix that a bit later.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,330
Before the final version of the application now we haven't had any styles before the location messages.

152
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,720
So if I send my location it's gonna look exactly like it looked before.

153
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,350
We're going to adjust to that as well.

154
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,320
Right here we'll take the paragraph from up above for our regular message and paste it in the div down

155
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,520
below for our messages that are location based.

156
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,350
Next up for this div we're going to set up the class message once again and inside of this paragraph.

157
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,660
All we're gonna do is remove created at with the hyphen.

158
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,170
We have the paragraph with the link right inside.

159
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,290
Now let's go ahead and test our location styles out.

160
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,810
I'm going to refresh things in the browser.

161
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,780
I'm going to click send location and my location shows up styled right here I have the link I could

162
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:33,680
click that and it still cracks open Google Maps in a brand new tab right here with my location pinned

163
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,940
to the map.

164
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,520
Now that we have this in place we have our basic styles in place for the chat page.

165
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,800
Now don't worry we are going to add something over here in the sidebar a bit later in the class we'll

166
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,320
show the chat room name as well as a list of all of the users currently in the room.

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,930
Right now we don't have any of that wired up though which is why we have the empty content over here.

168
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,380
We're gonna start to address that in the next lesson by allowing users to join a specific chatroom providing

169
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,680
a user name and a room name.

170
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm excited to get that mark up created.

171
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,430
So let's jump right in to the next one.
