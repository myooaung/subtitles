1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,120
The course is officially over.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:08,730
But if you've made it this far into the class you're probably wondering what you could learn next in

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,780
this video.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,080
I'm going to offer up two suggestions for other courses you could take that would pair really well with

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,920
what you learned here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,540
Now in this case I'm recommending other classes I teach.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,300
If you like my teaching style take those.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,920
Otherwise there are plenty of other instructors teaching these same topics.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:37,680
You can find the two topics I'm going to talk about over at Lynx dot Mead dot I O forward slash courses.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,700
This is going to redirect you to my profile page on udemy and if we scroll down these two topics I want

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,840
to talk about our graph QoL and react.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,330
So if you're interested in spending more time with backend development I would definitely recommend

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,130
checking out graph Kuo graph Q offers up an alternative to the traditional rest api and it comes with

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,400
a lot of nice features graph.

15
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:11,970
Q L scales really well it is super flexible allowing the client to request just the data it needs and

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,480
it also comes with support for subscriptions allowing you to create real time web applications as well.

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,770
So if you're interested in taking your knowledge of know J.S. to the next level that is definitely the

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,920
course I would recommend.

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,840
Now if you're looking to get a little better at creating the front end for applications I'd recommend

20
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:40,710
checking out react the react class is going to teach you what it takes to build complex web applications.

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,120
So in this class we built some basic web apps with just standard javascript features in that class.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,770
You'll learn how to use the react library to build complex web apps with complex forms validation models

23
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,620
routing and more.

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,900
So these are my two recommendations.

25
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,730
If you want to spend more time and with the back end learn about graph.

26
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:11,270
Q Well if you want to pair no jackass with a front end technology I definitely recommend react.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,110
Now there are other front end libraries similar to react such as angular and view that is v you e.

28
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,940
Those are fine tools as well but react is definitely my favorite of the bunch.

29
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,610
I wanted to come back just one last time to say thank you so much for taking the class.

30
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm Andrew Meade and I hope you got a lot out of the course and I hope to see you in another class sometime

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,770
soon.
