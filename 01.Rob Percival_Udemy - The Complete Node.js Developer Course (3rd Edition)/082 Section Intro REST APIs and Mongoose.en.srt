Welcome to section number eleven on a REST API eyes.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,380
In the last section you learned how to interact with a database using no J.S. in this section.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,830
Well we're going to do is start to create our very own express based REST API using what we now know

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,780
about data storage.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,110
This is going to allow a user to perform an operation such as signing up for a new account creating

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,080
a task or fetching a list of all of the tasks they still need to complete.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,180
Now along the way we're also going to explore Mongoose mongoose is a really popular library when working

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,220
with node and Mongo D.B..

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:48,050
It gives us a really easy system for modeling our data for modeling things like a user or a task.

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,530
We'll be able to set up the various fields and data types as well as things like data validation which

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,230
is going to make our lives a lot easier and our applications more secure.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm excited to get to all of that and more let's jump right in and talk about mongoose.
