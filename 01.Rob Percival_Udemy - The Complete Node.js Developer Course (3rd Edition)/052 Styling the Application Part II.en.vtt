00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.730
Welcome back to part two of styling your application and this one we're going to wrap up what we started

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.320
in the last video.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.280
Now the first thing I want to style is what lives on the about page.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.550
That is our image.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.710
We previously had a style in place that targeted that.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.430
And if you remember it looked a little bit like this image then we set up our curly braces and all I

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.360
did was set a width with equals 250.

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.950
When we do this it's also going to adjust the height proportionally so the image doesn't look sort of

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.880
skewed.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760
And if I refresh the page things look fine.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.820
Now this is going to change all images on the page which might not be what we want.

12
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.920
Imagine we have a large background image or we have an image that takes up the entire width of the content.

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.630
That's going to need a different set of styles.

14
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.790
So instead of targeting every single image we're going to use the class selector that allows us to target

15
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.890
a specific set of elements.

16
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.350
And right here we start off with DOT followed by a name for this class.

17
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.790
And since this is a portrait image I could call the class something like portrait.

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.890
So it's dot followed by the class name.

19
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.600
Now at no point anywhere in our code have we ever typed a portrait which means that the style is never

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.740
gonna get applied.

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.520
If I refresh the page we're back to that really big image to actually have this style used.

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.290
We set up a class attribute on our HDL elements where we want these styles to be applied in this case

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.610
that would be for the about page and it would be this image right here.

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.160
So as I just mentioned that is class equals inside of quotes.

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.600
We can provide as many classes as we want in this case just one portrait if I wanted another it would

26
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.560
be space followed by whatever the other class name is.

27
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.740
So by listing out the class I'm essentially saying I want this element to take on these styles applied

28
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.870
to that class which in this case is just the one we've set up here.

29
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.160
So this is just a different way to target elements on your page.

30
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.070
Now if I refresh things we have our portrait image showing up as expected and we could choose to have

31
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.080
other images that have a completely different set of styles.

32
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.640
So now that we have this in place what I want to focus on is that footer as I navigate between the pages

33
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.310
you'll notice that the footer is just as high as it can possibly be.

34
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.180
Ideally it would be sticking to the bottom of the page and that's what we're going to focus on setting

35
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.650
up now to do that.

36
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.080
We're gonna have to adjust a few things.

37
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.820
So let's go ahead and get started by closing down a header as we're no longer going to need that.

38
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:53.990
I want to crack open about index for 0 4 and help so our four views and we can start with the home page

39
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.740
so I'll drag index to the front of the list and the goal here is to get that sticky footer in place.

40
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.060
I don't want it up top I want it pushed to the bottom of the browser.

41
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.150
Now to do that we're going to use a simple version of a slightly advanced CSX technique known as flex

42
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.900
box.

43
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.820
If you take a course on CSX flex box will be covered.

44
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.830
We're going to use just the very basics here to achieve a sticky footer.

45
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.900
The first thing we need to do is create another element in order to wrap our content as needed.

46
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.520
So what we're gonna do is use the div element like we've done before.

47
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.120
I'm going to put one right here inside of body and what needs to go inside of there is everything but

48
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.750
the footer that's going to include the header partial but it's also going to include any page content.

49
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:51.300
So for the moment let's add a paragraph to demonstrate that I could say Use this site to get your weather

50
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.030
perfect.

51
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.090
So we want all of our page content the header and anything else we're going to show inside of this div

52
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.500
and the footer is going to sit outside of it using flex box.

53
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.440
We're gonna have this take up all of the space available except what the footer needs that's going to

54
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.500
give us these sticky footer look where the footer is pushed to the bottom of the page.

55
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.510
Now we are going to target this div with a set of styles since div is a very generic element.

56
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.500
It's best to apply a class to it and use that class.

57
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.180
I can go ahead and pick whatever name I like for this.

58
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.220
I'm gonna use main hyphen content as the name.

59
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.360
Now we can correctly style our application getting that sticky footer look over inside of styles dot

60
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.330
CSX.

61
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.710
We have to write a few lines of code.

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.350
First we have to enable flex box.

63
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.070
This is a different way to lay out your items.

64
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.390
And we use that by setting display equal to flex for the moment.

65
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.070
I'm just going to use this space to break up our other styles with our Flex box styles which will be

66
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.150
down here.

67
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.260
Now if we do that it's going to give us some undesired results.

68
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.860
If I refresh the page I can see that my footer is now on the right and the rest of my content is now

69
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.970
on the left.

70
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.180
Now that's not what we want and flex box gives us a way to adjust that.

71
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.640
There is a flex hyphen direction property the default value is row which means everything goes from

72
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.840
left to right.

73
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.720
We can optionally change that to column and this is gonna have everything go from top to bottom and

74
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.680
that's what we want.

75
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.020
So right here I refresh the page and now we're basically back to what we had before.

76
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.740
But with Flex box enabled.

77
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.350
Now the other thing we need to do is to set the height for the body to take up the entire browser height.

78
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.020
Currently it stops right about here and that's a problem because I want to push the footer all the way

79
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.340
to the bottom of the browser window to get that done.

80
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.570
Oh we're going to do is set the minimum height equal to the browser's height which is one hundred V

81
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.390
H V H stands for the viewport height.

82
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.100
So in this case we have 100 percent of the viewport height the viewport being this box where your content

83
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.420
shows up.

84
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.600
If we didn't want one hundred we could use another value like 50 which would be 50 percent of that viewport

85
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.920
height.

86
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.870
But in this case we do indeed want one hundred now that we have this in place.

87
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.620
We are done styling the body.

88
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.950
We don't have the look we want yet but we are very close to getting it.

89
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.020
The only other thing we need to do is target that class we created.

90
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.860
So dot followed by the class name I called it main hyphen content.

91
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.830
And we're going to apply one more flex box style.

92
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.060
This one is called flex hyphen grow.

93
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.610
This allows a given element to grow to take up as much space as it needs.

94
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.840
We're going to set this to one which tells the Flex box that the main content should take up all leftover

95
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.920
space.

96
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.260
Now if we refresh things what do we see.

97
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.750
I can see my footer is pushed to the bottom of the page and as I navigate between the pages I can see

98
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.600
that only the home page is working and that is because we made some changes to the structure adding

99
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.480
that div into place will have to make these same changes to the other page but right here we are indeed

100
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.990
getting the look we were hoping for.

101
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.250
So once again if you want to learn more about flex box I recommend checking it out by taking a Udemy

102
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.310
CSX course or checking it out on a free service like YouTube.

103
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.960
It's a great tool and it's definitely something worth adding to your CSX skillset.

104
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.630
All right.

105
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.790
So from here we're going to focus on our individual template files.

106
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.020
The first thing we need to do is make some adjustments to the other pages.

107
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.720
I am going to set up a div just by typing the element name and hitting tab to auto generate the tag

108
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:04.400
and then I'll use class of main content here on this page and I'll bring all the main content inside.

109
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.580
That's going to make sure that things work well for our forum for page.

110
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.330
There we go.

111
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.100
Now everything is going to work great and we can test things by pulling up the site.

112
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.950
I'm going to go to local host three thousand forward slash me.

113
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.680
I get my 4 0 4 page and it looks great with that sticky footer in place.

114
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.270
Just two more pages left.

115
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:31.350
We have help dot HB Yes here I'm going to use div dot main hyphen content.

116
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.690
This is a shorthand for setting up a div element with the class of main content.

117
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.510
And if I hit tab that is exactly what happens.

118
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.300
There are all sorts of great short hands out there and we're going to do is take the content and paste

119
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.550
it right inside.

120
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.610
Perfect.

121
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.270
Now we can save the file.

122
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.860
We can navigate over to the help page and we're getting our sticky footer there as well.

123
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.440
The last page is the about page which currently does not have that structure in place.

124
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.240
Let's go ahead and fix that about that.

125
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.680
HB Yes.

126
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:11.290
I'm going to generate that div once again div dot main hyphen content then inside of there we put everything

127
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.060
that's on the page except for the footer.

128
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.290
I'm going to paste all of that in indented correctly.

129
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.700
Remove the extra space.

130
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.450
And now we're done.

131
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.150
I can refresh the browser and write here.

132
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:29.080
I now have all of my pages styled in a way that's uniform as you switch between them it feels like the

133
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.360
same site which is exactly what we were going for.

134
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.010
Now from here there are a couple small changes I would like to make.

135
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:41.940
One is to customize the title in the tab as well as the icon that's showing up.

136
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.370
So right here we do that inside of head.

137
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.640
I'm gonna start by setting up the title by opening and closing the title tag and right inside.

138
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.730
We put the title so far about I could use about that's going to show up in the tab and now we can do

139
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.300
the same thing for the other pages for help.

140
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.030
Inside of head I will set up title and I will say help for 4 0 4.

141
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.520
We're also going to set up that title and I will use for 0 4.

142
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:16.110
And then finally for the home page we will set up the title and I can go ahead and use something like

143
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.220
weather.

144
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.870
Now as we navigate between the pages in the browser we'll see those showing up.

145
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:27.510
I'll refresh the home page I get whether I then have about for the about page and help for the help

146
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.560
page.

147
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.140
The last thing we're going to do is customize the icon that shows up in the tab.

148
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.590
This also requires us to add a little code to the header but first we need the image.

149
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:47.250
Now I've already picked one out for you that you can use that is links dot Meade dot I O forward slash

150
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:54.720
pic 3 pic 3 contains a very small icon of a cloud in front of a sun.

151
00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.290
We're gonna go ahead and right click that save image as and we're going to put this in our project image

152
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.290
directory.

153
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.910
So on the desktop that's where I have mine.

154
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.220
I have the web server folder in there we have public image that's where I want to put the content.

155
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.240
I'm gonna save it inside of there.

156
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:20.580
Close the browser tab and make sure it's actually showing up so inside a visual studio code I have my

157
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.730
images directory and in there I have weather dot PMG.

158
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:30.750
Let's go ahead and actually use it and to do this we use LINQ similar to how we linked in a style sheet

159
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.260
though in this case we're linking in an icon.

160
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.980
So I'll setup link.

161
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.260
We're going to set up rail as well as h ref.

162
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.150
Now the relationship between the document and what we're about to link in is not a style sheet.

163
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.520
It is an icon.

164
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.090
And the ref is the path to that image forward slash image forward slash.

165
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.040
I've called this one whether dot PMG.

166
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.250
Perfect.

167
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.330
Now if I do refresh the home page I'll navigate to it.

168
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.090
We can see that we have our little weather icon showing up making the site feel much nicer and a little

169
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.380
more real.

170
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:14.450
I can then take that one line and copy it to my other files so I'll copy it over under the title for

171
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.830
4 0 4 under the title for help.

172
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:24.880
And finally under the title for about now as we navigate between all of the pages on our site it doesn't

173
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.040
feel like anything's been left out.

174
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.490
The tab is nice and styled the content itself is nice and styled and we have that uniform feel as we

175
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.170
navigate between the pages.

176
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.360
Now even if you plan on spending all of your time writing note applications it's still worth at least

177
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.200
brushing up on the basics of HDL and CSX.

178
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.850
That's going to allow you to create nice front end stuff for your note J S applications.

179
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.480
Now even if you're on a large team or that's not your job it's still nice to have that skill set so

180
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.700
you can whip up together something basic at least making it look a little nicer than it would otherwise

181
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.400
be with no styles in place.

182
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.940
All right.

183
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.190
That's it for this video.

184
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.230
And that is it for this section.

185
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.660
We covered quite a bit in this section exploring a few very important topics we explored how to setup

186
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.540
a web server with Express.

187
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.970
And we did that in app dot J S.

188
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:23.710
We learned all sorts of things like how we can use handlebars to render templates how we can serve up

189
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:30.580
static assets and how we can send back Jason data set up for all four pages and more now we've still

190
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.150
only scratched the surface of what Express can do.

191
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.160
It's something we'll end up using throughout the rest of the class even as we integrate more advanced

192
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.090
features like real world databases.

193
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.260
I'm excited to continue on with the course.

194
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.290
I'll see you in the section intro for the next one.
