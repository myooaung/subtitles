Welcome to Section 14 on file uploads.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.520
Now this section is pretty self-explanatory.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.360
We know how to send a basic Jason data from the client to the server and from the server to the client.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.880
The question is how do we do this with images.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.770
What we want to do is allow the client to upload an image to the server we want to store that image

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.100
in the database and we want the server to be able to serve it up so the client can access it later on.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.950
Now in terms of the task manager app what we're going to do is allow users to upload a profile picture

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.630
so they'll provide an image of a specific file format.

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
They'll send it off to the server and we'll do a little processing on our end cropping it to fit our

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.700
needs.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.400
We'll then store it right alongside of the user's other profile data in the database and we'll set up

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.810
a way for the client to be able to access that image when it needs to.

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.220
All right.

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.540
Let's jump right in and talk about file uploads.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.590
In no J.S..
