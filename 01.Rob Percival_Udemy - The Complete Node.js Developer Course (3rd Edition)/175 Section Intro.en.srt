00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,460
Welcome to section 18.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,380
The course is coming to a close but there is still this final section and there are still two really

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,410
important things that I want to cover in the next video.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,710
The first thing I'm going to do is offer up some suggestions for features you can now add to our existing

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,330
applications based off of the skills you acquired in the class.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,600
This is going to give you a few things to work on now that the course is over.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,290
It's going to be really important that you continue to write code and build no J.S. applications in

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,740
order to keep your skills sharp in the final video.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,920
The second thing we're gonna do is aim to answer a single question which is what should I learn next.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,900
So I'll offer up a few different paths based off of your interests.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,580
Let's go ahead and jump right in to the final section.
