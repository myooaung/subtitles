Welcome to section number twelve on authentication and data security in this section and we're going

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.550
to focus on locking down all of the data for the task manager app.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.360
Right now all of the API endpoints are publicly accessible.

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.170
That means anyone can come along and do something like delete every single piece of data in the database.

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.680
And obviously that's a problem.

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.780
So in this section we're going to lock all of that down putting it behind authentication.

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.660
That means users will need to sign up and log in before they're going to be able to do something like

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.060
create a task or fetch a list of their tasks by forcing users to log in.

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.080
We're also going to be able to setup a relationship between a user and the tasks they've created.

10
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.290
That's going to make sure that user 1 can't delete a task or even see a task created by user number

11
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.130
two.

12
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.820
So in this section we're going to talk about authentication passwords security database data relationships

13
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.730
and more.

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.680
Let's jump right in.
