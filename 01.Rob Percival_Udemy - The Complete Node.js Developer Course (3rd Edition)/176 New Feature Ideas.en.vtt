00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.120
The course is coming to an end.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:09.500
But in order to keep your skills sharp it'll be important to continue using node j s so in this video

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.420
we're gonna answer the question.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.780
What should I build now.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.490
Aside from building the applications that I originally drew you to learning node what I'm going to do

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.850
is offer up three ideas for new features you could add to the apps that we've already created.

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.560
This will be a great place to get started.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.820
Now all of these features are quite a bit bigger than any of the challenges included in the course but

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
all of them are 100 percent doable with what you've learned so far.

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.040
So we'll go through all three features the first one is for the weather application so for this one

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.590
users need to type in their location.

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.100
What you're gonna do is allow them to instead click a button that button is gonna use the geo location

13
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.070
API similar to what we did with the chat application when we allowed users to share their current location

14
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
so someone could type in their location like Philadelphia and hit search.

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.090
Or they could click this other button when they do that it's automatically going to fetch their location

16
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.910
with their permission of course then it'll go off to the server and get the correct forecast.

17
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.720
So that is idea 1 combining something used in one of the other applications with the weather app.

18
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.960
The next idea is for the to do app location now in need to do application.

19
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.590
Users can upload profile pictures.

20
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.350
You learned how to work with melter to upload files your new feature idea for that app is to allow users

21
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
to upload images for their individual to dos.

22
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.430
So if I'm creating a to do such as let's say pay the bills I could include a screenshot of something

23
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.840
as well.

24
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.510
Now you already know how to do that since you have used melter with the User model.

25
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.240
All you'd be doing here is using melter with the to do model.

26
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.640
Now the last idea is for the chat application and this idea is going to allow users to get into an active

27
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.440
chat room quickly a chat room where there's already people inside of it.

28
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.900
Right now when you first visit the chat application you're brought to that page that asks you for your

29
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.820
user name and room name.

30
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.640
Now the user needs to provide both of those by typing in the input fields.

31
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.000
What you're gonna do for this feature is also show them a dropdown so a select t AML element that is

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.170
going to have a list of all active rooms.

33
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.830
So to get that done index dot H2 UML is going to need to connect to that socket Don I O back and so

34
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.260
it can get the list of rooms and that means you'll have to add a javascript file and a little bit of

35
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.670
code to get all of that done in the end of the day.

36
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.910
When a new user visits the chat app they should be able to type in the room name manually or they should

37
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.150
be able to pick from a list of rooms that currently have someone inside of them.

38
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.930
All right.

39
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.240
These three feature ideals will give you a few things to work on if you do go through the process of

40
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.080
completing any of these or you just have any questions.

41
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.990
Let's go ahead and use the Q and A for this lesson as a place to post those things.

42
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.410
Now if you end up adding any other new feature ideas to these apps or you end up building an entirely

43
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.950
new application altogether I know I would love to see it and I'm sure other students would as well just

44
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.790
include a link to the demo application so we can mess around with the new features and include a zip

45
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.970
of the code or a link to a github repository.

46
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.380
All right.

47
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.240
That should be a few things to keep you busy for now.

48
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.840
Let's go ahead and move on to the last video.

49
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.280
Figuring out where we could go now in terms of learning something new.
