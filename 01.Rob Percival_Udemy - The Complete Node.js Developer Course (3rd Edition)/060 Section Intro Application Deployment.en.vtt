Welcome to section number nine on application deployment.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.770
Right now the app is running really well locally on your machine.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.130
If a problem is that it's running locally on your machine that means no one else can access it.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.990
In this section you're going to learn how to deploy your no JSA applications to a production server

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.140
so anyone with the app U.R.L. can pull it up in the browser and start to use it.

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.520
Now to get this done we'll be working with three very popular tools get get hub and Heroku get is going

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.350
to allow us to put our application under version control that's going to allow us to track the changes

8
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.230
to our app over time.

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.570
Github is going to allow us to backup our source code and collaborate with others.

10
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.840
Finally Heroku is going to give us everything we need to deploy our no J.S. applications to a production

11
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.650
server.

12
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.640
So our app is accessible with just a single you are out.

13
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.810
I'm excited to get to all of this and more.

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.450
So let's jump right into the section.
