00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,510
Let's now discuss the scatter plot. A scatter plot is a type of plot or

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,550
a mathematical diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates to display

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,800
values for two variables of a dataset. It is usually used to show the

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,150
correlation between two variables.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,600
We will create a scatter plot to show the relationship between the

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,790
actual sale price and the overall material quality.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,410
So I am going to rename the sheet to Scatter Plot.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,110
And then I will choose the scatter plot visualization type, and the

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,460
field wells section is enabled too. In the X‑axis, I will choose the

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,440
overall material qualification, while in the Y‑axis, I am going to

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,850
choose the actual sale price.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,920
And, as you can see,

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:54,000
the overall trend is that an increase in the actual sale price when there is an increase in the overall material quality.
