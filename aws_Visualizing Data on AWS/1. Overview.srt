Hello everyone, this is Mohammed Osman.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,370
And in this module,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,720
we will learn what is AWS QuickSight, how it works, and

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,120
what benefits it brings to the table.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,860
Let's see what we are going to learn in this module.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,270
First and foremost,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,870
we are going to position our course in the AWS Big Data exam and define

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,080
what domain in the exam this course is going to cover.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,760
Then, we will proceed with discussing why we need to do data

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,930
visualization. From there, we will introduce AWS QuickSight, which

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,390
will be the bread and butter of our course.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,610
After that, we will take our discussion more deeper and

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,340
understand the core components of AWS QuickSight.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,990
Finally,

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,960
we will introduce the housing prices dataset, which we will

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,620
use to apply the data visualizations on.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you ready? Let's start another exciting journey.
