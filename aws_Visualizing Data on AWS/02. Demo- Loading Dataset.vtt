1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.510
And now I am in the AWS Management Console.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.060
If you don't have an AWS account,

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.490
please follow this link to create an AWS account.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.840
I will search for QuickSight to create AWS QuickSight service,

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.360
and then I will be asked to sign up for the first time.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.550
Click on Sign up for QuickSight.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.000
Then we will be asked if we would like to choose the

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.560
Standard or Enterprise account.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.280
A Standard account is enough for our demo.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.330
An Enterprise account has additional features such as Row‑Level Security,

11
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.980
Active Directory integration, and data encryption at rest.

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.690
Scroll down and click Continue.

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.060
Then we will be asked to fill in some details such as AWS

14
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.520
region and QuickSight account name.

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.610
I will choose QuickSightHousingSet for the account name,

16
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.570
and also I need to fill in notification email address

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.400
to send important notifications.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.580
The other tick boxes are helpful if we would like to

19
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.430
integrate QuickSight to other AWS services.

20
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
We don't plan to do that so I will click Finish.

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.190
Then I will wait a few seconds until my QuickSight account is created.

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.540
And here it has been created.

23
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.850
Then I will click on Go to Amazon QuickSight,

24
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.630
which is a different portal than AWS Management Console.

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
So the first step we would like to do is to upload our dataset.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.430
We will click on Manage Data.

27
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.960
Then I will click on New Dataset.

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
As you can see,

29
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.130
AWS QuickSight supports many types of datasets such as AWS,

30
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.640
Athena, SQL Server, and even Twitter feeds.

31
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.490
Let's create a simple dataset that is CSV by clicking on Upload File.

32
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.250
And then we will browse to the file directory in our

33
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.210
computer. After AWS QuickSight loads our data,

34
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.090
it will show us a peek from the dataset.

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.310
Let's use this as a chance to explain our dataset.

36
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.020
The first column we have in our dataset is the Zoning Classification, and

37
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.180
this column classifies different types of housing zones,

38
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.510
whether it's low residential, medium residential,

39
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.410
commercial, and so on.

40
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.970
The second column is the Overall Material Condition, and this column

41
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.070
describes the overall house material condition,

42
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.180
which takes discrete values from 1 for lowest and 10 for highest.

43
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.450
The third column is the Overall House Quality.

44
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.990
The Overall House Quality column has discrete values from 1 to 10.

45
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.480
The fourth column is the Roof Style,

46
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.130
and it tells us about the style of the roof of the house.

47
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.150
It can be hip, gable, and so on. And then we have the Fireplace Quality Column,

48
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.270
which indicates the quality of the fireplace in the house.

49
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.710
It can be good, average, fare, and so one on.

50
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.400
And then we have Garage Year Built,

51
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.950
which indicates the year in which the house garage was built.

52
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.350
Garage Area,

53
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.990
the area of the garage. Garage Quality, the quality of

54
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.450
the garage, whether it's average, good, fair, and so on. Years Old,

55
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.420
the year in which the house was sold. Actual Price, this is the

56
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.870
actual sale price of the house. Expected Sale Price,

57
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.480
and this is the expected sale price of the house.

58
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.350
Then I will click Next, and then I will click Visualize. You will notice

59
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.910
that AWS QuickSight provides a nice summary on the right on how the

60
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.620
data‑importing process went. And now let's have a high‑level overview of

61
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.720
our AWS QuickSight window. On the far left,

62
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.450
we have different options that can enable us to do a couple of things

63
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.720
in the visualization, like visualizing, filtering,

64
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840
storytelling, adding parameters, and so on.

65
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.100
In the bottom left, we can choose our visual types.

66
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.340
On the top left is the field list of our dataset or simply put,

67
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.890
the columns, while on the right is our visualization area where

68
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.000
the visualizations will appear. We can add more visualizations by clicking on the plus sign.
