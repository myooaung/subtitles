00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,610
Let's now discuss the TreeMaps.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,950
A TreeMap is a data visualization technique that is used to

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,140
display hierarchical data using nested rectangles.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,310
So, I will create a TreeMap to show the average actual sale price

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,540
and the average of garage area by year sold.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,440
That sounds like a lot, but you will see it.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,740
I will rename my sheet to TreeMap,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,610
and I will choose the TreeMap visualization type. In the Group

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,140
by, which is used to group different items in rectangular form,

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,080
I will choose the year sold. And I will also format the year

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,690
sold for more readability.

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,970
The size of the rectangle will be the average garage area. And

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,840
let's color it with the actual sale price.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,410
The darker color indicates the higher sale price while the lighter

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,270
colors indicate the lower actual sale price.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,000
And, as you can see, year 2009 has the largest rectangle, which is the highest average garage area.
