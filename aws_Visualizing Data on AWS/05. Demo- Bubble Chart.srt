1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's now discuss the bubble chart.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,520
A bubble chart is a variation of a scatter plot in which the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,680
data points are replaced with bubbles.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,690
Bubble charts use the size of the bubble to indicate a

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,710
third dimension of the comparison.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,810
I will create a bubble chart to find the relationship between the actual

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,220
sale price and the overall material quality and taking into account the

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,910
size of the garage as a third dimension.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,940
So I am going to rename the sheet to Bubble Chart,

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,700
and I will choose the scatter plot visualization type.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,330
In the X‑axis, I will choose the overall material quality,

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,330
while in the Y‑axis, I will choose the actual sale price.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,730
Up to now, our bubble chart looks like a scatter plot.

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,900
Let's add the third dimension. And for the third dimension, I am going

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,270
to choose the average garage area. And I will change the aggregate

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,150
type to average. As you can note, the bubbles have different sizes to

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,070
indicate different garage sizes.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,900
However,

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,460
I would like to limit the results for one year to have better visibility,

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,210
and I will do that using a filter. A quick size filter makes it possible to

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,430
limit visual view to a specific filtered value.

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,820
Let's filter this bubble chart by the year sold column. I

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,830
will click in the filters in the left.

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,340
It tells me that there is no filter applied in the selected visual.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,210
I will click on Create one.

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,720
Then, I will choose the Year Sold column, and I will click on the filter.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,560
As you can see,

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,860
it automatically recognized all unique values in the column, and it

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,140
makes it possible for me to choose a specific value.

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,830
Let's choose 2010 and apply the filter. And as you can

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:56,000
see in the visual, for houses sold in 2010, as the overall material quality increases, the sale price and garage area increase.
