1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,370
And now, let's discuss the pivot table visualization type.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,750
The pivot table present dimensions and expressions in table form.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,020
There is no formal limit to the number of dimensions or expressions possible.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,410
I will rename the sheet to Pivot Table,

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,360
and let's now create a pivot table to show the

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,100
Actual SalePrice by three dimensions, Overall House Condition,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,130
Overall Material Quality, and the Garage Quality.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,270
I will choose the Pivot table visualization type. And in the Rows, I will

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,370
choose the Overall House Condition and the Overall Material Quality, and

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,940
in the Column, I will put the Garage Quality.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,180
Let me expand the visualization for better visibility. And in

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,520
the Values, I will put the median of the Actual SalePrice.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,760
And as you can see on the left,

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,670
we can filter by the Overall House Condition and the Overall Material

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,350
Quality with the corresponding Garage Quality on the top, and the Value

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,340
of the cell represents the median SalePrice.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,200
However,

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,430
a word of caution is that please avoid creating

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,110
visualisations with too many dimensions.

20
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,000
It will easily confuse the user. I would say, at max, three dimensions.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,030
However, I did that here in the Pivot Table to show their power.

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,320
And now, after we are done with visualizing our data,

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,420
we might want to share the dashboard for other users so

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,990
that they can have visibility to our data.

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,530
I will create a dashboard by clicking on Share on the top right, then I will

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,620
click Publish dashboard, I will fill in the dashboard name,

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,620
say, Dashboard1, and I will click Publish dashboard.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,420
After that, it will ask me which users I would like to share the dashboards with.

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:01,000
The users should have licenses in the AWS Quicksight account. You will not see any users here because I don't have users.
