Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.170
My name is Mohammed Osman, and welcome to my course, Visualising Data on AWS.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.660
I am a software developer and a machine learning enthusiast at Smarter Code.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.020
A picture is worth 1,000 words is an English proverb that tells

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.020
us how much powerful data visualization is.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.140
With data visualization, we can easily grasp tremendous datasets,

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.610
find outliers and interesting patterns,

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.960
and even communicate our findings to executive audience.

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.090
In this course,

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.810
we are going to follow a hands‑on approach to learn about how

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.740
to visualize our data using AWS QuickSight,

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.390
a very handy and easy‑to‑use tool by Amazon.

13
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.740
Some of the major topics that we will cover include what is AWS

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.580
QuickSight and its benefits, how to connect and load our

15
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.690
dataset to AWS QuickSight, and how to create different

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.290
visualizations using AWS QuickSight.

17
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.710
By the end of this course,

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.810
you will know how to load and visualize your data using AWS QuickSight.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:27.000
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn about data visualization with Visualizing Data on AWS here, at Pluralsight.
