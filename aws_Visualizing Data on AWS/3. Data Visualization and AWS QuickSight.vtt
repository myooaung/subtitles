00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.460
The first common‑sense question we may think about,

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.810
why do we need to perform data analysis and why it matters

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.590
in the context of the data visualization?

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.520
The first reason is that data visualizations make it easy for

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.910
us to understand and digest big datasets on aggregate levels

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.680
without diving into details.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.740
The second reason is finding outliers and patterns.

8
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.960
It is almost impossible to detect patterns or odd

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.690
values by scanning individual records.

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.670
A picture worth a thousand words.

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.030
Data visualization makes it easy to communicate data

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.890
to our nontechnical stakeholders, such as project sponsors.

13
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.430
Finally, data visualization helps a lot in the data preparation phase,

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.080
if we are doing machine learning,

15
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.430
as it will guide us on what type of transformations we may

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.800
need to apply on our dataset to make it what the machine

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.480
learning algorithms expect.

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.190
After understanding the importance of data visualization,

19
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.370
we are now in a good position to introduce AWS QuickSight,

20
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.540
Amazon's tool for big data visualization.

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.660
It's a business‑oriented data visualization tool meant

22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.040
for business nontechnical users.

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.990
You can think about it as the equivalent of Microsoft Power BI in AWS space.

24
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.390
On a high level, it has the following features,

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
an affordable pricing model, scalable for a large number of users,

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.970
and it's fast since it's using an engine called SPICE,

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.730
which we will learn about soon.

28
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.190
Let's now have a deeper look on some solid arguments why

29
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.790
you would like to use AWS QuickSight.

30
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.070
As discussed,

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.800
the most important reason in my point of view is that it is very

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.470
business friendly and does not require deep,

33
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.140
technical knowledge to use it, like many other reporting tools.

34
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.620
Also, AWS QuickSight makes it easy to collaborate and share.

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.590
It even supports mobile reporting.

36
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.570
The datasets are queried over what's so called SPICE,

37
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.520
or Super‑fast, Parallel, In‑memory Calculation Engine.

38
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.530
Lots of fancy words, I know. However,

39
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.050
it is an engine that's engineered to rapidly perform advanced

40
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.900
calculations and serve data. It speeds up the analytical

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.490
queries against the imported data.

42
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.960
AWS QuickSight integrates what's so called machine learning insights,

43
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.870
which leverages proven machine learning and language understanding

44
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.710
capabilities to help you gain deeper insights from the data to find out

45
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.100
hidden trends and do what‑if type of analysis.

46
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.740
A newly introduced feature that is currently in preview

47
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.840
is the integration with AWS SageMaker,

48
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.720
which makes it possible for you to connect to any AWS QuickSight‑supported data

49
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.140
sources and select the SageMaker model to use in production.

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.180
Finally, the pricing model of AWS QuickSight is reasonable,

51
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.400
and it depends on whether you are using Standard or Enterprise edition.

52
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.550
The Standard edition only supports one role, called author. That's

53
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.970
a user creates and publishes dashboards. On the Enterprise edition,

54
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.440
there is another role called reader,

55
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.880
which is a lightweight role that can only read dashboards without creating them.

56
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.660
We can't do a quick comparison between the Standard and Enterprise

57
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.970
editions of AWS QuickSight based on AWS documentation. We will only

58
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.090
pick subset of the differences to compare.

59
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.740
We can see that the Standard edition does not support the reader

60
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.840
role, while the Enterprise edition supports it.

61
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.780
Also,

62
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.340
we can see that the Standard edition supports SSR using SAML and OIDC protocols.

63
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.340
The same goes for the Enterprise edition.

64
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.240
Also, the Standard edition does not support the row‑level security,

65
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.680
while the Enterprise edition supports that. The standard edition does

66
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.360
not support data encryption at rest. The Enterprise edition supports

67
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.110
that. If you are interested to read more about the differences

68
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.770
between Standard and Enterprise editions, feel free to check the

69
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.240
provided AWS documentation.

70
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.010
Let's conclude with other common visualization options that can be

71
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.850
used, aside from AWS SageMaker. D3, which is a JavaScript library

72
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.680
used for producing dynamic and interactive data visualizations in

73
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.790
the browser. Highcharts, which is a modern SVG‑based,

74
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.470
multi‑platform charting library. It makes it easy to add

75
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.470
interactive charts to web and mobile projects.

76
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.530
Chart.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to create different

77
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.340
types of charts by using the HTML5 canvas element.

78
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.330
As you can see,

79
00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:02.000
all these similar libraries provide an alternative visualization way for us if we don't want to use AWS QuickSight for some reason.
