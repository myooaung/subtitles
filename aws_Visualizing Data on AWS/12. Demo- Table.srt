1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,780
And now it's the time for the table,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,530
which I believe is a straightforward visualization,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,840
and we use it a lot in our daily life.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,330
I will create a new sheet and call it Table.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,800
Then, I will change the visualization type to table.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,280
Let's assume that I want to see the count of sales period.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,790
So in the group by field, I will put the year sold. And in

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,160
the value, I will put actual sale price,

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,420
and I will change the aggregate type to count, and let's

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,790
rename the column to Number of Cells.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,910
I will click on the gear in the right of the table, and then I will go to

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:50,000
value column names, and I will rename it to Number of Cells. And as you can see, that column has been renamed.
