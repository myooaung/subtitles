1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,980
Let's now discuss the KPI and gauge visualizations, which are

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,680
used to measure the progress towards a goal.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,370
I will rename my sheet to KPI and Gauge. And what I will do here, I

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,200
will just create a simple visualization that aims to provide an

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,670
executive summary of our progress towards a certain goal. And this

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,490
goal will be the percentage of the total actual sale price to the

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,640
total expected sale value.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,110
I will change the visualization type to KPI. And in the value,

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,510
which represents the current value, I will choose the sum of

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,630
actual sale price. And in the target,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,050
I will choose the sum of expected sale price. And as we can see,

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,590
the actual sale price is 88% from the target.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,180
Let's now duplicate this visual and create a gauge. And I

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,000
will change the visualization type to gauge. And here it provides the same information, but a nicer look.
