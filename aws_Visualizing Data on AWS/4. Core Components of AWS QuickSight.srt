1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,140
And now,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,140
it's the time to have a discussion around the core components in AWS QuickSight.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,550
Firstly, everything starts with data sources,

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,810
and AWS supports many types of data sources,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,120
such as relational data sources, which include Amazon S3,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,100
MariaDB, or MySQL among others.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,810
It also supports file data sources,

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,000
such as comma‑separated values and XLSX files,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,900
JSON data sources, and Software as a Service data sources through APIs,

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,500
such as Adobe Analytics, Twitter API, or ServiceNow.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,630
And then on AWS QuickSight,

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,450
the data sources can be loaded into what's so‑called datasets

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,660
to be ready for usage by AWS QuickSight.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,890
The datasets can be loaded to SPICE Engine for higher performance.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,640
After that, we are ready to perform what's so‑called analysis.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,060
In a single analysis,

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,130
we can have multiple visuals that will be created from the dataset.

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,060
Notice that how a single dataset can be shared among multiple

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,530
analyses. A visual simply represents a specific visualization,

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,200
such as bar chart or pie chart.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,270
From these visuals,

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,560
we can create dashboards, which can be shared with other users, or stories,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,970
which represent a multiple iteration of analysis that can be displayed

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,730
sequentially to tell a narrative about the data.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,220
The creation of datasets, analysis, and dashboards is done

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,610
by users who are in the author role.

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:47,000
If you are using the enterprise edition of AWS QuickSight, we can have users with the reader role.
