00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:03,183
Let's review the steps to roll back transactions in

2
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:05,400
a simple declarative fashion.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,790
To trigger Spring to roll back a transaction,

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,572
simply throw an exception from code that is currently

5
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:14,972
executing in the context of a transaction.

6
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:18,994
Spring catches any unhandled exception as it bubbles up the

7
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:22,301
call stack and makes a determination on whether or not to

8
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,558
mark the transaction for rollback.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,202
We looked at the configurations that allow us to define which exception types

10
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:37,000
mark a transaction for rollback including checked exceptions. Now let's see these concepts in action.
