1
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:04,945
So now I will provide a tour of the baseline TrackZilla application,

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:09,227
which we will build upon during the course.

3
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:12,642
This will include an introduction to the TrackZilla Spring Boot

4
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,934
application and its controller and service layer,

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:22,018
the associated domain model, the associated data access objects,

6
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:25,572
and the in-memory H2 database.

7
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:30,383
So let's look at how the baseline TrackZilla application is set up.

8
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,569
Here I'm in the TrackZillaController.

9
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:33,443
java file.

10
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:36,815
Notice on line 18, it is a RestController.

11
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:40,736
On line 19, there is a RequestMapping to tza.

12
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,887
On line 22, we have an applicationService,

13
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:47,048
and we have on line 25 a ticketService.

14
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:51,940
So now let's look at one simple use case for the getAllApplications.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,117
So on line 34,

16
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:56,362
we have the getAllApplications method that then

17
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:01,381
calls out to the applicationService.

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,488
getAllApplications.

19
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,392
So let's look at the ApplicationService and navigate to the

20
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:10,160
getAllApplications method on line 17.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,050
Notice that calls out to our applicationDAO.

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,771
Let's navigate to our applicationDAO,

23
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:20,588
and the getAllApplications method is found on line 20.

24
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:26,279
Here we see on line 21 a JPQL query that retrieves all

25
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,907
applications and returns them sorted by name.

26
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:34,627
So essentially this method returns a list of all applications that a user

27
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:39,801
can log either a bug or enhancement request against.

28
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:44,516
So the getAllApplications method can be tested through a unit test.

29
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:46,994
So let's go down to the test folder and

30
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,645
double-click on TrackZillaControllerTest.

31
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:51,207
And you see on line 32,

32
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:57,516
we have a very simple test to exercise our getAllApplications code.

33
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:00,463
So now let's go to our resources folder.

34
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,893
I'd like to point out one thing underneath application.

35
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,716
properties, so double-click on that, and notice on line 10,

36
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:11,235
we have the URL to our H2 in-memory database.

37
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,484
So this is very important when you want to access

38
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,838
the data through the H2 console.

39
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:18,526
And, lastly, there's data.

40
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:24,000
sql. This file populates our database with seed data.
