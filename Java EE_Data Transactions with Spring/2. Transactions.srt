00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:04,706
First, let's understand what a transaction actually is.

2
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:09,316
A series of actions that are treated as a single unit

3
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,576
of work is considered a transaction.

4
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:16,258
Although there are multiple actions in a single transaction,

5
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:22,304
all should either fail as a group or complete entirely as a group.

6
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:26,927
When a single action in the group fails, all actions should be rolled back.

7
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:32,751
If all actions complete, then the transaction should be permanently committed.

8
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:36,932
There are four key properties to transactions that can be

9
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:40,263
easily remembered using the ACID acronym.

10
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:44,945
A for atomicity, a transaction consists of a series of actions,

11
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,663
and the approach is an all-or-nothing approach.

12
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:53,466
The transaction must either fully happen or not happen at all.

13
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,810
It cannot partially complete.

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,372
Consistency.

15
00:00:56,372 --> 00:01:01,315
A transaction is committed once all of its actions have completed.

16
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:05,442
This keeps your data in a consistent state.

17
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:06,044
Isolation.

18
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,975
Each transaction is isolated from other transactions to

19
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:12,573
ensure that data is not corrupted.

20
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,678
Isolation ensures that one transaction cannot read

21
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,668
data from another transaction.

22
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:19,145
Durability.

23
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:29,000
A durable transaction is one that cannot be undone by system failure typically because it is written to persistent storage.
