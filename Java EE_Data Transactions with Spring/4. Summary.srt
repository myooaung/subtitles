1
00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:03,379
We've learned about programmatic transaction management

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,885
over declarative transaction management,

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:07,803
and vice versa.

4
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:11,122
We've seen that applications written to depend on declarative

5
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:16,065
transaction management can be easier to maintain and evolve.

6
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,431
We were also introduced to the PlatformTransactionManager

7
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:22,425
that provides greater flexibility when implementing

8
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,935
programmatic transaction management.

9
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:25,347
Overall,

10
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:34,000
Spring provides great support for transactions giving the developer flexible choices and ultimate control.
