We've looked at the inner workings of Spring's declarative transaction

00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:08,217
management infrastructure and how it supports transaction management.

00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,286
We specifically saw the @Transactional annotation and

attributes like readOnly and noRollback in action.

00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,773
We also discussed how to handle rollbacks.
