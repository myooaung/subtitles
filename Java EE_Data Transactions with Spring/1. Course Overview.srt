Hi everyone!

2
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:09,161
My name is Kesha Williams, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:10,780
Data Transactions with Spring.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,931
I'm a software engineering manager in the IT department of Chick-fil-A.

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,393
In this course, we are going to learn about Spring transaction management,

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:22,691
which is one of the most widely used and important

7
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:25,724
features of the Spring Framework.

8
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:29,070
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,192
declarative transaction management, programmatic transaction management,

10
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,783
when to choose declarative over programmatic,

11
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:40,766
transaction propagation and rollbacks.

12
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:44,628
By the end of this course, you will have mastered Spring transaction management,

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,065
which will help you as you introduce transactional

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,603
behavior to your applications.

15
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:55,183
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Spring Data and Java.

16
00:00:55,183 --> 00:01:08,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn transaction management with the Data Transactions with Spring course at Pluralsight.
