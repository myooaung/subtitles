00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.140
So we've just seen the AccessControlContext in action and how we can use it.

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.850
We talked about how this can capture a security context,

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.840
and then we can modify the security context and use this to control security.

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.850
We used this context to set up what's called a privileged scope,

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.830
and this would allow us to execute code that wouldn't normally be

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.060
allowed to run. A note here, that wouldn't normally means, that

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.430
normally in the context of this stack frame,

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.070
we couldn't run this code.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.000
This code has to be given the appropriate permissions. Otherwise, again, the security check would fail.
