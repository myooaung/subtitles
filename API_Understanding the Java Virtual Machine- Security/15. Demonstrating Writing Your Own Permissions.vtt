00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.480
So, in this demo we'll use a new permission,

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.880
a WarpPermission,

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.650
and we'll show how we can set that permission in the permissions file

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.740
and how we can check that permission in our code.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.910
So the way I'm going to do that initially is create a new instance of

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.490
Main. And we'll have a Main here. And then on Main I'll add a method

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.430
called makeItSo. We'll pass this an integer,

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.370
and that's going to be the warp that we want to set to.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.440
And if I go and create this method here,

10
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.230
so this will be warp. Then inside here I want to get a reference to my

11
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.160
security manager so = System.getSecurityManager.

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.840
If this is not null then I'm going to check the warp.

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.740
So I'm going to say securityManager.checkPermission.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.430
And we need to pass this a new WarpPermission, which we haven't written yet.

15
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
So let's just go and fill in the blanks here. And our WarpPermission

16
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.290
will take the name that we're trying to check, so this will be

17
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.540
maxWarp, and the value to check of the warp.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.690
So, this is whatever value's passed in to us.

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.660
So here I want to say String.valueOf(warp).

20
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.140
So you remember that the action we're passing in here is a string value.

21
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.940
Well now we can create our WarpPermission class.

22
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.840
So the string here is the name, and this string is the action.

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.010
So for this class we're going to extend BasicPermission.

24
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.210
And then inside our constructor we'll call the super, we'll call the base

25
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.510
class constructor, and we'll pass up name and action.

26
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.310
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

27
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.140
warp = Integer.parseInt(action).

28
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.400
Install that in a field on the class.

29
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.480
So we've seen the implies method that was on the slides.

30
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.990
So here we just need to compare the warp. I'm going to make one

31
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.990
change here. I'm going to add an equals sign.

32
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.330
So if the warp that we've been given is greater than or equal to

33
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.510
the one we've been asked for then we're good to go, we'll allow

34
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.340
that. Otherwise we'll fail the call.

35
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.720
So back over here in Main.java now, we check the WarpPermission.

36
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.500
If this fails, remember, it will throw an exception.

37
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.800
If it succeeds let's just print out a message saying something like

38
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:48.840
Warp now set to, we'll give it the warp value.

39
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.020
Now I can build this code. If I go to the command prompt then I

40
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.300
can run this code without a security manager.

41
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.770
And it sets whatever warp we pass in.

42
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.040
So we're asking for 8 and it's going to set the value to 8.

43
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.840
If I try and run the code with a security manager then it

44
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.830
fails because I'm asking for this WarpPermission and the

45
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.180
WarpPermission hasn't been set.

46
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.440
So we need to go and edit a policy file.

47
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250
So here, I've got a file called my.policy.

48
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.920
And we add,

49
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.480
as we've done before, a grant block. And in this grant block we add a

50
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:38.140
permission. And the permission is for com.pluralsight.WarpPermission.

51
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.240
We're asking for maxWarp, and we want to give it the value of 8.

52
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.700
So if I save that file, go back to my command prompt,

53
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.750
and then run this demo with that policy file set ‑‑‑ This is a common

54
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.740
error I make whenever editing policy files. I've left the semicolon

55
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.010
off the end here. So save the file again.

56
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.790
Now run the code.

57
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.150
And it works okay.

58
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.350
So the warp is set to 8 and we're allowed to access this warp. If I try and

59
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.250
change that to 7 and save the file and run the code it fails.

60
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.380
I've asked for 8, I'm only allowed 7.

61
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.540
And if I set this to 9 and run the code then it succeeds.

62
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:32.000
So again, the implies here. I've asked for 9, that implies 8 is okay. I've asked for 7, that implies 8 isn't okay.
