00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,510
Hi, my name is Kevin Jones,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,480
and this is the introductory chapter to the Understanding

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,740
the Java Virtual Machine Security class.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,640
In this class, we'll aim to understand how Java ensures code is safe to run.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,460
That is, when I execute a piece of code,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,090
is that code allowed to carry out a specific function?

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,700
And just to emphasize this, we are looking at code,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,330
not users, so we're not looking at how we can secure a user,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,090
how we can do authentication, and how we can do authorization.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,480
This is specifically looking at Java code.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,540
To that end, we'll take a look at four things.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,340
We'll take a look at something called the Java security manager.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,240
This is a class built into the runtime that helps us manage code level security.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,120
The security manager itself uses something called the access controller.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,260
Initially, when Java was first released, we only had the security manager.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,020
The access controller came along in Java 1.2, or JDK 2, if

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,340
you like, to try and make it much easier to manage code

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,310
level security. Between them,

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,720
these use something called a secure class loader. So a secure class

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,770
loader understands where code is loaded from, and security manager

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,420
can use that location information to determine whether code should

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,130
be allowed to execute or not.

23
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,640
And finally,

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,620
towards the end of the class, we'll take a look at

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,610
something called privilege scopes.

26
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,920
Occasionally,

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
you want a piece of code to execute. Even when it's surrounding code, it

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,070
shouldn't be allowed to do something. In the next module of this class,

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:39,000
we'll take a look at a little history, and we'll take a look at some of the players in Java code security.
