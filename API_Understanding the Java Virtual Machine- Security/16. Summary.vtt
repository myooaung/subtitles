00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.750
So in this chapter,

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.620
we've talked about how we can use policy to effect security in Java,

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.350
how we can load a policy file, how we can augment policy

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.660
files, how we can replace policy files.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.600
We've talked about how the security manager and the access

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.940
controller work together to walk the stack,

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.090
how we can set permissions for different JAR files and different class

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.980
files, depending on where they get loaded from and how the stack walk

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.710
affects that. We've talked about signing code and how we can set

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.000
permissions for JAR files that have been signed. And then we finally looked at writing our own permissions.
