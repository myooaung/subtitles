00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.320
Currently,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.360
as you guys know,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:20.120

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.960

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.360
by corrected the a p I that takes the criteria and search item And under our user service,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.850
I am peel implemented the corresponding method basically based on the criteria User name,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.500
first name,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.250

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:19.140
that on the age I had to ah converted to ah number since by default it will come as a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.170
string Also I set up under the control a new method uhm for search get mapping that will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.770
take the criteria and search item request harems as mandatory fields and just invoke the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.490
service.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.650
You can see that a newly created AP has been sit on their postman.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.320
Let's give it a try.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.170
With criteria,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.470
user name and search item.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:00.810
Alex are you can see that it was able to extract data now for country and the search item.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.990
You say it returned the users that have their country set up,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.550
as you say.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.850
Okay.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.710
So we can also go with age and type.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.850
Search item 34.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.950
It found the user in tow That a base are 34.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.480
Maybe.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.580
Go it on A just to it should not find in anybody here.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:45.240
The list is empty and does something like this.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.610
Just four additional test.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.650
