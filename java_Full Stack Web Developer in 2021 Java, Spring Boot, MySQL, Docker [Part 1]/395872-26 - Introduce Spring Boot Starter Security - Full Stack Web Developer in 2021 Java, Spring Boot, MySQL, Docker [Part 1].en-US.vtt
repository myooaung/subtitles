00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
as you can see in this video.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.360
First,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.660
I created a bunch off new users.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.170
We have 10 years,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.750
10 users now in total.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:22.630
And the I use the user reports story save all 40 billion least of users instead off user

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.450
depository,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.750
safe for each and every user.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.450
I think this will spit things out.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.250
And we're have also,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.800
um,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.250
bigger list off users that we can play with.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.210
Okay.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.850
Application has started.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.850
Okay,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.890
Great table.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.470
Illusory.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:06.570
And you can see that we have 10 insert statements over there on and go toe age to in memory

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.450
database and was select for user stable.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:26.040
And we can see that we have 10 users now or so on the find.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.450
All on the postman.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.550
Yes,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.100
we have 10 users created,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.050
so that's good.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:47.990
The next thing is to introduce the springboard started security dependency under our palm

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.610
file.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:59.750
So navigate to our phone file and or under here,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.230
we can create a new dependency,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.740
actually,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.080
Adamu dependency.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.350
So the group I deeds Orc spring framework in that booth,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:23.550
This will basically set up the initial security for our project.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:36.400
I'm searching for the Spring Worth Starter security dependency for you to auto review and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.120
know where I got this.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.650
Ah,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.050
this artifact from so springboard starter security.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.670
Okay,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.490
so once again adding this dependency will set up the minimum security that we can have for

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:06.620
our project is behind the scenes Spring will be able to generate on user and the you i d

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.700
that we can use to invoke our art.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.350
STP I I will show you guys in a minute.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.450
So I just started the application.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.450
Okay,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.350
creating the table.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.950
You saw that statement on there is a Spain point over here using jury the security password

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.000
and basically this longer long string format.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.140
So now if we go and invoke argon although find user sapi I found all users ap I we can see

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.710
that we receive 401 status code,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.250
so we're not able to involve the a p I.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:09.250
Since a minimum security for from Springer has been set up in place find by the a.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.500
P.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:19.400
I returns the same thing for a woman status code that we don't have for missions to to lack

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.650
off out indication.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:34.310
So we can ah go on postman on a specific a be a request and goto authorization,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.250
Select basic authorization and typing user.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:56.950
And that that's worth okay.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.810
We updated the request than the invoke it.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.690
You can see that we're now able toe basically invoke the a p A.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.150
Since we added the user name and
