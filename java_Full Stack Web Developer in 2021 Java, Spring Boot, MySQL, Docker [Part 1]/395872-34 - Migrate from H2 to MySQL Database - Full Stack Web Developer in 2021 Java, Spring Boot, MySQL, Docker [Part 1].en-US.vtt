00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
under this section.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.550
I would like him off the application from using H two in memory database,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.050
toe more popular database called my school.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.850
So,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.850
as you know,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.430
we have this users collection resource that extracts data from the age to in memory

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.170
database.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.650
So I'm running now on example,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.850
and you can see data being retrieved.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.280
Also,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.150
we have access to the Page two console over here.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.370
So now let's move toe my school database.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.850
So I went on Google chrome and type in,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.950
download my school work bench and navigated to the four Sling.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.650
Over here,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.050
we can navigate toe goto download page.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:11.460
And between these two abortions,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.690
we should select my school installer community.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.150
Worsen.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.680
We started the download process.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.550
Wait a few seconds for this to finish and just double click on the installer.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.800
The installation process has started.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.450
There are a few steps that we need to follow.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.650
You can see the my school installer one that poor,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:02:01.350
and we should select the developer default person and click on next.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.090
Currently,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.550
I'm not interested in this requirements.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.850
You can click next and just click on Yes,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.740
and wait for this to finish.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.950
I speed up the video for you guys to see the final process.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.650
We can now configure the my school product.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.390
Oh,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.250
click on next.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.540
You see the default port being used Pretty pretty.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.380
06 We need to set up on out indication method.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.250
Basically,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.940
we're required to type in a password.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.190
So I will use just the simple passwords.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.680
Keyword,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.250
click or next,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.950
my school service will be created.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:20.250
We are applying the configuration and the process should be completed.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.650
Now,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:32.490
we could go on finish now council and select the yes option in the task part.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.000
We should have a new icon and select manage.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.480
Instance the mice.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.710
Well,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.070
quarter pinching the mice Will war bench will be open and we need to type in the password,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:58.230
password and access our editor over here.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.550
We need to create the demo database.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:11.040
You see that?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.260
That you see,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.850
the database has been created.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.970
Now we need to configure our application to remove the age to corresponding properties and

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.610
add the my school corresponding properly.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.070
So the first step will need to go under the pump.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.390
That exam ill a remove the age toe dependency.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.690
Instead of this,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.550
we need toe ad of my school specific dependency.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.350
So the group I do you will be my skill.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.740
And for the artifact,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.450
I t will use my school connector java.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:13.920
The next step is to go on the application properties and update the properties to use my

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.410
school instead of age to so for the spring data search,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.040
u R l I will go with de DBC,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.950
my Skrill,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.930
local host,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.150
the my school corresponding port and the demo database that we just created.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.030
We need to update the driver class,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.090
name calm,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.970
my skill,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.050
the user name and password,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.450
our core ticked.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:11.850
Now we need to update our database platform to use or hibernate dialect and the

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:19.770
corresponding mice will dialect at the end.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.650
We're not used these two properties anymore,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:32.050
So let's stop the server around the application once again.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.470
Since the application will now use the Maya skill instance in sense of the age to in memory

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.230
database,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:50.750
the application has started.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.300
We should wait a few seconds.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.950
You can see that the user stable has been created and specific data has been added.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:09.650
Now let's check the my school corresponding instance.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:24.750
But first you can see that the dialect it's used as per my school specific dialect song.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.650
There are my school work bench.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.750
We need to first use the demote database and do a select from the user stable.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:41.880
You can see that up being inserted over here instead of the age to in memory database.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:52.550
And let's run a demo sample a P I data being retrieved now from the mice will database and

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.490
everything works.
