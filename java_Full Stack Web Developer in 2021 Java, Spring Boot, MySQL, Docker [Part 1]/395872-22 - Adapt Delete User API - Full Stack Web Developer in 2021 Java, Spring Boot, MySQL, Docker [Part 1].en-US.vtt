00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
under this section,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.180
let's update our delete user a p I to use in the newly created reposed story.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.500
So if we go on the user service,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.950
I am pale and search for the elite corresponding method.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.050
We don't need to use the users least stream anymore.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.380
What?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.980
Instead,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:36.470
we can use the user reposed authority and find a new user by i d.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.330
Once again,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.210
please recall that we haven't implemented this method.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.350
This will come directly from the spring data G p A.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:05.710
And if we found the user that we want to dilate were just deleted from the repository by

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.750
user optional that get.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.990
And also we need to remove this users list state month and that's basically it.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.700
Now we have to restart the application and take a look at postman to do some tests.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.360
Went to Maine just sittings in action.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:52.490
Now the application starts up gauge the console that a base has bean.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.370
Actually,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.600
the table has been created,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:09.550
application has start and now we can review the find alot method was there are requests.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.550
You can see that the the requested returned returned on empty list.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.980
We can play with the ad operation and add a new user.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.690
Now move back to test and review the final.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.790
We can see that we have on user next to this.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.690
Let's also check the user stable to see just to prove that the the user exists.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.830
Select from users.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.350
Concede that the user is present over there.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.340
And now let's invoke the delete operation with the ICTY one.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:08.980
Since we can see that the newly created user had i d one that involved the our estate p I

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.360
and you can see that tool four has been returned.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:24.980
Let's check once again to find all and we can see that we don't have any users.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.670
Also,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.850
same thing happens in age to counsel,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.200
so we were able to remove the user.
