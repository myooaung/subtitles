00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
Let's add the spin boots starter Web dependency under our project.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.650
So I opened bone file.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:16.300
We can see that we have the later spring version 2 to 5.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.810
Release next,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.790
though this we can see that we have Ah,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.190
springboard starter dependency.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.750
And also springboard started test.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.050
And we also need the stuck the work dependency.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.150
So I opened chrome chrome browser,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.650
That's it.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.300
And search for springboard starter dependency.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:01:01.480
We should wait for this to load and navigated toe Springwood reference documentation.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:12.550
And over here we should search for spring boot Starter Web.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.650
I found the dependency over here.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.850
Let me highlight it.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.930
Yeah,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.930
sorry for this.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:39.790
Let me get back to it once again and will copy paste this dependency and add it under the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:54.510
project Control Shift F on windows to format goat and just start the application Once again

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.510
,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.050

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.850
um,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.130
the application has started.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.150
Also,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:21.150
there is an embedded Tomcat Web server that runs 1 80 80 I navigated to local host 80 80

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640
and by default,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.050
