00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.850
I would like to introduce the Yeah pagination under our final users,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.450
A p I,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.390
As you can see currently it will invoke the find all users FBI.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.920
We are extracting the entire list off users present into our data ways.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.410
So imagine that we have one million users.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.650
No server with will be a bit slow.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.520
So how can we fix this?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.650
Under our user controller,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.260
we can go on the find all ap I an insert a page,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.170
a bubble page of one corresponding reference that comes from spring boot and you can see

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:04.140
that this page herbal interface has ah has specific features such a sorting pagination and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.750
so on.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:15.980
Now let's also add this page herbal under our find all method from our user service.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:32.220
So we're also important a page a ball here and we need to go under our user service.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.950
I am pl I also take this into account the page a bubble page double reference,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:51.850
import it and instead off using user reports story find all without the page a bubble.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:01.290
We just need toe use their user depository find all method with the page or reference added

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.750
to it.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.680
This will not return our list off users,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.050
but instead a page off user.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.150
This comes directly from spring data G p A.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.750
We need to import things out and also fix our interface with this page.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.910
As you can see,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.250
this is ah Supplee stuff Least objects,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.750
okay?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.250
And we saved it.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.150
And also under our user controller,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.070
we should not return our list off.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.650
User,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.850
we should return a page here under our response entity.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:00.940
So let's stop the server and started once again to take into account this pagination

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:12.290
process so you can see how simple or spring boot data G p a makes this.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.790
Ah,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:22.080
this concept off pagination we just need to add this page a ble reference in the return a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.770
page.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:41.530
Now if you invoke the find all oh users a p I we re thought now on Ah or eh off page is off

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.450
references to be honest,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:53.640
off user and we see some additional feel setups that are page herbal total pages sorting

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.950
Macon in total elements Total number off pages and so on.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:10.670
And we can even add some some custom fields on the request Such a spay judge one Saive size

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.210
five.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:20.090
The page is a page number start from From Zero and we can see that basically,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.950
we extracted the second page.
