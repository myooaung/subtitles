00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's fix the issue found in previous video by implementing Ah,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.650
across the moor Password in colder.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:22.850
So that's first Remove this and goto our calm configuration and greater new class called

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.040
password config.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.190
Okay,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.970
over here we need toe Mark,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.870
discuss us.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.240
Ah,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:47.070
configuration class toe Be taken into account by spring and create a new being that will

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.550
return a password in cold her.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.350
Okay,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.950
this should work.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:10.150
Let's call it the password in colder and as ah,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.150
basic password encoding met mechanisms We can use the big crypt.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.450
There is a class over here called Big Crypt Password in colder.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.650
So now we have ah password in colder set up.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:41.090
And we need to go under our security call thick and inject the password in colder using

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:53.350
though toward annotation and his stepped off using the admin password without encoding will

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.070
use the password in Golder encode method to in Cold the best warp Let's now start the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:23.390
application once again Days of your seconds toe to start up the service Okay created the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.950
user stable,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.310
we'll add although use ourselves application startup.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:43.310
And now if we of these the password here to use the at mean we can show the password that

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.650
it's that mean and update the request involved a find your i p I.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.310
We can say that the issue has been fixed.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:05.650
Then we are able to extract the stuff a list of users so that 500 error code has been fixed

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.250
using the password in colder.
