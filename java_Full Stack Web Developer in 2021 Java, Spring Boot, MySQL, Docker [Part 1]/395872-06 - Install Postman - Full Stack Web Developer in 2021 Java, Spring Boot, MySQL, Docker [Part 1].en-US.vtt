00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.130
the final prerequisite for our environment Set up process is to install Postman so we can

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.850
type in the long postman.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.260
No,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.150
no postman app.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.850
And over here we can choose between 32 64 bit.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.910
I'm on a windows environment with 64 bit So I choose the second option.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.150
Okay,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:46.850
we can open now The postman executable so that the we will install the postman pap on our

00:00:46.850 --> 00:01:06.470
environment will use this up mostly for invoking or arrest Ap eyes So installing postman

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:17.380
now the loader We should go Just keep us a few seconds for for post mental be properly

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.350
installed and configured And now postman is ready to be used
