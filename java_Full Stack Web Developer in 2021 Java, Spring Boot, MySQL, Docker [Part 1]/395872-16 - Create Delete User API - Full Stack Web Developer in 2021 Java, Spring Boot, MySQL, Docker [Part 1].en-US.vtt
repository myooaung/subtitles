00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
under this video will create the delete user a p I.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.990
So we need to navigate back to user service,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.650
create the new method called delete.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.850
But let's also return an optional user here.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.460
Okay,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.950
so did it.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.900
Well,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.750
get from the arresting point.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.190
But I D.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.150
Since we want to know which user we want to delete from our list,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:52.350
let's add the implement that method and those so set up a business logic for it.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:02.060
So in order to the leader user,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:11.850
we forced me to find it basically see if the user it's present under our existent list.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:27.280
So create an optional off user called User Hope on and using the users list stream process

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.190
and let's go filtering.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:42.050
And we want to find the user with the i D provided as request.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:53.650
So you need to check each user very fights I d and find first.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.710
Okay,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.750
now we need to verify if we have when user under our user optional.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.510
If so,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.350
let's return the use the optional back,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.980
and if not,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:28.370
let's return just on and the optional Now it's also important to remove the user from the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.600
users list,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:44.590
so let's use something like this Users list stream process.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.250
Okay,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.450
filter.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.860
I want to use this process just to show you guys that this can be done with the users list

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.860
.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.850
Really move method,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.900
but also using the steering process.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.500
The job.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.750
Eight stream process from from from list and we need to check the user optional.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.470
Get that get I d equals users,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.030
get I d.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.340
And also core elect the state months as a list.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.420
But what we can do here is to negate the statements so well we will keep on Lee the user

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.850
that don't have this,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.500
i d.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:52.900
So where he will have in our case on Lee three users instead of four if we provided valid

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.830
the I D,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.090
such as 123 or four in the pyramid or as a request.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:12.700
So let's move to use their controller and create the delete mapping method for the Delete

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.380
User service.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.150
A p I.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.850
Let's use something like the late and also the i D.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.850
So behind the scenes.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.950
In order to remove on user,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.980
we can evoke local host 80 80 um,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.140
a P i users and four,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.890
and it will basically remove the user that has the i d four.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.550
We set up the deal it method with the bat variable.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:00.330
And now we'll involved the user service deal it method that we're returning optional off

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.980
user.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.150
Okay?

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:17.710
And now we can check that the user the option optional user has a value and if so,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.290
will create a new response entity.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:42.210
And over here we can provide the optional user and 80 b staples such as Let's go,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.650
it don't know content.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.550
Okay,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:55.150
I changed the question mark to user.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.250
And if not,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.720
where it turned just a simple response entity.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:14.770
But this time with the http status such as not found and http.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.570
Status not not found.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.950
Okay,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:40.950
now let's start the application spring with this starting.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.020
Okay,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.350
let's go back to Postman and we need to create a new request.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:58.590
Let's call it the little user.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:19.450
We need to changed the method to delete and use local host 80 80 AP I users delete and four

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:27.550
we can save and also evolved the p a.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.450
You can see that toe for no content.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.190
It's the return.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.690
And if we invoke the final method,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.680
you can see that we only have free user set up.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.150
Since the 4th 1 has been deleted.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.810
Another test.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.090
You can see that photo.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.470
Four not found
