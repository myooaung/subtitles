00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.145
Hello guys, and welcome to the first part of the class series,

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:11.850
where we will build together onComplete full-stack erased API, web-based application.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.179
Under the following videos,

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.880
will create a springboard based backend server that

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.960
will handle the process of managing users.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.700
You will gather knowledge of working with technologies such as Java,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.970
springboard, spring Security, spring data,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.550
JP8, and many more.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.995
In terms of storing data,

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:39.515
we'll first start with an in-memory database called

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:45.890
H2 and migrate to the well-known MySQL relational database.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.530
There are many things that I want to show you.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.730
So if you are engaged in this class, let's get started.
