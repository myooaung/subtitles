00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
Under this video,

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.950
let's create together the initial project package structure,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.450
so navigate to the Project folder under Spring Bolt I D.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.950
And escape the new package.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:27.270
Let's call it Comb that controller that will keep our main application controller.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:40.950
Also another package called Comb that service where the Business Logic were decide.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.780
And those So Let's Kato,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.350
another package called Com that model where we'll keep our user model class.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:17.790
Lochte's open are conduct model package and create the new class called User.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:30.200
Under this close,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.050
I would like to set up some specific user properties such as first name,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.650
last name,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.350
age and country.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.690
So I created private string first name,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.440
private string,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.550
last name,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.050
private integer age,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:10.450
and let's also set up the private string country.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:18.710
Next to this,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:26.350
I also want toe generate or constructor,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.610
a simple constructor,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.190
nor argument constructor.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.890
Let's also generates,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.680
um,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:52.690
get her sense setters for our properties are selected or the properties from this model

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:04.240
class after the main constructor,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.640
our creator not on additional constructor.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.820
We told the fields from our class,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.550
so I selected all of them.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:33.060
And let's create also the I think hash coding equals metals That's great they been

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.750
generated.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.650
And finally we'll need toe.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.450
Add a two string method.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.710
This was also generated.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.660
So we have to string equals hash code.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.250
Get on setters.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.150
Constructor using fields in the North German constructor.
