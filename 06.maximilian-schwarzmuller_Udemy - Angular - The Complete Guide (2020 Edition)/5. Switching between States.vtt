00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:08.480
Right now in our application we are at the place that we are able to display one state normal year.

2

00:00:08.700  -->  00:00:14.760
Or of course if I were to change this two highlighted and related recompile this should get blue and

3

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:17.320
move to the right like this.

4

00:00:17.550  -->  00:00:22.180
But now we want to animate the transition between both states.

5

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:27.930
Now with that said back to normal right now we have no way to move to or change the state from our code

6

00:00:27.940  -->  00:00:28.030
.

7

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:34.100
But we do have this animate button and we try to execute on any made method there.

8

00:00:34.410  -->  00:00:39.040
So let's hook up to you on any made method here on animate.

9

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:42.250
And what do we want to do in this on any major method.

10

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:44.480
I simply want to switch to state.

11

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:49.140
So here I want to check if this state equals normal.

12

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:57.310
Then I want to set this state equal to highlighted.

13

00:00:57.840  -->  00:01:03.090
Otherwise I want to set this state to normal.

14

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:09.420
Now if this implies if I save this lad the application reload.

15

00:01:09.420  -->  00:01:11.880
Now you see it's gone.

16

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:18.120
Well that's simply a bug because I'm using Baghran color as a string and then like this year we actually

17

00:01:18.120  -->  00:01:19.730
have to use the very same.

18

00:01:19.740  -->  00:01:21.000
And I think the should get fixed.

19

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:24.080
To be honest I just wanted to bring this to your awareness.

20

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:28.440
If you're mixing the way you were setting up your properties even though it should theoretically word

21

00:01:28.650  -->  00:01:32.490
work it doesn't make sure to use the same type of property name.

22

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:37.740
But if I switched gears and I now have the function to change my state you can now see I can switch

23

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:40.680
between those states and toggle between them.

24

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:47.160
But now we want to animate the transmission so that we not instantly switch to state as we already are

25

00:01:47.160  -->  00:01:48.260
able to do with that.

26

00:01:48.390  -->  00:01:54.390
But now that we animate this otherwise we wouldn't need these animation to here at all because just

27

00:01:54.480  -->  00:01:56.690
appending different styles WOODER.

28

00:01:56.790  -->  00:01:59.150
Well that's something we learned from the course.

29

00:01:59.160  -->  00:02:02.900
So next do let's have a look at implementing this transition.
