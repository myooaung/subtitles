1

00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:08,550
So now that you learned more about components and data binding and especially how you can communicate

2

00:00:08,550  -->  00:00:12,820
between your components and how lifecycle hooks work and so on,

3

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:19,350
you gained a lot of new knowledge which is super important for most projects you are going to build, including

4

00:00:19,410  -->  00:00:21,170
our course project.

5

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:27,960
So in this section, what we're going to do is we're going to fine tune this, we're going to make sure

6

00:00:28,220  -->  00:00:33,510
that we can navigate between recipes and shopping lists, though our solution we'll add right now will

7

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:38,880
not be the final one, we will improve this even more later in the course and we will make sure that we

8

00:00:38,880  -->  00:00:42,110
can select recipes here and load them in the detail section

9

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:46,750
and generally, that we have a working communication between our components.

10

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:48,180
So let's dive into this.
