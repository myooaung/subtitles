00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.980
In the last lecture, we had a look at the basic ngIf syntax and that's the syntax you're going to use

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
most of the time, there is one alternative to it though.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.910
Sometimes you have not only the if condition but also an else condition,

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.640
so here we might want to say server was created, server name is something with ngIf but we could also

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.820
add an else block where we then want to say no server was created.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.690
Now we deleted that exact text for the reason that we don't want to see it

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.730
but imagine that we do want to show that alternative,

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.300
so no server was created could be the text here and now we want to show this paragraph only if ngIf is

9
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
not true or this condition, server created, is not true.

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.900
We can achieve this by placing a local reference on this element here and local reference is something

11
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.580
I will dive deeper into in the understanding components and data binding section of this course.

12
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.960
For now let's think of it as a marker,

13
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.120
so I will name this noserver,

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.900
any name you like,

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.500
noServer

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580
with a capital s

17
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.230
and now we need to change the paragraph here to ng-template. That is a component, that directive shipping

18
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.350
with Angular which you can use to mark places in the DOM

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.190
and now I will add the paragraph back in this template with the text in between, like this.

20
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.750
So now basically the text we want to output

21
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.330
and now with ng-template, with that local reference, this marker on it, we mark a certain spot in the template

22
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.540
which we want to show conditionally.

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.330
Now to show it conditionally, we simply enhance ngIf by also adding else and then noServer,

24
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.810
so this marker we placed on ng-template and that's all the syntax we need. If we save this, you see no

25
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.280
server was created

26
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.820
and as soon as I click here, that gets replaced with server was created.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.210
So that is ngIf else, a nice little addition in a use case where you have

28
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.050
an else condition.

29
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.860
Of course the alternative would always be to simply use ngIf with the reversed check,

30
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.480
so with !server created

31
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.810
but that here is another nice alternative.

32
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.830
Now I'm going to delete it,

33
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.160
you will find an article after the section here though where you can find this code again

34
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.940
in case you are interested and we'll also use this code in the course project we're going to build.

35
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.510
I just wanted to highlight that this option exists, using ngIf like

36
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.570
this however is the case you will see most of.

37
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.590
Now let's continue.
