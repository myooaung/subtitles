00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.040
In the last lecture, we styled our active links here,

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.950
now I want to fix the behavior that whenever I click one of these recipes icons here, we reload

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.760
the page.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.240
And that simply happens if we have a look at our recipe-list component which of course is responsible

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.490
for displaying the list, here in the recipe-item which is the individual item we're clicking,

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.320
we have a link with this ref attribute here.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.640
Let's remove it because that will actually send a request to the browser and therefore reload our page.

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.830
If we remove this, you'll see now I can click it

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
but now we no longer get the cursor which looks like a hand.

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.820
We can quickly add this manually though by simply adding style and then cursor equal to pointer

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.050
and now we should have the pointer which clearly indicates that we can click this

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.280
but now we don't reload the page anymore.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.840
Now for the dropdown here, we should also make sure that all these links are not reloading the page

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.020
because right now they are and that is something we have to fix in the recipe-detail component. Here

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.730
we also need to remove these ref elements here and I already added the style with the cursor which is set

16
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.240
to a pointer to the first anchor tag,

17
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.490
let's also add it to the other two and with that, that should be fixed too.

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.360
Now if we select something here, we don't reload.

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.110
Let's now also do that for the dropdown, right now clicking the dropdown also reloads the page,

20
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.880
that of course has to be fixed in the header component

21
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.050
and here we reload the page because our dropdown also has this anchor tag or this ref attribute on it.

22
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.300
So we should get rid of this and then maybe also implement this style cursor pointer set up to get

23
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.730
the right mouse cursor,

24
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.470
let's also do the same for the individual anchor tags inside of that dropdown.

25
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640
So I also removed ref there and added my own cursor style.

26
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.060
So with that, this now all works fine,

27
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.170
of course the dropdown doesn't do anything,

28
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.980
we'll add this later but the app is working again and therefore, we made a big step into the right direction.

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.680
So with this all added and set up here, our root routes seem to be working fine but now I want to change

30
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.930
the way we load the recipe when we click on one here in the list, I actually want to load that

31
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
via child routing. When we click new recipe,

32
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.840
I also want to load the to be created recipe-edit component here on the right, where we now have the detail

33
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.790
component and the same for the case that we click edit here.

34
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.640
So that is something I definitely want to add,

35
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.070
I want to add these routes,

36
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.960
these child routes.

37
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.210
So that is what we should work on next.
