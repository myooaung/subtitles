1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,560
We understood that templates are important and that we can either use them inline here or point to

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,150
an external file,

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,700
what about styles?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,230
We also have this styleUrls property here and we have these CSS files.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,080
What can we do with those?

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,070
Let's go back to our app component for this.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,710
Here we got a h3 tag and a horizontal line

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,120
and if we have a look at our application, it's not that pretty, right?

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,060
The I'm in the app component text here or all the text actually is sitting right on the edge here, not

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,640
super pretty.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,610
Now since we use bootstrap, of course we can use some bootstrap classes to enhance this. So we could add

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,800
a div with a container class around it, then add a row

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,490
and this is just using the CSS framework, bootstrap,

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,400
so these are some CSS classes provided by this framework, nothing Angular specific

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,080
and then we could add a column here, xs-12 to have one column on all device widths.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,100
Now if we add this, we added some styling, some normal CSS styling, nothing Angular specific

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,400
and our app looks a little bit nicer now.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,360
This is great but we can also use some tools given to us by Angular.

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,990
Let's say this, I'm in the app component heading here,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,390
we want to change that style,

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,960
maybe we want to give this some blue color.

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,480
We can do it just by going to the app.component.css file which defines the styling for this component

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,690
and now we can use or write normal CSS code,

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,570
so overwrite the style of the h3 tag and set its color to some blue,

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,970
so maybe to this dark blue here.

26
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,050
If we now save this and we have a look at our application, you see it's dark blue

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:08,230
now. This is how you can use this style file, this CSS file referenced in the app component here to

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,390
define the styles for a component.

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:20,170
Now just like we were able to choose between external file and inline code for template, we can do

30
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,420
the same for the styling.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:29,310
You notice that styleUrls is an array here whereas templateUrl wasn't. It is this

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,290
because we could reference multiple external stylesheets here, so you could add pointers to other stylesheets

33
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,370
but besides that, I'm going to comment this out,

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,170
you can also set up another property which is just styles.

35
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,770
This also takes an array but now it takes an array of strings where you define the style in this string,

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,400
so now in this file. Here I'm going to use back ticks again to be able to write a multi-line expression

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,790
here and then we could set up h3 here

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,430
and to really show you that this is different, I will set the color to 

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,390
now let's not say dark blue but to dodger blue.

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:18,070
And if I now save this and we go back to the application, you see the blue updated because now the inline

41
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,470
style is taking over,

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,460
I commented out the other one. Just like with the template, you have to decide which one to use,

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:32,290
you can't combine styleUrls and styles but both important here has to be an array, that's the difference

44
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,000
to template,

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,730
you must only have one template, you may have multiple style files or style definitions and you can choose

46
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,330
between inline and external file.

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,370
The rules are basically the same as for the template.

48
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,970
If you have more code in there, using an external file is a good idea, if it's a short style definition

49
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,670
like this,

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,970
why don't you just put it into the TypeScript file?

51
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,940
This is how you can work with templates and styles.
