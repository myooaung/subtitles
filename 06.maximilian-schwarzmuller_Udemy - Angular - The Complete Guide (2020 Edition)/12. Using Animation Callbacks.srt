00:00:01,770  -->  00:00:07,980
To Raptor's animation introduction up there are a couple of callbacks you can listen to so that when

2

00:00:07,980  -->  00:00:11,560
an animation finished you might want to execute some Abaroa code.

3

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:19,680
So here in EPK component let's say on that day of element here we can listen to you these callbacks

4

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:20,390
here.

5

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:22,300
We set up event binding.

6

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:27,080
But then again with the sign to indicate that we're in the animation world like here with the proper

7

00:00:27,080  -->  00:00:31,130
keybinding But we also used the sign we set up the trigger here.

8

00:00:31,140  -->  00:00:37,880
So Dave stayed for this death and then we got the start and the Done trigger.

9

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:43,260
This method will get executed whenever the animation starts.

10

00:00:43,260  -->  00:00:51,820
So here we could say animation animation started execute this method and let's pastie when exposed spangle

11

00:00:51,850  -->  00:00:54,060
to see what's inside of it.

12

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:58,040
And I also want to listen to you.

13

00:00:58,150  -->  00:01:08,340
Finishing with done you went on our trigger animation and it an old past event there and then the app

14

00:01:08,340  -->  00:01:09,030
component.

15

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:15,780
I want to set up the two methods here so animations started which received some event and here I want

16

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:23,130
to simply lock this event so that we can see what's inside and then animation ended with the wind and

17

00:01:23,130  -->  00:01:32,670
also log this he went here with Dad let's save this and reload this application here.

18

00:01:34,080  -->  00:01:39,700
And now if I click any made you see we had the starting and the ending animation fired.

19

00:01:39,750  -->  00:01:41,780
And here you see what's inside the wind.

20

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:50,070
We see the starting state to state and timing and the same is true for the same data is part of the

21

00:01:50,160  -->  00:01:53,920
animation ended event object Englad to give us.

22

00:01:53,940  -->  00:02:00,330
So these callbacks might be useful for you if you have some code which animate something but after the

23

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:06,420
animation finishes you want to execute some other code and you can do that by listening to these built

24

00:02:06,450  -->  00:02:15,130
in starred and done events on your trigger I hope with that you feel a bit more comfortable using animations

25

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:20,650
you get a nice introduction to how you might create your own animations and what you how you can ANY

26

00:02:20,700  -->  00:02:23,120
made things you your Englad to application.

27

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:29,070
And with that play around with it set your own challenges take your existing projects maybe the recipe

28

00:02:29,070  -->  00:02:31,070
book and any made some things.

29

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:32,090
This is a challenge.

30

00:02:32,090  -->  00:02:34,070
This is where you'll learn the most.

31

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:35,880
