1

00:00:01,530  -->  00:00:02,490
So that's all nice.

2

00:00:02,490  -->  00:00:04,870
We're able to animate these deaths year.

3

00:00:05,070  -->  00:00:10,620
But what if we actually do want to animate the addition of an item to the list.

4

00:00:10,710  -->  00:00:16,160
Or if I click on it remove movement of such an item how can we animate this.

5

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:20,360
We'll have a look at this now thus far we only animated the deaf.

6

00:00:20,370  -->  00:00:27,210
Well now it's time to add a new trigger to our application so I'll copy the first trigger in this overall

7

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:28,790
animations array here.

8

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:34,380
This one here and added Make sure you pick the right level where you add it should be in the same level

9

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:40,170
as the ava triggers of course now I'm going to name this list one and there.

10

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:48,300
I only want to have one state actually d in state so that the element is on the dorm is added to the

11

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:50,420
state it's in the dorm.

12

00:00:50,550  -->  00:00:55,800
The our state would be that we don't have the element because we just remove it or we just edit it.

13

00:00:55,800  -->  00:01:02,500
So it kind of should appear and that is stayed handled by Anglo to us you will learn.

14

00:01:02,510  -->  00:01:07,250
So the instate is how should it look like once it finally is there.

15

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:13,320
Well I want to have translate X of zero to be at the position to actually place it here in my what my

16

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:23,160
age team on the code and I wanted to have let's say an opacity of one so that it is fully visible not

17

00:01:23,160  -->  00:01:24,450
transparent.

18

00:01:24,570  -->  00:01:29,340
That is the one state I have here now I need transitions.

19

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:33,610
The first transition which is interesting for me is when it comes in.

20

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:39,510
So when I added to the dorm here the end state is in but what is the beginning state.

21

00:01:39,900  -->  00:01:46,290
Well we could use the wildcard character but there is a specific state for this case that the element

22

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:48,080
hasn't been added yet.

23

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:52,890
That's why it so why does a reserved state name you can't use it.

24

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:56,000
You shouldn't override it when it does provide the buying won't you.

25

00:01:56,000  -->  00:02:03,510
For cases where you do have an element in an end state which wasn't added to the dorm at the beginning

26

00:02:03,720  -->  00:02:07,170
or of course you could also add Woit as the transition to state.

27

00:02:07,200  -->  00:02:15,540
So if you remove an element for example with this it should slowly appear and we can see the action

28

00:02:15,540  -->  00:02:23,580
by going to our app component to our HMO file and there on the list on the list item specifically we

29

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:29,580
want to add a trigger as before in square brackets and then at and then place to one and we don't need

30

00:02:29,580  -->  00:02:37,560
to bind it to anything because it will actually set up word to anything because I don't care what the

31

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:39,970
specific state is in.

32

00:02:39,990  -->  00:02:42,720
It's just a dummy or you could use any name.

33

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:48,010
I only have in here we could have some logic in the code which changes the state of our list items.

34

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:54,560
But here for the entering animation when we add a new item I don't care what the initial state is and

35

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:56,660
actually I never said it in this application.

36

00:02:56,670  -->  00:02:58,140
I never apply a state of.

37

00:02:58,140  -->  00:03:02,790
In two days I don't have a property managing my list element States.

38

00:03:02,790  -->  00:03:06,300
I do have it forward the above examples but here I don't care.

39

00:03:06,360  -->  00:03:11,820
I went to any made from not existent to any state.

40

00:03:11,820  -->  00:03:20,320
This is the animation I want to execute and if I saved this and we see this in action let's add tasks

41

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:25,770
here and well that is certainly not working as intended.

42

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,240
So what's going wrong here.

43

00:03:27,510  -->  00:03:30,200
Well the issues clearly we have no starting state.

44

00:03:30,390  -->  00:03:37,120
Now it doesn't work as such that we now set up Lloyd like this before we defined are states like this

45

00:03:37,120  -->  00:03:37,140
.

46

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:41,490
But since what is kind of a bulge in state it now works differently.

47

00:03:41,490  -->  00:03:46,110
Instead here in our transition we now want to change this.

48

00:03:46,110  -->  00:03:50,080
We will use an array here where any mate is placed in.

49

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:57,750
But before executing animate I will have a nap restyle method where I set the initial style and this

50

00:03:57,750  -->  00:04:01,310
style will now be applied by English to you right at the beginning.

51

00:04:01,350  -->  00:04:07,680
So when we add on your list item it is appended to the dawn and it will instantly get this style by

52

00:04:07,690  -->  00:04:13,960
Angola 2 and then transition over Dyster region to its final style here.

53

00:04:14,340  -->  00:04:21,080
So to a style a one a set up here therefore is a pop opacity of 0 and a 1 to transform such that it

54

00:04:21,090  -->  00:04:22,130
flies in.

55

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:25,690
So translate X should be minus 100 pixels.

56

00:04:25,770  -->  00:04:29,790
And now if I save this now we should see a nice animation.

57

00:04:29,850  -->  00:04:35,680
When they actually add new items to the list year you saw it up on the initial loading already.

58

00:04:35,880  -->  00:04:41,880
And now each new item is smooth fully animated in like that automatically by Englad to.

59

00:04:41,940  -->  00:04:43,930
It doesn't work for deleting though.

60

00:04:43,980  -->  00:04:45,490
So let's handle this next.

61

00:04:45,690  -->  00:04:53,220
Well let's say for deleting we want to have it slide to the right so to do this I'll add a new transmission

62

00:04:53,220  -->  00:05:04,890
here to my trigger and here I want to navigate or animate from any state to any state would be possible

63

00:05:04,890  -->  00:05:07,360
to you but too wide specifically.

64

00:05:07,560  -->  00:05:15,410
And here I want to start with the state it already has so no need to define a starting state.

65

00:05:15,420  -->  00:05:19,240
Instead my animate function should now have a final state.

66

00:05:19,350  -->  00:05:24,050
Because here I don't have the problem of it snapping to some state at the end.

67

00:05:24,060  -->  00:05:26,680
This should be the state that takes a deep end.

68

00:05:26,700  -->  00:05:31,250
So here was a second argument as you learned above here.

69

00:05:31,270  -->  00:05:34,110
I set up the state I want to have it where I want to have it.

70

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:35,220
And the end.

71

00:05:35,510  -->  00:05:39,240
And there are two trends for him to translate x.

72

00:05:39,390  -->  00:05:47,130
The last one hundred pixels to move it to the right and to all faded out by setting the opacity to zero

73

00:05:47,130  -->  00:05:47,940
again.

74

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:50,740
Well and with that in place the timing.

75

00:05:50,750  -->  00:05:57,930
Well let's let's have it at 300 to Wantage reloads and I click on the element you see it smoothly transition

76

00:05:57,960  -->  00:06:04,410
out and being removed and this is how you can animate lists and the same would of course also work for

77

00:06:04,410  -->  00:06:09,020
energy IV where you also have the behavior of something new being added to the DOM
