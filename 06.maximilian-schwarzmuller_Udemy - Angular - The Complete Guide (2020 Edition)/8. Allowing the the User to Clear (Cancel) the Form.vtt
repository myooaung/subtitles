00:00:02.290  -->  00:00:06.830
We already finished resetting, the clear button is pretty similar to that.

2

00:00:07.120  -->  00:00:14.940
So here, I'll add a click listener and I'll execute onClear and in the TypeScript file,

3

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:17.800
I'll now add the onClear method here,

4

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:20.120
how can we clear our form?

5

00:00:20.790  -->  00:00:28.320
Well we already got access to the form because we add it here with @ViewChild, so I can simply call this

6

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:36.780
sl form reset and I need to make sure that I also set editMode back to false.

7

00:00:36.820  -->  00:00:39.100
If it was false before, it doesn't hurt,

8

00:00:39.160  -->  00:00:42.180
if it wasn't false, I ensure that we leave it.

9

00:00:42.730  -->  00:00:51.630
So with this now, if I select an item and I click clear, we're out of it again so I can now add a new one

10

00:00:52.330  -->  00:00:59.920
and if I'm already adding one, bananas and then I hit clear, I simply cancel this.

11

00:00:59.970  -->  00:01:04.740
So now I have to start over but I can still update the existing ones.

12

00:01:04.950  -->  00:01:07.860
So that is all working as expected,

13

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:13.620
now with the clear button added. In the last step, I want to make sure that we can delete the items we

14

00:01:13.620  -->  00:01:14.590
selected here.
