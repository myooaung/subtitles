1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,610
Let's now output our data

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,940
now that we're fetching it. For that when we're getting the data instead of logging it,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,170
since we now transform this into an array of posts, we can set this loaded post, which is a property

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,360
I created earlier, where we now also can be more explicit about the type it will store because that will

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,430
be an array of posts of course, we can set this loaded posts here equal to the posts we fetched.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,530
Now we just have to use loaded posts in our template and for that, of course in this area where I say

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,160
no posts available, I only want to say that if we really have no posts, so I'll add ngIf here

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:49,190
and check if loaded posts length is smaller than one, which means we have no posts. If it is longer than

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,910
one, then I want to output an unordered list with a class of list group which is a Bootstrap class which

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:04,610
has list items with list group item as a class and in there, we'll have a h1 tag for the title and a

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,570
paragraph for the content of the post.

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:14,300
Now, I want to only show this of course and hence I'll add ngIf on the unordered list if loaded posts

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,100
length is greater or equal than one,

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,630
so it's the opposite of this condition here.

15
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,880
If that's true, we'll show the list and now I want to loop through all the loaded posts and recreate

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,300
a list item for every loaded post.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:36,290
So here, I'll add ngFor to go through all my posts, so I'll name this post of loaded posts and then

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:49,130
here, we can output post title and for the paragraph, we can output post content. Let's have a look at

19
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,500
whether this works, if this now reloads, it fetches the posts and you see thereafter, these posts appear

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,550
here. Now maybe the heading is a bit big, let's maybe use h3 here but the important takeaway

21
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:08,300
is that our data loads of course. Now that is super awesome and this shows us how we can make the step

22
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,120
from loading the data to outputting it in our front-end.
