00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.030
Now that we've had a look at what this course offers,
1

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.940
let me explain to you how you can get the most out of it.
2

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.570
Of course, you should watch the videos, go through the lectures and I do my best there to explain how Angular
3

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.550
works, why it works like this and how you use the different features together.
4

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.250
Besides the lectures, I've got a couple of assignments in this course, practices, exercises and I urge
5

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.110
you to do these exercises.
6

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.840
I designed them to be challenging but doable
7

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.290
These assignments allow you to check if you understood a certain concept and to really practice
8

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.130
it and get more comfortable using it.
9

10
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.990
Well besides the assignments, we're going to build a whole course project and I can only invite you to
10

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.580
build this project with me
11

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.210
and also sometimes pause the video and build a feature we're about to implement together, on your own first.
12

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.240
This really is a great exercise
13

14
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.520
too and it might also be very interesting for you to expand this course project beyond the things we build here
14

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.620
to add new features to it.
15

16
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.280
If you get stuck somewhere or if something is unclear, there is the Q&A Section and I'm very
16

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.980
happy to help you there and answer any questions you might have related to this course.
17

18
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.910
However, you will learn even more if you not only ask, but if you answer. Dig through the Q&A Section
18

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.480
and try to help other students too.
19

20
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.430
Why?
20

21
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.640
Because by answering, you are really challenged to think about a problem and come up with a solution.
21

22
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.390
It doesn't really matter if that is then the best possible solution.
22

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.150
If there is a better one, someone else is going to correct you and then you'll learn again.
23

24
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.750
But, by thinking about it in the first place, you really go through the concepts you learned and you apply
24

25
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.470
them to a real problem.
25

26
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.630
So, that's how you will learn the most.
26

27
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.260
Besides that, however strange it might sound, the official documentation
27

28
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.410
and Google are your friends; especially if you get some strange error messages. Simply Google for it and
28

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.280
not because I'm too lazy to help you, I will help you,
29

30
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.970
but because it's so much faster than waiting for my reply or for the reply of someone else.
30

31
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.760
Most of the error messages were encountered by other people before too,
31

32
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.630
so chances are great that you'll get an answer by simply searching for it. By following this advice,
32

33
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.710
you should learn a lot about Angular in this course.
