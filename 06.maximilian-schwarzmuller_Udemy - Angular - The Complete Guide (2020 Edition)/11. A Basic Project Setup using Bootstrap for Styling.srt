00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:08,810
Throughout this course, I'll often start with an empty project for a given section so that we can focus on the topic
1

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,240
at hand
2

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,760
in that section.
3

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,560
So therefore, you can simply create a new project with ng new; as we did a couple of lectures
4

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,070
ago and I'll typically start with an empty app.component.html file. If I have a different starting
5

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,440
setup, you'll find it attached to the lectures.
6

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,090
I'll always ensure that this is the case.
7

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,100
But here, I'll now simply have this empty setup.
8

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,730
We can remove FormsModule from app.module.ts (in case you added it) so that we have a clean
9

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:44,120
starting project and there's one important thing: in this course, I'll use the Bootstrap CSS framework
10

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,780
to have some nice CSS styles out-of-the-box without us having to write all these CSS styles. Now,
11

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,540
to add this, we need to install it; we need to download it. We can do this by quitting this development server
12

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,800
with Ctrl-C and then installing it with this NPM tool
13

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:10,590
(the Node Package Manager), by running npm install --save bootstrap@3. It's important
14

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,490
to install version 3 as it's the version I use in this course.
15

16
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,780
Now, this will install it locally in this project; not globally, but locally.
16

17
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,280
Simply hit Enter and it will download Bootstrap and store it in the node_modules folder.
17

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Now, that's the first step,
18

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,770
but to be able to use it, we also need to make Angular aware of this styling package we want to use and
19

20
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,170
we do that in one of the config files
20

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,530
(the most important one actually) the angular.json file. This configures the CLI project. We will not
21

22
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,120
work in this project file throughout the course because the default setup is perfect and we don't need
22

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,390
to change anything there.
23

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,780
But one thing we do need to change right now is the styles we want to use by default.
24

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,730
Here you've got this "styles" array in this "architect", "build" node.
25

26
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,830
Now, it already has one entry
26

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,350
"src/styles.css".
27

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,080
This is a file you can use to define some global styles you want to use application-wide.
28

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,510
So, you can enter any code here and it will be used in every Angular component. But, in my case, I will add
29

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,440
another import
30

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,040
prior to that "src/styles.css" import so that we could overwrite it within this file.
31

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,300
Now, here we need to point to node_modules
32

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,170
(to this node_modules folder
33

34
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,260
we've got here) and if you scroll down a bit, there are many dependencies because you have dependencies
34

35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,600
of dependencies here.
35

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,800
If you scroll down a bit more, you'll see bootstrap and in there you'll find a dist folder, a CSS folder and
36

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,180
there, bootstrap.css file,
37

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,850
or to be precise, there is also a bootstrap.min.css file just hidden a bit by my IDE. So, we can enter
38

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:04,350
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" and make sure that
39

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,880
you've got no typo in here.   
40

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,390
It's easy to miss the 't' or something like that.
41

42
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,060
So, make sure that you have a path like this.
42

43
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,080
Once you've added this path, save your angular.json file and re-run ng serve to load this
43

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,330
new configuration.
44

45
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,990
As I said, you don't really need to change anything else in here.
45

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,370
The default configuration should work perfectly.
46

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,010
So, once you're done you can visit localhost:4200. You won't see anything because I deleted all the
47

48
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,930
content in the template.
48

49
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,740
But if you access the Elements tab in the Developer Tools, you should see that in the head section there
49

50
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,810
are two styles imports and the first one should be Bootstrap v3.3.7.
50

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,930
Now, this is the import you need there and with that, everything we do in the course will look correct.
51

52
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,150
Now, one last change is needed in app.component.ts.
52

53
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,440
I'll get rid of whichever property we have here. With that, the starting project is prepared. You can always
53

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,700
use this at the beginning of a new module and, importantly, you also saw how you can add your own styles.
