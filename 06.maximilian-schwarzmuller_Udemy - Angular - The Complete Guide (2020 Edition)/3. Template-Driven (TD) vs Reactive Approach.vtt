00:00:02.500  -->  00:00:08.680
Before diving in the actual code, it's super important to understand that Angular actually offers two

2

00:00:08.680  -->  00:00:12.010
approaches when it comes to handling forms.

3

00:00:12.100  -->  00:00:17.920
It offers the template driven approach, which is called like this because there, you simply set up your

4

00:00:17.920  -->  00:00:25.090
form in the template, in HTML code and Angular will automatically infer the structure of your

5

00:00:25.090  -->  00:00:32.140
form, will infer which controls your forms has, which inputs and makes it easy for you to get started

6

00:00:32.140  -->  00:00:33.400
quickly.

7

00:00:33.400  -->  00:00:39.250
It also has a more complex approach, the reactive approach.

8

00:00:39.250  -->  00:00:45.150
There, you actually define the structure of the form in TypeScript code,

9

00:00:45.250  -->  00:00:51.730
you also set up the HTML code and then you manually connect it which might sound more complicated

10

00:00:51.730  -->  00:00:56.230
than it is in the end and therefore, it gives you greater control over it,

11

00:00:56.230  -->  00:01:00.300
you can fine tune every little piece about your form.

12

00:01:00.310  -->  00:01:05.250
Now in this module, we're going to have a look at both approaches, in the next videos,

13

00:01:05.320  -->  00:01:10.200
I'm going to start with the template driven approach which is fine for a lot of use cases

14

00:01:10.300  -->  00:01:13.960
before we then dive into the more advanced reactive approach.
