00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:07.080
Welcome to a new Marshall indice course we had a look at a lot of functionalities Anglo to offer us

2

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:11.480
which allow us to create awesome single page applications.

3

00:00:11.490  -->  00:00:16.410
Now what functionality we haven't covered yet and where an older want to give you a basic introduction

4

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:22.110
to it at least our animations and what use ships with its own animation system which we can use to for

5

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:29.010
example render da addition of items to a list or deconditioned all at hatching or detaching of elements

6

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:29.950
to the DOM.

7

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:35.670
So all these things which are kind of hard to handle with normal C as s transitions were animations

8

00:00:35.970  -->  00:00:42.240
because if you add something to dom which isn't there before it's hard to handle this with a C S S transition

9

00:00:42.250  -->  00:00:43.320
style.

10

00:00:43.380  -->  00:00:48.930
Therefore in this modular will have a look at the two with a lot to offer us to turn this application

11

00:00:48.930  -->  00:00:56.040
here which isn't too awesome but which has a list at least well to turn this into a nicer application

12

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:01.100
where we play around with a couple of any nations and see how the animation system in England works

13

00:01:01.120  -->  00:01:02.390
.
