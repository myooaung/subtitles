Welcome to a new module in this course. This module is about services and dependency injection,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,030
now what is that?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,190
Let's start with services,

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,450
what are services? Let's consider this application, we get an AppComponent, an AboutComponent, a

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,810
UserComponent and a UserDetailComponent.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,400
Now we might have some methods in those components,

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,730
let's say we want to log some data to the console in the AboutComponent and in the UserDetailComponent

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,800
and somehow this log statement is pretty similar,

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,130
so pretty much the same text, so we're basically repeating ourselves here, we're duplicating code in two different

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,420
components.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,280
Let's say in the UserComponent, we also want to access some data, some array of users maybe and maybe we

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,590
also don't know if we will later use that in some other part of our application.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:08,190
Both use cases, duplication of code and data storage, providing data are typical use cases for a service

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,180
because a service is basically just another piece in your Angular app, another class you can add which

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,350
acts as a central repository, as a central business unit you could say, something where you can store, where

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,850
you can centralize your code in. So we could create a log service for example to centralize our log

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,120
statement,

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,790
we could create a user service to manage the data storage here.

19
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,850
Let's see this in a real app so that it becomes more clear though.
