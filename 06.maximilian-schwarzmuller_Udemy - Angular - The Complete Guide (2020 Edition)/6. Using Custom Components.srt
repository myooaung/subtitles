00:00:02,970  -->  00:00:06,040
With our component registered, let's use it.

2

00:00:06,270  -->  00:00:10,690
So we have our selector here, app-server.

3

00:00:10,890  -->  00:00:15,620
Now I told you we are not going to add it to the index.html file, there it wouldn't work,

4

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:22,110
instead let's go to the app.component.html file, the only other HTML we have right now

5

00:00:22,110  -->  00:00:23,660
where we could add it

6

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:27,250
and here I'll add a horizontal line and below this,

7

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:35,800
I'll add my app-server element here and the shortcut I used here is just a little plugin called emmet,

8

00:00:36,010  -->  00:00:40,720
available for many IDEs and editors which gives you a quicker way of writing

9

00:00:40,740  -->  00:00:41,380
HTML.

10

00:00:41,770  -->  00:00:47,630
So here, app-server is our own selector, our own element kind of we created.

11

00:00:47,740  -->  00:00:51,130
If we now save this, it should successfully recompile

12

00:00:51,130  -->  00:00:57,550
and if we have a look at our running application, you see the server component here, our own component

13

00:00:57,850  -->  00:00:59,460
being added here.

14

00:00:59,860  -->  00:01:06,670
So that is how you can use your components then with their selector after adding them to app module

15

00:01:07,240  -->  00:01:10,240
and then displaying them on the page.
