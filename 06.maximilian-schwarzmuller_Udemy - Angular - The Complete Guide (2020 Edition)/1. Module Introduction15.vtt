In this module, we'll have a look at components again but now, add dynamic components.

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.180
Now what are dynamic components? Dynamic components are essentially components which you create dynamically

3
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.590
at runtime.

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.800
So let's say you want to show an alert,

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.890
you want to show a modal, some overlay which should only be loaded upon a certain action,

6
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.490
for example you have an error and you want to not show that error box which we're currently showing

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.360
in our course project but we want to show an overlay on the entire screen or something like that, that

8
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.620
could be done or could be implemented by using dynamic components. And dynamic components is not a

9
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.700
specific term, not a specific feature provided by Angular but we can simply add components that we load

10
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.430
through our code and that's exactly what we'll do in this module. You will learn how to create such a

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.240
component and how to then load it on demand, how to communicate with it and also how to get rid of it.
