1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,560
For that, I'm back in the course project and the part I want to handle with dynamic components is here

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,020
on the login when I enter incorrect credentials, at the moment we then have that spinner and then we see

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,720
that error message there.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,060
Now nothing wrong with that way of displaying an error,

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,380
it's perfectly fine,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,040
you don't have to change that but to demonstrate how you could load a component dynamically,

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,590
I will change it.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,650
I will not use that box here but instead, we'll build a very simple alert box which is presented as an

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,130
overlay here on the screen with a nice backdrop that hides the background and in that alert box, we

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,350
can then simply click OK to get rid of it and have another try here.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,980
So that's the idea.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,970
Let me now go back to code and here,

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,140
the goal now is to first of all build such an alert and I'll do that in a shared folder.

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:05,350
I'll name that alert and in there, I'll create my alert.component.ts file where I

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,390
want to build that alert component.

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,560
Now my alert component here will be a simple box that is loaded as an overlay on the entire screen

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:23,900
and therefore, let's here export a class, alert component like this and give it that @component decorator.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,740
Now in that decorator, I'll assign a selector, app alert and add the template URL where I want to

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,090
point at an external template, the alert.component.html file which we therefore also have

20
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,590
to create in that same folder and that is my basic component for now.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,750
Now the alert component here then receives of course some markup

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,000
and here, I will include both the backdrop and that overlay box in one and the same component,

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,480
of course you could also split this into multiple components.

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,050
So here we'll write some custom CSS actually and I'll add a div with a class of backdrop, that will

25
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,130
be the backdrop,

26
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:19,270
so basically that thing in the background that blocks access to the rest of the page and ensures that

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,970
the focus is on the alert box and that box is the second div I'll add here.

28
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,660
I'll give that a class of alert box, something like this, to not interfere with the alert class provided

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,750
by bootstrap because I don't want to use that and in that alert box here, I'll keep this really simple,

30
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,580
I'll just add a paragraph where we can output the message with string interpolation

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,470
and that is referring to a message property we haven't added yet to the component, we'll do that soon

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:58,770
and I also want to have a button to close that alert and therefore I'll add another div here, I'll

33
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,480
name this alert box actions,

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,310
so that's my class name here and in that div, I'll add a button with class btn-btn-primary.

35
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,790
Now I'm using Bootstrap classes here again to get that button styling

36
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:20,590
and here we can just say close. So this could be an alert box, it's missing some styling, so let me add

37
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,300
an alert.component.css file here as well and point at that file in our component declaration here,

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,890
so style URLs receives a pointer, an alert.component.css. So far, so good.

39
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,820
Now in the alert component, I do have that message property which I want to output and therefore in the

40
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,560
alert.component.ts file, we need that message property and that will be a string and it should

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,590
be settable from outside.

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,420
And therefore, you learned that we can add @input here and input needs to be important from

43
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,930
@angular/core to make this settable from outside.

44
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,720
With that, the alert component is almost finished,

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,800
let's now add it to the app module here, add it to the declarations there, the alert component

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,560
and now let's see how we could add it.

47
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,580
Well, we could go to our

48
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,830
auth component, to the template there of course and there,

49
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,030
right now I do have that alert box which is shown when we do have an error.

50
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:33,670
Now I'll comment that out and instead use app alert here and there, we have to set the message property

51
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:40,030
which we made bindable with @input and I'll set this to error and I'll show the entire alert box

52
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,280
here with the app alert element only if we have an error.

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,370
So now we're simply just showing our own alert component,

54
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,280
so far, nothing too fancy of course.

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,490
Now this custom alert component now will receive some styling and I'll start with the backdrop,

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:09,340
so the thing in the background. That will get a fixed position, top 0, left 0, a width of 100vw

57
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,330
actually which is the viewport width, so not the percentage, to not take the container width but the entire

58
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,060
viewport width, a height of 100vh

59
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:31,780
to take the entire viewport height as well, then a background of RGBA 0, 0, .75 which is slightly

60
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,830
transparent black background color. A z-index of let's say 50, to be above all the other elements that

61
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,550
could be there

62
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,280
and yes, that should be it.

63
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,750
Now the alert box, this is the other element we have, should also get some styling.

64
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,280
First of all, this will get a position of fixed too, top here

65
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,830
could be let's say 30vh to have it 30% inside of the viewport, to not have it sit right at

66
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,240
the top of the viewport.

67
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:14,550
The left will actually be let's say 20vw, the width of this thing here will then be 60vw because then

68
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,750
we have 20 to the left and 20 to the right to center this nicely.

69
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,960
I'll not set a height, the height should be determined by the content that's in there and I'll give it

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:35,400
a padding though of let's say 16px, a z-index of 100 to be above of the backdrop, a background color

71
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:47,810
of white and a slight box shadow with these settings here to hopefully make it look good. So that's

72
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,830
my alert box,

73
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,710
now we also have that alert box actions class which holds that button where we can close everything

74
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,710
and there, I just want to add the text align right to push this all the way to the right.

75
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,820
Now of course, you can adjust this however you want.

76
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Let's see this,

77
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,480
let's wait for this to reload and then enter some incorrect credentials here

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,260
and here is our alert box. This is this nice modal now

79
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,880
and of course you could go way more advanced here,

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you could use ng content to pass dynamic DOM into that box here, whatever you want

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,400
but this is our box, of course at the moment we can't close it though

82
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,700
but creating that is the first step.

83
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,610
Now how can we load this dynamically

84
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,710
and of course also, how can we then close it?
