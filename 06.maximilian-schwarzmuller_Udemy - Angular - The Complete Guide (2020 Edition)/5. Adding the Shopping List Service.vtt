00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.850
So in the last lectures, we improved our recipe section a lot with the service,

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.870
now let's work on the shopping list side, on the shopping list service.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.270
This service is empty right now,

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.250
now here's your challenge,

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.560
fill it some life. It would be nice if this service could manage our shopping list, so our list of ingredients,

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.680
maybe you even add the addIngredient method here so that you can add ingredients using this service

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.280
too,

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.340
we already got this add functionality here in the shopping list component.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.520
It shouldn't live here anymore though and with that, we would take a huge step forward.

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.150
So your chance to pause the video and try this on your own, thereafter we'll solve it together.

11
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.590
So were you successful?

12
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.510
Let's fill this shopping service with some life.

13
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.690
For this, I'll first of all copy my ingredients here and add it here as a property to the service

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.100
and of course I need to import ingredient from the shared folder, from the ingredient model there.

15
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.600
Now with that, we got the data in here and I will make this private. Now just like in the shopping,

16
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.800
excuse me, in the recipe service,

17
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:27.440
I will add a getIngredients method here where I will return my ingredients but only a copy of it with

18
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.420
the slice method, so that I can't access the original array stored in this service.

19
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.140
With that, I can go back to my shopping list component and I will set this to an uninitialized property

20
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.830
but I can inject my shopping list service.

21
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.210
Now again the question is, where should we provide it? Now for now,

22
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.150
we can provide it here in the shopping list component and therefore it would also be available in the

23
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.970
shopping edit component but actually later I also want to access it from my recipe section.

24
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:15.480
That is why I will actually provide it in app module and here, I will add it to this providers array therefore, shopping

25
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.290
list service.

26
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.570
Make sure to also add the import at the top here.

27
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.910
So now we will be able to use a service application-wide including in other services and I exactly need

28
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.420
this behavior because we will soon use it in another service.

29
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.910
So back to the shopping list component then, we can now inject a shopping list service and I will bind it

30
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.290
to a property named slService,

31
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.840
of course you can choose a different name which will be of type shopping list service and you need to

32
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.230
add the import pointing to the shopping list.service

33
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.280
file. With that in ngOnInit because you should do all tasks which required a bit more

34
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.310
heavy lifting or in general as a good practice,

35
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.830
all initializations in ngOnInit.

36
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.040
Therefore here, I will simply assign my ingredients to whatever the shopping list service returns me

37
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.870
if I call getIngredients here.

38
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.720
With this in place, if we save this and we go to a shopping list area, this is still working so that's

39
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.770
great,

40
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.950
now let's make sure that we can also add items. So I'll add the addIngredient

41
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.320
method here and I know that I will receive an ingredient here of type ingredient and all I want to

42
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.440
do then is I want to access my ingredients and push this new ingredient on it,

43
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.000
so here, ingredient. Now if we go to the shopping edit component,

44
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.560
right now we're emitting an event with our own ingredient. We no longer need to do this so we can get

45
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.640
rid of the event, of output and of the imports here related to this,

46
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.200
we can also go to the shopping-list.component.html file and remove our listener where we listen to this

47
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.810
event and in the shopping-list.component.ts file, we can get rid of the onIngredientAdded method

48
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.570
because we'll now do this in the service.

49
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.180
So back to shopping edit component where we create a new ingredient, here I want to use the service and

50
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.350
for this, I will access my service so I will inject slService here,

51
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.410
like this,

52
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.810
make sure to add the import of course and in onAddItem,

53
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.380
I'll add slService and add an ingredient to it,

54
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.340
this new ingredient here.

55
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:53.680
Now if we save this and now try adding a new item here, bread one, we don't see it but we also don't get

56
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.430
an error.

57
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.990
Now there is something wrong here and we will find out what and fix it in the next lecture.
