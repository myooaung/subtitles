1

00:00:01,650  -->  00:00:06,650
Well that was a lot but I want to mention two more things or show two more things.

2

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:11,240
One is a more detailed control over the individual steps.

3

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:14,360
You are in the animation process year.

4

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:20,700
We always saw that we can defy multiple faces but each face gets the same importance.

5

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:26,910
It would be nice if we could define some key frames to specifically say okay you any enemy over one

6

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:33,510
second after 200 Second you should have stayed off for 500 seconds you should have this state and so

7

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:34,230
on.

8

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:36,170
Well we can do this.

9

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:39,100
I'm copying my trigger your final time.

10

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:46,680
And here I want to set up a list to which in my template I bind to my second list year which uses the

11

00:00:46,680  -->  00:00:48,090
same data source.

12

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:54,740
So here at least two sets up to trigger to binded and then we can set up the animations here.

13

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:57,550
Well leave d in stage here.

14

00:00:57,870  -->  00:01:03,620
But for the transition when coming in I want to change this here.

15

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:11,070
I don't want to specify a normal array as I did before to have these different equally weighted phases

16

00:01:11,100  -->  00:01:11,580
.

17

00:01:11,690  -->  00:01:18,660
Instead I'll pass an argument which is still an array but they're in the animate function.

18

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:20,360
Let's say one second.

19

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:24,120
I use the keyframes method as the second argument.

20

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:27,480
This needs to be imported from an angle or core.

21

00:01:27,480  -->  00:01:33,510
Now the key frames method here in the animate function allows me to be more precise.

22

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:40,170
Which part of multiple styles I can now set up should occur as to which timing the overall animation

23

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:47,160
will take one second but I can control which state in sight of that animation should take how long.

24

00:01:47,520  -->  00:01:52,290
So here keyframes therefore it's all an array with now the individual faces.

25

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:57,100
And there I simply apply a couple of styles of the style method again.

26

00:01:57,120  -->  00:02:05,220
So let's for let's say when we let it enter it should transform and at the beginning we have it on the

27

00:02:05,220  -->  00:02:08,000
left as before minus 100 pixels.

28

00:02:08,040  -->  00:02:12,990
We also said that about your past two years before to zero.

29

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:18,600
Now let's say we want to have a number stall during that flight in animation.

30

00:02:18,600  -->  00:02:21,380
Here we want to have transform.

31

00:02:21,560  -->  00:02:29,160
Set this to translate x 50 pixels minus 50 pixels.

32

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:35,670
So halfway there because we want to end at zero trancelike x zero at the end that's our final state

33

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:44,990
up here that we want to animate the opacity to already be at zero point five.

34

00:02:45,630  -->  00:02:53,700
And then we have yet another style let's say where we want to say OK the transform function is now also

35

00:02:53,880  -->  00:02:54,770
almost there.

36

00:02:54,780  -->  00:02:59,540
So translate X is now minus 20 pixels.

37

00:03:00,600  -->  00:03:04,350
But importantly opacity is one.

38

00:03:04,350  -->  00:03:10,830
So we're done when it comes to opacity but we're not completely at the position we want to be.

39

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:12,440
This will work like that.

40

00:03:12,450  -->  00:03:20,210
I can now save this and if we let this reload you should watch the bottom list you always saw it upon

41

00:03:20,250  -->  00:03:25,570
the initial fly in and should see if you watched the compression to the top list.

42

00:03:25,680  -->  00:03:33,180
If I add a new item this is much slower and it starts fast and then takes very long for the last bit

43

00:03:33,180  -->  00:03:33,840
.

44

00:03:33,840  -->  00:03:41,040
The reason for this is that by default all these steps here take equally long I have free elements here

45

00:03:41,040  -->  00:03:42,290
in my key from an array.

46

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:48,020
And then every style is triggered after a third for the third of a second.

47

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:53,070
I can override this by passing the offset property.

48

00:03:53,100  -->  00:03:59,880
I can't say as to which timing of these 1000 milliseconds in this case should you be at the state sort

49

00:03:59,900  -->  00:04:03,390
of first status at the beginning offset zero.

50

00:04:03,450  -->  00:04:10,020
Then here let's say you want to be at this not after half of the time which it would make sense because

51

00:04:10,050  -->  00:04:13,250
we are half way in and half way the opacity.

52

00:04:13,440  -->  00:04:20,390
But we want to be at this point after point three of our animation time.

53

00:04:20,580  -->  00:04:24,910
So 30 percent of our animation time so 300 more seconds in this case.

54

00:04:25,200  -->  00:04:36,450
And we want to be almost done after let's say Dot 8 and then I will add a final style here

55

00:04:39,270  -->  00:04:43,570
with an offset of one where I'm done.

56

00:04:43,620  -->  00:04:47,570
This is my final key for him so that it doesn't snap at the end.

57

00:04:48,000  -->  00:04:54,960
Well with this if I let it reload we saw it year up on initial loading and if I add a new item it stat

58

00:04:55,050  -->  00:04:56,210
starts fast

59

00:04:58,980  -->  00:05:08,020
but then smoothly finishes does how we used keyframes to control precisely which state we want to have

60

00:05:08,020  -->  00:05:08,040
.

61

00:05:08,040  -->  00:05:14,160
At which time during the transition that's important key for EMS are for the time during the transition

62

00:05:14,160  -->  00:05:14,330
.

63

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:19,620
So over the time of such or any made function and of course you could still have multiple animated functions

64

00:05:19,650  -->  00:05:23,110
as we had before it in that array you passed through the transition.

65

00:05:23,240  -->  00:05:27,440
You could have multiple any made in functions and each element functions could have multiple key frames

66

00:05:27,450  -->  00:05:29,780
so unlimited possibilities here
