Welcome back to our recipe book course app,

2

00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:08,470
we already added a lot of features to it,

3

00:00:08,510  -->  00:00:10,660
now I went to add forms.

4

00:00:10,700  -->  00:00:16,550
We have two places where we need to add forms, when we create a new recipe or edit a recipe in the

5

00:00:16,550  -->  00:00:20,710
recipe edit component and in the shopping list here.

6

00:00:20,900  -->  00:00:26,950
We already are able to add elements to the shopping list but we can handle this in a better way through

7

00:00:26,960  -->  00:00:30,620
a form and then I also want to make these other buttons here work.

8

00:00:30,740  -->  00:00:33,720
The form for the recipe, as soon as we can create new ones,

9

00:00:33,740  -->  00:00:36,280
I also want to make that delete button work.

10

00:00:36,350  -->  00:00:40,690
Let's start with the shopping list form in the next lectures. Here

11

00:00:40,740  -->  00:00:46,100
I want to use the template driven approach and certainly feel free to go ahead and try implementing this

12

00:00:46,160  -->  00:00:47,090
on your own

13

00:00:47,390  -->  00:00:52,700
but there are a couple of different approaches of implementing it, so probably we won't have the same

14

00:00:52,700  -->  00:00:54,650
solution. In the next lecture,

15

00:00:54,650  -->  00:00:57,510
we'll start together and I will show you my approach.
