00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.440
This is it for this module.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.980
We had a thorough look at NgModules, what they do, which different types of modules we have and when

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.200
to use them.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.860
We also had a look at routing in these modules and at lazy loading, to optimize our initial bundled

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.120
size.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.290
You learned about services and modules and what's special about them and that you can also set up

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.580
preloading to optimize lazy loading even more.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.860
And now last but not least, we had a look at ahead of time compilation which is another important optimization

9
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.210
technique you want to use before shipping your app to a server.

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.450
Now speaking of that, in the next module, we'll do just that. We'll deploy our Angular app onto a server.
