00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.860
Thus far, we learned a lot about the template driven approach and how we can create great forms

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.000
with it.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.130
Now let's move on, let's leave the world of validating the user input here

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.160
and let's say we want to define some default values which should be displayed, for example on the

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.320
dropdown here.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.370
Right now, it's empty by default,

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.430
well would be nice if

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.250
one of the two questions would be selected, right?

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.430
For this, we can change the way we add ngModel.

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.210
Right now, we add it like this, without property or event binding nor two-way data binding,

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.490
well we can use it together with property binding, so let's add some square brackets around it, no

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.250
parentheses so we're not using two-way by binding as of now

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
and now we can bind it to a value and remember with it,

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.460
I mean the control, this input here which is turned into a control by Angular in the background.

15
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.930
So this select here can now be bound to a default value and you could either hardcode a string

16
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.560
into there,

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.650
don't forget the single quotation marks in this case

18
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.490
or you set up a property, like let's say default

19
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.900
question which would be pet. Pet

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.010
because that is one of the two valid values, the other one being teacher for this question here.

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.970
So now we can bind this to default question and if we now save this and let it reload, you'll see that

22
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.300
now pet is selected

23
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.160
and of course if we switch this to teacher, well it shouldn't be a surprise that the other value is

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.040
selected.

25
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.060
So now all of a sudden, we're using a default value

26
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.290
and of course this does not only work for the dropdown, it would also work for the username,

27
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.340
you could point to a default string there, pre-populating this field with a default username.

28
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.980
Very useful and something you should definitely keep in mind, that you are not limited to using

29
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.880
ngModel without any bindings,

30
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.880
you can use one-way binding, property binding to set a default value.

31
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.370
Of course this value can still be overwritten,

32
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.250
you can still pick a different option here.
