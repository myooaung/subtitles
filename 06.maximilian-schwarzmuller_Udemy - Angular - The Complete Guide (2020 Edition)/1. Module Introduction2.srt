00:00:02,550  -->  00:00:07,470
Welcome to a new module. You learned the basics and we set up our first project,

2

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:11,240
additionally we had a look at how to find and fix errors.

3

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:18,120
Now I want to dive deeper into components and data binding and how you can connect both concepts even

4

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:23,100
closer to now make the next big step in your application.

5

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:25,560
Let's start with an example project,

6

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:31,890
you can find it attached to this in the next lecture and enhance this project to take advantage of components

7

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:34,320
and data binding to make it a better app.
