1

00:00:01,210  -->  00:00:04,810
All the first thing you can do and for that I'm animating this.

2

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:10,140
Excuse me I'm commenting on this out if you want to use the same timing.

3

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:16,060
You don't have to duplicate is and simply write highlighted to normal here.

4

00:00:16,620  -->  00:00:21,270
Instead you can use one line and simply make an arrow point in both directions.

5

00:00:21,270  -->  00:00:24,840
Now this means back and forth use the same animate function.

6

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:30,360
So in this case use the three hundred milliseconds which now means we have the same timing.

7

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:31,970
That's one thing.

8

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:39,210
But also you might have a more complex animation where you want to control the styling this has during

9

00:00:39,210  -->  00:00:39,790
the movement.

10

00:00:39,860  -->  00:00:44,100
So not the beginning and not the end state only during the transition.

11

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:50,040
You might have some extra styles at this place or at this point of time too well to simulate this.

12

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:57,150
Let me copy this trigger here so that we keep the simple one two and I will name it wild state because

13

00:00:57,150  -->  00:00:58,770
it's getting more wild now.

14

00:00:59,040  -->  00:01:02,220
So the wild state should now be applied to a new.

15

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:06,780
I'm copying here Q which is now bound to that new wall state.

16

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:09,220
It still uses my state property.

17

00:01:09,240  -->  00:01:13,480
Don't get me wrong but here it now uses the wildside.

18

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:17,660
Now with that I'm handing it to the wall state animation trigger.

19

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:26,580
I also want to set up a new property I'll name it wild state and therefore here in my component of duplicate

20

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:32,310
normal and set this to wild state so that I have two different dates where we can see two different

21

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:34,160
things.

22

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:38,310
Now how does wild state work or how do you want to control this.

23

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:43,620
Well I still want to have my normal and my highlighted style and I will leave to styling I have here

24

00:01:44,100  -->  00:01:46,450
but I want to set up a third state.

25

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:49,130
This is the srong state let's say.

26

00:01:49,130  -->  00:01:56,490
So I'm able to shrink this square the background color let's say should then be green and we transform

27

00:01:56,490  -->  00:01:57,680
it such dead.

28

00:01:57,840  -->  00:02:09,150
We want to translate it 100 pixels but we want to scale it to zero point five let's say and no let's

29

00:02:09,150  -->  00:02:15,690
actually translated 0 pixels so at the starting point therefore in the average You state you want to

30

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:16,830
scale it to 1.

31

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:20,650
So that's again normalcy is a set up here.

32

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:23,540
And with that we set up the different states.

33

00:02:23,560  -->  00:02:32,340
Now when I go back to where the two directions highlighted two normal and normal two highlighted have

34

00:02:32,340  -->  00:02:35,340
different durations like we had before.

35

00:02:35,580  -->  00:02:39,420
So like this you have just commented this out anyways.

36

00:02:39,900  -->  00:02:48,090
Now i also an injustice and also hook up is on Szeryng method here does shrink button.

37

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:59,100
So on shrink show now I assigned this wild state to be shrunken that is that third stage set up appear

38

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:02,500
shrunken in on any mate.

39

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:08,700
I therefore also want to set this wild state equal to or for us compare it.

40

00:03:08,700  -->  00:03:13,560
If it's equal to normal and if not well I basically want to do the same as year.

41

00:03:13,560  -->  00:03:16,980
So let me quickly capitis and replace this.

42

00:03:17,010  -->  00:03:24,370
So you're I'm not using the shrunken state that's something I'm only setting here now with this set

43

00:03:24,370  -->  00:03:33,510
up I can of course reload my application and once it does reload we should see a new square below the

44

00:03:33,510  -->  00:03:41,640
first one or maybe let's introduce a little divider here like a line break so that we can clearly see

45

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:44,070
the difference and now if it like animate.

46

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:51,330
They both move with different speeds of course because it changes but shrinking still happens instantly

47

00:03:51,330  -->  00:03:51,710
.

48

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:54,420
So shrinking is not really animated.

49

00:03:54,420  -->  00:03:56,540
And that is something I want to change.

50

00:03:56,940  -->  00:04:02,850
So back in the up component we basically need a forward transition because we're only targeting normal

51

00:04:02,850  -->  00:04:07,430
and highlighted and we're not using shrunk now to do that.

52

00:04:07,470  -->  00:04:15,180
I can use the fallings transitional where a transition from an to shrunk and now from anywhere.

53

00:04:15,180  -->  00:04:21,260
So I don't care if I have normal or highlighted no matter which of the both states it is.

54

00:04:21,270  -->  00:04:23,430
I want to play the same animation.

55

00:04:23,700  -->  00:04:27,110
And for that I can use the wildcard character which means any state.

56

00:04:27,210  -->  00:04:34,630
So shrunken to any state and shrunken from any state should play the same animation here for now.

57

00:04:34,650  -->  00:04:41,090
And we made it over 500 milliseconds so that we can see something before I then find this.

58

00:04:41,130  -->  00:04:46,200
So after reloading this find our shrink get you see shrink down.

59

00:04:46,350  -->  00:04:52,290
And if I animate you now see it switch and animate correctly.

60

00:04:52,290  -->  00:04:57,050
So now we are animating days and the wildcard character here is the key to all.

61

00:04:57,050  -->  00:05:03,240
Give us the flexibility that we don't manually have to specify any possible state and an application

62

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:05,530
where you maybe derive a state dynamically.

63

00:05:05,550  -->  00:05:08,300
You might really not know which states it could have.

64

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:11,260
And they're the wildcard character is what you need.

65

00:05:11,460  -->  00:05:18,180
Now in the next few I want to dive in how to manipulate this animate function and have some in-between

66

00:05:18,210  -->  00:05:19,860
styles during the animation
