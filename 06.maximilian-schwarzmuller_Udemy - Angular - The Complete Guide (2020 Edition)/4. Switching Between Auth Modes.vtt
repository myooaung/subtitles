00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.050
In order to switch between login and sign up, in the auth component, we need to manage the currently active

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.970
mode and therefore you could for example add a property, isLoginMode but you can name this whatever

3
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.550
you want. In the end, the idea here is that you store if the user is currently in login or in sign up

4
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.220
mode and you adjust the user interface but also what you do in the form gets submitted dynamically based

5
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.210
on that property.

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.430
So initially, that could be true and then I will add a method, on switch mode, which we can call from our

7
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.950
user interface to change that property,

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.170
this allows us to dynamically change what's on the user interface upon an event triggered by the user

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.560
by using that helper property,

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540
a pattern we used many times throughout the course already.

11
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.240
So in here, we can set isLoginMode to false but that's actually not what I want to do,

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.620
instead the idea here is that we change it to the opposite of what it was before

13
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.080
and for that, we can use a handy shortcut,

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.780
we can change it to not

15
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.780
this isLoginMode.

16
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.570
Whilst this might look strange at first, this simply reverses the value.

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.810
If this previously stored true, then not true will be false and therefore we now store false,

18
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.430
if this stored false, then not false will be true and we now store true,

19
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.530
that's the idea.

20
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.860
Now we just have to connect on switch mode

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.280
and this isLogin property in our template.

22
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.960
Now I want to switch the mode when we click that button here at the bottom.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.160
So here upon a click, we can call on switch mode,

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.910
that's the idea

25
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.680
because that should be our trigger for switching the mode

26
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.990
but now of course we also need to adjust the user interface based on the mode we are in.

27
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.760
The form inputs we show shouldn't change let's say but the button labels certainly should.

28
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.160
Here for example, we'll not always show sign up but instead we can use string interpolation to show a

29
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.690
dynamic text.

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.140
We can check isLoginMode which is the property we just added

31
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.200
and if that is true, we know we are in login mode,

32
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.040
so this button which is there to submit the form, should actually display login as a text

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.270
and don't forget the single quotes here to really output text in there because you're in the string

34
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.210
interpolation syntax, hence everything in there is interpreted as Javascript code.

35
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.550
The alternative and this is a ternary expression here with the question mark,

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.270
then the code we want to execute if this condition is true and then a colon and then the code we want

37
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.790
to execute if that condition is not true.

38
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.190
So if that is not true, then we are not in logging mode and therefore, I want to output sign up because

39
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.630
if we're not in logging mode, we are in sign up mode. A side note by the way, as I just said, this button

40
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.610
should submit the form,

41
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.500
so we should change it to type submit. The other button here which switches modes should be changed to

42
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.130
type button so that it doesn't submit that form here

43
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.140
because if you don't set a type, clicking that button which is inside of the form will actually submit

44
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.450
it

45
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.150
and therefore if Angular doesn't step in, it will send an unnecessary HTTP request into the void

46
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.300
and even if Angular steps in and prevents this submission, it will trigger the form submission in Angular

47
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.000
nonetheless

48
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.640
and we certainly don't want to do that for this button, only for the first one.

49
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.720
So now we have that first button changed, the second button here,

50
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.210
this text of course also has to change based on the mode we're in because if we are in login mode,

51
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.410
then we can switch to sign up mode.

52
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.930
So in that case that we are in login mode, we want to say switch to sign up,

53
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.560
if we're not in login mode, then we are in sign up mode

54
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.080
and then here, we should say switch to login because that is the mode we can switch to.

55
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.780
If you now save this and have a look,

56
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.270
if I click this button now, indeed correctly our user interface changes.

57
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.090
So this is working and that's our first important step,

58
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.010
the next important step is of course that we handle the form input here.
