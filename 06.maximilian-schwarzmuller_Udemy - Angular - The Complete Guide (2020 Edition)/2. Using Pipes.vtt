00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.150
I get a little example project set up here and you can find it attached to this video.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.120
Now the code responsible for what you saw here on the screen is basically this app component template

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.560
where I output a list of servers and the servers are stored here in my app.component.ts file,

4
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.270
I got the servers array which simply holds a couple of Javascript object, each representing a server and then

5
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.060
at the bottom here, I got a little helper class which simply retrieves the right CSS classes which should be

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.050
attached to that list group item depending on the state of the server,

7
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.110
if it's stable or offline.

8
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.820
So this is the project we're starting with,

9
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.000
it looks all right but we get a couple of things we could fix here.

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.750
Now for example, we get a server name which looks all right to me but then we get this instance type

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
here, medium, large, small and we get the state.

12
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.990
Now you could for example put this instance type to be all uppercase and the date,

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.660
I'd like to change something about the state too

14
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.340
but let's start with the instance type, medium, large, small here to see how to use pipes and you will

15
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.970
see it's actually pretty simple. To change it,

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.650
we have to go to the template, to the HTML file because remember, a pipe is only responsible for transforming

17
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.340
the output,

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.150
so the right place to use it logically is the template.

19
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.940
Now here, I want to change this server instance type thing here.

20
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.760
I'll just bring it into a new line here

21
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.850
and the same for server started just to make it a bit easier to read

22
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.320
and now I would like this server instance type to be uppercase.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.740
Now that's easy to achieve,

24
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.290
we just add the pipe symbol, hence the name, pipes and then the name of the pipe

25
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.400
and as mentioned before, there are a couple of built-in pipes and you can also build pipes on your own,

26
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.690
we will have a look at this in one of the next lectures.

27
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.420
Now a good built-in pipe for making this all uppercase of course is the uppercase pipe you saw in the

28
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.690
slide before. With that added, you

29
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.310
now see if you save this and go back to your webpage, that all the instance types here have been converted

30
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.570
to be uppercase.

31
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.590
So without changing anything else, without and that's important, changing the property itself, here

32
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.700
the instance types are still lowercase, without changing anything here,

33
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.490
we change the way users can view it simply by adding a pipe here.

34
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.950
That looks pretty good to me,

35
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.810
now let's move on to the date and for this, we get another pipe we could use.

36
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.540
So if we have a look at the HTML code here, the server started output here is responsible for rendering

37
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.280
the date,

38
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.100
well if we add the pipe symbol here too, we could add the date pipe, another built-in type and I will

39
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.700
come back to where you find those built-in pipes in a second.

40
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.890
Now with this added, let's save this and now you see out of the box,

41
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.690
this looks much nicer but it might not be the way you want it to look.

42
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.960
So let's learn more about how to configure pipes in the next video.
