00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:05,840
So in the last lecture, we try to improve our application a bit more

2

00:00:05,860  -->  00:00:11,770
but the issue is our query parameters are gone whenever we navigate away from our single

3

00:00:11,770  -->  00:00:18,400
server component, to the edit server component for example. So we want to preserve them because we already set

4

00:00:18,400  -->  00:00:22,180
this information at the point of time we visit a single server,

5

00:00:22,180  -->  00:00:27,910
now we want to preserve this information once we navigate one step further to the edit server component.

6

00:00:28,840  -->  00:00:30,970
To preserve that information,

7

00:00:30,970  -->  00:00:38,140
we get a simple way of doing so. In the server component where we navigate, we can pass another property

8

00:00:38,140  -->  00:00:44,560
or add another property to this Javascript object we use to configure our navigation

9

00:00:44,560  -->  00:00:49,140
and here, we get the query params handling property.

10

00:00:49,540  -->  00:00:57,760
Now query params handling takes a string as a value and this could be merge, to merge our old query params

11

00:00:57,820  -->  00:01:02,420
with any new we might add here. Now we don't add any new ones,

12

00:01:02,560  -->  00:01:09,340
so we can simply choose preserve instead and preserve which will overwrite the default behavior which

13

00:01:09,340  -->  00:01:14,300
is to simply drop them and make sure that the old ones are kept.

14

00:01:14,320  -->  00:01:18,580
Now if we were to add new ones here, the old ones would actually overwrite the new ones,

15

00:01:18,610  -->  00:01:20,480
so we should use merge in this case

16

00:01:20,680  -->  00:01:26,520
but since we don't add new ones, preserve should make sure that we don't lose them.

17

00:01:26,530  -->  00:01:32,680
So now if we click on this again and click edit server, now you'll see allowEdit equal to zero is

18

00:01:32,680  -->  00:01:39,250
still set and therefore on the dev server where it is set to 1 if we click edit server, we do see the edit

19

00:01:39,250  -->  00:01:40,270
menu again.

20

00:01:40,300  -->  00:01:46,290
So query params handling here, super important, super useful to know to make sure you don't lose the

21

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:48,260
information you had before.
