00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.190
So with all four forms of data binding covered

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.400
now, let's finish our little demo app for now.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.210
We get the server name and this is live updated

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.920
whilst we type due to two-way data binding in place here. I will comment out this server name here, instead

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.560
I want to display the server name

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.520
once we clicked this add server button.

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.030
So once we create the server, we should not only say server was created but also name this and then simply

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.360
add this server name, like this.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.320
So now with this in place, we're now using the data we're changing through two-way data binding or if we chose to do

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.600
so, through one-way data binding if we use the other approach which is currently commented out and with

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.780
this in place, now you can see that if I change the server name like this and click add server, we see

12
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.100
server was created, name is Testserver 2.

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.260
With that, we're using all four forms of data binding together with each other, event binding to listen

14
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.070
to the click, string interpolation to output the data

15
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.680
here, property binding to enable this button in the first place after two seconds and two-way binding

16
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.720
to fetch our input data.

17
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.730
So with that, we're pretty advanced into the basics of Angular,

18
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.760
we use components, we know how they work in general,

19
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.430
we use how to communicate with our templates from our TypeScript code and in the other direction.

20
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.300
Now there is one more basic feature we have to cover to really be able to build first little applications

21
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.130
before we then can dive deeper into the individual building blocks.

22
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.450
So let's have a look at this next feature soon, directives, before that, time to practice data binding though.
