00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:05,880
Welcome to a new model for this course we learned a lot about English too.

2

00:00:05,970  -->  00:00:11,440
But the one thing we haven't covered is testing unit tests to be precise.

3

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:17,340
While the reason for this is that I really wanted to focus on the angle to code and not confuse people

4

00:00:17,340  -->  00:00:21,220
with mixing in some non-English to testing code.

5

00:00:21,450  -->  00:00:23,710
That being said testing is something.

6

00:00:23,840  -->  00:00:24,130
Wait.

7

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:29,790
A lot of people might want to do in their project which actually improves your project and hence I will

8

00:00:29,790  -->  00:00:36,570
give you an introduction this module and that is important and introduction you will learn how you can

9

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:38,650
write your task to have the Angua Seelye.

10

00:00:38,670  -->  00:00:41,850
You will also find resources for non-C like projects.

11

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:48,300
You will learn how a task generally works and why you might want to test and which tasks and utilities

12

00:00:48,550  -->  00:00:49,830
to office you.

13

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:53,760
I will give you or it will explain some example tests.

14

00:00:53,760  -->  00:01:00,750
For example we will test a basic component a service and a pipe but thereafter it's really up to you

15

00:01:00,810  -->  00:01:08,190
to use the resources I also provide to dive deeper into it because testing alone won't be enough content

16

00:01:08,190  -->  00:01:13,620
for let's say a 15 hour course and it's not what this course is about and it's not what discourse should

17

00:01:13,620  -->  00:01:14,450
be about.

18

00:01:14,670  -->  00:01:15,440
But with.

19

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:16,290
Let's dive in
