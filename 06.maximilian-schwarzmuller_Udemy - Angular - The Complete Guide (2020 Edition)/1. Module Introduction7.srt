00:00:02,660  -->  00:00:06,410
Welcome to another course module, welcome to this course module.

2

00:00:06,650  -->  00:00:14,100
We already learned a lot about Angular and thus far, we really built a single page application.

3

00:00:14,120  -->  00:00:18,330
We use directives and so on to change portions of this page

4

00:00:18,500  -->  00:00:21,410
but in the end, we always were on the same page,

5

00:00:21,470  -->  00:00:27,540
if you looked at the URL at the top, it was always localhost:4200.

6

00:00:27,860  -->  00:00:33,470
Now what if you wanted to have a page where you actually display several pages, like you have a

7

00:00:33,470  -->  00:00:36,650
/users or a /accounts page?

8

00:00:36,650  -->  00:00:42,380
Now you might think that for this, you indeed need multiple pages, multiple index.html files or

9

00:00:42,380  -->  00:00:43,460
something like this

10

00:00:43,610  -->  00:00:50,180
but you don't, Angular ships with its own router which allows you to change the

11

00:00:50,360  -->  00:00:59,260
URL in the URL bar and still only use one page but then exchange major parts or a lot of parts of

12

00:00:59,270  -->  00:01:05,490
that page, so that to the user, it really looks like a new page was loaded because maybe only the header

13

00:01:05,510  -->  00:01:13,550
is the same but behind the scenes, it is still Javascript changing a lot of parts in your DOM, in

14

00:01:13,550  -->  00:01:19,730
your page, making it look like a new page was rendered but you're still in the Angular world in your

15

00:01:19,790  -->  00:01:21,890
single page application.

16

00:01:21,890  -->  00:01:23,240
Let's take a closer look

17

00:01:23,300  -->  00:01:24,200
in this module.
