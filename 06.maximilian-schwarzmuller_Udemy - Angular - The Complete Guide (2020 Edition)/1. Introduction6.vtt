00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome back to the recipe project.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.420
We already added a lot of features to it,

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.040
now it's time to add services to it which will give us the possibility to greatly enhance this project.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.370
Which services do we need?

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.060
Let's have a look at our application again,

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.170
this is the application the way it looks right now.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.890
Now services allow us to centralize tasks, manage data in a central place and so on.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
So we probably need a service for both feature areas, we will need a shopping list service and a recipe

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.930
service. The shopping list service managing our shopping list and we will also access it from the

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.890
recipe, from the recipe area because we want to add items to the shopping list from there

11
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.080
and well the recipe service, that will be responsible for managing our recipe, managing the data there

12
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.120
and so on.

13
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.420
So we'll use both services

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.260
and as always, the challenge for you, create both services. For now only create the files and try to find

15
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.860
places in our app structure where they just fit in

16
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.960
and thereafter, we will fill them with some life together.

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
So let's start together in the next section, try to create these files on your own.
