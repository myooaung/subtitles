1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,120
We of course added navigation to our page

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,960
but one issue is that

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,290
whilst it does work fine, we get no visual indication of what the currently active route is.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,150
It would be nice if the selected tab would change and that of course is only a CSS thing because

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,730
if you check your app component here, you'll see we get this active class on the list item which determines

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,880
whether this is marked as active

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:35,670
if this link gets the right CSS classes or not. So it would be nice if we could dynamically

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,910
set this class.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,730
I will remove it from here and how can we now set it dynamically? Angular gives us a specific

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,470
directive for this,

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,470
the routerLink active directive and the convenient thing about this directive is, you can add it to a

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,060
wrapping element, like we do here, to the list item or also of course to the link itself

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,170
and it will attach the class you specify in between here, for example active,

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,350
so this should be a string, to that element

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,530
it sits on. Now active on the link itself wouldn't do anything

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,310
when using Bootstrap, here for these tabs look we need to add it to the list item

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,700
but this of course depends on which package or which CSS code you are using

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,320
and here you could specify any class you want,

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,310
like my active class or whatever that is.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,910
So here, it is active to make it look nice in Bootstrap's world and I will add it to all my links

21
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,490
here.

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,700
So now theoretically, all my links should receive this active CSS class once they are clicked or when

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,360
they are active.

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,160
So if we have a look at this, it seems to work because we still have homes set as our active page, even

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,880
though we remove this class, this active class we had there before. If I click servers, it gets marked as

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,720
active too

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,940
and the same for users, so this works but somehow, home is always marked as active.

28
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,790
So that does not seem to work correctly,

29
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,050
what's wrong here?

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,880
Well the routerLink active directive does one thing,

31
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,150
it analyzes your currently loaded path and then checks which links lead to a route which uses this path

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,960
and by default, it marks an element as active, it marks this

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:40,710
CSS class if it contains the path you are on or if this link is part of the path which is currently

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,460
loaded.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,270
So for the /servers link or the /users link,

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:52,380
this is of course the case once we click servers or users. For the slash nothing link, which is the first

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,690
one, the home page,

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,410
this is always the case,

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,610
we always have slash nothing at the beginning of our path here,

40
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,480
so if we are on /users, well there is this empty path in-between you could say, the same for servers

41
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,900
and the same for just home of course.

42
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,040
So the empty path segment is part of all paths,

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,170
still we don't want to have the home being marked as active all the time.

44
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,560
So to fix this, we can add some configuration to this routerLink active directive and I will split this

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:33,620
up all over multiple lines to make this a bit easier to read. So we can add a special configuration to

46
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,930
our routerLink active directive,

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:44,470
so on the same element as routerLink active was added to, we can add routerLink active options

48
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,220
and this now needs some property binding because we don't just pass a string there,

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,850
instead we pass a Javascript object and that would not work without having our square brackets.

50
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,850
So with square brackets, we can pass anything which will be resolved dynamically, like this Javascript

51
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,820
object

52
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:12,480
and here, we can basically add one important configuration, say exact and set this to true. So exact is

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,070
a kind of a reserved property on this object you passed to routerLink active options

54
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,760
and this will now basically tell Angular only add this routerLink active class,

55
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,390
so this active CSS class in this case,

56
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,830
if the exact, the full path is well whatever does link leads to,

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,000
so only if everything is just slash and not if it is only part of the path. So with this in place,

58
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,040
now you see it still is marked as active on the empty path, at the starting page but if you go to

59
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,820
/servers, now only servers is marked as active because now we fixed this, we change the default behavior

60
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,220
to make sure we only mark this if the full path is whatever we have on our routerLink.
