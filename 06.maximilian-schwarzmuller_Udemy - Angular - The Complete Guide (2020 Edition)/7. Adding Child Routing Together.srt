00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,170
So were you successful?

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,090
Here is my solution.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:14,110
As I said, I want to implement child routes, so I will do this by going to the AppRoutingModule here

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,080
and on my recipes, I'll add the children property.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:26,040
Now children also takes an array of routes and each route still is just a Javascript object, here

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:33,410
the first route I want to have is the empty path so that we just visit /recipes/,

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:40,600
the default case. Here I want to load that new component I was referring to which will simply hold the

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,210
text we have in this ng-template for now.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,410
Now for this, I will quickly create this component and I'll use the CLI

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:55,450
for that, with ng g c I can generate a new component and this component should now go into the

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,140
recipes folder, so recipes and then slash

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,780
and here, you may simply choose that folder,

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:11,420
so recipes and I will name it recipe-start, so the recipe-start component, with spec false I prevent

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,020
this spec file from being generated.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,310
So with that, we got our recipe-start component here

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,860
and as I mentioned before, all I will do is I will output here, maybe in a h3 tag now,

17
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,540
please select a recipe,

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,310
so really simple. With that set up, with our start component set up here,

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,060
I now want to use that,

20
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,440
it has been added to app module automatically by the CLI

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,700
so make sure that this is the case

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,110
and now in the AppRoutingModule here, I will load this component, 

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,770
so the recipe-start component,

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,830
this one here.

25
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,890
Make sure to add the import at the top from 

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,530
./recipes/recipe-start/recipe-start.component

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,930
and with that added, we got our first component which can be displayed inside of our recipes component.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,030
Let's try this out because that should be all we need to get started with it. In the recipes component because

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,880
again this is and that's important,

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,570
this is the component, the recipe component here is the component where our child routes are registered.

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,470
So it is in this components template that we need to provide a router outlet for the child routes to

32
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,460
be rendered.

33
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,400
So I will do this here.

34
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,710
I will add a router outlet here and when I save this with ng serve running, this looks pretty good,

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,710
we see please select a recipe and clearly that is not a paragraph anymore, so it seems to be our new component.

36
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,420
Of course if we click somewhere, that doesn't work anymore because we only have the router outlet there,

37
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,320
our old logic of loading a recipe is completely broken

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,390
but we will restore it soon.

39
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,210
Actually we can already take the first step for restoring that functionality,

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,820
I'll add another path here to the child routes of recipe component.

41
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:10,050
That path should be :id, so a dynamic segment added after /recipes,

42
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,250
that's of course something you have to keep in mind.

43
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,100
All child routes always come after the path of the parent route,

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:25,600
so all these routes here will have /recipes in front of it. So at /recipes/id with

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:38,390
ID being a dynamic parameter, here I want to load my recipe-detail component.

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,830
We also need to add the import to that component

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,820
up here of course,

48
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,970
so from the recipes folder, then recipe detail and then the recipe-detail component file. With that,

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,250
we now at least have a route which would allow us to load this component and we can kind of see this

50
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,010
in action if we manually enter one here

51
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,570
let's say. It tries to load the recipe-detail component,

52
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,740
of course it will break because there we try to output data which we no longer get because our old logic

53
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,530
of transferring data from the list item to the detail component doesn't work anymore

54
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,640
but we will fix it and we'll actually start fixing it in the next lecture.
