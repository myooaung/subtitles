00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.140
So we split our app into at least two modules or if you count the routing modules, into four modules.

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.900
Before we split it even more and we also learn about different types of modules we could add,

3
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.130
let me dive into one important note about components we load via routing, like here,

4
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.560
the recipes component. The recipes component is loaded whenever we visit /recipes.

5
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
The recipes component is also declared here in the recipes module.

6
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.740
Let me remove that declaration and that export here and let's see if the app still works thereafter,

7
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.320
it doesn't.

8
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.720
Now we get that the component, recipes component is not part of any NgModule. So it's really important

9
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.960
to understand that you don't just add to declarations what you plan on using as a template but you also

10
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.710
have to add any routes here that you load via routing, so via routing config.

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.250
It's not enough to just point at it here,

12
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.240
you really just also need to have it here in declarations.

13
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.200
The other important thing I wanted to highlight is that now that we manage the loading of our components,

14
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.040
here with recipes routing, we do define which component should be loaded for which route, there is no reason

15
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.520
to still export all these recipe components because we're now only using them internally in the recipes

16
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.660
module. We're using them either embedded into other components here or by loading them through the recipes routing

17
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.140
module, both is part of this file. So there is no reason to export the recipe components anymore because

18
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.480
we're not using these recipe components in the app component or any child component of the app component

19
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.710
and therefore as you can see if we reload and rebuild everything, this app still works as before even

20
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.620
if I don't export all the recipe components anymore.
