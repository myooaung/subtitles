1

00:00:02,570  -->  00:00:07,000
Time to practice the things we learned thus far in our course project.

2

00:00:07,040  -->  00:00:09,940
Now what is our course project?

3

00:00:09,980  -->  00:00:15,230
My goal in this project which we will build throuhout the course, to which we will come back after the individual

4

00:00:15,230  -->  00:00:20,470
sections of this course, is to build a recipe book and shopping list app,

5

00:00:20,510  -->  00:00:23,330
you saw it in the intro video of the course.

6

00:00:23,360  -->  00:00:28,070
Basically there, we're going to have two sections, shopping list and recipe book and we will be able to

7

00:00:28,070  -->  00:00:34,760
manage our recipes, view them in detail and also to manage our shopping list and even push ingredients

8

00:00:34,760  -->  00:00:37,400
from a recipe directly to the shopping list.

9

00:00:37,430  -->  00:00:42,380
This application will use a lot of the features we learned throughout the course and therefore I think it's

10

00:00:42,380  -->  00:00:47,000
perfect to practice these things and see them come together in a real app.

11

00:00:47,000  -->  00:00:52,820
First of all though, let's try to plan the application because before creating the app, you of course need

12

00:00:52,820  -->  00:00:58,820
to have a plan and therefore in the next lecture, we're going to think about which components we will

13

00:00:58,820  -->  00:01:02,310
need for the different features of this application.
