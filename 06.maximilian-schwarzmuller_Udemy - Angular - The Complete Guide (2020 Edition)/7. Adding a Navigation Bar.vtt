00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.650
So we added all the components we created to our templates,

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.700
now let's fine tune them and add the real content

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.190
we want to have there, starting in the header.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.450
Of course I don't want to have this h1 tag here,

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.890
instead I will use a couple of Bootstrap classes to create a nice looking header. So I'll create a wrapping

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.810
nav element and on this element, I'll add the navbar class and the navbar-default.

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.140
Again, these are just Bootstrap classes which will give me this default Bootstrap header. In there,

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.890
I'll place a container-fluid div to have my own view container basically in there and the first thing

9
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.690
I want to have here is a header.

10
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.800
For that, we get the navbar header class

11
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.550
we can add to a div and in this div, I want to have a clickable header,

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.980
so I'll add an anchor tag pointing to hash

13
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.140
for now, we'll later of course add a route there once we learned how to do this and this should have

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.610
the class navbar-brand, to give this this brand-like text style,

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:15.030
I'll say recipe book here since this is the name of our application. So that's the header part of our

16
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.850
header, so this main brand part,

17
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.730
now let's work on the actual links. For this,

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.200
I'll add a div which will receive the collaps class and then the navbar-collaps class.

19
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780
Now, I won't really use the collapse feature,

20
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.110
I won't add a hamburger

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.040
icon here since we will not have many links on our header anyways but this gives us some nice styles

22
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.080
and of course, collaps here should have an e at the end, like that.

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.330
So in here, I now want to have a group of list items, so a group of links in the end, this will be an unordered

24
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.030
list with the CSS classes, nav and then navbar-nav.

25
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.300
So make sure to create this unordered list with these classes and in there, if we add some list items,

26
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.180
they will actually sit next to each other, so they will automatically be positioned correctly by Bootstrap.

27
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.070
Each list item should hold a link,

28
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.510
so here I'll add an anchor tag, also pointing to just hash for now, one for the recipes section and

29
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.820
the second one for the shopping list section.

30
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.840
Now with that added, I'll add another area in my header here,

31
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.530
this will be another unordered list which will receive the classes, nav and now also navbar-nav

32
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.850
like before but then also navbar-right to position these links at the right and actually, this will

33
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.970
only be one link here which will receive a class of dropdown, this list item

34
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.910
will, because later, we will add our own directive which will turn this into a working dropdown where we

35
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.430
will then choose some options to store our data on a server, something we'll also implement later

36
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.000
in this course or fetch it from there.

37
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.260
So in the dropdown, I simply want to have my dropdown menu which when using Bootstrap is added by adding

38
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.720
an unordered list with the class dropdown-menu,

39
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.920
so this will hold the items this dropdown and here, I'll add a couple of list items which all hold some

40
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.390
links pointing to just hash for now, one for saving data

41
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.690
and one for fetching data. Again this will be filled with working code later.

42
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.000
So that's my header,

43
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.060
let's save it and see how it looks.

44
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.230
Looks ok,

45
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.050
I don't see my dropdown though,

46
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.680
the brand looks off,

47
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.650
so I'm not entirely happy with that.

48
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.590
Let's see what is wrong.

49
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.620
The brand is not working because that should be navbar, not have a h in between, so if you fix this, the

50
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.330
brand looks all right.

51
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.410
Now what's wrong with the dropdown?

52
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.350
Well the dropdown simply misses the link we would see to open the dropdown because this unordered

53
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.880
class here simply is the content of the dropdown, 

54
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.720
we of course also need a link to trigger it.

55
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.740
So let's add an anchor tag pointing to hashtag here

56
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.100
where I will say manage, just manage maybe, you could of course change that text and this should have

57
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.230
a class of dropdown-toggle because this will be the button toggling the dropdown in the end.

58
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.390
Therefore it will have a row of button to add some accessibility to this and also required for this to

59
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.860
work correctly though

60
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.860
and with this now if we save this, we see the dropdown. It would be nice to have a little arrow next

61
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.330
to it indicating that it is a dropdown.

62
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.730
So next to manage, I'll add a span with a class of caret which will give us this arrow pointing to the

63
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.360
bottom,

64
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.850
this arrow here and now we get a dropdown.

65
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.740
It won't work if we click it because we haven't added any code which would open the dropdown,

66
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.050
we will do this after the directives section though.

67
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.040
So the header is now working,

68
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.320
with that let's move on

69
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.170
and let's work on our recipes section.
