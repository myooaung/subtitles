1

00:00:01,650  -->  00:00:04,350
Thus far we only had starting an ending state.

2

00:00:04,350  -->  00:00:06,780
Now let's play around with the animate function.

3

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:13,830
We actually cannot only pastie the timing we can control the whole animation and define styles.

4

00:00:13,830  -->  00:00:16,710
The animation should take during the animation.

5

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:22,920
For that I will pass a second argument here which is the style never again we're already importing that

6

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:23,180
.

7

00:00:23,250  -->  00:00:28,250
And as I can define a style in a state I can also define a style during the animation.

8

00:00:28,410  -->  00:00:34,380
So year I also pass a challenge crypt object and that in-between style will now be taken during the

9

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:35,760
installation.

10

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:42,840
So here let's say I want to give as a border radius of 50 pixels.

11

00:00:42,840  -->  00:00:47,720
Now let's see how that looks if I save this with this extra style during the animation.

12

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:56,350
If I hit shrink you see it now looks kind of ugly because now we let these border radios or we let it

13

00:00:56,480  -->  00:00:57,700
well get around.

14

00:00:57,750  -->  00:01:01,570
But once it finishes it instantly jumps to the end state.

15

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:08,760
So this is not really what you want we want to smooth fully half this in between our animation and not

16

00:01:08,820  -->  00:01:15,750
any made the changing of the border radius and that instead of the chumped the end state to cater for

17

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:23,790
such needs we would replace this any made function here like this with an array.

18

00:01:23,810  -->  00:01:27,230
Now we can pass an array as the second argument to transition.

19

00:01:27,420  -->  00:01:34,350
And here we can also define starting and in between states during this transition.

20

00:01:34,410  -->  00:01:46,860
So we could pass a style here and say background background color Shelby orange it would be one thing

21

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:48,150
.

22

00:01:48,160  -->  00:01:54,120
Thereafter the second element in disarray would be an animated function which takes let's say one second

23

00:01:54,650  -->  00:02:03,450
where I want to animate my border radius ask before border radius 50 pixels and now to avoid this ugly

24

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:06,150
jump at the end I add a number.

25

00:02:06,150  -->  00:02:11,730
Any made function of half a second which will be executed after the border radius has been changed.

26

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:17,530
Now with that we should instantly see a change to the background color to orange.

27

00:02:17,650  -->  00:02:24,090
Thereafter we should see the border radius developing over one second and thereafter we should see the

28

00:02:24,090  -->  00:02:29,690
animation of well half a second where we removed the border edges again.

29

00:02:29,940  -->  00:02:37,500
Shrink the object and turn it from orange back to our end state which is green for example if we do

30

00:02:37,500  -->  00:02:38,380
shrink it.

31

00:02:38,790  -->  00:02:45,450
Well let's see if I can shrink it What we do indeed see it turn orange see the border radius and thereafter

32

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:50,370
see a shrink and the border radius being removed and the same is true for any made back.

33

00:02:50,370  -->  00:02:55,140
So with that I get a more complex animation where a chain multiple styles.

34

00:02:55,200  -->  00:03:01,650
And while all this nesting here might look difficult it actually isn't it only is an array passed to

35

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:08,520
the transmission which allows us to define different phases in that transition starting phase.

36

00:03:08,550  -->  00:03:15,510
If no Any made method is used then it is instantly applied that if we do get any mate we do apply a

37

00:03:15,510  -->  00:03:22,110
style but over some time and if we have any made without a style this means basically now transition

38

00:03:22,140  -->  00:03:23,390
to the end state.

39

00:03:23,730  -->  00:03:29,060
And this is how we can set up our animation of course we could have multiple in-between styles.

40

00:03:29,310  -->  00:03:36,060
The important thing is that you do end with any made 500 or whatever timing you have to get smoothly

41

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:41,230
to the end state otherwise you will see what we had before that it instantly snaps back to your end

42

00:03:41,250  -->  00:03:41,680
state.

43

00:03:41,730  -->  00:03:44,140
Probably not what you want.

44

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:49,130
This is a more complex transition with the in between steps.

45

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:55,050
But I think still manageable if you really think about what's happening here with these different phases
