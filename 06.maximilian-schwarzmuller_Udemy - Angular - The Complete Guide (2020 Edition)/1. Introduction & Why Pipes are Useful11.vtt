00:00:02.770  -->  00:00:09.520
Welcome to a new course section. This course section is about pipes and let's start with the most important

2

00:00:09.520  -->  00:00:18.450
question first, what are pipes? Pipes are a feature built into Angular 2 which basically allows you to

3

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:21.230
transform output in your template.

4

00:00:21.230  -->  00:00:23.480
This is the main purpose of a pipe,

5

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:25.660
it transforms some output.

6

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:32.700
Now there are pipes for different types of output and also for synchronous and asynchronous data,

7

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:34.960
we will have a look at this throughout the course,

8

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:37.460
the general theme is always the same though.

9

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:39.880
A basic example would be the following,

10

00:00:39.960  -->  00:00:43.380
you have a username, that's a property in your component,

11

00:00:43.440  -->  00:00:47.210
for example here it holds a string, Max.

12

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:53.100
Now you want to output that username in your template and for this you probably use string interpolation

13

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:55.510
as you learned it throughout the course.

14

00:00:55.530  -->  00:01:02.050
Now that's all right but then you decide it would be nice if the output which is Max

15

00:01:02.070  -->  00:01:08.350
if you do it like this, would be all uppercase but only when you output it.

16

00:01:08.520  -->  00:01:14.880
So you don't want to change the property itself to uppercase because imagine you use that throughout your code

17

00:01:15.270  -->  00:01:18.970
and it should still be as you assigned it up there

18

00:01:19.290  -->  00:01:21.930
but you want to transform the way it is displayed

19

00:01:21.930  -->  00:01:24.130
once you render it to the screen.

20

00:01:24.540  -->  00:01:29.130
Now for this, you could use a pipe, namely the uppercase pipe,

21

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:35.160
this actually would be a built-in pipe and we will have a look at the built-in pipes in a second.

22

00:01:35.160  -->  00:01:43.470
Now with that built-in pipe in use, you would now see Max, all uppercase being printed to the screen

23

00:01:43.770  -->  00:01:45.840
because this is what this pipe does,

24

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:48.070
it transforms the value.

25

00:01:48.110  -->  00:01:52.110
Now that is the main purpose of pipes, transforming values,

26

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:54.370
let's dive into them a bit more,

27

00:01:54.480  -->  00:01:58.800
let's view some of the built-in pipes and then let's also build our own pipes.

28

00:01:58.860  -->  00:01:59.370
Let's go.
