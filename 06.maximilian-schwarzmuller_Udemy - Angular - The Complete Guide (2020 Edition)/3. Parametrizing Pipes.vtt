00:00:02.230  -->  00:00:09.020
In the last video, we added a couple of pipes, the uppercase pipe to transform the instance type and the

2

00:00:09.020  -->  00:00:11.170
date type to transform the type

3

00:00:11.210  -->  00:00:16.880
but as I mentioned at the end of the last video, it would be nice if we could configure a pipe because

4

00:00:17.240  -->  00:00:24.920
this layout here, this way of displaying the date might not be the layout, the format of the data you

5

00:00:24.920  -->  00:00:29.900
want to output. So it would be nice if we could parameterize a pipe

6

00:00:29.990  -->  00:00:37.430
and we can. For example on the date here, we can add a parameter to configure the pipe by adding a

7

00:00:37.430  -->  00:00:38.060
colon

8

00:00:38.090  -->  00:00:43.480
and this is the case for any pipe, you configure it, you pass a parameter to it by adding a colon,

9

00:00:43.490  -->  00:00:46.570
of course the pipe needs to be able to handle a parameter

10

00:00:46.580  -->  00:00:53.840
and again I will come back to where to find out how these pipes work or what the built-in pipes do,

11

00:00:53.840  -->  00:00:59.210
how they can be configured in a second. The date pipe can take a parameter and we simply add it

12

00:00:59.270  -->  00:01:00.760
after this colon.

13

00:01:00.980  -->  00:01:04.940
Now the date pipe expects to receive a string parameter,

14

00:01:04.970  -->  00:01:10.380
so let's pass a string and there, you basically set up the date.

15

00:01:10.400  -->  00:01:13.340
I'll come back to the options you have in a second,

16

00:01:13.340  -->  00:01:17.390
now for the moment let's just enter fullDate, camel case,

17

00:01:17.390  -->  00:01:18.890
so a capital D.

18

00:01:19.310  -->  00:01:27.100
Let's save this and go back to our application and you see, now we get a better formatted date.

19

00:01:27.170  -->  00:01:31.930
Now might still not be what you want but again I will come back to other options in a second,

20

00:01:31.940  -->  00:01:39.260
it is what I like to see here and this is how easy you can parameterize a pipe. You can pass parameters

21

00:01:39.470  -->  00:01:45.480
by simply adding a colon and then the parameter. As a side note, if you would have multiple parameters

22

00:01:45.500  -->  00:01:49.110
here, you simply separate them with additional colons.

23

00:01:49.130  -->  00:01:54.470
So the date pipe doesn't take an additional parameter but if it would, you could pass it by adding another

24

00:01:54.480  -->  00:01:57.110
colon and then the second parameter.

25

00:01:57.140  -->  00:02:03.320
Now with this basic functionality set, let's have a look at where you can learn more about the built-in

26

00:02:03.320  -->  00:02:06.530
pipes and how you can configure them.

27

00:02:06.740  -->  00:02:08.520
Let's dive into this in the next lecture.
