00:00:01.440  -->  00:00:06.810
High to wrap up this section we'll have a look at module's now.

2

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:14.240
Modularity is something that is supported by typescript and we will use modules a lot for the scores

3

00:00:14.340  -->  00:00:14.810
.

4

00:00:14.950  -->  00:00:17.310
This file is roughly.

5

00:00:17.340  -->  00:00:24.590
I only want to show you how we will basically tell typescript to a certain class or variable or what

6

00:00:24.590  -->  00:00:31.710
ever should be available outside of the file where it lives in by default if we don't have to export

7

00:00:31.710  -->  00:00:32.430
keyword.

8

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:37.930
We can only use this class inciters file by adding this export keyword.

9

00:00:38.070  -->  00:00:42.100
We're able to use it in Arafat's not in much leverage.

10

00:00:42.180  -->  00:00:43.710
We use an English shoe.

11

00:00:43.940  -->  00:00:50.610
It's all driven by the fact that we in this course use system just to load our javascript files in which

12

00:00:50.670  -->  00:00:52.470
are different parts live.

13

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:57.550
But we need to export key word for this to actually work correctly.

14

00:00:57.780  -->  00:01:04.000
And so that you're able to use a service which is an old file in a component which lives in a number

15

00:01:04.000  -->  00:01:11.550
of files so much hilarity is really about splitting up or code over several files and have that work

16

00:01:11.550  -->  00:01:18.930
together seamlessly through well through typescript and through a yes or our system lower tier system

17

00:01:18.930  -->  00:01:19.010
.

18

00:01:19.030  -->  00:01:21.040
Yes or no.

19

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:30.090
So through here you could of course talk more detail but you will work your way from this course.

20

00:01:30.210  -->  00:01:36.720
It's only important that you understand that we're exporting everything basically because we're not

21

00:01:36.720  -->  00:01:40.870
separating parts of our app in files which live on the road.

22

00:01:40.980  -->  00:01:44.710
But all these files need to be able to work together.

23

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:53.610
And therefore we're using expert keyword and this module driven approach to share the code basically

24

00:01:53.630  -->  00:01:54.340
.

25

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:00.200
So that was a real quick with you but that's just not recognized as x.

26

00:02:00.270  -->  00:02:08.220
The key word here was that this should be a basic introduction to typescript which should allow you

27

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:10.700
to follow this course smoothly.

28

00:02:11.130  -->  00:02:18.210
I guess if you feel that something is missing or that you want to dive deeper into a certain topic attached

29

00:02:18.220  -->  00:02:25.200
to this section you'll find the document with additional links leading to the very good handbook and

30

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:26.020
typescript.

31

00:02:26.130  -->  00:02:27.740
And of course you do not.

32

00:02:27.760  -->  00:02:35.220
I mean by the way which might allow you to get a deeper understanding see and our readers by
