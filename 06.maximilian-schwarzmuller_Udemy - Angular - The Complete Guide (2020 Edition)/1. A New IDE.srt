00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,080
One important note at this point, my IDE changed slightly here.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,220
The only reason for that is that I switched the IDE because I had to re-record these modules where you

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,720
see the new IDE, which does not mean that the other modules are old or outdated,

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,350
it just means these modules here needed an update to be up to the quality standards

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,350
I want to enforce and to teach you the latest of Angular. If you see videos with a different IDE, then

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,520
these videos still are perfectly fine,

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,610
that's the only reason for that change.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,100
I hope it's no big problem,

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,400
the project of course is exactly the same,

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,680
the folder structure is exactly the same,

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,320
you will only have some tiny visual changes.
