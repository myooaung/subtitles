1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,170
So we already reorganized our code quite a bit,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,190
what's remaining here in the app module is the auth component

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,260
and we also got a couple of imports here which we might not need

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,110
in the app component anymore because our app component already got pretty lean.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,420
Now the forms module is still required because the auth component needs it

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,490
but we can definitely drop the reactive forms module.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,090
We need the HttpClient module because it turns out that this is a module that only sets up some

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,230
global services, the injectable HTTP service and we need that,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,750
so we will keep that. We need the app routing module, we need the recipes and a shopping list module and

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,970
all these modules but the reactive forms module could be dropped

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,890
and I also want to drop the forms module and get rid of the auth component here because we can simply

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,460
create a new feature module for that.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,320
I analyzed at the start of this module that this is our third feature area and therefore, creating a

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,630
separate module would make sense. Again, definitely feel free to pause the video and try this on your own

15
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,970
here, outsource the auth component and its route into a separate feature module.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,420
Were you successful? To do it together here in the auth folder,

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,450
I'll add an auth.module.ts file and as before, export a class, auth module which receives our normal

18
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,500
@NgModule decorator.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,970
Now here, we as we learned, need to declare whatever we're using in this module and in the auth module,

20
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,280
that is the auth component.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,920
So let's cut the auth component from the app module and move it here into declarations of auth module.

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,990
Now for that of course, we also need to add the missing import.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,160
Now the auth component is using certain Angular features which we should import. We need the common module,

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,030
in case we're using ngIf or ngFor and you need to add the import to that as well.

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,430
We also need the forms module, because we're using the template driven forms approach here in the

26
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,570
auth component. That allows us now in the app module to get rid of that forms module.

27
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:32,690
Now we can also import, maybe here, our auth module and make sure to add that import path of course but

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,350
I also wanted to outsource my routes, so in the app routing module, let's grab that auth route here, remove

29
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,340
it from the app routing module and go to the auth module and in here, simply add router module which you

30
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,210
import from @angular/router and as you learned it, forChild and add this route and if you put this

31
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,970
into a separate routing file, into a separate routing module and import that separate routing module

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,420
into the auth module, that would have been correct as well.

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:11,090
So now I have my auth module, that focuses on all the auth related stuff. The auth service still is provided

34
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,710
like this

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,310
and if you would provide it in a module, you would still keep it in the app module to have it available

36
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,880
application-wide but other than that, this is looking good. Let's now save it all and see if that works

37
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,620
and I'm getting an error, the app loading spinner is missing in the auth component or in the auth module.

38
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,340
Now do you know what the issue is here?

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,570
Well, the app loading spinner, the loading spinner component is defined in our shared module and as I mentioned,

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,720
you only have access to what you declare in a module.

41
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,590
So if we need the loading spinner component in the auth module, we could add it to declarations but double

42
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,120
declarations are not allowed,

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,780
so declaring it here and in the shared module is not allowed.

44
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,930
Therefore the solution is to simply import the shared module to get access to its features

45
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,460
and now with that, everything seems to work.

46
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,700
If I now logout and I test the login flow again, first of all with invalid credentials, that works

47
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,570
and now with valid credentials, that also works.

48
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,000
So now we also outsourced the auth related things into their separate feature module.
