00:00:02,160  -->  00:00:08,100
In the last lecture, we added routing, we set up our routes for this application and we can load them

2

00:00:08,370  -->  00:00:13,990
but the links are not working as expected, so we should fix this. With our main routes set up,

3

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:19,650
we can go to the header component and here I want to change the way we navigate.

4

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:22,580
I no longer need the click listeners here

5

00:00:22,710  -->  00:00:29,700
and also I don't need ref elements, so we should remove that so that our app doesn't reload because right

6

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:34,170
now if you click the links, it will simply send a request to the server and reload the page.

7

00:00:34,170  -->  00:00:40,980
So I'll remove that and I can also remove the onSelect method here and remove the eventEmitter, the header

8

00:00:40,980  -->  00:00:41,570
component,

9

00:00:41,610  -->  00:00:48,520
so basically all that code, also the imports and now we can simply use routerLink

10

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:56,670
and here I want to create an absolute link to /recipes and for the shopping list, here I will

11

00:00:56,670  -->  00:01:00,560
create an absolute link to /shopping-list.

12

00:01:00,900  -->  00:01:06,330
And of course you could also use that alternative syntax taught in the last lectures, in the last course

13

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:13,530
section actually, where you would enclose routerLink into square brackets and then you would pass an array

14

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:18,370
between the double quotation marks here to configure the individual segments of your path.

15

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:23,920
But since here all I want is to go to these root routes, there is no need to do so

16

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:27,010
and that is the quickest way of setting up our paths here.

17

00:01:27,060  -->  00:01:33,030
So with that, if we save this we should already see that navigation is working again and it is, that's

18

00:01:33,030  -->  00:01:34,050
great

19

00:01:34,050  -->  00:01:37,180
but I also want to mark the active route here.

20

00:01:37,230  -->  00:01:39,740
So that's what I'll work on in the next lecture.
