1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:09,430
I'm back in my Firebase project and as with the normal HTTP requests, I really want to emphasize that

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,830
you of course don't need Firebase to add authentication to an Angular application.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,880
You can add it with any back-end, be that a REST or a GraphQL API. Your back-end just needs to offer

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,100
endpoints you can use to create new users and to log users in to get such a token

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,100
therefore. If your API supports that, and most APIs do and if you're creating your own API, you can of

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,730
course add your own auth logic, then you can use that API,

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,130
you don't need Firebase, I'm just using it because it's easy, free to use, doesn't require us to write

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,040
server-side code,

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,280
that's the only reason.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,870
And with that, let's go to the authentication page here and there,

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,200
we now have to set up a sign in method.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,790
Well actually before we do that, let's go to the database again and there,

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:06,730
let's go to rules and under rules, previously we unlocked this by setting read and write access to true for

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,290
everyone.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,660
This means that everyone can read our recipes, get our recipes and store recipes, everyone can interact

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,240
with our database here.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,860
Now this was required in the past because we had no authentication in place, since this is about to change

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,470
now, it's about to change these settings and therefore you should now change this to auth unequal null

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,300
here, for both read and write.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,800
This will tell Firebase that only authenticated users should be able to read and write data.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,140
Now of course if you were using Firebase for your project, you can set up more sophisticated rules for

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,770
different resources and the official Firebase docs are then the way to go. Here,

23
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:53,770
I want to lock down everything, my entire Firebase database if users are not authenticated. Publish these

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,250
rules to make sure they have an effect and what you will already notice

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:05,050
now with these changes, that if you go to recipes and you fetch data, you get an error here, a 401 error

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,790
that you're not authorized.

27
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,560
Now of course, we could handle that error in a better way by displaying a nice error message here or

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,290
anything like that but we won't even reach that page soon because we will lock down access to it in

29
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,170
our front-end to provide a good user experience and avoid that a user is able to visit a page where

30
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,950
he's not going to be able to do anything anyways.

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,260
So for now, we can go there and we can fail but soon this will change

32
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,130
but now, we need to go back to Firebase and enable authentication so that we can slowly add the logic

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,160
to be able to visit our authenticated routes again.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,300
So here under authentication on Firebase, click on setup sign in method and choose e-mail and password

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,800
and click enable here, only that top one. Now click save

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,050
and now you got that built-in Firebase authentication active where you can send requests to certain

37
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:06,250
endpoints offered by Firebase, to create users and to log users in and you'll then see your users here

38
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,640
under authentication in the users tab.

39
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,010
Now which endpoints are that though?

40
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,700
Let's start with signing users up.
