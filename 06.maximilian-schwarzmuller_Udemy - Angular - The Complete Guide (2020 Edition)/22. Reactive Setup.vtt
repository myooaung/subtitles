00:00:02.600  -->  00:00:09.050
Just like before, I already created a little template, a little HTML code for the form with which

2

00:00:09.050  -->  00:00:10.240
we're going to work,

3

00:00:10.430  -->  00:00:11.800
it looks like this

4

00:00:12.260  -->  00:00:14.910
and you can find it attached to this video.

5

00:00:15.260  -->  00:00:20.790
Now as I said, in the reactive approach, the form is created programmatically,

6

00:00:20.870  -->  00:00:22.450
so in TypeScript code,

7

00:00:22.490  -->  00:00:24.560
so this is where we should start working on it,

8

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:31.610
in this app component here, in this TypeScript file. Here I want to create a new property which will hold

9

00:00:31.610  -->  00:00:38.150
my form in the end and no worries, programmatically doesn't mean from scratch, Angular offers us a lot

10

00:00:38.150  -->  00:00:40.480
of tools to quickly create such a form.

11

00:00:40.670  -->  00:00:44.660
So I want to store it in a property which you may give any name you like, I'll name it

12

00:00:44.660  -->  00:00:53.840
signupForm and important, this will be of type FormGroup. Now I could auto-import but since it's important

13

00:00:53.860  -->  00:01:01.560
to understand, I'm going to import it manually this time, FormGroup needs to be imported from 

14

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:03.100
@angular/forms.

15

00:01:03.170  -->  00:01:08.790
This is the forms package as the name says and it contains a lot of classes

16

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:11.190
we will work with. In a template driven approach,

17

00:01:11.190  -->  00:01:14.190
we already imported ngForm from it,

18

00:01:14.190  -->  00:01:18.180
now ngForm was this automatically created wrapper

19

00:01:18.180  -->  00:01:25.050
you could say but it was wrapping a FormGroup in the end because in Angular, a form in the end is just

20

00:01:25.050  -->  00:01:26.730
a group of controls

21

00:01:26.850  -->  00:01:28.840
and this is what a form group holds.

22

00:01:28.890  -->  00:01:33.350
Therefore, the overall form also is just a form group.

23

00:01:33.350  -->  00:01:36.870
Now this is all, we don't need to set an initial value for now,

24

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:41.790
this gives us a property with which we can work which will hold our form in the end.

25

00:01:41.820  -->  00:01:48.540
Now important, for the reactive approach to work, especially later when we connect our programmatically

26

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:51.290
created form to our HTML code,

27

00:01:51.570  -->  00:01:54.510
you need to import something in app module.

28

00:01:54.690  -->  00:01:57.200
You don't need the forms module,

29

00:01:57.210  -->  00:02:00.430
this is required for the template driven approach,

30

00:02:00.780  -->  00:02:04.900
instead you need the reactive forms module,

31

00:02:04.920  -->  00:02:10.920
make sure to also import it up here from @angular/forms. So reactive forms module,

32

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:17.370
this is the module containing all the tools we need now to build our form on our own and then connect it

33

00:02:17.490  -->  00:02:19.130
to our HTML code.

34

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:24.050
So back in the template, in the next video, we're going to create the actual form.
