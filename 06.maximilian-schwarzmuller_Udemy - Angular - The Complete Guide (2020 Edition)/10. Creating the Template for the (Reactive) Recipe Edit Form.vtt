00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.630
In the last lectures, we edited our form using the template driven approach,

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.640
now let's move onto the reactive approach for the new recipe or editing an existing one.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.850
We got our recipe edit component here and it doesn't have a form inside of it, so we should definitely

4
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.840
change this. In here,

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.810
I will start by adding a row and then a column which should span the full width for all device sizes

6
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.080
and then the form, without an action because we don't want to send a request,

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.120
we want to handle it in Angular.

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.230
Now we will need a couple of inputs here,

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.480
I will actually begin with the save and cancel buttons though.

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.190
So right at the start of this form, I'll add another bootstrap row, col-xs-12 will be width

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.390
and here I want to have a button of type submit with a class of button and then btn-success, so that

12
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.450
it's a green button which should simply save the form, should save the recipe.

13
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.870
I'll have a second button of type button so that it doesn't submit the form which will be of or which

14
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.390
would get the class btn-danger, which should simply cancel the editing here.

15
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.710
So these are the two buttons which allow me to control the form in the end.

16
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.250
Now for the inputs, I definitely want a row with my default column width here, where I will add a div with

17
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.230
the form-group

18
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.470
CSS

19
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.440
class

20
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.460
to simply use that bootstrap CSS class to give it some nice styling, then I'll add a label for the

21
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:52.320
name of that recipe and I'll say name here and I will add the input, the input will be of type text with

22
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.580
the ID name maybe and let's already structure this over multiple lines and with a class of form-control,

23
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.820
to make it look nice.

24
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.780
Now I will actually copy that row and paste it in below this name, here

25
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.910
I want to have my imagePath, so I'll name it

26
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.500
ImageUrl here, this input and here I simply want the user to paste in the imagePath.

27
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.810
So that will be this row, below it I'll add another row, here

28
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.260
I won't have my FormGroup though,

29
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.600
instead I want to preview the image the user pasted in.

30
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.070
So I will simply add my image element here,

31
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.110
I will later bind the source and assign the image responsive class to it,

32
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.040
we will fine tune this later if needed.

33
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.060
So that allows the user to enter a title and an image and see that image as a preview.

34
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.190
Now I'll add another row with another label which should now say description,

35
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.800
so the description of our recipe or the content of the recipe, so I'll assign this for the ID description

36
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.520
which of course will be this but this will not be an input, I'll change it to a text area,

37
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.480
therefore I also need a closing tag for this. On this text area,

38
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.890
I want to provide let's say six rows for typing,

39
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.380
so that is not too big, not too small,

40
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.470
should be ok.

41
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.390
Well and then below this, I'll add yet another div,

42
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.680
this will later be required for the ingredients of that recipe here.

43
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.670
So here, we will actually need to create an array of controls and we will need to manage this,

44
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.580
we did learn how to do this but here, we will see it in practice in a real project.

45
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.160
Now here as this will be for my array of items, I will get rid of the label and get rid of the ID, also

46
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.220
get rid of that div here, instead

47
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.120
I will add a new row inside of there,

48
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.220
we're going to have multiple ingredients probably

49
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.220
and each row should then have a couple of columns.

50
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.020
The first one spanning almost the entire width,

51
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.960
it will hold the input for the name of the ingredient.

52
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.390
The second one being very narrow next to it which should hold the amount and the third one,

53
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.630
also a very small column, should hold a button which allows me to delete an ingredient,

54
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.440
therefore btn-danger and put an X on it.

55
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.420
So if you have a look at this, that is how a single ingredient will look like.

56
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.850
Now we don't have descriptions for these inputs,

57
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.280
you could of course restructure this form and try placing labels next to them or use a different layout,

58
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.680
I like that layout here though. With that, we got the HTML code

59
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.400
almost finished.

60
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.830
There is something missing but before we work on this, let's make this base form work without ingredients

61
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.020
for a start.
