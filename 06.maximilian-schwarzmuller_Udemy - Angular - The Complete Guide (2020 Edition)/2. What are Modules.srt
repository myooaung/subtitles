00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,450
What are modules?

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,960
And with that, I mean the Angular modules. You will also hear the term module where you are talking about

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,540
the imports you have in your files when you import something from another file into another

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,040
file,

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,360
that also is sometimes referred to as modules but these would be Javascript modules, they're totally

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,180
not related to Angular and they're not

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,000
what I mean.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,040
I mean that NgModule thing that we have in our app, like the app module or the app routing module.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,930
So modules in the end are ways of bundling Angular building blocks together,

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,250
that would be components, directives, services, pipes.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,990
You have to group that all together into such Angular modules so that Angular is aware of these features

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,280
because Angular doesn't automatically scan all the files in your project,

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:01,090
it doesn't search all the code you write and automatically detect all components and services,

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,480
instead you need to tell Angular what is a component, which components do you have and you can then bundle

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:14,980
them together into modules. Every Angular app needs to have at least one module, that app module,

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,090
you can't have an Angular app without it.

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:24,040
So Angular analyzes these NgModules to understand your application and its features, you use them

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,210
to define all the core building blocks - components, directives, services, pipes and so on and app as I just

19
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,410
mentioned requires at least to one such module, the app module

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,460
but you may split it into multiple modules and we will do that in this core section.

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,980
You also have core Angular features that are wrapped into modules, things like the forms module which

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,600
we added in the course already,

23
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:56,650
so Angular itself also provides certain features grouped together into such modules, so that you don't

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:03,400
have to declare like 10 different forms directives, instead that forms module gives you all these directives,

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,910
that is how you can think about that. And important also,

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,760
you can't use a certain feature or building block without including it in a module. How you include it

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,120
if you add it to declarations or providers depends on the feature you are talking about.

28
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,980
So let's have a look at our app module and what we're using thus far.
