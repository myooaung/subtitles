00:00:02.450  -->  00:00:06.090
In the last lecture, we learned something crucial,

2

00:00:06.090  -->  00:00:13.330
we learned how to bind to our own properties with @input parentheses in front of it,

3

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:15.330
super important.

4

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:18.460
Now you can even configure this a bit more,

5

00:00:18.660  -->  00:00:25.800
sometimes you don't want to use the same property outside of the component as you use inside of it.

6

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:30.540
So inside this component, you might say element is exactly the property name I want to use because it

7

00:00:30.540  -->  00:00:37.070
makes the most sense but outside, so here, you maybe don't want to bind to element,

8

00:00:37.320  -->  00:00:46.260
maybe you want to bind to srvElement to make it clear it's a server element, anything like that.

9

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:52.170
Now that would of course not work because now you would try to bind to a property, Angular doesn't know

10

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:53.620
that it would be bindable

11

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:59.980
because there is no server element property in this component with @input in front of it.

12

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:02.370
You can assign an alias,

13

00:01:02.370  -->  00:01:08.970
you can pass an argument to @input with the property name as you want to have it

14

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:11.010
outside of this component,

15

00:01:11.100  -->  00:01:15.860
so srvElement could be added here and now from the outside,

16

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:23.490
so from the component where you implement this component, you now have to target srvElement if you

17

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:27.630
want to bind to this property. Element will no longer work,

18

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:34.290
it has to be srvElement now which is why now with these two places changed in the app component and in

19

00:01:34.290  -->  00:01:40.400
the server element component, we see the same as before but now binding through the alias.

20

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:43.730
And just again to be really sure, to make this really clear,

21

00:01:43.800  -->  00:01:48.070
now you have to use srvElement, element will no longer work.

22

00:01:48.090  -->  00:01:54.750
So that's a little bonus, a little alternative in case you want to bind to some other property name outside

23

00:01:54.750  -->  00:01:55.640
of the component,

24

00:01:55.770  -->  00:01:57.480
this is how you assign an alias.
