1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:11,630
With all these changes made, we can now also get rid of the recipe service here and that means that in

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,610
the core

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,310
module, we no longer need and can't provide it, so we can clean that up

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:33,570
as well and I'm getting an error about my recipe detail component. The recipe detail components still

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,230
imports it and still injects it and still uses it here in on

6
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,680
add to shopping list and that is now the remaining thing where I don't want to use the recipe service

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,940
anymore because I deleted it anyways. Instead here the idea is now to import my shopping list actions

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:05,500
as shopping list actions from and now I go to the shopping list area of this application, to the store

9
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,280
there and then to the shopping list actions file because there, we do have an action for adding all ingredients, 

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,670
right.

11
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:21,250
So in here, we can now use the store dispatch and dispatch a new shopping list action and that would be

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,090
the add ingredients action which takes the ingredients as a payload and that would be the this recipe

13
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,650
ingredients data which I want to add

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,000
and with that, we fixed that. Now in the recipe-edit component, there I'm also still importing the recipe

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,950
service because I am still injecting it but we don't need it there anymore,

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,180
so here we can just remove it.

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,750
With that, everything compiled successfully and if we reload, that looks good, let's try adding these items

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,320
to the shopping list, this also works

19
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,020
and now we did some cleanup work and we're entirely in the NgRx world.
