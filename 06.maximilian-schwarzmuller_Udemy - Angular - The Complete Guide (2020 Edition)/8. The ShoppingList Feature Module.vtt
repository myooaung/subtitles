00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.040
So that was our first feature module, the recipes module.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.850
Now I want you to practice this a bit, take the shopping list here and create a feature module for that

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.270
as well.

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.960
You learned everything you need for that,

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.920
so definitely try on your own,

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.800
here's your chance to pause the video, after the pause,

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.880
we'll do it together.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.800
Were you successful?

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.830
Let's do it together

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.400
and for that in the shopping list folder, I'll create a shopping-list.module.ts file.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.340
Now in there, let's export this class, shopping list module

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.780
and as before,

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.070
let's add NgModule as a decorator there.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.020
Now NgModule needs to be imported from @angular/core, like this

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.070
and in NgModule, you now again have to declare what you're using in there and you have to export

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.050
what you're using elsewhere.

17
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.510
Now let's have a look at our app module,

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.060
what are we using that is related to the shopping list?

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.100
Well obviously, the shopping list and shopping edit components are used in the shopping list area. Therefore,

20
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.060
let's grab these two components and remove them from the app module,

21
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.310
let's also remove their imports here and let's instead move them here into our shopping list module.

22
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.540
There, let's add declarations and add these to shopping list components.

23
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.700
Now just as before,

24
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.300
make sure you also add the imports, here

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.170
my IDE is unfortunately not helping me, so I'll do it manually. Import to the shopping list component

26
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:56.160
and also of course, an import to the shopping edit component here, like this. With that added, we could

27
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.900
export this and import the shopping list module into the app module.

28
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.730
Of course we would

29
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.810
also have to make sure we add all things the shopping list components need into the shopping list

30
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.650
module

31
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.110
but I don't even want to export my shopping list related things in the shopping list component,

32
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.410
I want to manage routing there as well.

33
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.670
Now if we have a look at the app routing module,

34
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.990
we've got one route related to the shopping list and that is this shopping list route.

35
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's remove it from the app routing module and also get rid of that shopping list component import

36
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.770
there

37
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.800
and now we could create a shopping list routing module but since this is already a very small and tiny

38
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.320
module, I will do it all in one file, though this is totally up to you and you could create a separate

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.840
routing module if you wanted to. There,

40
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.070
I will import the routing or I will add the router module from

41
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.470
@angular/router and there, I'll add forChild, pass my routes array to it and in there, set up this single

42
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.150
route that is related to the shopping list right now. We don't need to export router module here because

43
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.370
we only did this when we had a separate routing module, since it's now all included in the feature module

44
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.380
we already got that in the place where it should be. The router module is not the only module we need

45
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.040
though, we also need the common module that should be imported from @angular/common. This unlocks

46
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.480
ngFor and ngIf

47
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.050
when we are using these features here and we also have to add the forms module because we are using

48
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.140
the template driven forms approach in the shopping list area.

49
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.870
So we need to import this as well

50
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.390
and then,

51
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.890
well of course the router module.

52
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.670
Now this should be a module that works,

53
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.700
let's now go to the app module and add the shopping list module to it

54
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.520
and of course, adding it in the imports array is not enough,

55
00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:03.900
you also need to add an import to it up here from ./shopping-list shopping-list.module

56
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.620
from that file.

57
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.470
If you save everything, let's wait for the app to reload and if I try to visit shopping list and I reload

58
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:23.240
there, this all seems to work. So we now have a new feature module,

59
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.370
this time for the shopping list area.
