00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:09,100
In the last lecture, we added our own recipe, spaghetti and we recognize that the image preview is not

2

00:00:09,100  -->  00:00:16,450
working. Well that makes sense because if we have a look at the recipe edit component, here where we try

3

00:00:16,450  -->  00:00:20,750
to preview the image, we're not binding the source.

4

00:00:21,010  -->  00:00:21,950
We should do this,

5

00:00:22,000  -->  00:00:29,170
I'll add a local reference named imagePath to that input because I want to get access to the input

6

00:00:29,200  -->  00:00:31,260
inside of this template

7

00:00:31,810  -->  00:00:40,190
and then I'll bind the source here to that local reference, so to imagePath value because that is exactly

8

00:00:40,190  -->  00:00:48,650
what I want to display here. With that, if we now create a new recipe and paste in our old link, now we

9

00:00:48,650  -->  00:00:51,620
immediately get a preview of this image.

10

00:00:51,620  -->  00:00:54,280
So now this is working as expected

11

00:00:54,290  -->  00:00:57,860
and now if I add my spaghetti recipe,

12

00:00:57,860  -->  00:01:09,160
very tasteful, with my new ingredient, spaghetti 100 and some tomatoes,

13

00:01:11,470  -->  00:01:12,780
3

14

00:01:13,010  -->  00:01:15,570
and if I hit save now, here it is.

15

00:01:15,570  -->  00:01:16,880
Now we can see it,

16

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,400
now we can edit it,

17

00:01:19,620  -->  00:01:22,490
multiple exclamation marks make it more meaningful.

18

00:01:23,150  -->  00:01:28,120
We can send it to the shopping list to find our spaghetti on tomatoes there,

19

00:01:28,280  -->  00:01:32,290
well we already have tomatoes here so we can delete these here I guess

20

00:01:34,390  -->  00:01:36,580
and we lost it.

21

00:01:36,730  -->  00:01:38,550
Where are our spaghettis?

22

00:01:38,830  -->  00:01:43,310
If I go back to recipes, spaghettis are gone.

23

00:01:43,360  -->  00:01:46,550
So that seems to be another bug we need to fix.
