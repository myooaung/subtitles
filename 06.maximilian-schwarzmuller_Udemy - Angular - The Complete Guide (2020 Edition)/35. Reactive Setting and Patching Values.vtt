Not only can you listen to the updates in your form, you can also update the form on your own,

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.450
just like in the template driven approach, setValue and patchValue are there for you.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.540
I will quickly show it here.

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.310
You can of course on your form as a whole call setValue and pass a Javascript object which should

5
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.250
now resemble the object structure up here when you create the form,

6
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.410
so where you have your userData which then is an object, where you have your username and set this equal

7
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.580
to Max for example,

8
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:55.050
have your e-mail, set this equal to max@test.com, have your gender, male and of course your hobbies,

9
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.520
potentially an empty array.

10
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.220
So if we do this, we should see that now our form is pre-populated with some values because we immediately

11
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.160
call setValue and of course you can also call this upon the click of a button.

12
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:20.090
And as in the template driven approach, you also have patchValue of course if you only want to update

13
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.420
a part of the form, like for example the username, switch this to Anna,

14
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.560
now you should see that the username is changed to Anna,

15
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.220
the rest still contains the values I set with setValue.

16
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.720
So just to bring this to your attention, patchValue and setValue are also available and the same is true

17
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.470
for resetting,

18
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.470
so if we want to reset the form after submitting it, we can simply call reset here.

19
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.620
So let's quickly do this

20
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.140
and hit submit,

21
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.660
now it's gone.

22
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.130
So this empties our form,

23
00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.000
now with that, you should have the tools to work with the form, to configure it to your needs and to really

24
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.380
build powerful forms. Time to practice this in the next assignment.
