00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.600
I want to conclude the section with one other built-in structural directive which might be handy from time

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:18.210
to time, ngSwitch. Imagine the case that we have a value like this which is simply 10,

3
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.330
anything you want.

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.530
Now we got a place in our app where this value changes and we get a couple of different messages

5
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:34.930
we want to display for each of these values. For this, we can use ngSwitch,

6
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.310
so let's add a new div

7
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.970
below our paragraphs with our own attribute directives and ngSwitch is used like this.

8
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.280
We are bind to ngSwitch with property binding,

9
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.670
so no star at this point and we bind to value.

10
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.810
So this is our condition

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.110
basically, what we want to check and then you might be aware that switch has a couple of cases we can now

12
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.330
cover.

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.810
So let's say we have a paragraph where we say value is five,

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.490
then we have the same for 10,

15
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.320
then we have the same for 100 and maybe for default.

16
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.190
Now we need to add something to these paragraphs to control which paragraph gets shown because it should

17
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.920
only be one of these at a time, that something is ngSwitchCase and we simply pass the value for

18
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.310
this case here as an argument, for example 5 and we need the star at the beginning,

19
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.690
that's super important.

20
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.360
So here, the star comes into play again because behind the scenes, this is done also transformed by

21
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.420
Angular.

22
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.080
So now we can use this here for the other use cases too, with 10 and with 100

23
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.660
and finally for the default case, we have ngSwitchDefault, like this.

24
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.670
Now here, we also need to add the star of course. With this in place, if we save this, we only see 10 here

25
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.240
and if I go to my component and I change this to 5, like this, then of course we see five.

26
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.920
So this is ngSwitch, super easy to use, might be useful in some cases where you find yourself creating

27
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.100
a lot of ngIf conditions, ngSwitch might be the better solution in such cases.

28
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.940
So that is structural directives finished and that is directives overall finished.

29
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.200
You learned a lot about them and I hope this knowledge allows you to create awesome directives for

30
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.120
your applications in cases where the built-in ones aren't everything you need

31
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.750
even though these already cover a lot of the default use cases to be honest.

32
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.130
So let's move on, let's add a directive to our recipe book in the next section and then let's move on

33
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.090
in the course.

34
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.870
See you there.
