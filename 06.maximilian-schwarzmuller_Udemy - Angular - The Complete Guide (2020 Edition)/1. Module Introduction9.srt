Welcome to this course module. This course module is about forms, so forms on your HTML page and

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,930
how Angular can help you with those forms.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,500
Now on first sight, it might be strange why you would need that help, right, because a form is something

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,260
you can simply submit to the server but then keep in mind, you're creating a single page application,

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,230
so there is no submitting to the server,

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,750
instead you will need to handle the form through Angular

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:39,000
and if you then want to submit something to the server, you will need to reach out via Angular's HTTP

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,510
service which we'll cover later in the course to that server.

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,090
So you will need to handle your forms through Angular and actually, Angular will help you in handling it

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,070
because not only will it allow you to get the values the user entered,

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,430
it will also allow you to check if a form is valid,

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,470
it will allow you to conditionally change the way the form is displayed,

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:08,040
put some red borders around invalid controls, so Angular really ships with some powerful tools when

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,840
it comes to working with forms.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,980
Let's take a closer look and let's understand what exactly

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,100
Angular does for you, how it handles forms.
