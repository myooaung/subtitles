00:00:02,530  -->  00:00:09,060
In the last lecture, we learned how we can submit a form created by Angular and how we can access to this

2

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:09,900
object

3

00:00:09,950  -->  00:00:12,510
Angular created for us.

4

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:18,790
Now we had a look at the value property which stores the input of the user in key-value pairs,

5

00:00:19,080  -->  00:00:25,440
we see that we also have a lot of other properties and that's pretty cool about this Javascript object,

6

00:00:25,440  -->  00:00:28,650
about the form handling by Angular,

7

00:00:28,740  -->  00:00:33,050
it allows us to really understand the state of our form

8

00:00:33,090  -->  00:00:38,850
We can see which controls we registered here on the controls object, e-mail, secret and username and

9

00:00:38,850  -->  00:00:45,690
each control is of type FormControl, of course a type made available by Angular where each control then

10

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:50,640
has a couple of properties, mostly the same properties we have on the overall form though

11

00:00:51,150  -->  00:00:53,650
and therefore let's go back to that overall form,

12

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:59,010
for example properties like dirty, disabled, enabled, errors

13

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:05,610
and most of the properties should be pretty self-explanatory. Dirty for example is true because we changed

14

00:01:05,610  -->  00:01:07,490
something about that form.

15

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:14,880
If I reload the page and submit it now, you will see that dirty is false because I didn't type into any

16

00:01:14,880  -->  00:01:19,440
input, so therefore of course dirty is false.

17

00:01:19,510  -->  00:01:26,190
Disabled would be true if the form was disabled for some reason, invalid is false because we haven't

18

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:27,840
added any validators,

19

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:29,340
so it isn't invalid,

20

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:30,620
it is indeed valid.

21

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:32,710
You do have the valid property down here too,

22

00:01:32,710  -->  00:01:34,590
so the form is valid right now,

23

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:40,050
we will later learn how to add validators to make sure that a valid e-mail address has to be entered

24

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:42,300
for example.

25

00:01:42,300  -->  00:01:49,260
And we also have touched for example to see did we click into some of the fields, the difference to dirty

26

00:01:49,260  -->  00:01:55,950
would be that for dirty, we have to change the field, have to change the value of a field, for touch we simply

27

00:01:55,950  -->  00:02:01,350
have to click into it and now it would be touched and you will later learn how these properties can

28

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:03,470
be helpful in

29

00:02:03,600  -->  00:02:10,450
changing the user experience, for example disabling the submit button if the form is not valid,

30

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:12,330
I will come back to this later.

31

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:17,940
It's important to understand that you have all these properties and definitely feel free to dive into

32

00:02:18,240  -->  00:02:24,240
the output we logged here and understand which properties you have, how they change, which properties

33

00:02:24,240  -->  00:02:27,310
the individual controls have and so on.
