00:00:02,720  -->  00:00:08,510
So now that we get started with this course and with Angular and our project we're going to use in this course,

2

00:00:08,990  -->  00:00:14,840
it's time to dive deeper into Angular to understand what really does, what happens behind the scenes,

3

00:00:15,110  -->  00:00:21,710
how an Angular gets started in the first place and which base building blocks it offers us, how we can

4

00:00:21,710  -->  00:00:25,520
build Angular apps and which features we may use for this.

5

00:00:25,520  -->  00:00:31,400
By the end of this section, you will understand how you can build your basic Angular application, what

6

00:00:31,400  -->  00:00:35,690
it then does and what you need to change to reach a different result.

7

00:00:35,690  -->  00:00:42,920
So with this, let's dive into it and let's start by having a look, what actually happens when we

8

00:00:42,920  -->  00:00:43,230
visit

9

00:00:43,280  -->  00:00:48,090
this page in the browser when we reload this page, how does Angular get started,

10

00:00:48,170  -->  00:00:51,760
what do we actually see here, besides nothing

11

00:00:51,790  -->  00:00:54,710
because there is more to this page than it might look like.
