1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,850
We saw examples for ngStyle and ngIf, now something related to ngStyle is ngClass.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,930
Now we learn that ngStyle allows us to dynamically assign a style,

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:23,500
now I will also add ngClass here and where ngStyle allowed us to change the CSS style itself,

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,430
ngClass allows us to dynamically add or remove CSS classes.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,660
So let's create such a class and for this, I will

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,390
first of all add my styles here

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:42,170
and I will use back ticks to write this over multiple lines and I will give this a class name of online, in

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,950
which case I want to color the text white. So that's all I want to do because I think it's kind of hard

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,400
to read the black text on the green background.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,310
So back here, ngClass also,

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,250
this is the directive, also only works as intended when using property binding.

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,090
So let's wrap it in square brackets too

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,230
and here we also need to pass a Javascript object and that's just the case for this property of this

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,980
directive here,

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:16,300
of course each property you bind to may take a different value, like disabled which took true or false.

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,450
So here it's a Javascript object and for ngClass object works like this.

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,570
We also have key-value pairs,

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:30,980
the keys are the CSS class names and the values are the conditions determining whether this class should

19
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,200
be attached or not.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,390
So here, we have the online class,

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,750
you could also wrap this in single quotation marks

22
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,690
if you had a class name with a dash inside of it or something like this

23
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,950
and here,

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,750
well I want to attach this

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:54,220
only if the server is online, so only if serverStatus equals online, online

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,200
here is a string between single quotation marks.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,420
Now of course you could also outsource this in a method, you call this serverStatus equal online check

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,610
but here I will write it inline.

29
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,600
So if this is online, we should attach the CSS class online to this paragraph

30
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,880
otherwise this should not get attached.

31
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,030
Let's view this in the running application,

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,690
both are offline so none of the two should have the online CSS class added to it

33
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,250
and indeed, I can't find the class on any of the two.

34
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,770
Now let's reload and hope that some of them is offline or online, excuse me, both are

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,180
so let's check it,

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,180
now we see the online class has been added,

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,400
actually to both of them because this is how ngClass works.

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,680
It only adds like CSS class if a certain condition is true

39
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,230
and that's an example for another built-in directive, another built-in attribute directive.
