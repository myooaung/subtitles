00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.590
Let me quickly summarize what we've learned thus far because it really is important. This component communication

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.230
is such a key feature and with @input and the ability to make your properties bindable from outside,

3
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.420
from the parent component using this component

4
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.530
and the same for @output which allows parent components using this component to listen to your own

5
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.520
events which you created with new eventEmitter,

6
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.190
these are such important features in your app.

7
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.570
We will use it in the recipe book in the next section because this really allows you to make your application

8
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.560
very dynamic,

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.900
use many components and have them talk to each other.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.850
Now one issue you could say with that approach is that if you want to talk between two components sitting

11
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.600
next to each other, it can get kind of complicated to emit an event in one component, change something

12
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.830
in the parent component and then pass this new data down to the child component

13
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.790
and these chains of inputs and outputs can really grow more complex.

14
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.070
So while this is absolutely fine here and this is a feature you will use a lot because it's not bad at all,

15
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.460
there are some use cases where the distance between two components that should talk to each other is

16
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.400
so great that building a chain of outputs and inputs is not very practical.

17
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.140
That is why in the services section of this course, I will then show you another approach of having components

18
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.630
talk to each other, though and that is important,

19
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.940
this will not be a better approach,

20
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.760
it is just a better tool for a specific use case.

21
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.460
A use case like this here is typically handled with input and output like we are doing it here,

22
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.810
it's the perfect tool for this job and it's so important,

23
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.810
you will see it getting used a lot throughout the rest of this course.
