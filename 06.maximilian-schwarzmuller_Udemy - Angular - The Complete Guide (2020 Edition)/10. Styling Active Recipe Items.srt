In the last lecture, we made our child routerLinks here work again,

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:16,520
now let's make clear which one is selected by marking it. We can mark the active link by adding manually

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,040
the active class to it.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,470
If we do this, all are marked as active because of course it's added to every instance of this component

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,510
because I hardcoded it in there.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,090
So that's the right class

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,420
but of course we should add it dynamically with good old routerLinkActive directive and here, I simply

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,210
want to pass active as the class name because we just saw this is the CSS class we need to add

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,040
and with that it's working as expected. And this is all we needed here,

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,020
you also see that recipes is still marked as active at the top because we still are at /recipes

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,630
and then at a child route but that doesn't matter for this to be marked as active because it's not

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,450
set to exact matching

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,420
and actually we want the behaviour we have right now. So that all looks pretty good,

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,920
now we can move on to make sure that we can click this new recipe button and this edit recipe button

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,510
and actually do something

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,640
once we do click them.
