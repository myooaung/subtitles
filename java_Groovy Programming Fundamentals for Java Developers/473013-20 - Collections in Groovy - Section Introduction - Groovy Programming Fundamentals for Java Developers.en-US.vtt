00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Now we wouldn't be able to do much in

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.905
our programs if we didn't have access to the collection classes,

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.960
which Java carries across to groovy.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
Now what's nice in Groovy is that collections kinda become

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.000
first-class citizens and are much easier to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520
work with and you'll be used to in your Java programs.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.410
So let's jump in now together and see just how nice and makes working with collections.
