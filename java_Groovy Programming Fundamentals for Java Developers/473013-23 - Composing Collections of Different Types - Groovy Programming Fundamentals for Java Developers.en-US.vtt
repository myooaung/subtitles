00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Also, we can even compose collections as well as you might expect.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.900
So for example, here we've got a map.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.850
We could change this map,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.650
we could create a new map maybe.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.545
And maybe like a map of food for example.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:16.455
And here we can have fruits.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:23.440
And we'd have apple, banana, orange,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:34.350
vegetables, potato, green beans for example.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.210
And now if we look at that and we can see here we've got a map.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.455
And the map is composed of two entries with each one having a list.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:47.285
The type of the collection is still linked hash map though,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:49.295
as we can see here, still linked HashMap.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.820
The only difference being, and we now have lists as the values for each element.
