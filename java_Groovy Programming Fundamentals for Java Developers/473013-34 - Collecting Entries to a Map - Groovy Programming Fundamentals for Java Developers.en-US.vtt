00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
You don't just have to create a list.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.075
So what we get back here, you'll see if we do get class.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:09.480
Is ArrayList like we're used to.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.120
You don't have to necessarily return back a list.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.950
We can actually construct a map instead.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.095
And to do this, instead of using collect,

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.570
we use collect entries.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.535
So if we use collect entries,

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.580
then what we pass in the closure is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.105
basically syntax which specifies what the map interests will look like.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:32.760
So for example, we could take the age as a key and that has a value in the map.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.390
We could take the limb and Pakistan for example.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.155
So now if we clear and then rerun,

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.195
we can see here we've got a map, but this time,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.220
the map consists of elements keyed by

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.355
the edge and each element refers to capitalize them.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:48.680
Since effects we now an inverse map, if you like,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.755
of the ages for the person with the edge and capitals.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:53.180
So k by the way as well,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.905
that in constructing the key,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:56.840
which is where you are giving here before this column,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.160
this is the key and this is the value that we're enclosing this in parentheses.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.760
And that's so that we can actually evaluate what that is to construct the key.
