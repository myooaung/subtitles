00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Now strings are probably one of the most fundamental data types in any language.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.180
So it's really important that we get a good handle on

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.714
how we can better use them in our groovy programs.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.640
So in this section, you're going to learn about things like string

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.534
interpolation here at OCS and regular expressions,

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:16.935
which are all much nicer ways of working with strings,

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:21.165
either formatting them as you want or extracting information out of them that you need.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.500
So here we go.
