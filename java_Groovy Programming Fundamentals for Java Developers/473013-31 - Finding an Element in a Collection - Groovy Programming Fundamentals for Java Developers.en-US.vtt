00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
We don't just have to do find older,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.385
find all would return where we get rid of this each in fact,

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:09.210
find all Hashim just changes bank two bigger than or equal to.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.975
So we've got a few things that we can get back and get two things here,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.695
two items there either we don't just have to use find all, we could just use Find.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.750
Now if we use Find, what will happen here

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.035
is it'll return back the first element that matches.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:23.685
So we get back a person.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:27.375
We can then use the dot syntax to just find out the name.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.895
And we hear it. We can see the name IS robert.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.655
So the first thing we got back with Robert is 50.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.460
And that's because find just returned as the first thing.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.530
If we switch the order of these safer boat

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.100
Simon first and robot afterwards and then replay.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.530
Now we see we get Simon will access in the field directly here,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.240
by the way, because this isn't a field.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.760
Actually what we're doing here is we're referencing the property.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.225
So behind the scenes, Ruby's actually calling the getter for them.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.595
It's calling getName. So cancel that.

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.260
That's fine and find all.
