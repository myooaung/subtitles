00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
Now sticking again with the collections theme,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.390
but see some of the things we can do.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.470
So let's create another list, 1-2-3-4-5.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
Another operation we can do to be able to create another list is to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
do l dot Collect and passing the closure.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.610
And what L dot collates does is it basically

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.810
reforms the collection by applying the transformation is given in the closure.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.115
So if we take it,

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.900
which is the current element,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.525
we said is the variable which references the current element.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.385
And if we multiply it by two,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:30.960
and then if we run this,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.485
we'll actually get the set of numbers 246810.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.695
And here we can see 246810.

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:39.930
Again, it doesn't just work with numeric types.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.880
So we could have a list of names.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.000
Matt allen, Kevin for example.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.800
And then we could do it DO2 uppercase.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.650
And so now we've transformed each element by making each one uppercase.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.810
And again, it works on classes to,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.870
so if we have a class that's going to class person again, string name,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.830
int age,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.160
age 25.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.660
This is obviously not me.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.560
Age 23.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.290
Kelvin page before.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.760
Don't forget, these are actual call to the constructor.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.525
So I'll just do that just a bit easier to type out the syntax are now.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:06.175
So now this list contains three personal objects with name and age is given.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.630
And now we can collect those.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.715
We're in a different way of so it's dot name, dot toUpperCase.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.710
And we still get the same result.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.975
But notice that now when we had it,

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.810
it was actually referencing a full person object.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.590
So then we do dot Nim to de-reference natural name property.
