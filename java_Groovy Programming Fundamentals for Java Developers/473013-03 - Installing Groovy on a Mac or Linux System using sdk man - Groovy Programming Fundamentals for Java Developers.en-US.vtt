00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
In this video, we're going to see how we can install

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.504
SDK man onto a system on your Mac specifically,

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.665
which will enable us to get groovy installed.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's just jump over to the STK11 website.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.890
If you go to SDK Amanda Ir,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.940
then this is the homepage for sdk men.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.220
And what is the Cayman does is it basically gives you

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.995
a curated set of frameworks and libraries,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.045
tools, that kind of thing that you can download and use and installed on your system.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:30.285
And pretty much most of the framework should expect to find in

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:34.320
the Java ecosystem are available through SDK, Java itself.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.915
Another frameworks such as, for example, groovy,

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.100
which we'll see here, also Gradle,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.835
things like Scala, that kind of thing.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.410
So it's really useful tool to have.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.290
It's available for Mac and for Linux with a bit of extra work,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.705
you can also get it set up on Windows if you use Cygwin.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.625
But that's beyond the scope of this particular video.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.720
Here we're just gonna show how to get installed and set up onto a MAC system,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.195
which you can also apply to Linux based systems as well.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:01.505
So if you click the Install link here and copy this command,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.135
what this does basically to command C to copy that into the clipboard.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.840
Well, this does is it basically goes off to get dynasty came and IR.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.515
And at that particular webpage, there's a bash script,

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.820
and then it executes that Bash script by piping it through the batch process.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.800
So if we jump to a terminal session and then

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.910
copy that pen and press Enter, you can see that it's installed.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.370
It's pretty much instantaneous.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.340
Now if we do what it says, if we basically source this file.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.050
So that basically means get the variables in aliases into our current shell,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.260
hit into that at this point we can use SDK amen,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.705
so we could do what it says here, SDK help.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.510
And I'll give you some help as to how to use the tool.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.630
Now if you look at your bash file,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.310
this is my Bash RC file here,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.630
which establishes my environment.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.010
If I jump to the end here,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.450
you'll notice we don't have a section in which also establishes SDK man for future use.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.520
So if I jump over to the website and just make sure that I have this command here.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.665
And she's also my clipboard anyway.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.110
Can we see it at the end of the file?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.900
Save that command S and then come out of there.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.525
We can close this browser down now as well.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.195
And we'll close terminal and then we'll go back in.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:16.865
Then we'll see that it should be set up.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.070
And you can see here that it's now setup,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.870
but it's also changed my prompt as well.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.145
So what probably happened is it's created adopt profile.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:31.460
It's created adopt bash on the skull profile and is also generated these lines here.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.605
So this sometimes happen,

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:37.415
is picked to basically the wrong profile to additives if I just copy those winds instead.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:43.220
And then my Bashar C,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.150
go to end with, with colon dollar, delete that line.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.680
Actually these lines women to put him because it also establishes

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.505
the directory then colon w q of them.

00:02:55.505 --> 00:03:01.775
But if we do exit bash now will see that my usual prompt his back.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.310
But we also can still use SDK man.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.220
So that's just something to bear in mind that SDK man automatically

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.145
tries to figure out which shall initialization folly using,

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:12.410
and it puts those extra two minds on there as well.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.060
So you just gotta make sure if anything

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.845
strange or that happens and it changes your prompt,

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:17.585
that you just put them in the correct file.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:19.505
Anyway, now we've got SDK installed,

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.950
can do SDK ls, which means to list.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.925
And we can list the Groovy versions that we can have.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.790
So these are the different versions of Ruby that we can have.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.525
So will get installed with the most recent version,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:36.485
which is 304, and restore the most recent version if you just do sdk i,

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:37.640
i stands for install.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.030
And then the name of the kind of framework or package that you're installing.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.580
And that will by default pick the most recent installation,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.520
homeless recent version rather, just to enter there.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.785
And you can see it's downloading groovy 30 for the whole process is pretty quick,

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:53.255
so it shouldn't take too long.

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.700
And what you'll find afterwards is that it's installed it

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.675
into a folder called the SDK man and your home directory.

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.550
And then a candidate's folder under

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.770
their grievous subdirectory and then you'll see the version.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.690
So if you just look here now,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.550
we can see we should have and the SDK man folder, which we do.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.460
We should have a candidate's folder under there, which we also do.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.785
And then we have agree we folder.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:20.885
And here you can see it's got the three 0-4 installation with a directory with the d,

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:24.425
which is the full groovy installation of 300 four in there.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.090
And it's also credit assembling for us as

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.340
well to say that the current version is currently set to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.530
30 for the reason being is because you can

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.825
also set another version to use if you wanted to.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.915
So for example, supposing you had multiple versions.

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:39.275
Actually, if I do SDK ls, review again.

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:41.660
And just explain this version chart quickly.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.215
You can see we've got many different versions which we can potentially install.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:47.465
Versions with a star next to them in

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:50.405
their actually versions which are available on the local system.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:53.015
And if you have this greater than sign,

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.730
it means this is the current version that using, so for example,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.795
supposing we installed SDK 3v version 2512.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:04.190
For example.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.425
If we had 2512 installed,

00:05:06.425 --> 00:05:08.015
you will just install it now anyway,

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:14.420
if we had Version 2512 installed onto the system than what you'd see is inversions chart.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.480
You'd see an extra star there next to 2512.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760
We will see in a second.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.340
Whenever you install a new version is asking if you want

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.320
that to become the default version we're gonna send No,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.425
because we want to keep the latest version as the current version.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:30.154
But again, SDK ls Grinnell.

00:05:30.154 --> 00:05:32.570
And I can see we've just got 300 four.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.190
We've also got to 512.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.065
So that's on the star. And the star means,

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:37.850
but because we're using 300 four,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.670
that's why we have this greater than symbol there as well.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.290
Now just before we check the, we've actually got

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.300
the correct version of Ruby installed and it's all set up.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.550
Okay, there's one other thing I can show you.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.010
You can also choose to use the SDK LS,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.930
and that will give you the full catalog of

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.940
different frameworks and libraries that you can install.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.400
So it's kind of outside the scope of this particular lesson.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.840
But supposing you wanted to install,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.350
I don't know, for example, Gradle.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.275
You just search for greater WEB slash Gradle.

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:06.260
And then here you can see we've got Gradle as a framework or library which we

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.170
could install and use this law of SDK installed Gradle.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.880
And you'd go to the same thing again where it

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.875
give me the list of versions that you can select from.

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:16.835
So just plus q to quit out of that command cages declare there.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.710
And also in SDK,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.020
help if we do SDK D,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.095
groovy, it'll tell us what the default version is for groovy.

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:26.120
So we know we're using Groovy 300 four.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.840
Now, this is actually the output from the SDK tool itself.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.890
It's telling us that it's setup version 304 of gravy for us to use in our shell.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.600
We can double-check that right, of course,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.450
by invoking one of the group BY command line executables.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.290
So groovy itself minus-minus version.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.065
And I can see indeed we've got 300 four.

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:48.890
So this is actually output now from the Groovy command-line tool itself.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.830
If we did SDK use Chicago or version it was slick ALS groovy.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.155
Similarly, the version was it was 2-5, 12.

00:06:57.155 --> 00:07:00.770
So if we did SDK use to 512,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.765
don't forget the name of framework.

00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.775
Now you can see we're using 2512.

00:07:04.775 --> 00:07:08.750
And again, if we did groovy minus-minus version and enter,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.420
we'd see that EBIT to 512, which it is there.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.050
So that's how you get up and running and install SDK man on Geo system,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.535
which in turn allows you to install

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.290
the latest groovy installation and get up

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.090
and running with it very quickly and effectively.
