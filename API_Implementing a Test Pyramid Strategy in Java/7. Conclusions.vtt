00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:02.952
For the end of our journey,

2
00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:05.691
let's try some conclusions and have a final look at

3
00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:10.211
possible other related courses.

4
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:13.886
Developing applications that are tested at different levels is a

5
00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:17.415
widely-spread present day software development technique.

6
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:21.907
Unit testing overrides our basic components working in isolation.

7
00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:26.709
We make sure we are writing safer code and we are finding bugs early.

8
00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:30.674
Integration testing looks at the units combined as a group.

9
00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:33.308
Each unit may work fine in isolation,

10
00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:37.403
but this does not ensure the integration with other units.

11
00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.427
System testing scrutinizes the complete software.

12
00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:43.290
Usually, we work in a consumer-driven testing mode,

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
and for some part of it, using mock objects.

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.914
Acceptance testing ensures the compliance with the business requirements,

15
00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:55.005
more detail, testing with respect to user needs,

16
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.977
requirements, and business processes.

17
00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:01.454
We have shown a comprehensive work to cover the whole

18
00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:04.767
pyramid from its basis to the top.

19
00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.361
When it did,

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:10.059
like in the case of lack of integration between Arquillian and JUnit5,

21
00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:14.302
we have also emphasized the problems that you may still face at the time

22
00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:19.450
on declarations or new versions will be available.

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.956
As we have passed through all levels of testing pyramid,

24
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:27.973
we must point out other related courses that Pluralsight is currently providing,

25
00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:30.911
JUnit 5 Fundamentals by Esteban Herrera,

26
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:34.611
TDD with JUnit 5 and Java: BDD Fundamentals,

27
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:39.950
both by Catalin Tudose who is also the author of this Implementing a Test

28
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.386
Pyramid Strategy in Java that you are currently following.

29
00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:44.292
And of course,

30
00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:47.527
it is worth following the Pluralsight website as

31
00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:50.479
related courses may appear frequently.

32
00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.029
I hope you have enjoyed our journey and that the presented

33
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:57.280
information and examples will be useful for your activity.

34
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.000
Thanks for watching. See you soon in the next course.
