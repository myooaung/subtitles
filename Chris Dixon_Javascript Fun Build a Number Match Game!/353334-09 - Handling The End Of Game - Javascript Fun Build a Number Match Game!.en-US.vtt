00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.600
Hey, welcome back. We are now going to handle

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.645
exactly what the user sees when the game is over.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:11.055
Currently, when we cycle through all of our images and we get to the very last one,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.680
we're currently stopping our timer and also,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.635
we're not generating any more images.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.530
During the game started and game ended condition,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.935
we also need to show and hide various elements on the screen,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.240
and also at the very end,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560
we need to display a message to the user with their total score.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
First of all, we're going to get to work inside of this play function and we're going

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.610
to begin by hiding some elements which we don't want to see when the game is running.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.415
For example, if we click on "Play",

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.240
we don't want to see all of this Welcome section.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.965
We don't need to see the Play button.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:50.020
We just need to see the stats area and also the image.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.705
This is because inside of our index.html,

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.640
we have this image area,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.960
and once the game is in play,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.340
we only want to display this image container.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.990
We're going to hide our message area.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.185
We're going to hide our start screen.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.290
We are also going to hide the Play button,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.940
since the game is already in play.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.425
We're going to take out of all of this over in our play function.

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.700
This function is called as soon as our game start,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.175
so this is a good place to hide all of our content.

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:24.300
First of all, we're going to select the message area with getElementByID.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.735
I'm going to use JavaScript to set the style

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:33.410
and set the display property to be equal to none.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.175
This is just the same as adding the display type in our style sheets,

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.519
but this is being added dynamically with JavaScript.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.615
We're also going to copy this and paste this in two more times.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.480
We can use this second one inside of

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.845
our index page to grab our start screen section which contains all of the text.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.540
Number 2 is the start screen.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.675
Then finally, we also need to remove the Play button once the game has started.

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:07.760
This is the ID of Play button.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.485
It looks like this is all working.

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:17.580
Once we click "Play," we no longer see all of our text at the top.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.905
We no longer see the start screen.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.845
We no longer see the Play button.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:25.630
We've also hidden the message area for later too.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.240
This is handling the condition when the game is started,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.365
and we also need to handle what happens when it's the end of the game.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.105
With this, we're also going to create

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.615
a custom function which we'll call right at the very end.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:44.370
So constant, and this function is going to be called endOfGame,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.005
and this section also wants to show and hide some areas.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.330
Once we've reached the end of the game,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.790
we want to make sure that our message has been

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.520
displayed because we're going to add a message to the user with their score.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.370
Let's copy this and paste in the message section.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.280
To make this visible on the screen,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.195
we're going to change the display type to be block.

00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:15.629
The second one we're going to amend is going to be our image container.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.430
This is because once the game is over,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.620
we want to remove the last image from

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.020
our screen and we can do this by keeping this display type to be equal to none.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.590
Once we remove this image,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.165
we then want to populate our message with the users score.

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.845
If we go right up to the very top where we created our variables,

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.535
we have the user score inside of this variable.

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.280
We also need to create a second variable too,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.010
which is the total of points available.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.380
This is going to be equal to the number of images inside of our array.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.930
We can create a variable just below,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.865
separate it by a comma.

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:58.910
I want to call this the totalAvailable.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.110
Set this equal to the length of our images with images.length.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.970
We can now use these two variables to display

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.405
a message to the user at the end of our game.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:13.465
Back to our endOfGame function,

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:18.980
let's grab our message area with document.getElementByID,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.585
the ID of message.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.310
Then we can set the message with

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.835
an innerHTML and we're going to set this equal to a template string.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:32.005
We're at the back [inaudible] so we can include our two variables.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.770
The message I'm going to display is going to be,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.705
"Game over, your score was."

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:45.070
We can then use the $ symbol and the curly braces to output our score variable/,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.850
and then we make use of our total available variable,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.665
which we just created above.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:55.145
This is going to display our message to the user.

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.275
Let's reduce down our timer.

00:04:57.275 --> 00:05:01.595
Let's go for 300 milliseconds and check this is all working.

00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:06.520
Click on "Play." The score doesn't really matter.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.765
We get to the end of the game and nothing happens.

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:15.169
This is because we have created our end of gain function,

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.015
but we have not yet called it.

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:21.605
The place we want to call this function is look inside of our Generate function.

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:25.025
This is the same location inside the if statement,

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:28.625
where we check if our images.length is equal to 0,

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:31.175
and then we stop in our timer.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:36.470
Inside here is also the same place we call our endOfGame function.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.790
Let's add this, and then cycle back through our images.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.230
Our endOfGame function has now been called.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.620
We've removed the image container and then set the message to

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.790
the user with the total score. So this is good.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.625
This is all working, but what do we want to do now?

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.560
Well, we have a couple of options.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.410
We can add our Play button back into the screen,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.170
which is going to take us back to the start of the game.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.560
Or we can simply do something like setting this message to

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.875
be three seconds and then reloading the browser.

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.530
Take the user back to the start screen.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.895
The way we can do this is by using a timeout.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:21.560
Here we used the setInterval,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.930
which is going to call a function after a certain time delay.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.965
SetInterval will also keep repeating this until we tell it otherwise.

00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:36.115
However, inside here, we only want to run a function awesome code only once.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:39.240
To do this, we can use setTimeout.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.075
Inside here, we're also going to pass in a arrow function.

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:47.190
Inside here, all we want to do is to refresh the browser and

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.870
the way we can do this inside of our code is by using location.reload.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.450
This is exactly the same as pressing the Reload button on our browser, but instead,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.820
we're doing this after a time delay,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.685
which I'm going to set as three seconds.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:08.210
Let's try this out. Click on "Play."

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.500
There's our score, and after three seconds,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.450
we should see a reload.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.310
While we're also dealing with the end of the game condition,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.360
we can also hide this Stats section on the left.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.760
We're going to hide this at the end of the game and

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.775
then reinstate this once the game has started.

00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:35.710
The way we can do this is just like we've done above with getElementByID,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.850
and the ID we want to grab.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.370
If we scroll a little to our start section,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.860
remember when we use these CSS early on,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.574
we surrounded all of these text content inside of a div with the ID of stats content.

00:07:48.574 --> 00:07:52.750
We can now use this to show and hide this area in the script.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.260
First of all, let's copy and paste this line.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.020
We need to select our statsContent.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.700
Then at the end of the game,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.505
we are going to remove this with the display of none.

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:08.810
We can grab this and then we'll see game is started.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.770
We want to reinstate this by setting this to be a display type of block.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.955
Let's cycle through our images and check this is all working in the browser.

00:08:18.955 --> 00:08:23.770
When the game is started, we see our section is appearing.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.300
Then this disappears at the end of the game.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.430
In fact, we probably don't even need to reinstate this when the game starts,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.995
because remember, we're refreshing the browser,

00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:37.430
which will immediately place us back into the DOM.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:43.230
Let's cycle through. Our stats are all displaying.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.850
They are removed again at the end of the game.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.700
With this now taken care of, in the upcoming video,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.400
we're going to handle these two buttons here,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.990
but make sure the user can only have one selection each time an image is displayed.
