00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
We're now back with our project and at this time we're going to apply

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.475
some CSS styling to improve the look and feel of this project.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:14.205
To do this as if we're going to create a style sheet inside of our project directory.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:19.450
New file, and this is the styles.css.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.415
We can link this inside of the head section or index page with our link.

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:29.475
This is at the same level as our index page.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.820
This is simply the name of styles.css.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.405
We can go over to our style sheets and begin by creating

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:40.230
the root one size inside of our HTML selector.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.155
Let's begin with the root font-size,

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.374
and I'm going to go for a 10 pixels,

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:49.010
and also a color which will apply to all the texts in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.760
our project and let's override it use may selector.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.415
The Color to go for is going to be 212560.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.990
I'm going can check this is work in by reload the browser,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.830
and this is all now taken effect.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.940
Now we're going to move on to the game area,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.920
which was the main wrapper,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.780
and this is the wrapper for both vie stats section and also the imageArea.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.500
This was no ID, so we use the harsh.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.275
Now we're going to do here is to set some font styling and also the size.

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:31.430
So 1.6rems, some padding.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.415
Let's go for padding on the top of 3rems.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.185
This will just give us some spacing at the top of the page just here.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:44.465
The majority of our styling is going to be broken up into two sections.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:45.980
Have the Stat section,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.845
which is all of the information up at the top here.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.460
We have the score, the number of items on the image,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.459
and also the tick and the cross buttons,

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.435
and then below, which is going to be this whole section here.

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.885
This is going to be the image area.

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:04.940
First of all, let's target both of the sections and we can

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.255
set the minimum height for the small screen.

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:11.585
This is the class of image area,

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.150
and also the same for stats.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.865
The minimum height, I'm going to go for 30 vh,

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:24.115
which is 30 percent of the browsers visible viewport.

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:27.305
This is going to make our sections a little taller.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:29.360
It doesn't really matter too much at the moment

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.900
because you'll have quite a lot of content on the screen,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.380
but later on in JavaScript,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.425
when we switch between this section and the image,

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.740
there be less content on the screen.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.010
For the image area, I'm going to apply a gradient as a background color,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.510
just like the final version.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.650
This is going to be the section oval on the right or on the small screen.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.690
This will be the section at the bottom.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.630
Moving down the imageArea,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.020
we can do this by setting a background as a linear gradient.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.990
The first color I'm going to select 859ede.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.040
For the second value,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.930
I'm going to go for 6965de.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.800
Let's check this is work in.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.140
This is fine and this gives us

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.985
this straight linear gradient from the lighter to darker shade.

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:27.995
But I'm just going to set a optional first value of 70 degrees followed by a comma.

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:33.625
This is going to offset our gradients be across the page at 70 degrees.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:37.430
Next, the border-radius, which is going to apply to both the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.940
bottom-left and also the bottom-right on the mobile view.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.900
For this we can apply the four values and these go clockwise from the top-left.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.120
Top-left of zero, the top right of zero too and then,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.690
both the bottom right and also the bottom left values of 3rem.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.110
These have now taken effect on the bottom of our section.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.610
Just to see this more clearly,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.895
we can temporarily remove our image.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.495
Let's comment this out.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:15.780
This is how the game will look before the user clicks on the Play button.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.155
Back to our style sheets and still within the imageArea,

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:23.510
we're going to make use of the display type of flex,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.980
which is going to allow us to position all of this text into the center.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.470
First of all, let's set the flex direction to be column.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.440
All of our content is stacked vertically,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.350
and then we can use the justify content,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.510
the spaces into the center.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.250
Since this is our main axis from top to bottom,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.624
justify content will send to this vertically,

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.985
we see we have some uneven space on the top and bottom.

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:56.555
This is because of some browser defaults on the level 1 heading.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.075
We'll take a look at fixing this very soon.

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:01.070
Just to finish off this image area,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.120
let's add some padding all around with the value of 3rems.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.400
This uneven space at the top and bottom is because of

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.120
this heading just here inside of our index page.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.625
If we go to this section just here,

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.345
this is within the level 1 heading.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:24.540
Let's go into the developer tools and we can see this in more detail.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.170
Click on the arrow just here,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.240
and then if we hover over our level one heading,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.840
we can see by the orange section we have some default margin which

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.830
is been applied to both the top and the bottom of our heading.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.280
Now the margin on the very bottom of this heading is fine

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.075
because this supply some spacing to our textures below.

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:50.705
However, to keep things more central in our container,

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:54.680
we are going to remove the default margin from the very top.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.140
Let's go over to our style sheets and we can now remove the browser defaults.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.250
First of all, our level 1 heading.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.930
We can do this by resetting the margin on the top 0,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.580
and also let's give this a new font size of 2.4rems.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.925
We can still see that there's more spacing on the top than the bottom.

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.310
Well, if we go back to our index page,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.595
this is because still within this image area,

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:32.195
we have a level 3 heading with the ID of message.

00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:35.000
This is going to be used later on to apply

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.580
a message to the user once the game is finished.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.230
But for now this is still taking up some space inside the dome.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.410
We can do exactly the same.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.310
We can remove the browser default margin on the top,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.230
reset this, and just for later,

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.490
we can also set the font size to be a value of 2rems.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.210
This now leaves our space in more consistent.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.930
This section is pretty much complete,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.885
we can now move up to these cross-section.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.030
We've already targeted the level 3 heading.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.680
Let's go up. The score is also

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.605
inside of the level 3 heading which you've just taken care of.

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:19.970
Now let's move on to our P elements with the class of items.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.160
This is going to let the user know the number to compare against.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.560
All we're going to do is to make this stand out a little more,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.900
by setting font-size to be 2rems.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.840
The items class and there we go.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.955
Moving down we also have these two buttons here,

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:46.120
and also the button at the bottom too.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.600
First of all, let's target our button selector,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.210
and we can add some base styles,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.505
starting with the width of the button and a value of 8rems.

00:07:57.505 --> 00:08:03.455
We can remove any default borders which had been applied by the browser.

00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:06.740
But we still want this to have some rounded corners.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.040
We can do this with a border-radius,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:19.285
some spacing to make the button a little more padded inside.

00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:23.260
So a padding value of 1 rem.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:29.585
Then we also need to make these different color and also remove the background color.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:34.000
If we take a look at the moment we've got this light gray color button

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.005
one two make these buttons just basically an outline like we see on the final version.

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:44.705
We can do this by removing the background by setting this to be a color of transparent.

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:49.270
For this image section, this will allow the blue background color to shine through,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.465
and also the same for the stats section oval on the left.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:56.770
We can then apply this border color or this outline,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.450
to each one of our buttons.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.485
Inside the button selector,

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:11.370
we can remove the background by setting this to be transparent. Then our border.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.655
This is going to be two pixels wide,

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:22.280
a solid line, and then the color which I'm going to use is going to be a1e0e4.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.090
Finally, we can change the mouse cursor to be

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.705
a pointer when we hover over any of these buttons.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:35.860
All we need to do is to set the cursor to be a pointer,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.220
and this will change the mouse as you hover over.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.320
Just to finish these buttons off,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.195
we're going to make sure that the cross button has the red background color.

00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:51.850
Just like we see here, we have a different color for the tick and also for the cross.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.500
A way we can do this is by targeting the second button.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.710
Inside of our index page, here,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.620
we have two buttons which are grouped side-by-side,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.179
and since these are side-by-side,

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:07.885
we can select either the first or the second child.

00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:12.670
Further down, we also have our button which is in the image section just here.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.615
Since this is in a different section rather than side-by-side,

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:18.950
the nth child won't affect this.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.020
We'll see this more clear if we go over to our style sheets,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.740
we can target our button and then a colon.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.605
We can then target the nth child.

00:10:28.605 --> 00:10:33.395
Let's add in a value of two since we are targeting the second button.

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:36.865
Let's go ahead and change the border.

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:40.780
We still want this to be two pixels and a solid line.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.955
But this time, we want to use a different color,

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.985
and I'm going to go for an RGB value.

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:47.995
First of all, red,

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:52.450
a value of 241, 152 for the green,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.090
and 152 for the blue.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.360
Since these buttons are now side-by-side in the DOM,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.570
this is going to target the second button.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.460
If we change this to one,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.150
this will target the first one,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.585
number 3, and this doesn't affect our third button since this button

00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:18.745
is completely independent and it's not side-by-side with these two here.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:22.850
Let's reinstate this, we want this to be the second button.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:29.110
Now, we are going to move on to our stats which was the wrapper for this top section.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.495
This is the area just here.

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:34.675
We're going to set the background color and also apply a border

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:38.289
around both the top-left and also the top-right corners,

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:42.830
and then also center all of this content into the middle of this section.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.710
Just before we add some CSS styling to this section,

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.890
we want to cut out all of the content inside the stats,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.995
and add a second div nested inside.

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:57.550
This div is going to have an ID of stats content.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.420
Then we can paste in all the contents just inside.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.345
Now, there is a few reasons why we've done this.

00:12:07.345 --> 00:12:11.860
First of all, what we're going to do is set this stat section to be a flex container.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.505
Meaning, we can push all of this stats content into the center.

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:18.130
Second of all, using JavaScript later on,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.630
we're also going to hide these content when the game is not running.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.875
Back to our style sheets, we can target the stat section and then

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:32.030
center all of the content underneath the button.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.365
First of all, a background color,

00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:38.990
and we're going to go for a value of white smoke.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.960
The border, this is going to be two pixels,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.530
a solid color, and a value of 859ede.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.560
This border should also be rounded on the top left and the top right.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.140
We can do this with border radius.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.920
First of all, the top left value of three rems,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.205
the top right of three rems too.

00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:09.370
Then we want zero on the bottom.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.090
Next, we can set the display type of flex.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:22.315
This is now going to allow us to center our new div in the middle of this section.

00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.880
When using the flexbox, the default

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.525
flex direction is going to be row which is across the page,

00:13:28.525 --> 00:13:31.690
and we can center across this axis by using justify

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.900
content and setting the value to be center.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.965
Next to take care of the alignment on the cross axis or the vertical section,

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:45.530
we can do this by setting align items.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.940
Next up, the padding.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.350
Three rems on the top and bottom,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.615
and zero on the left and right.

00:13:55.615 --> 00:14:01.130
Then we can set the text line to be in the center of our section.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.755
We're almost done for this mobile for styling.

00:14:05.755 --> 00:14:09.175
The next thing I'm going to do is to go back to our index page.

00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:12.249
If you remember, when we set all of this content,

00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:15.370
we also added a class of space-y.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.230
We added this to each one of our lines of text inside of the stat screen.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.025
We did this so we can add some space in on this y-axis.

00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:28.250
We can do this by setting some margin on the top and bottom.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.590
Space-y, the margin will add two values.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.980
The first one is three rems on the top and bottom,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.755
and zero on the left and right.

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:44.290
Good. This is now looking how we want it.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.585
Now, if we go back to our index page,

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:49.615
we can begin to work with this image section.

00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:53.710
To do this, we need to uncomment out our image from earlier,

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.440
and we can also comment out our stat screen.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:04.120
This will simulate how our game will look once the game has started.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.740
Let's target the image element, so IMG.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.935
First of all, the width of 100 percent,

00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:16.430
and also, let's round the corners with the border radius.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:22.750
Our game now looks how we want it on the mobile view, but now,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.090
when we stretch the browser to a wider screen,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:31.180
we want to switch around our two sections just like we see here on the final version.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.860
To do this, we're going to add a media query inside of our style sheet.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.410
At media, all screens,

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:47.440
and also the minimum width of 600 pixels.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.375
All of these styling from above will be defaults and applied from the beginning,

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:56.230
and then all of these style rules inside of this media query will only

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:00.505
apply once the screen reaches 600 pixels and above.

00:16:00.505 --> 00:16:04.000
The way we're going to do this is by using this flexbox and

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.035
changing the flex direction of these two sections to be row.

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:13.790
We can do this inside of the parent elements which is the game area.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.490
First of all, we need to set the display type to be flex,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.000
and the default flex direction is row so we don't need to add this in.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.940
Next, the image area,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.620
and also the stats.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.420
For these two areas just above,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.770
we set the minimum height to be 30 percent of the viewport height.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.440
Since we have more screen space available,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.570
I'm going to change this to be 50 percent.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.145
Inside of this image area which is on the right,

00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:55.405
we want this to overlap the stat section which is on the left.

00:16:55.405 --> 00:16:57.250
Just like the final version here,

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.615
we see that the right section is overlapping just a little.

00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:07.420
Now, the way we can do this is by using a CSS transform called translate.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:13.705
Translate is going to move our section across the x or the y-axis.

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:20.410
Let's take a look at how this works in our CSS by first targeting the image area.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.625
First of all, the border radius of three rems.

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:28.975
You can see rounded corners on all four sides,

00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:32.440
and then we can set the CSS transform.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.505
We see that there's lots of different types of transform we can use.

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:42.025
There are things such as scale to scale up or scale down the size of our elements.

00:17:42.025 --> 00:17:44.425
We can also rotate our elements.

00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:47.515
But the one we're interested in is translate.

00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:50.410
Inside of here, we can set Alpha,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.430
we want to move our elements on the x and the y-axis.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:18:00.730
The first one is the x-axis which is across the page from left to right, so 50 pixels.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.370
Then the y-axis which is top to bottom, 500 pixels.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:13.105
This is now pushed our elements over by 50 pixels and also down by 500 pixels.

00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:17.545
We're only interested in moving our element over to the left,

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:20.935
so we are only interested in the x-axis.

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:24.009
Let's just use one of these values,

00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:27.500
and instead, we can use a negative value.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.485
This would be three rems.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:34.150
This now pulls our image section over to the left by

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.645
three rems so it slightly overlaps the stat section.

00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:42.335
Now, let's target the stat section.

00:18:42.335 --> 00:18:44.770
First of all, we do some spacing,

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.400
we can use the flex property and a value of one.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.650
If we then set the value inside of the image area to be two,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:59.900
our image area will then try to take over twice the available space as our stat section.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.765
For this area, we also need to adjust the border-radius,

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:08.750
so we just have this on the top left and the bottom left too.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:14.094
The border-radius, three rems on the top-left,

00:19:14.094 --> 00:19:19.300
zero, zero, and three rems on the bottom left too.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.190
The final thing we're going to do inside of

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.195
this media query is to account for this translate.

00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:30.085
We moved over this image section to the left by three rems.

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:35.020
Meaning, we now have some uneven spacing on the left and also the right.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.780
To compensate for this, we'll add three rems of margin on the left-hand side.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.550
This should take care of our spacing on the outside of the game,

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.145
but we also need to take care of the spacing inside of the stat section.

00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:56.970
We can do this by adding three rems of padding on the right-hand side.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.255
This is now it for the styling for this project.

00:20:04.255 --> 00:20:10.200
Next up, we're going to introduce some JavaScript by generating some random images.
