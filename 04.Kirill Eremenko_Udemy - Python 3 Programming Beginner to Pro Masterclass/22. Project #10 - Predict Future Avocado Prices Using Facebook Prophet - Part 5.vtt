00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.320
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.120
I'm super excited because now we're getting closer to actually predict our specific prices for the avocado.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.350
For that specific reason.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.390
OK so what I want you guys to do which is you know a little bit of a challenge.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.660
OK.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.090
That's kind of maybe it might be a little bit you know like like longer challenge.

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.810
I want you guys to pause the video OK and make an attempt to actually predict the data.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.490
So now I want just want you guys to go ahead repeat the exact same steps as we have done before.

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.640
So we can go up here.

10
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.700
I want you guys to first instantiate first of all change the name.

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.770
So we need to change the name of the column.

12
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.280
So here that is naming.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.500
So pretty much everything is the same here.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.550
Just this this instead of having the avocado profit the f we're going to do the avocado def sample which

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.080
is only specific for a specific region.

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.590
You let's recall let's do this.

17
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.850
I want you guys afterwards to do the profit to do the fit make predictions and plot the data.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.750
All right.

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.870
Peace pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

20
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.070
All right.

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.590
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.290
Let's go ahead and see what we could do here.

23
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.560
All right.

24
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.320
Well we could do going to say first of all we need to rename the columns.

25
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.530
Right.

26
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.730
So going to say avocado on the score def on the score sample that rename.

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.850
Right.

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:39.280
We're going to pass along our column equals to get a pass along our date and we're going to pass along

29
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.450
our D.S..

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.830
Right.

31
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.500
And we're going to here rename as well if you wanted to rename our average price.

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.730
So when I say average price we're going to rename it to why.

33
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.120
All right.

34
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.040
Looks good.

35
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.130
That's an actual I'm going to get here.

36
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.030
We're going to just put it into the sample again

37
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.760
so it looks good.

38
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.080
Let's take a look at it.

39
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.320
OK.

40
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.980
Looks good.

41
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.450
So we have now we have D.S. and we have Y.

42
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.820
Right.

43
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.790
OK.

44
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.340
Looks good.

45
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.010
So what we need to do that we need to go ahead and actually start to make making predictions.

46
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.250
All right.

47
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.940
Obviously what we could do as well is that we can we need to drop all these columns right.

48
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.180
Actually we can.

49
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.390
We need to do that beforehand if we want it to.

50
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.020
OK.

51
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.530
So he was sort of by region and actually missed.

52
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.220
Let's make it.

53
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.870
Let's give it a shot.

54
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.510
That's actually speed all that data into our profit and see what's going to happen and say Okay m equals

55
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.330
to Prophet.

56
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:57.230
Let's instantiate an object and let's go say Okay m dot fits and we're going to pass along.

57
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.930
Actually going to need that's going to use it several times

58
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.680
Strawn It's okay.

59
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.770
Looks good.

60
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.590
All right.

61
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.280
And let's go ahead and make predictions.

62
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.670
Let's look into the future.

63
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.550
Future equals to m dots make underscore futures.

64
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.230
The score data frame.

65
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.310
Right.

66
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.810
And we can specify our period equals to three hundred and sixty five.

67
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.280
And then afterwards we're going to use the predict.

68
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.420
So going to say forecast equals to m dot.

69
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.560
Predict that we'll look into the future and we're going to pass along our future.

70
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.600
All right let's run.

71
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.780
That's OK.

72
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.010
There's an error.

73
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.330
So here I'm saying m dot make underscore future data frame periods so there's periods here.

74
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.570
Let's run it seeking a bit of why it looks good

75
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.530
afterwards we're gonna go ahead so now it's done.

76
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.960
Actually if you guys realize it took a little bit shorter than before why.

77
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.470
Because we're only working on a subset of data and they'll actually appear when we actually start plotting

78
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.490
the data too.

79
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.380
So let's go ahead.

80
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.150
Going to take a figure equals to m dot plots and I'm gonna say let's plot the forecast and it's plot

81
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:30.460
x label equals to date and let's plot the Y label equals to our price already.

82
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.920
Let's run that.

83
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.860
All right looks perfect.

84
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.850
So this is a data that's our data points right.

85
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.570
That's our trend in here.

86
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.620
And if these guys take a look here you find the data points topped here.

87
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.960
Right.

88
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.340
So the data points taut and that's what basically the prediction is doing.

89
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.450
Prediction is saying OK this is the prediction for the price for that specific region.

90
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.750
OK guys try to go ahead here and try to compare it to before you will find that the trend actually differs

91
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.210
here is the trend you know looks like it's slid a little bit like going down.

92
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.010
That's over the over the entire market right over the overall data that we have.

93
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.390
However here the data looks like it's going you know maybe a little bit trending up a little bit the

94
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.990
is going to be down but it's going up here measure and measure.

95
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.100
Which means it's not haphazard.

96
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.370
OK.

97
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.930
These like these like the profit thing is not it's not it's not like you know random you know random

98
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.130
operations actually has a lot of mathematics behind it has a lot of smartness behind it.

99
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:37.040
OK let's go ahead and let's plot components or to say m dot plot underscore components.

100
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.390
And I'm gonna say forecast and that will going to be let's say my figure in here.

101
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.690
Let's run it's beautiful.

102
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.470
Together you can see the trend is going up.

103
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.250
So you're expecting for that specific reason the price will reach point one point seven dollars.

104
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.520
And that's the yearly trend.

105
00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.860
So it seems like the yearly trend goes here you know up at around July goes peaks and then goes down

106
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.030
back afterwards to January.

107
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.040
All right.

108
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.230
And that concludes the case study and that concludes our project.

109
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.300
I hope you guys enjoy that project and see you guys in the next project.
