1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,970
I know everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,130
We're going to learn how can we install Anaconda which is the development environment.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:15,450
They're going to be use maybe using their older course to develop old codes or I mean the anaconda is

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,990
a famous development environment among Python three developers many for machine learning and deep learning

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,360
and Capriccio vision.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,140
You use it as well.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,720
Here it is develop pretty much most of our codes in the beginners section and in the practical section

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,210
as well.

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,800
All right so the good thing about the anaconda is it's very easy to install.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,740
It's you're going to show you that you can use what we call a Jupiter node books as well in which you

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,570
can run the code and actually view the results right away it just in one in one block.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,880
It is very interesting and it's very easy to set up I going to show you right there right.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,360
So the first step is I want you to go ahead then start the course material and unzip it you'll find

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,710
a One's a folder that contains all the coarse material.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,320
All right.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,930
And then next step is to install Anaconda for Python 3.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,000
So if you go head to Anaconda dot come back says don't vote and you will see that there is depending

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,460
on your operating system if you are windows a Mac you can just click on windows and then you download

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,330
Python 3.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,840
We're not downloading Python too well meaning to download Python 3.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,780
And if you have 64 bit or 32 bit most of the time you're going to have 64 bit like a do if you're just

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,690
going to click here.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,780
You don't have to enter your email but you can just enter all the information that you wanted here.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,620
Then you get to see it and once you see it is just going to keep keep going keep ahead and with installation

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,370
and once the installation is complete I want you to go ahead and install open civi and intensive flop.

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,350
We're going to be using it mainly in the in some of the prises and are going to be using this with tons

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,090
of flow in some of the machine learning section of the course already.

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,820
So if you open here if Anaconda you're going to right click here.

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,780
Any save run as administrator.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,100
Okay yes that would open your command prompt here and then what I wanted to do with them wanted to write

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:18,270
simply Conda install deste s Channel hgt s again Conda and a candidate or backslash tempo and then open

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,860
CV 3 which is simply what you guys can see here.

33
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,470
Once you do that and click enter then you're solving environment and you get to prompt you for a yes

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,940
or no.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,100
You can press yes.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Going to show you right now.

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,990
And then here we're going to prompt you to proceed or not.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,430
So you going to say yes press enter.

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,250
Then you will see that there is downloading and accepting the packages.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,810
So it will take a couple of minutes which is going to run.

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,120
We go back again later.

42
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,570
Then go ahead then install a flow sensor flow.

43
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,420
We're going to mainly be using for the machine learning section in this course.

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,320
So if you open a Honda and right click on it and see Run as Administrator look.

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,700
Yes and then what.

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:23,300
Going to write Pip install that there ignore that installed a dash upgrade flow and that's what you

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,750
can see here as well.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,180
Right in the instructions and press enter and found in N is told to flow for you.

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,140
All right so now you are a pretty much good to run the optimal book.

50
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,220
You have open civi installed you have all the packages installed and you have as well offensive flow

51
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,300
installed as one.

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,900
So let me show you how can we actually launch a Jupiter book and run through an example.

53
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,690
So if you go here you were simply wrong.

54
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:59,450
The anaconda prompt if you run that and then you will open the right Jupiter notebook and press enter.

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,070
You will see that basically that opens in you kind of window in here and guess I can see you can just

56
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,250
straight A See.

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,690
Only a of top for instance just going to go to the installed folder that you already have for the entire

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,670
course package.

59
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,440
Whatever you install them on the desktop for example.

60
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,980
So here I just added the python general.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,090
Some course package that's where the data is in store.

62
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,230
And if you open course to practical projects and here let's open the testing environment mainly fall.

63
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,100
And you would see set simply here an environmental testing kind of a sample code.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,570
And there was that image as well that's contained in you as well of you know of two dÃºchas you know

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,780
like a famous politician in.

66
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,340
So if you open that here you would see that kind of you know that's where there's you know look we're

67
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,880
going to show show us.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,520
So I guess I can see here you would see that.

69
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,880
You can this kind of a simple cold that you're already ready written in.

70
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,170
You know as part of of course I'm going to walk you through the code.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,840
You can understand every single line step by step.

72
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,900
So when you open Jupiter modbook that's that's kind of a sample.

73
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,410
That's what we what it actually looks like.

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,220
You would see that you can actually see the mounds of code in here.

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,860
All right.

76
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,610
And simply if you don't know you want to run this specific blocks you can just press shift centres if

77
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,690
you press shift into that on this specific block.

78
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,280
All right.

79
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,130
If you wanted to run for example the next block you can just come in here and press shift into well

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,800
what I want to do is just the objective of this is to see if you actually if the environment is set

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
up properly or not.

82
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,470
All right.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,220
Well I guess I can see it as well that you can write text in there which has you know kind of lines

84
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,990
of which kind of lines the VA.

85
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,630
They won't be executed as part of the code.

86
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,340
All right.

87
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,580
Speed interesting because now you can actually right kind of you know and that's kind of the standard

88
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,210
that I'm following through the course.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,780
It can include all the lecture notes within the areas you know.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,330
So you have kind of your notes along with the codes Gabby kind of you know intact in one place in one

91
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,510
stop shop are going to be very easy for you to access the optimal books and test all the information

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,790
just one place so you can see here for on and on this cell is going to chip into again but shift into

93
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,740
Right and you will see that you know like here it just changes a little bit.

94
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,730
Then it turned out to become like kind of a number which means that the cell has been successfully executed.

95
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,900
If anything goes on you'll see there's an error in you know everything turns red but hopefully you won't

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,070
see any of that.

97
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,680
You're going to run this again.

98
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,380
And once you've done this you will see that you know it's still kind of you know like like like running

99
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,340
something here.

100
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,220
If you go here with you there's an image of you know like Justin trudeau here appeared on the Im on

101
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,010
the on the screen.

102
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,570
All right.

103
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,190
Okay.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,240
And you see that basically again I'm going to show you that one more Falwell.

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,690
But he did just you know swaying the computer was kind of waiting for you to enter to enter like press

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,470
any anything.

107
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,780
So he would press Enter just to give that you would see that he gone already and are going to run the

108
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,560
next cell and you will see that you know that's kind of one fun party would see that.

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,070
You know that's kind of our image became kind of a cartoon effect.

110
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,530
And that's one of the you know all kind of fun project we might be working on on how to test for an

111
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,890
image whatever image you can upload even your own image to kind of a to an effect you can you know show

112
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,070
it to your friends and family and it kind of you know like showcase you have Python Python skills.

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,060
Once you run that you press enter and exit.

114
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,490
Right.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,020
And let's keep going.

116
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,420
If you keep running.

117
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,840
So is he not running shift into again shift into one more time shift into one more time shift into an

118
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,850
Now to the kind of you know like that again and other fun activity we can be can do if you press shift

119
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,580
into.

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,730
You will see that you know like that's pretty interesting you will see that kind of image in here you

121
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,790
know kind of you know through the webcam and you will see that there is kind of you know like etch your

122
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,150
images Well look kind of an edge detection algorithm that's running in the background.

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Showing us we're here which is you know hopefully when everything's running perfectly You should see

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,030
you know your image and you should see as well that you were wrong.

125
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,930
You're a kind of edge detection showing all the features in here which is very interesting.

126
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,490
All right.

127
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,110
OK.

128
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,930
I hope I hope they called again once you press entrance should exit.

129
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,260
I hope the code will run and everything will be set up properly.

130
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,560
Now we're pretty much ready to start the first letter of the courts.

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,220
I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next section.
