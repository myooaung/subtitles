00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.620
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.380
We're going to keep going and finish off the exercises that we have for the print and get user data

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.780
from the input.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.500
So the exact number for is we're asking the users to write it.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.260
I can use to write a code that takes to integer values from the user and print out the summation and

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.000
multiplication.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
Something like that and then insert number into another engine on an position equals to addition equates

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.840
to.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.680
You guys should be should be easy it should be straightforward.

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.610
You guys are you know once a place to be experts now statistical looking to say okay equals two I'm

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.780
going to say it's open.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm going to say okay input because I want to add data from the user input up in parentheses and then

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.050
he's going to say okay enter any integer number right.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500
Collins looks good.

15
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.060
Okay.

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.530
Perfect.

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.280
And then do the exact same thing but are going to do it for B.

18
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.560
Right.

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.600
And looks great again into.

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.380
But I wanted to see another another.

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.790
Move any.

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.860
I'm going to say that another integer number looks good too.

23
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.650
And I wanted to simply print the result for multiplication and addition.

24
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.090
Okay print or print print these again double quotes.

25
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.900
I'm going to say okay multiplication model to location all right equals two.

26
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.190
And I wanted to clear something here.

27
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.830
And as the rocket quickly brackets.

28
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.210
Right.

29
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.590
Forget it remember this.

30
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.830
Okay.

31
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.690
Addition actually to make it small as an addition equals to another really becket's.

32
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.240
Looks great and they used the format method music dot format.

33
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.720
And I'm going to pass along basically the multiplication and the addition.

34
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.460
Okay.

35
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.180
A multiply by B.

36
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.170
Good do a comma a say a plus b r eight.

37
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.410
Let's run it.

38
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.580
So in C case for example it equals to five or four.

39
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.460
I'm going to say OK and of the in let's say five five for example and then you came of the position

40
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.050
is twenty six looks great.

41
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.290
Five four times five is twenty and then addition is nine which looks perfect.

42
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.500
Gail isn't on one much time and you get another shot.

43
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.360
Let's say three and let's see nine looks good.

44
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.960
Nine times three twenty seven and then seditionist 12 looks great.

45
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.780
OK.

46
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.530
Right.

47
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.870
Called Question five radical that takes the value from the user and simply princeville the number.

48
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.870
It's Square and it's a cubic value.

49
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.650
Let's take a look.

50
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.990
So again as the user enters a number.

51
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.910
Going to go here.

52
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.670
Copy this simply say okay.

53
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.130
Input into a any integer number.

54
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.560
OK.

55
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.550
So there's got to it integer number and then I say okay I want it to print.

56
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.100
OK.

57
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.360
And then not to print anything.

58
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.900
Just want to print for 16 64.

59
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.430
That's the requirement and a sticky open brackets.

60
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.520
I'm going to say okay I need curly bracket right.

61
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.630
I'm going to say again I need another kaloo bracket right then that other Crowley bracket messy dot

62
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.530
format right Dot format or print.

63
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.880
I guess I need to pass along a which is the same value.

64
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.460
I need to pass along a Time's a right and a cube let's make it very simple.

65
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.640
Eight times eight times a.

66
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.050
That's it.

67
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.570
Let's see what's going to happen.

68
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.110
If you're on it and your kids say 5.

69
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.030
Now tell me actually it's 525 125 exect or expected it looks great.

70
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.310
All right.

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.290
The next question that we have is I'm asking to ask you to add a call that takes the temperature input

72
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.740
from the user in Celsius and convert it to fair tonight.

73
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.950
We have done that before.

74
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.770
This is the only difference is that I'm asking you to actually feed the data from the user.

75
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.020
So I'm going to say okay so see for example equal to it.

76
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.500
All right I'm going to say a key input.

77
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.280
Right.

78
00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:03.100
Open again brackets I'm going to say n30 temperature of temperature in degree Celsius Celsius.

79
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.990
Right.

80
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.700
And Colin looks good to me.

81
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.170
All right.

82
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.400
And that's the first step.

83
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.530
And then I'm going to say okay.

84
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.120
Fahrenheit.

85
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.990
Because as a member of the calculation equates to nine.

86
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.660
Right.

87
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.150
By the by five.

88
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.940
Right.

89
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.800
And they multiply that by the value of Celsius N without any prentice's of anything because President

90
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.000
doesn't hold here.

91
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.190
It's no need to do the president's operate because he are going to do the multiplication and division

92
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.150
first and then add along to afterwards if they do defer and height then you can actually print both

93
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.890
right away actually when a printed in that format of messick Print and I'm going to say okay print for

94
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.760
me please.

95
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.000
Temperature right in Celsius.

96
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.120
Right.

97
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.500
And what it could do going to take any column here and the little bit of space ending in a print.

98
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.980
The value of c and they need to print the units which is the greasy it's actually do that courtsey of

99
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.630
messick the greasy.

100
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.300
All right.

101
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.210
And if I copy that.

102
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.510
Copy and paste and an associate print temperature in Fahrenheit.

103
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.900
Fair Wren heights.

104
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.670
K equals two.

105
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.590
I'm going to print f am I on it.

106
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.540
He has to show it as just the value of f which is simply the notes on it.

107
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.490
And that's pretty much all what any they hope.

108
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.930
I didn't make any mistakes to give a shot.

109
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.360
Let's for example Clint let's say temperature room temperature 25 degrees C.

110
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.830
If you'd done it would that be temperature in incenses 25 degrees C in Fahrenheit that 77 degrees Fahrenheit

111
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.100
which is sounds about right.

112
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.880
Great.

113
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.780
Looks great.

114
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.490
Let's take a look at question number seven.

115
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.270
So question number seven asking the use of too radical the picks are less than with the verdict came

116
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.190
from the use of print the very end premiere again it looks very similar to what we have done before.

117
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.560
But here are some actions with the user.

118
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.840
Let's take a look.

119
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.940
It's okay again print.

120
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.100
I'm sorry to say equal is to say it's an imports from the user.

121
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.540
I'm going to print I mean his input inputs.

122
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.330
Open printers open prentice's massive kentish widths.

123
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.860
Right.

124
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.730
Get its first step looks good and again into length.

125
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.860
I'm going to say it's open inputs.

126
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.480
My apologies inputs and I will open again prentices and say okay enter lengths right.

127
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:35.190
Gail looks great and then I'm going to say okay area equates to lenth times with in a very simple form

128
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.500
and I want to get to the perimeter as well.

129
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.350
Let's say primitive equates to two times and I'm going to do then.

130
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.900
Plus width looks great as well.

131
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:53.070
They are right and I wanted to print it to the user rates and in to say keep print open parentheses

132
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.540
Methody Okay area equals to right and end.

133
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.590
I'm going for a maths method and here are going to take a comma.

134
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:12.000
They keep primitive primitive equal to an opening in another choli bracket people dot format.

135
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.220
And am going to pass along the value of it in order to a MP.

136
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.130
Eight.

137
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.250
Looks looks pretty good to me.

138
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.030
All right let's let's instead of.

139
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.060
Because I'm using all of the values here upper case.

140
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.420
Let's make it all uppercase with this will get to be w..

141
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.570
This is L..

142
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.220
This is going to qualify.

143
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.740
A.

144
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.110
Okay this is L A plus.

145
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.410
That looks good tends to mean equality.

146
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.290
And as he appears upper case makes sure that all of them are uppercase or at least trying to see what's

147
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.950
going to happen.

148
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.310
Let's assume going to pass along the value of three with three lenses to aiming to get the area to be

149
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.520
6 and perimeter equal pen which looks great to me and which makes sense of course.

150
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.060
All right.

151
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.720
OK I'm great.

152
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.900
The last example that we have is that I wanted to write a code a code that takes the radius of the circle

153
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.820
from the user and principally area they emit at a conference in the area or point out a squared M and

154
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.630
A to oddisee conference to power.

155
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.790
Let's take a look.

156
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:18.900
So what I wanted to do I wanted to simply improve the radius from the from using a c k are equals to

157
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.960
in brackets.

158
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.890
I say okay.

159
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.940
Input.

160
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.830
Because remember when I say okay what a message that I wanted to feed is a basically enteritidis of

161
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.730
a circle.

162
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.570
Actually copied from here and there are going to be passed along.

163
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.520
The radius of a circle k.

164
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.480
Looks great.

165
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.150
There will be the value of are what I wanted to do afterwards.

166
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.910
Okay I wanted to print them print for the first print.

167
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.180
I mean it's a print.

168
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.870
I'm going to tell it to a circle circle.

169
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:57.950
They ever write and column and I'm going to say it is simply two times.

170
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.400
Right.

171
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.770
So it's two times are all right.

172
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.000
Looks good to me.

173
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.750
I'm going to copy this again.

174
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.910
Again here I'm going to say okay I wanted to circle a long circle a.

175
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.730
Area here is simply point out a square right.

176
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.300
So I'm going to say okay I need to do PI are square.

177
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.230
So I need to do something which is pi.

178
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.390
I'm going to show you something right now.

179
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.630
PI are square.

180
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.530
So you do this and not to do squared what I'm going to do going to do basically to start as if it causes

181
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.070
a membership and make it square.

182
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.740
But the only difference here.

183
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.830
I can simply write the PI 24 instead using the maths.

184
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:44.130
If you as a member of the maths module I can actually import maths and then I can use maths that Pi

185
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.800
is with the actual value of pies defined separately.

186
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.080
Let's actually take a look even outside of this woman M import imported let's say maths here on its

187
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.650
own.

188
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.610
An American and you are going to say okay maths dot pi.

189
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.430
Let's take a look at the value.

190
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.690
If you do it you actually get a return seapoint 140.

191
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:08.440
It's way more detailed way more accurate than just using the One Ford which is kind of an approximation.

192
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.620
So what I could do here is put in maths.

193
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.560
What I could do you're going to say okay maths.

194
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.470
Maths.

195
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.350
DOT.

196
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.200
PI.

197
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.310
Right.

198
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.860
And they'll be the multiplication.

199
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.130
So here I simply.

200
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.220
Oh my apologies.

201
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.310
This is two times.

202
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:21.650
This is.

203
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.410
This is separate.

204
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.800
This looks good here.

205
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.720
Now multiply maths does.

206
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.320
I say multiply pi.

207
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.920
Times are times the power of squit which is spiotta Square which is the area which looks great.

208
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.560
The last one that I want a copy that's going to do it.

209
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.990
An analysis circle and a copy axis at a conference.

210
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:54.920
And a copy of circle of conference equals 2 to pi are going to see achates two times pi times are gay

211
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.780
and I don't need this.

212
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.290
Okay so it's two pi.

213
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.430
OK looks great.

214
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.490
Let's give a shot.

215
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.450
It's an integer value of three for example radius.

216
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.400
In your case there is six.

217
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.910
The Circle area is twenty eight point two and the circle side conference is eighteen point eight four

218
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.020
and that's it.

219
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:21.000
Now he is supposed to be familiar with print and has to get data as well from the use in using the Input.

220
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.840
Great job.

221
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.920
You guys should be proud.

222
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.110
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

223
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.990
And see you in the next section.
