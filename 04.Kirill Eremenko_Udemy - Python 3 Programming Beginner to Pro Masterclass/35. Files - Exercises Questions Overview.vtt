00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.050
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.380
We're going to walk you through the questions later to files operation.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.390
OK and then we're going to go ahead and the next video and I want to walk you through the solutions.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.900
Kind of detailed video explanations of all the solutions for these questions.

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.530
All right.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.540
So the first question we have here is a mascot to read the failed fruits underscored input the text.

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.690
You guys will find that file in the course package.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.530
So if you go here you will find that our text file OK.

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.360
It basically has kind of a bunch of a bunch of fruit names you know like Apple avocado banana whatever.

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.940
And you know it has a bunch of like you know some other stuff as well.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.750
So it has maybe like exclamation mark here there's like a percentage sign and so on.

12
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.300
All right.

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.570
And what I'm asking you to do.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.400
Let's minimize that is to read the file and print its content.

15
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.320
It's really simple question number two of asking to read the file as well and remove all the new lines.

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.070
So any new line I want you to remove and I wanted to remove as well.

17
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.150
Any special characters.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.650
And then save the output file in fruits open the text OK.

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.550
All right.

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.390
And then question number three I'm asking you to do the same thing pretty much so read the file again

21
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.330
remove all the new lines move the special characters and remove any lines that does not represent the

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.900
fruit.

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.620
So in the beginning actually of the of here for example you'll find there is you know here is the list

24
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.440
of fruits here that is thought of list.

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.350
I wanted you guys to remove these two as well.

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.640
And I think at the end as well there is you know after this that it's like kind of many maybe an ending

27
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.140
statement.

28
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.320
I want you guys to remove it too.

29
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.610
So basically here what I want to do is only to see names of fruits.

30
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.890
All right.

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.710
So that will be the outcome that will be the output the expected output.

32
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.990
All right.

33
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.040
So simply clear everything just make it fruits and only fruits.

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.000
All right.

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
Question number four I'm asking you to read the file fruits underscore input the text and compare it

36
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.140
to the list of fruits in my fruits which is simply here.

37
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.760
I have a list.

38
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.400
We'll call it.

39
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.200
Let's actually include this one second.

40
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.730
So what we could do here.

41
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.840
I'm asking us to simply compare.

42
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.960
That's what we have here to compare this is a list of my fruit.

43
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.200
OK.

44
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.320
So is Apple pepper orange.

45
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.380
This is part of the questions about what I'm asking you to do is simply compare the all the elements

46
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.480
within the.

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.070
My fruits the text file and see if they're matching to this or not.

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.050
OK.

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.890
And just print the matching elements only.

50
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.450
All right so obviously peppers for example is not a fruit so it's not contained within their tomatoes

51
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.810
as well as not contained.

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.460
So I want you guys to kind of you know there is a little before loops that will be opening to the file

53
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.730
there'll be comparison and so on.

54
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.680
Question number five mascot try to code that takes an input from a user and store it in a new text file

55
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.050
separated by new lines.

56
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.710
So just enter whatever words and then get to save it in a new file.

57
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.470
You know I'm going to learn how to do appending for example how to append names to a file.

58
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.890
Question number six I'm asking you to read the CSB file as an S&amp;P 500 underscore stock and the score

59
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.850
data the CSB and print out the heading.

60
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.930
And first five rows of data.

61
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:34.420
So if you guys go here you will find that this is the S&amp;P 500 so it's simply showing you know interest

62
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.440
rates showing employment showing S&amp;P price and what I'm asking you guys to do is to simply load that

63
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.210
CSP file.

64
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.100
So I'm asking best to read it to see as we file and printout the heading just the headings.

65
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.790
So I want you guys to print this.

66
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.420
Basically which has rates interest rates employment and S&amp;P price and then I'm asking you guys to print

67
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.990
the first five rows of the data.

68
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.990
So just the first five rows that are contained within the sheet.

69
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.270
So something like this.

70
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.380
So that's the requirement.

71
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.630
That's what I wanted to print and then print the first five names first five elements.

72
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.320
Question number seven I'm asking you to write a code that takes several inputs from a user as long as

73
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.980
the user does not enter stop.

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.550
So simply here we can be kind of stuck in a loop in a way you know like asking you know what I want

75
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.890
a while loop you know asking to enter something you enter a word like hello world happy learning and

76
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.070
so on and save that data into our profile and then unless they use it enters top.

77
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.460
And that's where they code we're gonna stop going to exit basic close the file and Exit Question number

78
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.910
eight.

79
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.460
I'm asking theoretical that searches for all text files and work on your computer and print out all

80
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.900
the files in their path.

81
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.570
So something like this for example here is looking for files operation in protects fruits you know these

82
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.050
are all the files you know that are contained that the text mainly in my in my root directory.

83
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.140
Okay.

84
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.090
So please here there's a little bit of extensive research you would find that there is you need to do

85
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.550
is walk again if you guys get stuck in here don't worry about it.

86
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.550
The objective again is to free guys to maybe practice stretch your limits as much as you can.

87
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.480
Duke's in the research.

88
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.850
If not we're gonna have a detailed video explanation for this as well.

89
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.300
And then lecture question number nine I'm asking you to write a code that will search for images on

90
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.430
your computer and return a list of all images.

91
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.960
So here I am searching for J P G.

92
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.690
JP G M P G extension extensions for your for the images.

93
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.400
All right.

94
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.640
And by the end of the section you guys should be familiar with files operations.

95
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.450
Great job.

96
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.880
Best of luck and we'll see you guys in the next lecture.
