00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,820
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,200
We're going to walk you through the questions for the list.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,720
OK.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,950
So please try to attempt to solve them.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,640
If not that's not a problem.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to have a detailed video explanations of other solutions simply in the next event.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,580
All right.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,710
Let's get started.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,410
So here we actually have around.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,540
We have eight questions.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,520
OK.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,790
And the first question that we have here is that I give you a list that has names equal to Sierra Chanel

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:37,150
and Mike Ryan wholy Alex of Rob and asking you to print first second and last elements in the list.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,810
That's what I wanted to do to sprint.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,790
You know like Sarah Chanel and Prince Harry.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,720
Okay.

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,690
I hope that will be.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,050
Please step forward.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,890
Your next question I'm asking you to again giving you the green much you seem pleased.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,460
I'm asking you to print all elements in the list.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,330
Print Chanel metaldyne which is simply here for these elements.

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,990
They print the first three elements which is these the elements print the last three elements which

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,900
is here.

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,110
And Skip each other element.

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,480
Again we didn't cover that.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,430
Simply I want to print it say ceara and then skip Chanel pretty much skip orionis slipped into holy

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,300
and so on.

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,100
We did a cover that again there's kind of you know one in an extended research that you need to do if

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,310
you can do it that's fine we can Willow.

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,640
We're going to walk you through it in these solutions sections.

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,450
All right.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,170
The next question is I wanted to print sallie's.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,080
SARAH Sally Jo and then print Ali for example with two different ways.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,800
Okay.

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,220
Like cream.

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,870
The last element here in two different ways.

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,610
Again this kind of exercise for nested list which is a list.

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,150
All right.

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,930
Inside Inside the big list here that we have here again we have couple of a couple of examples before

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,870
in the concept lecture and you guys would find it that's true for the next question that we have.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,340
I wanted to print the length of the list and add your name to the list which is kind of you know we

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,120
do kind of exteriorly search using the append here method.

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,710
So simply I have my list here and I'm asking you to print the length of the list.

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,270
We cover that.

45
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,540
That's easy.

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,880
Add your name to the list.

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,890
I want you here the end to just add your name on top of it.

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,430
OK so I have to use the pen here method somehow.

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,230
Again this is kind of a more of an externally research just for you guys to you know practice a little

50
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,470
bit.

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,450
How can you actually go ahead and look for additional concepts that are not covered within the lecture.

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,760
OK question number five is we want you to remove the name Peter.

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,620
So here we have I wanted to remove this knee from the list using two different methods.

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,090
Again this is kind of you know an extended search.

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,260
I wanted to use the Remove method.

56
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,930
Any medium we use as well delete or to Dell.

57
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,730
OK so just how can you actually delete a specific element within your list.

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,950
There's a lot of the research here and this exercise no problem no worry.

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,910
Again the objective is for you guys to practice as much as you can using stuff or topics that are not

60
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,010
covered within the lecture.

61
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,600
The next exercise I wanted to be sordid elements in a list and be versed on elements to go from maximum

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,660
to minimum.

63
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,520
So I'm giving you here a list I want you to sort it.

64
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,870
OK.

65
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,230
So I need to apply again kind of a sort method printed.

66
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,040
And I want you to again reverse it so make it you know it's going from minimum to Max.

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,710
I want to go from Maximin.

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,340
All right.

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,860
Question 7 I wanted to create a new list that contained the last elements in the nested list.

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,140
So simply put I want I wanted to do it they want you to print the last elements Only with chocolate

71
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,570
on the OK potatoes and protein bar right.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,850
Try to figure out here there's no it's in the least Shiria we covered that in the in our election.

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:02,840
And the last exercise that I want you to create a list of with five of your closest friends and sort

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
them at phonetically.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,460
So you need to just create the list whatever names you have of your closest friends and sort them in

76
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,250
and out for better or right.

77
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,660
And that's pretty much all what I have with this lecture.

78
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,390
Good luck.

79
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,790
I hope you guys we're going to enjoy that.

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,320
And if not again if you get stuck Don't worry.

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,530
We're going to have detailed explanations in the solutions lecture.

82
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,720
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,790
See you in the next hour.
