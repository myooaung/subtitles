00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.110
We're going to go through the solutions mainly for the for the questions that you guys had regarding

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
the very available datatype mathematical operations presidents and really well a right.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.850
Okay so let's take a look at the first question.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.740
So what will this could generate.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
So here I am asking you what do you guys expect.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.290
So simply put if we get a call How do we do very well assignment.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.770
So here we put 10 in two X and then here we put 20 on top of X again which means that we overwrote what

9
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.370
we had before and then it puts 15 on top of X..

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.580
Then I'm asking you to print X to tell me what's happening with x.

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.570
So obviously what are going to see here again without even running the code that X will have the latest

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
value or the most up to date value which is 15.

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.550
All right let's try on it.

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600
So when you're on it you actually come up with 15 which makes complete sense.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.540
Perfect.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.950
You guys were able to figure it out on your own.

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.190
The next question that I'm asking you to do is I wanted to get the type of x you used to call we had

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410
integer data type.

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.530
We had float data.

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.320
So here is because we put 10 in 2 X or 15 which is most up to date value into X from asking for the

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.370
type of x we should be expecting an integer value which makes complete sense again.

22
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.890
All right.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.990
Perfect.

24
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.320
All right so here I'm asking you to get OK.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.680
What about Z equals 2 X divided by Y.

26
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
Okay so I take X which is the most updated value which is 15.

27
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.200
OK.

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.950
If I divided by Y and I put it in Z Okay and then I wanted to plot What's the value of z on that.

29
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.790
Now we educate.

30
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.980
There is a problem section in Y is not even defined case where I'm asking you to do.

31
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.510
OK.

32
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.670
Hope you as well you were able to figure that out.

33
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.270
It's just go here and right.

34
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.470
Let's say y equal to let's say 3 for example right before doing this for actually running this game.

35
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.190
If I run it that would tell me the result of Z would be equal to 5 and then I'm asking you to write

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.850
okay what's a type of Z.

37
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.370
Afterwards if I had that that would tell me well the type of Z is actually float which means Because

38
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.350
here I'm performing kind of the division here.

39
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.220
Even if he did take a look at the numbering see this number it becomes 5.0.

40
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.340
Which means there's a fraction of a fraction an element associated with it and that's why the type becomes

41
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.280
float instead of actually having an integer value.

42
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.020
OK.

43
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.640
Right.

44
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.690
OK.

45
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.890
Great.

46
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.670
Perfect.

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.420
The next question that we have is we want you to write a code and that code will simply take a take

48
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.720
B and basically read the area and the perimeter of our rectangle.

49
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.210
So these are kind of the simple calculation here.

50
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.650
And then that's new to just assume any values for A and for B OK all right.

51
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.910
Let's take a look.

52
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.300
So here I am asking you to define a and find.

53
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.500
So going to say okay let's say eight equals two.

54
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.370
Let's say two for example.

55
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.020
I'm asking is Where would be equal to let's say three or.

56
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.150
And they found that there were 10.

57
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.540
Me Okay.

58
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.420
Now I'd rent a and b put two into a and I could see into B and then I wanted to define again if you

59
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.160
called a very difficult area and inside my area I'm going to put a multiply by B B.

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.610
If I add on that that will tell me basically.

61
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.790
Then you would say the cell has been ran already but I don't see anything because I plot plotted or

62
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.650
get a copy.

63
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.980
I'm going to paste in around it.

64
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.260
There was the enemy in my area with the six which makes sense.

65
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.200
I wanted to add a couple of new cells I mean I'll just do a They'll create more new sounds.

66
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.070
So that's kind of you know half of the question.

67
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.010
The second question is I wanted to through the perimeter which is two times bracket apprentices a plus.

68
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.560
Let's do that.

69
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.180
And then I say okay you get quality perimeter's just call it pair for example a preliminary equal to

70
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.330
say to multiply by and that's very important.

71
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.900
If Do not please don't illustrate a plus b.

72
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.930
Okay why.

73
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.590
Because according to presidents if you do that that means you get to do multiplication first and then

74
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.090
the result we're going to be added to B which is not true.

75
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.530
The key element here is that you need to add the parentheses.

76
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.660
Actually has been listed as well here.

77
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.680
That's kind of a hint for you as when you are controlling the perimeter anyways so here we're going

78
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.440
to do again two times a plus b.

79
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.530
Okay that will click.

80
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.700
My perimeter if I done that and if I wanted to let the view the perimeter I run it.

81
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.450
That will give me some value of 10 which is basically the perimeter.

82
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.890
If I have the two sides to and three you guys again can come up with any values and here's to come up

83
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.730
with whatever values.

84
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.460
But there's kind of you know that pretty much standard answer.

85
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.770
This is kind of the brain behind it.

86
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.340
When you do this once you have these right then you're good to go.

87
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.810
Then you answered the question right.

88
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.230
OK the next question I have for you is what will this code generate.

89
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.200
What do you expect to here.

90
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.550
So you did find a couple of variables x Equus 25 y 20 equals 3 and F equals to.

91
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.400
And I'm asking you to pick the answer key.

92
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.760
What is the answer of X minus Y Times Z divided by F OK again.

93
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.030
Obviously I'm not asking you to run the code because if you wanted to that would just simply cannot

94
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.340
generate the values.

95
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.270
But here again I'm asking you to do just give me like what do you expect even in a calculator proceed

96
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.040
from an on a calculator which is going to multiply again.

97
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.490
First you're going to do the prentice's first grade to get the x minus y.

98
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:42.780
So 25 minus 20 that will generate 5 great and then multiply the value 5 by Z which is 3 and then divide

99
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.230
by F..

100
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.710
Which is too great.

101
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.620
Right let's sit on it and let's see what's going to happen.

102
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.380
So I think that's okay.

103
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.860
Let's run this list on this one and then if I of the answers that will generate seven point five.

104
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.530
Okay all right.

105
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.880
You guys were able to figure that out.

106
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.420
Here what I'm asking to do is that I'm asking okay beside this when I ask you to add to kind of the

107
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.240
parentheses here to exact the same mathematical operation but I'm adding prentice's here.

108
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.830
What do you guys expect.

109
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.580
Actually if you run it you'll come up with the exact same value.

110
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.370
Why.

111
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.700
Because here the division is has a C pretty much the same kind of thing.

112
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.550
It doesn't really matter because if you once you add these practices right whatever value if you multiply

113
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.570
first and then divide it doesn't really matter.

114
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.640
Okay so the key element here is you need to add the parentheses here.

115
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.610
That's what matters.

116
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.200
This will make a difference.

117
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.010
Other than that does it really matter here What happened is you think there is on Multiply by Z and

118
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.200
then 0 taking the Z divided by F and then multiply as well.

119
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.150
They have the speed about the same order the same president's head is pretty much the same.

120
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.210
Surely the exact same result because there is no additional subtraction which might cause issues.

121
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.500
What about here.

122
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.330
If I do this what's going to happen is going to again do this first.

123
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.250
And whatever the result multiplied by Z divided by f k for I that there actually is an exact same result

124
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.990
which makes sense OK.

125
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.810
However if I go for example I remove let's say X minus Y for it to come up with a totally different

126
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.140
answer.

127
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.860
Why.

128
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.390
Because this we're going to be performed first.

129
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.260
OK which is prentice's time multiplication first and then the result we're going to be subtracted minus

130
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.710
X.

131
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.060
OK that's totally different.

132
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.270
However once you have these parentheses here okay and you're on it then you're good to go.

133
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.030
Okay.

134
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.710
Actually.

135
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.180
It's because I added his Z as kind of part of the answer.

136
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.810
That's why.

137
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.330
And so is messed up.

138
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.780
So that's why we need to go ahead and run them all again.

139
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.710
And that's why I'm up with the exact same answer which is to live with faith.

140
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.320
Or.

141
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.310
Okay great.

142
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.420
I hope you guys were able to figure that out as well.

143
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.250
Okay.

144
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.410
For question for I'm asking you to write a code to test if a number is even or odd gay.

145
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.460
So let's assume you're going to take just whatever number say X equals to 20 for instance.

146
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.850
And number two here I'm going to do simply take the value of x and test if the number is even an hour.

147
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:11.150
If you guys recall that we use the mod to give me the remainder value Okay let's start afresh at.

148
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.450
If I think let's say the value of x and do percentage get and then divided by two.

149
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.710
All right that will give me whatever value of x when divided by two.

150
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:27.830
And will give me the remainder of that number which is in this case 20 is actually divisible to the

151
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.800
remainder is going to be equal to zero.

152
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.580
Okay so I'm going to do here.

153
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.700
I'm going to check for example on the value of Y's still going say y equals to the remainder of this

154
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.370
operation.

155
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.920
Okay let's add on it.

156
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.100
Let's run it and let's plot or let's have you why.

157
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.880
So simply put what I could do here is going to test okay if y or if there's value here.

158
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.210
The result of this operation is zero.

159
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.410
That number is even.

160
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.080
Ok if that is all key it is one that mean that number is odd.

161
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.700
That's it.

162
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.370
That's pretty much a test.

163
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.560
Obviously when we move forward and you know kind of you know go through the code of advanced topics

164
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:10.010
we're going to learn about if condition Okay and how can we actually perform kind of kind of a condition

165
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.120
statement here.

166
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.160
We did uncover that.

167
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.230
So I'm just you know the overall idea is to pick a number divided by two and test if the number is even

168
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.560
amended to 0.

169
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.620
That means that even the remainder is not equal to zero.

170
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.740
That means it is OK.

171
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.760
OK let's give it a shot.

172
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.380
Let's assume that we're going to test it for 25.

173
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:34.520
If I had done it 25 25 divided by two did that mean the remainder would be equal to one.

174
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.230
That means why.

175
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.730
Because 25 is action not divisible by two.

176
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.730
That's why you come up with the remainder that indicates then that number simply is an odd.

177
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.970
OK I'm perfect.

178
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.340
I hope you guys were able to figure that out as well.

179
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.990
Okay here I'm asking you it's a couple of cents first.

180
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.610
And here I am asking you to write a code x number.

181
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.880
Square that number and then take that result and gets its square back again.

182
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.810
So simply you would end up with the exact same or addition a value of that number.

183
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.840
Okay let's take a look.

184
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.010
So let's assume I'm going to define a value called x.

185
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.940
I'm going to put let's say Ford into it.

186
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:20.050
And in order to get the square of the value for you as it remember we did it would take X and we do

187
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.020
times times right.

188
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.680
And that will give me kind of this the the the power of.

189
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.380
In a way.

190
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:33.950
So get the so basically squared right and there will you get to put it in a let's say very book called

191
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.230
Y.

192
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.580
So I'm going to call it quits for going around it and then get to do four square.

193
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.460
And that should generate y value for it it 16 which makes sense.

194
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:50.690
Now I'm asking you to take the result and get and get the square root of it so you will end up basically

195
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.590
with the exact same number.

196
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.690
Is this kind of thinking for squaring it.

197
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.100
The genetics 16 get the square root that gives you need for temeka again.

198
00:10:59.610 --> 00:10:59.980
Right.

199
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.480
If you a call I cannot do this quedagh directly.

200
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.760
I know that I have to in order to do the square root and I say OK is that equal to mass.

201
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.730
Does it square root of the main value of my value Y.

202
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.810
Right but I can do this.

203
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:21.080
I have to import because it is called import the module which is maths first gay.

204
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.740
Right.

205
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.710
If I did that and if I wanted to views that is going to list that here is just to review it.

206
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.030
That would really turn back again.

207
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.620
The value of.

208
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.690
Which makes sense took four square that the result got it square root and that would need the value

209
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.370
for which is pretty much exacting value that I started with 2 from the beginning.

210
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.510
OK and that's kind of a quick overview of the first quick solution of the first question that we had.

211
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.820
I hope you guys enjoy that.

212
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.630
And in the next election are going to keep going and I'm going to finish the seven remaining questions.

213
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.830
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next lecture.
