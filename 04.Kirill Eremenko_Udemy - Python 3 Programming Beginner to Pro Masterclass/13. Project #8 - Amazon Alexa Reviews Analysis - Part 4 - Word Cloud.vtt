00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.090
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lectures.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.110
I walk you through some data visualization so we're able to visualize a couple of of the information

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.360
here so we're able to visualize a couple of the positive feedbacks versus negative feedbacks we're able

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.230
to visualize how many ratings were five star ratings and so on.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.580
And we did some histogram analysis as well.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.330
And here we showed some bar plots showing the different variations within our product along with how

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.550
many were five stars and so on.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.820
And that was kind of overview of the data visualization.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.590
And this section I'm gonna walk you through kind of actually really interesting and fun way of doing

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.010
what called the word cloud.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.560
Okay.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.180
So what cloud clouds actually very powerful function that you could use.

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.000
That's kind of a library that you could use that you can simply shows you kind of you know how many

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750
words have been repeated for example.

15
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.710
We know within a specific text how many words like what's the other what's the what are the most famous

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.670
words in there.

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.620
In a very pretty like you know kind of nice way of visualization so let's take a look and see how can

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.080
we do this.

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.280
So first of all let's go to our def Alexa which is our data offering.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.270
And here we go that's our data frame.

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.870
And what we could do is say OK I wanted to do some analysis to my verified reviews right.

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.450
If you guys remember that is verified reviews here.

23
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.780
OK.

24
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.490
So let's go ahead and actually grab that column verify the reviews verified on the score reviews.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.560
All right.

26
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.410
And this is my column here.

27
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.320
It looks good.

28
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.170
So that's my that's actually press shift enter.

29
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.800
Here we go.

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.270
So he did this just the column that I'm interested in.

31
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.950
So what I wanted to do is actually apply that word cloud to all the text in here.

32
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.500
OK.

33
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.940
But the question is I need to organize it in a way that we have we can eliminate all the spaces and

34
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.660
we're going to have them in just one string.

35
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.200
So simply word cloud works by having one single string and you just going to call call the important

36
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580
input the library and then apply it right away.

37
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.420
And it's just called today.

38
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.130
All right so let's say how can we do that first.

39
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.580
What we're going to do we're going to say OK we're going to say words let's actually do that in a new

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.850
cell here.

41
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.860
So can I say key words equals to def on the Alexa.

42
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.490
And here I'm going to pass my verified reviews and what I'm going to do going to say a dot to list.

43
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.210
All right.

44
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.800
So what going to happen here if a plus shift enter.

45
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.480
And if I take a look at words because we're going to find that this is simply just all the text in there

46
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.750
transform into a list.

47
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.610
So this is the first f first review and that is common right.

48
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.250
There's another my second review this comma and then next review and this comment so simply have been

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.440
transformed all the data frame into a list of words basic.

50
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.140
OK.

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.650
All right maybe let's check how many what's the lengths of my words so we have around 31.

52
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.530
Three one hundred or thirty 150 words which is equivalent to how many reviews do we have.

53
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.790
Right.

54
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.460
OK good.

55
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.540
All right let's go ahead and what we need to do right now is to simply go ahead take all simply all

56
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.470
these like kind of list list of kind of you know of these things we're going to mix them together and

57
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.750
create one single string out of it.

58
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.610
Once you do that then what good.

59
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.300
So we're gonna say key words as one string obviously is very like kind of a basic way of programming.

60
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.190
But like I like it this way because you know when you say this you say words as one string and just

61
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.980
do an explanation.

62
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.880
Now what we're doing is simply combining all the words in there and make it an interesting one string.

63
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.840
So I'm gonna say okay what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say okay let's go ahead and put spaces and join.

64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.900
So I'm going to join all the words together Okay and let's go ahead and do this project enter.

65
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.490
And if I take a look at words as string it's printing Get out.

66
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.730
And here we go.

67
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.760
So now simply I have one single string that has every single kind of you know like review in there which

68
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.750
is amazing.

69
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.610
Let's take a look at actually the length of this one too so going to see lengths of words it's called

70
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.290
words as one string

71
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.740
words as one string.

72
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.080
Let's take a look at it.

73
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.300
And here we go.

74
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.860
These are all this every single word count in there.

75
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.910
So we simply have around four hundred and nineteen thousand words OK in every single review.

76
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.220
All right.

77
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.720
And that's pretty much it.

78
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.350
Now we are pretty much ready to go ahead and actually do the word cloud.

79
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.290
It's actually really simple mistake from words cloud.

80
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.340
We're going to import word clouds entered.

81
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.160
Looks good.

82
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.060
Please make sure that you have actually installed word cloud if you actually go up to my data overview

83
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.080
please make sure to install what cloud pip install word cloud.

84
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.240
If you have it installed everything is good.

85
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.210
You're just gonna go here once you're on that command.

86
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.410
It will show it should work fine and then afterwards we're going to say OK BLT that figure he get a

87
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.060
pass along our fig size equals two.

88
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.000
Let's say I'm going to make it 20.

89
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.790
Let's say by 20 and he's gonna say P L T that image show and here are going to simply pass along our

90
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.720
word clouds which is what I imported here.

91
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:55.450
Okay then open parentheses and then as a dot generate and hit I was just gonna pass along every single

92
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.920
word they have.

93
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.730
That's it.

94
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.820
So simply if you have any string that has a bunch of words.

95
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.700
Okay.

96
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.640
And if you apply generally to it and then you call that word cloud and then you show that image.

97
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.460
Let's go ahead shift enter.

98
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.720
And here we go.

99
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.450
It's amazing.

100
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.100
I really like it because you know it shows you kind of like a one stop shop just have all the information

101
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.770
you would need just all the words you know how many words like Alexa obviously is one very famous word

102
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.100
obviously because it's a product great that's a good thing really.

103
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.250
Maybe like you know Speaker love that's amazing you know that means you know people actually liking

104
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.930
it more obviously than it might be some like options.

105
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.440
For example example here echo because a girl called Alexa echo.

106
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.020
So you Amazon Echo echo.

107
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.900
And if you go down here maybe I'm just looking for one name that is prime prime day.

108
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.450
There is maybe a nice home light you know and so on.

109
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.810
It's actually really powerful.

110
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.470
You guys can practice with it just bring just a bunch of things in there and then use the call of this

111
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.860
command.

112
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.600
That's all what it's actually very powerful very easy to do.

113
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.300
All right.

114
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.670
And that's all what I have for this lecture.

115
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.620
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

116
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.040
Now it's time for a quick challenge.

117
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.720
All right.

118
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.750
So now it's time for a quick challenge.

119
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.620
What I did here is I just defined one string.

120
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.940
OK.

121
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.250
Here you can call it whatever you can call it maybe string equals two.

122
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.690
All right.

123
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.520
And I call it here.

124
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.700
I'm so happy.

125
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.620
Love love love Python python.

126
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.970
I'm learning artificial intelligence and machine learning and what I want you guys to do is to please

127
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.530
go ahead.

128
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.160
Maybe created all string.

129
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:48.000
Or maybe use this string and actually go ahead and use the the word cloud to actually visualize you

130
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.840
know like this word cloud thing.

131
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.630
OK.

132
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:58.040
And please go ahead pause a video and we'll see you guys after the challenge.

133
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.500
All right.

134
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.420
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

135
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.370
Ask us to do is to simply pretty much apply the exact same commands that we had before.

136
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.040
So now we have a string right.

137
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.290
And what we could do.

138
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.390
I'm going to say OK I don't need to import world cloud again because I have it already so I can say

139
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.750
OK BLT dot figure.

140
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.260
And they're going to say fig size equals to pass along 20 and 20.

141
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.290
And he going to say appeal to that image show.

142
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.490
And what I could do I'm going to say it it's called a word cloud and what it could do we're gonna say

143
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:40.480
dot generate and they can pass along here simply my string.

144
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.790
All right so string here is going to pass it here.

145
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.800
And here we go just shift enters.

146
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.310
And here we go.

147
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.330
It's amazing.

148
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.340
So a lot of guys can see here's the word love love love has been repeated Python Python Python repeated

149
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.510
so it seems like these are the two most important words like love and python.

150
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.820
There are some happy there's some learning some artificial some machine some intelligence and so on

151
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.730
which is the rest of the words here and it seems like you know the the word cloud actually kind of ignores

152
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.030
the common words.

153
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.530
So I for example am so like all this stuff just removes it just focus on the key important elements

154
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.410
or key important words in here which is really powerful too.

155
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.920
All right.

156
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.620
That's pretty much all I have for this lecture.

157
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.940
I hope you guys enjoyed it and enjoyed the challenge and the next section I'm going to show you how

158
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.090
can we perform data cleaning and some feature engineering and that should conclude our project.

159
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.010
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
