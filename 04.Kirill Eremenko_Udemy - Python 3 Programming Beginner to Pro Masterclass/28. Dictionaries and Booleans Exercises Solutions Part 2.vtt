00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.240
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.500
Let's keep going and let's continue with the question number five.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.300
So here I'm asking you for each of the students listed below.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.010
I want you to calculate the average mark for the midterm and final exams so simply you just got to go

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.040
an average these two values and put the average in a separate dictionary along with the student I.D..

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.330
So basically extract the student I.D. and put the average of these two numbers in a separate dictionary.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.970
OK.

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.440
Let's get started and see how can we do this.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.240
Let's create a couple of lines in here.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.480
And the first step is I wanted to access the these two elements.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.580
How can it access these two elements.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.160
We can do that by saying.

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.960
Let's get started.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.350
So first of all this is kind of you know like a little bit different.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.060
You know that we have view with that we're used to here we have the lists as to details actually ilist.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.950
Right.

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.970
And inside that list there is an actually a dictionary for each of these elements in here which is kind

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.630
of unique.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.820
Now we have you know like a list that each list has a dictionary so we need to combine your knowledge

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.090
of lists and dictionaries to get it.

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.540
Let's get started.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.220
All right.

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.390
So let's get started.

24
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.170
So let's assume they're going to go ahead and let's say run the self first and go here and start to

25
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.470
access the different elements.

26
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.830
Let's see how can we access different elements within the list that has dictionaries in it.

27
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.390
So I say.

28
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.850
Student underscored details open here.

29
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.050
And then they say okay I need to access the first element number zero.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.660
If I do this you would come up with an actual dictionary which is the physics of that one.

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.140
Got.

32
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.470
Which is pretty straight forward maaseik.

33
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.490
I wanted to access a second element within the lists you'd come up with an idea to which is you know

34
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.500
the second row in here which is great.

35
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.360
And if I want to go here and do too you come up with this.

36
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.570
OK.

37
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.020
That's great.

38
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.810
That's for Ista.

39
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.950
Okay that's good.

40
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.570
And let's assume they wanted to access for example this midterm.

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.310
I can exit again using the exact same idea that we have them before using its key on an x is the value

42
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.330
60 I can use the key to open this door simply massive scale organ and go ahead to mid term.

43
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.370
Okay.

44
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.760
And that should return my value of 60.

45
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.450
So now I know how can I access it lists.

46
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.160
And is specific value of the dictionary within that list.

47
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.280
All right.

48
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.120
So it took in the average I need to do this an at plus an again in sort of midterm.

49
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.540
I wanted to access the final someone to give the mid-term Closs the final one out in the average.

50
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.390
Are you that going to say okay.

51
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.530
Open here brackets and again here brackets.

52
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.680
They've been asked in the summation and the right way to.

53
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.620
That should give me the average.

54
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.830
I'm going to say okay that's a quality average underscored one for a student for his student.

55
00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.020
And if I don't that you can again view here the average one that would come up 17 2.5 looks pretty look

56
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.450
make sense he average 60 plus 85 might be seventy two point five looks good.

57
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.700
Let's do that for all of all value.

58
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.350
So going to do this.

59
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.640
Copy and paste it three times what you're going to do average to an average three for all students here

60
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.850
can access the student number one.

61
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.770
And he just put in number one the key value pair of scissors in chains and terman final day of the same

62
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.380
for the second student.

63
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.510
Engler Do the same as well for their students which is great.

64
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.270
All right.

65
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.310
Okay.

66
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.360
Oh my apologies.

67
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.190
This will going to be number two.

68
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.300
OK.

69
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.270
OK.

70
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.730
Looks great.

71
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.750
Average one two and three.

72
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.200
Looks great it looks perfect.

73
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.640
If I had on this then I should come with all of them.

74
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.990
And what I need to do here is one or two let's say if I wanted to view average to you come up with a

75
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.100
different number it looks good.

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.820
Every three run it looks anything up with five looks perfect.

77
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.430
All right.

78
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.860
So what I need to do here.

79
00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:04.320
I wanted to create our new dictionary with all the student I.D. along with the the average values.

80
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.940
Let's see how can you do this.

81
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.880
I'm going to say okay my underscore average equals two which is my new Simply list that has diction

82
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.560
and is in it.

83
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.620
Let's create a dictionary.

84
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.020
The first element within the dictionary has again student I.D. student when a college student I.D. or

85
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.710
a student I.D. will take the first value which is one right.

86
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.640
That's the first step.

87
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.960
OK.

88
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.060
Which is a single exim idea that we have here.

89
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.810
OK.

90
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.270
It's first element.

91
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.340
And within the first again dictionary I'm going to assign the value of average.

92
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.700
Right.

93
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.700
And I'm going to assign here to the average one or a Colin and then I pass along this value which is

94
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.370
that we have got you average one.

95
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.090
So basically here I'm creating again.

96
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.040
It's pretty.

97
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.390
That suit would be very clear for you guys.

98
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.410
Again I'm creating a list and that list has a dictionary that dictionary has as good an idea.

99
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.650
Along with the average afterwards Kate looks great.

100
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.610
And to create a new element in the Alaskan create do comma.

101
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.380
And I'm going to go here a copy of this.

102
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.740
Based here.

103
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.090
And I'm going to call their still I.D. as well.

104
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.090
The same key.

105
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.760
Correct.

106
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.520
But here I'm going to call it a good idea to end air.

107
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.580
We're going to be average to karma and I'm going to do the same thing and are going to go here.

108
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.340
And I'm going to call this soon in 93 with average value of three or eight.

109
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.150
Looks good to me.

110
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.270
I hope it didn't make any mistakes.

111
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.960
We can actually do this like this so we can you know like make it a little bit more readable for us.

112
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.820
We can even do this too if you want it to just to make it you know.

113
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.130
OK.

114
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.090
Now we know that there is a list and that list has see the action that is in it.

115
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.130
It.

116
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480
Let's run it.

117
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.750
Looks good to me.

118
00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.890
And then we can simply go here and print our my average print my on the score average.

119
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.900
If I add on that then you would come up with basically as to an idea with the average value which is

120
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.990
exactly what am asking you to do.

121
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.780
One last point that I wanted to outline here is that there is a specific model.

122
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.690
It's what we call it P print.

123
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.130
Okay so let's see how can we do that it's just going to help us you know do you print that dictionary

124
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.760
in a pretty For OK.

125
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.610
It's can we do that.

126
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.980
Okay.

127
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.410
From preprint K import.

128
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.470
P print and when I'm going to do healing is say instead of print basically the exact same comment.

129
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.480
But instead of doing this I was going to copy that thing and I say it's pea print instead of print.

130
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.200
That's it.

131
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.030
And that's you'll find that basically here you're plotted one in a pretty ways as kind of you know to

132
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.460
be more readable for you which is pretty equal.

133
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.120
Pretty interesting.

134
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.170
The next question that we have here.

135
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.690
Question 6 is I want to repeat the previous exercise.

136
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.670
But at the average in a new dictionary line with an average as a key.

137
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.420
OK so how can we do that.

138
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.110
So basically I wanted to go ahead here do the exact same stuff such as going to go here at the exact

139
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.520
same lines in here.

140
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.440
OK.

141
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.980
So going to go here and then the exact same elements.

142
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.890
But instead of adding them in a separate dictionary and wanted to create in you item or in you basically

143
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.840
key value pair.

144
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.390
OK.

145
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.780
This is called average in the exact same or additional dictionary's exact same stool in details dictionary.

146
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.310
OK.

147
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.750
So going to say here come here say OK I need my student details that's what I wanted to address but

148
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.870
I wanted to create in you basically.

149
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.860
Key cut of all account the crow here within that.

150
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.470
And in here I'm just going to call it simply for the first element for the second element for this third

151
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.250
element.

152
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.940
N I'm going to create simply in you.

153
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.430
Key here.

154
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.420
Associated with it.

155
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm going to call that key average.

156
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.480
That's it.

157
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.400
Average.

158
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.370
We're going to call it average and he's going to call it as well.

159
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.720
Average.

160
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.640
Right.

161
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:14.270
And that's pretty much again gave the average value for each of the students and create again in you

162
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.950
key value pair.

163
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.890
That's called average within the student index of 0 and 1 and 2.

164
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:28.040
And let's run that's should be looked good to me and let's for example print my eyes to the details

165
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.500
which is what we have here.

166
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:35.520
Let's print it and let's print let's say the first element within the list printed.

167
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.000
You'll find that they actually have a sort of idea of my subject maths midterm sorry final.

168
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:46.180
And that is an additional element that has the final average along with the final average value in here.

169
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.720
All right.

170
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.590
Perfect.

171
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.880
The next question that we have.

172
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:58.010
Question 7 is that we wanted to square each element in our phone dictionary to a have a dictionary that

173
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.140
basically has an element key value pair.

174
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.140
But in the value I have the list is a single value and Y and what I'm asking you to do is to simply

175
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.390
go ahead and take each of these elements and simply Square them.

176
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.860
How can we do that.

177
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.510
What we could do here and say okay in order to square the elements I'm going to say okay I need to access

178
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.380
elements first to access them.

179
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:26.720
I'm going to go here go to my dictionary OK and to access the first element say okay I need to access

180
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.790
the first element which is has one.

181
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:38.330
That's my first element and in order to access simply this one this element has an index of zero within

182
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:38.860
my list.

183
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:45.320
To do that I mean to say OK see one end of value of zero right.

184
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.850
This is basic and can be determined.

185
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.800
Let's print that list see what that number for don't get a squaring.

186
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.590
Let's see what an American is to get into intent which looks good for an extra second element within

187
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.540
the list defined and that that means you can come up with 20.

188
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.370
Looks great.

189
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.560
If I do this we can come up with 30 which means this.

190
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.380
If I change this and make it let's see to an M.

191
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.490
Come he didn't make it 0 4 on it.

192
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.930
You'll come up with this value.

193
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:15.050
So now I know how can it access different elements when I have the lists in there in the value part

194
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.510
of the dictionary and it's how can we do that.

195
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.750
All right so now I know how can it access the elements right.

196
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.670
So in order to do it what it could do here and say okay I need to access my first element of a 0 which

197
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.770
has this element.

198
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.470
Then I take it and square it.

199
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.150
That's how I look in the square of the first element to square the second element.

200
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.110
We're going to copy the exact same one.

201
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.250
And I'm going to copy again the third one so.

202
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.400
Okay okay see 1 or zero see one or one and see one of two.

203
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.440
And I'm going to quit all of them and all that answers are just going to put them in a big list here.

204
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.870
All right so now I have the list that has all the square elements ready.

205
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.340
And I wanted to simply put that in.

206
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.320
Let's say override my dictionary.

207
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.450
How can I do this.

208
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:12.670
And I say okay I'm going to go to my dictionary gay dictionary and I'm going I'm going to do here and

209
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.170
say OK.

210
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.010
I went over right the value of C1.

211
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.700
So go to the value of my dictionary.

212
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.710
See one day all the elements and simply Square them.

213
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.460
All right let's see.

214
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.210
For more on this.

215
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.650
And if that's an if I wanted to let's say print.

216
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.050
My dictionary.

217
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.190
Are in for it.

218
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.800
I'm it.

219
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.450
You would find that basically if you took the elements and you square them.

220
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.470
She didn't touch the setu because you haven't done anything to see too.

221
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.370
But is the concept is good you to do the tenney's quoted comes 100 years to the 20s.

222
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.470
Basically I'm sort of square to get your pain.

223
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.250
The swelling it's debased queing 20 becomes 400 and swilling 30 becomes comes 900.

224
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.970
Right.

225
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.370
Okay so how can we do that.

226
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.510
The first one it's pretty simple you could do the exact same stuff here.

227
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.060
And we're going to do here.

228
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:13.940
Me this C2 and change this make it see to come here and make this CO2 and CO2 as well.

229
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.550
And let's try it again.

230
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.980
So the find the dictionary again again and that's how you simply obtain the squaring of all the elements

231
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.170
are right.

232
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.190
And that's pretty much all the half of the section.

233
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.380
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

234
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.620
And the next lecture we're going to keep going and answer questions eight and above.

235
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.390
I hope it has enjoyed it.

236
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.720
And see you in the next hour.
