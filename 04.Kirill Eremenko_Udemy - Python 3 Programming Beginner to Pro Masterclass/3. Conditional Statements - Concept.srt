00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,070
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,470
I'm super excited because in this lecture we're going to discuss the conditional statements which is

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,600
why we call it if any statements they are really really powerful and they are kind of the foundation

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,520
or the kind of the basic building block of any programming language.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,300
All right so let's recap what we have done before in the previous section we covered the logical operators

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,640
and we cover it as well what we call it the comparison operators.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,020
And in this section we're going to cover the conditional statements which were called if statements.

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,480
Let's assume that we wanted to divide our code.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,920
Okay.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,810
Kind of into two sections.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,220
Would you call it two different path lines.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,510
All right.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,420
Let's assume that I wanted to for example compare the value of let's say five number five.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,040
And number two.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,830
So I'm gonna do that comparison like this I'm going to say Okay if that's how we write the if condition

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,270
I'm asking if five is greater than two.

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,130
Okay.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,230
And then in order to write the if condition we put Colin in here and then press enter and you would

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,920
see that simply here that has been indented.

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,240
That means you know like there is kind of a space in here and here we actually write the body of the

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,860
if condition.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,090
Okay.

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,410
And that's the beauty of Python.

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,640
You don't need to put like you know like brackets or curly brackets or you know like C or any other

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,090
programming language which is really tough to like I don't say tough but it's it's way more complex

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,690
than Python python is very intuitive very easy.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,140
So let's assume that I wanted to compare a five is greater than two.

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,470
I want to go ahead and do something and then I say okay.

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,250
Else if that condition is not true let's do something different.

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,820
Okay.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,190
So I mean I'm asking if five is greater than two.

32
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,390
I'm going to say Okay print and I'm going to say print true.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,800
All right.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,480
Okay.

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,430
So I wanted to print on the screen too if this condition is true.

36
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:03,730
All right.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,310
Okay.

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,900
Looks great.

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,390
And what I'm gonna do here I have to go back.

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:14,150
Please make sure that when you write the F if statement that the F and the else have to be aligned here

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,190
and the body of the F has to be shifted a little bit.

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,180
So here I'm gonna write.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,570
Okay.

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,030
Else and please don't forget the column press enter and you'll find that simply the body of the F and

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:34,120
the body of the LS we going to be aligned we're going to say Okay print and I'm gonna print false.

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,150
All right that's it.

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,740
So simply put what we have done here is really powerful.

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,280
Okay.

49
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,000
It looks pretty easy but it's actually very very powerful why it's powerful it's really powerful because

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,530
now I actually created kind of you know like to pass within my code I'm going to say Okay I'm gonna

51
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:59,040
split my code into two sections this section which is the body of the F and this section which is body

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,170
of the LS which means that if for example here if I compare five compared to two and then say Okay it's

53
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,110
five greater than two.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,150
Well that condition gonna turn true.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,590
Right.

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,380
So if the if condition is true then we are going to execute this command and that's it.

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,990
And that's the beauty of it.

58
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,820
We're not going to execute this one I'm gonna go to the else ever.

59
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,390
We're just gonna execute the body of the if condition if the if condition is true.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,710
All right.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
What if this condition is false.

62
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,520
If this condition is false.

63
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,690
We're actually going to skip this and only perform the body of the ls but execute the body of the else

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,130
which is the beauty of you know F if it's condition.

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,790
All right let's run that annual find that you know simply here it has we print true on the screen.

66
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,320
OK so why is that.

67
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,300
You know like what happens.

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,220
So simply put because five is greater than two which is this condition was true we actually implemented

69
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,480
this and that's it.

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,670
We didn't basically implement the LS portion of it.

71
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,390
All right.

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's take a look at again pretty much the exact same examples it's going to copy it here and let's

73
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:19,870
print for example something different let's say OK if condition is true I'm going to say here for example

74
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,110
if condition is false.

75
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,120
All right.

76
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,500
OK let's run that and that makes sense.

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,870
So basically here we said OK if Group Five is greater than two let's go ahead and basically execute

78
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,380
the body of the if and that's what we have got here.

79
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,880
If not let's go and execute the else condition.

80
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,940
All right.

81
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,360
So OK sounds great.

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,910
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to leave you guys for a quick challenge here are going to compare

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,520
actually let's going to compare this and I'm asking you guys without running the code please let me

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,730
know which one will going to be executed if this one is gonna be executed.

85
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,380
Or this one will gonna be executed.

86
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,410
Please go ahead and pause the video and see you guys after the challenge.

87
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,620
All right.

88
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,510
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself here simply am asking is five equals

89
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,770
to ten or not.

90
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:30,010
OK well five is actually not equal to ten which means that I cannot or I will not going to execute the

91
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:36,610
body of the if I'm going to go back to the L's here I'm going to execute the LS part which is well if

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,000
condition is actually false.

93
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,970
All right let's run that and that's all I've got here.

94
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,090
Which makes sense.

95
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,430
Why.

96
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,310
Because the if condition or this condition actually failed or we know was wasn't true.

97
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,600
So we went there and we executed the L's body only.

98
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,870
And that's why we executed if condition is false.

99
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,680
All right let's take a look at kind of a little bit more advanced concept when it comes to if conditions

100
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,540
which is what we call it.

101
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,320
Else if.

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,180
OK let's assume that I wanted for example to compare let's say or have three different parts within

103
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,790
my code.

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,820
So instead of having two different paths I wanted to have three different path.

105
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,010
Let's do this.

106
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,780
Let's take it if five is equal to seven.

107
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,510
OK Colin I wanted to go ahead and print.

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,740
Let's say first statement is true.

109
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,580
OK and here and that's the beauty of it since I wanted to create kind of three different path.

110
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,630
I cannot just go and write else I actually wanted to import or insert another ill else if conditions

111
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,370
are going to say OK try this I'm gonna call it.

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:55,080
Else if and we actually combine it in just l. l if you guys can see that he it's turned to green OK

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:02,820
which is kind of reserved keyword for python I say OK Elif two equals equals to four for instance just

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:10,010
any numbers in the first enter and here are gonna say Okay print second

115
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,160
statement is true

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,320
and the else which is if none of these conditions were true let's go ahead and do this.

117
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:36,320
Let's go ahead and print let's say the last statement statement is true all right.

118
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,500
OK so what do you guys expect.

119
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,280
Let's OK without running the code here I'm asking is 5 equals 2 7.

120
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,500
Well that was false.

121
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,900
So I'm going to skip this right when I come here I'm going to have to have another if condition I'm

122
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,880
asking is two equals to four.

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,130
Well that wasn't true.

124
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,040
So I'm going to go ahead here and execute this which is the last statement is true.

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,590
Let's on that.

126
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,290
And that's actually what we have got here.

127
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,570
Last statement is true.

128
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,320
OK.

129
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:11,110
All right let's go ahead and leave you guys as well for a quick challenge.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,450
OK I'm going to say OK.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,070
Copy that.

132
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,720
Let's paste it and here we're going to compare is less than here.

133
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,030
Going to say greater than.

134
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,010
And that's it.

135
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,770
OK.

136
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,860
Please go ahead guys and pause a video and please do not run the cell just tell me what which one do

137
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,830
you expect we're going to be executed.

138
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,950
Please go ahead and see you guys after the challenge.

139
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,960
All right.

140
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,570
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

141
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,690
So you know I'm asking if five less than seven.

142
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,740
Well that condition was actually true.

143
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,140
Right.

144
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,180
So here I'll simply going to execute the first one.

145
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,120
So let's run it.

146
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
And the first one we're going to be executed.

147
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,010
So first statement is actually true.

148
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,340
All right.

149
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,160
Makes complete sense.

150
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,400
Let's take a look at one last example before we jump into the exercise section.

151
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:11,070
So here I'm saying OK let's for example insert let's define let's assume that wanted to build kind of

152
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,150
our password

153
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,530
password system.

154
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,980
So we're going to grant access to the user if the enter the password successfully.

155
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,190
All right.

156
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,680
So let's say can we do that.

157
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm going to say OK when I say OK name equals two which is our variable input in order to feed data

158
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,330
from the user.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,050
I'm gonna print to the screen enter your username.

160
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,230
Sorry user name.

161
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,130
All right.

162
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,130
So he is simply I'm asking the users to enter their user name.

163
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,370
And if the user name was right which was correct without giving without at will pass without anything

164
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,160
just if the user name was right.

165
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,550
Oh just gonna give them access if it's wrong then I'm not going to give him access.

166
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,950
That's pretty much it.

167
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,670
And the user name they're going to use here is let's say what you can pick whatever name you have just

168
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,190
selected for example like my name for instance I'm going to say okay if he and I'm comparing simply

169
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,050
and that's why we use the if condition because we wanted to have to have two options within our code

170
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,400
we have either to grant the user access or to deny him access.

171
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,740
So I'm going to say okay if name equals equals to Ryan.

172
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:34,570
Okay and please don't forget the column I'm going to say Okay print I'm going to say access granted.

173
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,680
All right I'm gonna say here.

174
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:48,650
Else which is if not I'm going to print access denied all right and that's it.

175
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,490
That's pretty much it.

176
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,300
Let's run that code.

177
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,710
Let's run it.

178
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,340
So here.

179
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,870
When I press shift enter you'll find that he was asking you enter you enter your username so you have

180
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,130
to enter username.

181
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,400
So I gonna say Okay I will enter Ryan and if I run it you'll find well x is granted Y because this condition

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:12,500
has been satisfied I inserted value here okay and name has my name right now has Ryan in there and he'd

183
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,400
have competing as Ryan equals equals to Ryan.

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,770
It would me.

185
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,420
Yes.

186
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,590
Then we're gonna get access granted.

187
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,530
If not then X is gonna be denied.

188
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,590
All right let's run it one more time.

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,450
Next say enter your username.

190
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,200
So I'm gonna say are y n.

191
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,780
And please note that here I inserted all the values here were uppercase right.

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,720
If I run that you'll find X access denied.

193
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:42,080
It will tell me no access denied Y because when you compare uppercase all uppercase with the the only

194
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,510
letter only first letter uppercase actually the access will not gonna be Grant.

195
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,080
These two strings are not the same.

196
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,540
And that's why you get access denied in this case.

197
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,940
All right.

198
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,240
So I can leave you guys for a quick challenge.

199
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,880
Slip it might be a little bit tough here.

200
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,910
I wanted to basically make the system a little bit more robust.

201
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,950
Okay.

202
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:11,210
I wanted to grant the user access if the enter their name like this or if the inserted their name like

203
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:20,140
this which is r y n all uppercase or if they inserted the name all lowercase like r y n all lowercase.

204
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Right.

205
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,900
So I leave you guys for that quick challenge.

206
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:32,740
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

207
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,460
All right I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

208
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,330
So what I ask us to do here.

209
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:45,240
Let's copy this space of here and ask you guys to make the code kind of a little bit more robust in

210
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,910
a way.

211
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:53,010
And in order to add here instead of having just are as uppercase and Ryan afterwards I wanted you guys

212
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:02,780
to add more conditions so I'm gonna say okay if name equals equals to Ryan or write name was.

213
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,740
Equals equals to all uppercase right.

214
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,300
Or name was equals equals to all lowercase.

215
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,450
So I'm saying if all of them are uppercase or all of them are lowercase or the first letter only with

216
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,200
uppercase and that the system will kind of be being a little bit more robust.

217
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,760
So you know that you can insert user name whatever you feel like.

218
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,880
Let's run that and let's make sure it actually works.

219
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,880
So let's enter our user name let's try our first one which I've tried before with any well access granted.

220
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,050
Let's run it one more time.

221
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,190
Okay are y n all uppercase.

222
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:44,750
Let's run it then we will access granted to if you guys remember we if we did that before it was access

223
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,330
denied.

224
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,100
Okay so one more time I'm saying he are y in all of them are lowercase.

225
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,360
Let's run it then.

226
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,100
Well X is granted to.

227
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,760
Okay.

228
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,460
All right let's run it.

229
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,650
And for example insert let's say Ryan one for instance let's run it then well access denied which makes

230
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,300
complete sense.

231
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,360
All right I hope you guys enjoy this lecture.

232
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:12,090
Let's recap what we have done so far in this section we discussed how can we do conditional statements.

233
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,810
So now we know how can we write if else condition and kind of create you know kind of to pass within

234
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:25,200
our code here we learned how can we do multiple if else conditions like this one which is having three

235
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,010
for example case cases in this case and we learn as well how to kind of develop more kind of advanced

236
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:41,090
form into doing or creating a password or username access system if the user insert the access or user

237
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,710
name correct we can give them access if not we can deny them access and we learned here how can we produce

238
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,310
the or logical condition to actually apply more than one condition that might be true we're gonna give

239
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,200
the user access.

240
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,880
All right I hope you guys enjoyed that lecture in the next lecture we're going to start go ahead and

241
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,520
start you know like we have tons of exercises for you please stay tuned and see you guys in the next

242
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,000
lecture.
