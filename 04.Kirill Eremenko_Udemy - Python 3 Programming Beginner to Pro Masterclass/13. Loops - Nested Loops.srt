00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,770
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:08,190
I am super excited because in this lecture we're going to kind of step up our game a little bit when

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,730
it comes to loops and study what we call it nested loops.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,410
OK.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,780
And that would be going to be extensively used as well throughout the exercises and the practical projects

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,520
to please focus a little bit and it's very easy.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,210
We're going to get through it together.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,240
So the first step is what they mean by nested loops.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,040
The idea of nested loops that we wanted to print a loop inside a body of another loop.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,440
All right.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,130
So it sounds crazy but again it's really simple.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,270
Let's assume that I wanted to print for example the multiplication table.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,510
All right.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,440
So I wanted to print let's say 1 times 1 equals to 1 1 times 2 equals 2 to 1 time 3 equals 3 and so

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,000
on.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,520
And I would keep going and print let's say two times one equals two to two times two equals four.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,310
And so on.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,520
All right.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,860
How can we do that.

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,450
So what I could do I can use nested loops to actually do this to print out multiplication table.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,890
So first I'm going to take a four X in range because remember we use the range and let's assume that

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,650
I wanted to print for instance multiplication tables from one till five.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,840
So I can take a four I for x in range one and I want to print to five.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,550
Right.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,660
So I'm not going to write five here.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,980
Five is wrong rather than actually print six figures.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,820
Remember the word range can go up too.

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,380
And excluding the value of six right.

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,510
We have done that before when now we're experts in it right.

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,070
So I can do this.

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,390
All right.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,080
So here I know they're going to create a loop that goes through one two three four five and six.

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,740
OK.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,070
All right.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,550
What I wanted to do.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,710
They wanted to create a multiplication table right.

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,990
So for each of these numbers for the number one I actually when I multiplied by all numbers from one

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,380
to 10.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,620
So that's why I need to print one times 1 One times two times three.

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,830
Apparently there is another loop within that loop that I need to implement somehow.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,830
So let's see how can I do that.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,180
All right.

43
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,930
So here we are in the body right.

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,850
So this is simply the body of the loop right.

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,560
So this is the indentation right.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,030
So what I could do here instead of actually writing something like for example print I for instance

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,070
No I'm not gonna do this actually in the body I'm going to create another loop I'm going to put an addition

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:24,660
and loop with a different index y for i in range and here I'm going to pass along the numbers from 1

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,740
let's say to 10 I wanted to print all the numbers in the multiplication table right.

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,890
So going to say from 1 to 10 I'm not going to put 10 action can I put Eleven if you remember range can

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,230
go up to an exec loading the last number.

52
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,230
So going to see Collin again every time I'm going to say Okay now we're pretty much ready to print.

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,500
And I wanted to print here.

54
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,300
You guys remember I can use the format method.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,330
So I'm gonna say Okay I need to print this something times okay.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,700
Something equals to something and I need to illustrate what they mean by all this.

57
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,310
When I say a dot format and here I'll get a pass along x.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,290
I want to multiply x by y and the results will gonna be X times Y which is amazing.

59
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,290
Okay.

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,250
So what happened.

61
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,550
Let's actually go ahead and print let's see what's have shift entered.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,260
Here we go.

63
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,680
Beautiful.

64
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,030
So pretty much you're able to print my multiplication table.

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,930
We're able to print one times one equals one one times equals two and so on.

66
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,010
Up until one times nine equals nine.

67
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,790
And then afterwards I print two times one equals two two times two equals to four and so on.

68
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,390
So I printed two up until 10 to 20 and then print all the multiplication tables sorry for three.

69
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,220
So three times all of it.

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,140
And then for all of that.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,860
And then five which is all of this.

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,630
All right great.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:49,890
All right.

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,430
So let's take a look at what happened here.

75
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:58,510
So when we did the nested loops we would actually be able to take a 4 x 4 number in range.

76
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,330
There's an image.

77
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,830
This will call it the major loop.

78
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,040
When we think about it.

79
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,950
Actually I would like to write that.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,230
Think of it as a call slow loop and think of this one as we'll call it the fast loop.

81
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,710
So every time I'm going to go here I'm going to take the number one.

82
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,330
All right.

83
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,750
So X equals to one.

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,050
Right.

85
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,700
This is the slow loop.

86
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:18,970
Right.

87
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,180
And within that slow loop we're going to go here and loop several times very fast quick.

88
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,520
All right.

89
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,160
So I'm gonna scan through the numbers one two three four and one up until I reach one to 10 and that's

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,400
why I multiplied all the numbers you know like x x 0 6 to 1 y you has been changing all the numbers

91
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,560
from 1 to 10.

92
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,430
And we're able to print it up to then and then afterwards after I finish this loop which is a small

93
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,010
fast loop I all go up again.

94
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,860
All right.

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,970
To the main loop to the slower loop.

96
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,310
Take the next number x which is to in this case.

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,700
Right.

98
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,090
And then go here and do the fast loop and then go up again.

99
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,040
Take this next number go down go up again repeat very fast and so on.

100
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,990
And that's pretty much the idea of doing nested loop.

101
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,390
All right.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,030
I hope you guys were able to figure it out.

103
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,240
It's really simple.

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,370
Well I want you guys to do it.

105
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:13,030
Please go ahead pause a video and I want you to print out the entire multiplication table from number

106
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,340
is 1 up until 10.

107
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,640
All right.

108
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,350
So simply here we printed out all the numbers up until 5:00.

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
Right.

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,220
I wanted to go ahead and actually do the entire multiplication table up until then.

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,000
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

112
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,430
All right.

113
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,150
If you guys were able to figure out the challenge we're asking us to do is to simply come here.

114
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's actually copy it.

115
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,040
This space it again here.

116
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,700
And when I want you guys to do it instead of having six here and I may set it to eleven.

117
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,000
All right.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,220
And that should print out all entitlement application table.

119
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,090
Here we go.

120
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,540
So now we have all the numbers or the numbers two three four five six seven eight nine and ten.

121
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:51,870
All right.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,700
Awesome.

123
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,090
Up until 10 time sandwiches equals to 100.

124
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,050
OK.

125
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,550
Again what we have done here is that we just stopped.

126
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,270
Instead of having one arrangement and six it's up to eleven again.

127
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,720
So that means the slower loop and the faster the loop goes from one to 10.

128
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,140
All right.

129
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,550
OK.

130
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,580
Let's take a look at another example.

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,240
OK.

132
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,090
Which is not numbers would get a deal a little bit different kind of an a list of strings.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,800
So let's go ahead and maybe define two strings and it's a color.

134
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,240
Color lists equals two.

135
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,650
Let's assume I have black.

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,180
Just list of colors color black white and let's say gold.

137
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,830
And let's assume I have another list I'm going to call it phone on the school list equals two.

138
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:46,740
Here I define them as iPhone and let's say Samsung just can't.

139
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:54,740
Couple of the couple of the major brands and then maybe pick BlackBerry all right.

140
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,820
Looks good.

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,990
Shift enter.

142
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,510
Here we go.

143
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,760
So now I simply have to list what I wanted to do is simply go ahead and print all the combination of

144
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,890
the different colors with the different phones.

145
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,930
For example I wanted to print black iPhone black Samsung black BlackBerry and then print white iPhone

146
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,830
white Samsung.

147
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,550
Why BlackBerry.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,180
And then gold gold iPhone gold Samsung gold blackberries.

149
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,030
Think about it.

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,240
Pretty much the same as the previous idea.

151
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,920
I wanted to do that we have kind of a slow loop and the faster loop the slow loop is this loop.

152
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,140
Right.

153
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,120
And the faster loop is this loop simply.

154
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,920
So simply put I need to have kind of a nested loops in some form and some sort.

155
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,210
So I can say okay.

156
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,250
For I in color list.

157
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:50,610
So I'm gonna loop on the color list every time I'm going to say for J in phone list K sounds good and

158
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,410
then I'm going to go into print simply I wanted to print what were the content rights I wanted to print

159
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,450
black iPhone like Samsung and so on.

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,880
So when I say print I comment Jay OK that's it.

161
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,460
Here we go shift enter.

162
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,090
Here we go.

163
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,510
So simply put we're able to print black iPhone black and so on.

164
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,230
So here I have all the elements and then white or the combination afterwards.

165
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,800
My apologies and then we have gold all the combinations as well.

166
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,790
All right.

167
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,230
OK.

168
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,450
I hope you guys were able to figure out the this concept which is nested loops concepts really important.

169
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,580
Very intuitive.

170
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,650
And let's recap all I've done in this lecture and this lecture were able to introduce how to do loops

171
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:38,350
within a loop which is kind of a nested loop and we're able to do that using the maybe by applying simply

172
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,150
and fast the loop within a slower loop and doing let's say the printing operation or whatever operation

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,120
and we have went through kind of a mini challenge to expand the multiplication table from one to five

174
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,510
that's expanded to 10 by changing this number to 11 and we're able as well to take a look at another

175
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:02,200
example using the list of strings and we're able to print as well all the content using pretty much

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,770
the exact same concept.

177
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,290
All right.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,980
That's pretty much what I have for this lecture.

179
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,320
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

180
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,240
We actually have two more topics to go on that should conclude the entire kind of loops section we're

181
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,860
going to cover while loops and we'll cover kind of a very a little bit advanced concept concepts or

182
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,310
call list comprehension.

183
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,980
And I'm gonna cover that in the next lecture.

184
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,960
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
