Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,360
Welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,950
I'm going to walk you through the exercises questions for dictionaries and bullion's the cake.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,380
So they're going to be tons of fun I hope because we're going to have lots of fun doing doing the the

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,470
exercise of sport.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,310
So just let me walk you through it really quick.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,230
So here's the first question I'm asking you to create a dictionary we see of your favourite friends

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,040
and their respective age and print of the age of the second name you choose.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,810
Just print whatever names along with our age.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,900
And that's pretty much what we wanted to do.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,070
Just got kind of you know quick exercise to test your skills on how we define a dictionary.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,770
Right the next question is I'm asking you to create a dictionary.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,670
We see you or your favourite friends and their respective hourly wage let's say twenty five dollars

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,820
three dollars whatever an up the average of all their salaries.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,060
OK.

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,020
So this question is I'm asking you to update the previous dictionary with two of your next favourite

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,630
friends.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,320
So now I need five friends and their respective senators as well and the average of all the salaries

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,700
of you know how can you add elements to an existing dictionary.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,100
We've done that before.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,210
Question for asking to write a code that multiplies all the elements in the following dictionaries so

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,900
we have this four specific dictionary and I wanted to multiply all elements in here to question five

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,870
for each of the students lists below.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,770
Calculate the average mark for the midterm and final exams for each of the students.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,940
So for all the midterm and final exam I wanted to calculate the average of that K and put the average

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,340
in a separate dictionary along with the student I.D. so simply I need to create another dictionary that

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,210
has a student I.D. along with the average of these two numbers.

28
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,620
Again this dude in a D.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,020
And again and the average of these two numbers which is the midterm and final exam.

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,350
That's it get.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,360
Question 6.

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,690
I'm asking you to repeat the previous exercise.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,510
But the average in the new dictionary ok line with average as a key.

34
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:14,890
So I wanted to simply add another key value pair that has the average as a key and the actual value

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,190
as the add the value of the pick.

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,000
All right.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,880
So Question 7 I'm asking two square each element in the following dictionary.

38
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,770
So basically take all that diction and try to square each elements in there.

39
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,820
Again please bear in mind that you know here we are within a couple of days before we here find that

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,970
there is a dictionary that has instead of having just single value.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,750
Well having a list simply in in the position of the values are not just a single number.

42
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,910
We have a list which is kind of a little bit unique.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,840
What I'm asking you to square each element in the following dictionary are in question 8.

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,630
I've asked you to create a list of all keys and a list of all values and the total sum of all values

45
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,670
of all this.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,310
Again that should be pretty simple and pretty straight forward.

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,870
OK.

48
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,450
Question number 9.

49
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,180
I'm asking you to obtain the length of the following dictionary and so its elements.

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,710
How can you look in the lengths and how can you sort the elements within the dictionary.

51
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,590
Right.

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,600
OK great.

53
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,600
Question number number 10.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,740
I'm asking you to filter out values that are greater than or equal to 30.

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,450
Okay so simply here have key value pairs and I'm asking you to filter basically through the values here

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,330
and only pick the number at a greater than it equates to 30 which is simply these values right 30 and

57
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,100
50.

58
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,320
Again we didn't cover that.

59
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,740
You know so so far you know what kind of advance.

60
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,080
That's why I listed it as advanced or kele to be covered in the future.

61
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,230
Again I'm going to walk you through it quick and you know and again if he didn't figure that out that's

62
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,670
fine.

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,450
We're going to walk you through it in the solution Section 4.

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,000
Question number 11 I'm asking you to basically tell me without running the code.

65
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,450
What will this go generate.

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,110
So here we have a couple of lines.

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,550
It's kind of testing you know your abilities on booleans which is how to generally true or false.

68
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,910
Alright that's pretty much all what we have for this lecture.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,460
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

70
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,550
Best of luck and see you in the solutions.
