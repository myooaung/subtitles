1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,880
What if I won it instead of plodding all the data on one image of one figure I wanted to create or collets

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,560
subplots.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,070
So I wanted to create let's say a plot and then separate in order to create another plot and another

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,730
plot but all of them with a kind of contained within a single plot.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay the talk quality subplot you can do this by specifying Okay I need to create plot that sub plots

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,060
and create.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,520
Here is postpone the number of rows and number of columns and then which figures can give you one which

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,770
index you're looking for.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,230
So I need to create one row okay in three columns so that means I'm going to have one big figure that

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,650
has one two and three images within.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,390
OK.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,690
So it took place the first one to get a specific end in one by three airgap of the first one made again

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,640
and one by the same one again but a crippled the second one and one C and explore the third one.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,060
If I do this then can I come up with this so simply put you to all this queries you separate them again

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,230
they're still in the same figure.

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,950
But they're defining the defining separate subplots array.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,190
OK what if I wanted to plot them for example that below with each other.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
You can do that by changing the order of here and specify OK.

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,220
I need one row and three columns three what if I make it the other way around.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,150
I make it three rows in one column.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,050
If I just seen the index you really give 3 1 and then three by one see by wanting this suspect in this

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,190
one two and three the exact same stuff you kind of come up with this.

23
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,940
Then you specify again it's a subplot that has three kind of you know images in it which is really powerful

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,330
two or three.

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,300
OK.

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,310
So that's how can you do perform just gender while using it using IMET plot lip.

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,470
What we could do here is that we can use object oriented programming within a couple of that yet but

28
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,850
we can cover it again later in the course on how can we plot in a much better and kind of elegant way

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,450
using the object oriented program.

30
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,880
If you don't have XP with object oriented programming don't worry you're going to show you just kind

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,080
of your basics of how can we plot.

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,240
Again djinni the exact same plots but in a simpler way.

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,250
So all we could do is that we can first define a figure and then you can apply different methods on

34
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,260
that figure.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,740
Right.

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,920
OK.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,530
Let me show you what they mean by that.

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,680
So here in order to create and you'll figure I'm just going to create a key P L T Dot figure.

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,220
Okay.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,950
That would create simply our a kind of a.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,670
Instance.

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,510
So here you have an instance fig and then you kind of refer to that figure later on.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Then you can say okay fig dot whatever.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,620
Then you can apply different functions to different methods to it.

45
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,270
Okay.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,230
So you can change for example the with Chief thickness Ed for example different elements to it.

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,670
And xii's do whatever you want.

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,470
So let's get started.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
So he'll keep that figure.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,830
And then I'm going to create my thing here and I'm going to do.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,420
Gap like Fig dot Ed axes.

53
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,290
And then you can add axes here.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,070
Zero between range of zero on one.

55
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,590
OK.

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,730
And they'll become my axes and they won't get into here.

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,870
I'm going to postpone any to plot X versus Y.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,740
So again to create in the little space that would create linear values again between zede on and 10

59
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,320
and get a plot here.

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,230
The end paedos sign on it.

61
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,530
Okay let's actually plot that first.

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,080
And before doing this is going to go back years do this.

63
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,470
Let's block that for us and see what's going to happen.

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,850
So what we have that's what we have got.

65
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,640
We just created simply a figure okay.

66
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,450
We specify X's from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 1 we specified x specify the white.

67
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's take a look at X..

68
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,620
Actually let's delete this and it's here.

69
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,610
Create another one.

70
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,280
And let's look at let's take a look at X. That's the value of x.

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,330
So you simply specify again a hundred points or between 0 and 10.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,190
And if you want to view why which is simply the sign of this you can simply go here.

73
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,800
Read Why don't we show you why that's my way values again.

74
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,420
It's basically there was a corresponding value for y for each one of X..

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,520
What I could do is say okay instead of using P LTE dog plot I can refer to the axes in a ship log them.

76
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,870
OK it's a little bit different.

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,630
Little bit we have.

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,490
You're kind of.

79
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,120
Kind of way of thinking about it but it's actually we'd get to see how it becomes very powerful moving

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,760
forward.

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,170
Well I can see I'm going to say okay I have now my axes.

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,050
If you all better use the axes Equis fingered axes you know we have these then you can refer to the

83
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,590
axes and do the plodding in.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,430
Yes they axes dot plot and then you specify X and Y can specify.

85
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,130
Again here you wanted to read a wanted Square.

86
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,890
You can specify you label and then if you want to add let's say titles X label way label you can again

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,510
apply a method to your object here so you can separate axes darts set X label a time said y label title

88
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,480
and legend put eggs for example set.

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,700
Why limit if you want to limit the y axis to that range and set X limit if you want to X that limit

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,250
from zero to 11 and add a grid as well.

91
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,870
Create let's actually view all of them altogether.

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,420
Actually let's go back here.

93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,400
Before running it let's do them all together.

94
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,510
Let's actually plot them because they have to be pretty much when you plot it has to be the same kind

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,550
of kind of cell.

96
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,240
So if you're under this then you'll come up with that useful curve you have there.

97
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,500
So let's take a look first plotted.

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,700
X is the plot X Y that will simply plot my curfew.

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,860
OK.

100
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,990
So as you can see it's red the direct and it has square elements.

101
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,090
Because I specify this.

102
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,880
S If I change this for example I make it let's say triangle.

103
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,740
If I had it there.

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,430
Do you see a cheetah triangle.

105
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,360
If I change utlity and make a dash that will make it again.

106
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,370
There you go.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,430
That's my label.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,050
If I want to specify a label he has specified dread sine wave.

109
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,640
Again let's say it's red you know red sine wave like number 1 for example or whatever.

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,970
And then you can change you can see whatever use Gambia.

111
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,540
If you want to set X label you can use axes dot sets underscore X label and then you specify the what

112
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
you want to write on the X X which is time.

113
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,130
Set underscored way label.

114
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,440
Then you specify will do right here on the same week.

115
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,290
That would be siwei if you want added paid all.

116
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,940
My first plot so set underscored a table.

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,800
You specify whatever title you want and then if you want to add a legend that's my legendary added.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,480
And here if I wanted to limit simply my ex exes let's say I'll make it from 0 to 11 and that's why he

119
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,010
did set the scene to 11 if you want me it to 10.

120
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,520
If you make it 10 and if you're on it you will see that it simply cropped a 10.

121
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,380
If you want to make it let's see between 0 5 you run it.

122
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,550
You see the mcrobert from you on 5 and so on so forth.

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,220
Let's go back.

124
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,060
Make it 10 in here you can again Krab your limits your way axes.

125
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,160
By changing it from minus one point one point five to one point five let's say make it to between 1.

126
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,200
Minus one.

127
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,710
Let's see one if you run it you'll see that actually very smooth and he looks great.

128
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,730
And then if you want to add that grit then you can come up you do X. He's done great.

129
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,430
If you actually do more of this end run it you will see that you've got the curve without the grit.

130
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,010
Right.

131
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,250
If you want to clear the green again you can enable it and done it.

132
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,370
You see the curve with the grit.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,620
And that's pretty much how can you have a foundation of plotting any data.

134
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,110
And that's we're going to be using it throughout the course.

135
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,650
The object oriented programming way of of plodding.

136
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,320
OK.

137
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,300
All right.

138
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Okay.

139
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,730
Looks great.

140
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,290
So the next step is what if I want to let's say plant or do multiple plots.

141
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,570
Let's run this cell and see what's going to happen.

142
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,090
That's actually what we've got here.

143
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,480
I want to say to plop a curve or better.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,010
Wanted to create mini or you know kind of subplots with within.

145
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,140
How can we do that.

146
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,890
Let's see how can we do that using again object oriented programming a way of plotting for say okay

147
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,310
figure equal ability or to figure out that would create our Figg.

148
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,330
And then it would start to add axes.

149
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,710
So you say Go figure.

150
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,910
XY is he living in a collared zino the ranges between 0 and 1.

151
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,960
That would be accedes one.

152
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,040
And what I'm gonna do here I'm going to create again kind of a smaller smaller axes which is you know

153
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,100
the minute figures there's consomme before here.

154
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,690
So you're going to create think up X's as well but he can get a caller to a quote inset axes.

155
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,330
Okay which is again point one point three which is kind of an issue.

156
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,830
Kind of a kind of a smaller version of that mean x is that we find here.

157
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,550
So you have my second access.

158
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,210
You have my my third access.

159
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,250
And what I'm going to do here.

160
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,290
You're going to specify simply the location are going to tell you what they mean by this.

161
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,720
And then what I'm going to do here.

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,920
I'm going to plot let's say X and Y which is my beat Are you hitting at a point of say plot X and Y

163
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,990
squared and red and that's the Red Gap.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,540
Plus X and Y squared as well to seem bitter but with let's say Green Collar.

165
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,210
All right.

166
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,830
And again I'm going to college you know I can specify X label why label we have done that before you

168
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,520
can basically Name the different these minute plots whatever you want it.

169
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,360
Okay.

170
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,550
So if you've done this you come up with this game.

171
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,990
What if I wanted to see move or shift some let's say X wrote the x or y axis you can actually do that

172
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,670
here.

173
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,930
Let's say if I wanted for example to shift this from the point six which is shift if you let's say I

174
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,480
wanted to shift in this to make a point it's let's drop it.

175
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,150
So you'll see that you actually shifted it you know to to the right.

176
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,380
Right to the X within the X when change say up you can make it it's a point to.

177
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,730
My apologies.

178
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,850
Point two if you run it you'll see that actually moved to the right and up right.

179
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,060
That's how can you change the location simply of it right.

180
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,950
It's put 0 here.

181
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,810
Let's turn it back in to make a point six point seven point two.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,210
OK it looks great here.

183
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,330
And then here you can change the Let's Make It for example point five point five.

184
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,540
You run that run it.

185
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,030
You'll see that you can change the size.

186
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,760
Simply put it can specify the location of the exact location of the Y.

187
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,580
How we're going to shift the curve.

188
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,390
OK.

189
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,380
And you can specify the dimensions as well here.

190
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,290
Using these two.

191
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,580
So simply put you specify the X..

192
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,840
Movement.

193
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:44,770
Why.

194
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,430
Movement of displacement size of the X and size of the Y with ratio with this with respect to the main

195
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,530
axes.

196
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,660
Or.

197
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,760
Let's assume that when I moved the other one for example make it let's say from point to point two and

198
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,090
she said there's 2.5 in point five.

199
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,740
OK.

200
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,210
You would see they actually move that make it bigger.

201
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,020
Obviously anymore the point to point.

202
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,870
OK.

203
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,730
It looks great.

204
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,550
Let's take a look again at another exercise and another examples.

205
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,720
Let's assume I'm going to run it and let's see what's going to happen.

206
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,250
What we have got here if you want to do let's say some plotting using the object oriented programming

207
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,160
method what we could do.

208
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,810
Then again we can create purity instead of vlt that figure that we had before we do that figure.

209
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,000
You can do with using P L T Dot sub plots and how you specify how many rows and how many columns are

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,540
written for.

211
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,730
Okay.

212
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,420
So if you specify t subplots and lemke's not forget the yes I used to forget it all the time to get

213
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,410
it right away.

214
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,240
You'll get the number of rows three a number of columns 1.

215
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,470
And here you get simply two objects you get to figure and you get X's out of it and then you can refer

216
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,050
to the axes because now we have three axes.

217
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,850
Then you get a quality axes of zero.

218
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,020
You can plot something to it axes of one couple or something to it and X is to complete something to

219
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,620
it listicle up.

220
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,830
So what we've done is that ok.

221
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,750
Okay xy is of zero.

222
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,750
Then a plot to its first to mean a plot.

223
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,640
X and Y with the red column.

224
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,900
And you get a column specifically X Lehman a y label and a specific table.

225
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,570
That's what you guys can get here.

226
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,580
For xes of one that's simply this data.

227
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,800
Plot x square and in a plot.

228
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,230
So you why squirrelling in a plot y cube.

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,730
Again if you run it that's what the data we've got here.

230
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,530
And that's pretty much how can you do subplots using the object or you and the programming method.

231
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,060
So let's take a look at how can we adjust the figures size spacing and column.

232
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,140
If you can see here you would see the kind of view there's an overlap here so the figure doesn't look

233
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,870
really nice.

234
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,050
So we could do here.

235
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,990
It can again do the exact same plot which is two of them were done before.

236
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,450
But what we could do with it can actually change again the thicker size skew within and specify the

237
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,760
figure size.

238
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,340
You can specify the figures as an MC.

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,510
Let's say 10 by 10 make a little bit bigger.

240
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,800
But that doesn't solve the actual problem which is how can we change the difference here which is what

241
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,770
we call a h space or a.

242
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,070
So as a list here you can change using the P T subplots underscored.

243
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,130
Just you can specify whatever you want.

244
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,790
You can change.

245
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,080
Let's say that didn't like the shifting in the left during during in the left direction the right direction.

246
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,570
You can change the width space n the H space as well.

247
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,200
And that's what we're interested in here.

248
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,450
So let's actually go here and enabled that line.

249
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,970
So what's the name of that line.

250
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,710
I want to make any shift so that's why I specify there's none.

251
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,980
And I wanted just achieve the HP distance between the two.

252
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,470
Let's set it a point for point on that.

253
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,760
Then you'll come up with a way better one then you can actually separate the figures or subplots using

254
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
the space.

255
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,300
It comes very handy in order to make the image a little bit better or clearer.

256
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,440
Again they may mimic any change here.

257
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,050
Exact same beta or the change we have done that we added their comment.

258
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,300
Just to think of the HS space n again we changed the figure size you're right.

259
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,690
What if I wanted to say to change again the life style or the line.

260
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,800
We kind of took a quick example before when I showed you how can we change let's say the the the colour

261
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,880
from red green blue or whatever.

262
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,740
These are kind of the different combinations they could ever imagine.

263
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,140
So you can actually BLT the plot x y you specify the lines style cones for spite.

264
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,330
Specify the marker you can specify again the colour.

265
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,370
And that's pretty much how can you mix them all together he can instead of writing them you know separately

266
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,630
can specify them in order so they're going to be the line style that will be the marker.

267
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,070
And that will be the colour of of the line.

268
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,150
And the MicroTech.

269
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,260
And here you have tons of combinations you can do like you know stencil for a square you can do Pentagon.

270
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,630
You can do like you know triangle you can do tons of stuff with it.

271
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,670
OK.

272
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,130
So here there's a tons of code in here.

273
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,530
Let's actually run it let's see what's going to happen.

274
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,470
I want you guys to guess you know which one is a liar corresponding to work.

275
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,080
OK.

276
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,480
There looks pretty.

277
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,030
So let's start with let's see the first ones here.

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,090
Basically what I've done here is just a couple of hard columns and seams with all of them are blue but

279
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,090
it seemed the width.

280
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,590
Let's see how can we change that with Kate to come up with this.

281
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,010
So simply put you will see that all the curves he'll have shifted by one that's where you come up with

282
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,800
all the shift and the y axis.

283
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,990
So you're plodding X versus Y but the y axis you're shifting them.

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,240
That's why you see those plus 1 2 3 4.

285
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,150
Up until 18 and you will see they're the first one all of them are collared equates to Blue which looks

286
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:48,110
good you know and the differences here we changed simply the width of the line with us from Point 2

287
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,990
5 to 1 to 5 on night.

288
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:59,430
Obviously here I just created again the blob subplots and specify the figure size and he just added

289
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,670
basically a plot to plot different plots of you.

290
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,230
If you wanted to and if you wanted to change the line styles he kept simply the column the same purple

291
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,330
line which the thing is the same but we change the style of the colour of the of the line so he would

292
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:15,780
make it.

293
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,830
Let's see desch will make it their diet and column.

294
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,120
That's what you get here so you get pretty much this and then there are darts and then all the dots

295
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,520
right.

296
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,910
Next one.

297
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,560
If I want to let's say to the marker.

298
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,740
Here we were just trying different combinations just to give you an idea of what we could do would how

299
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,050
powerful that is.

300
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,470
You can change you can give the words the same you can line style of the same but each in the moniker

301
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,230
from squares to all to star and that's what we're get.

302
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,720
We got square get Ole's got stars and got plus's as were good which is one clipless.

303
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,610
What if I one for example to change the micro size.

304
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,010
You can actually go and change the microseismic at it's 3 here.

305
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,670
Mixed again 7 making that a bit bigger.

306
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,660
You can me the micro size 10 and make it square.

307
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,500
So there's the square we weskit see here and you can actually as well even column of the actual face

308
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,980
of the model which is you know kind of crazy you Ken.

309
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:12,930
You can do a really pretty plus using a mad flocculate you can use again like a face column equal to

310
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,470
yellow and that's why you see there is yellow here or.

311
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,380
However you see that the the boundary is green because you specify the line actual colour is green.

312
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,960
What you could do here as well is that you can say okay I need the little even more pretty you can change

313
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,860
the edge.

314
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,790
For example you can change the thickness of the edge you change the thickness of the edge and make a

315
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,470
blue.

316
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,090
Again you can do tons of stuff with it.

317
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,720
I just wanted to give you an idea how powerful that could be.

318
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,300
Right.

319
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,920
OK.
