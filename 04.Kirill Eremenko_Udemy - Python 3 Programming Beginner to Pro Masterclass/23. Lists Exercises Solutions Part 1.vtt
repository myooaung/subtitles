00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.210
Hello everyone and welcome to this election.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.150
This election is going to walk you through with your solutions simply for the last questions.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.870
All right.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.570
So let's get started.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.400
I hope you guys were able to figure out you know maybe couple of questions.

6
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.770
If not that's fine.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.450
Don't worry about it.

8
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.200
We're just going to work through all of them.

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.360
First question I'm asking you to print first.

10
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.470
Second unless elements within the list.

11
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.900
All right.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.620
Let's stick a look so to print the first elements and say okay print.

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.460
Right.

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.690
And we're going to see a list here the name off the list which is Nemes right open square brackets.

15
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.970
And then I need to print the first elements of the first element Sarah has an index of zero for you

16
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.840
as a member of PLEASE.

17
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.850
Again he listed the member the first element of the list has an index of the right as most of those

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.690
have covered that or adopt it for granite.

19
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.530
They'll come up with serious looks.

20
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.670
If I copy that and I need to do it twice so you need to do this.

21
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.600
And I wanted to be the second element.

22
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.690
So the second element has an index of one and to print the last element which as Rob has that index

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.370
if you do negative indexing will do minus 1 and that should obtain again Sarah Chanel eyedrop which

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.750
is great.

25
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.860
Perfect.

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.510
That was pretty easy.

27
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.750
Your next question is I wanted to print all elements in the list.

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.390
Print schnall Mitch and Ryan here in the first three elements are I print the last three elements here

29
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.610
and skip each other.

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.010
OK.

31
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.370
Let's take a look at what we could do if we wanted to first to print all elements I can do that by seeing

32
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.370
we print.

33
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.330
I'm going to say Nemes open square bracket and then went to print.

34
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.900
All of them was going to see Colin and that should print them out and then here we got them off script

35
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.150
and I could do it it just going to press a to create new cells and I just want to make it you know kind

36
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.670
of a little bit readable.

37
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230
I'm going to do this on it again and again.

38
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.660
So that's the first answer of the question.

39
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.340
The second one is I wanted to copy this.

40
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.330
Put it here and I wanted to print here.

41
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.910
Chanel MITCHELL Right.

42
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.070
Okay and it print deals because remember this has index of zeo index of one grade so I need to print

43
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.990
starting from index of one right and then any.

44
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.900
This is Index one.

45
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.670
This is.

46
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.510
This is three right.

47
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.580
And if you're as a member we wanted to take this into consideration.

48
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.200
Then you have to think for here.

49
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.480
Just simply if I put the four I'm going to go from elements 1 2 and 3 and simply are going to skip the

50
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.540
number 4 right.

51
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.270
If I don't that means to come up with another match Orion which is basically what you were requesting

52
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.080
in the actual question.

53
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.380
The next question is I want to print the first three elements or write the first three elements within

54
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.980
the the list.

55
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.360
I can say OK print.

56
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.650
Are going to see names or point again square brackets.

57
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.190
I'm going to say okay I need to print the first three elements in order to do that I can look into print

58
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.150
this this and this right so I can do that actually by say look at Colin and then 3.

59
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.740
If they do this I mean okay in all elements up to 3 which is.

60
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.980
That's why you come up with another great next element.

61
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.420
The next question I wanted to print the last three elements.

62
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.030
That's actually easy so I can do that.

63
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.430
Seeing kid print rights again square Nemes square brackets and I can do again negative indexing but

64
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.890
I need to print the last three elements.

65
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.210
I can do that by single.

66
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.850
I need to print mine in a three hour and then common this basically say okay I need to print to get

67
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.710
all the elements from minus 3 and moving on.

68
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.930
And that's basically all the estimates they have here.

69
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.350
If I done that that would come up with holy Alex wrong.

70
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.380
Let's see if I wanted to get a let's say Ryan as well.

71
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.810
I'm going to say okay minus four.

72
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.830
Except for an idea.

73
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.290
That's why I come up with basically these these last 40 albums.

74
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.420
Let's go back and make it three so you won't get confused.

75
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.300
That's all I am looking for.

76
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.910
The last one I wanted to do I wanted to print every Or skip each other element.

77
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.380
So simply I wanted to print for example say I skipped Chanel and all mentioned so I can do their best

78
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.710
to get print.

79
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.540
I think we didn't cover that in the concept section but that's fine.

80
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.510
Well you got to do here is simply names.

81
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.030
I'm going to do it by basically do Colin.

82
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.600
Colin to that simply we're going to say okay skip each other element alright and print the names so

83
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.410
that's why going to come.

84
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.920
Sarah Mitch Hawley and rock which is great.

85
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.640
Alright.

86
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.870
Perfect.

87
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.940
Okay.

88
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.440
I hope that wasn't too hard.

89
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.800
The next question that we have here is I wanted to play in SALLY SARA said you know.

90
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.450
And then Ali.

91
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.690
OK.

92
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.260
OK.

93
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.340
So if you as a member these are kind of nested lists So that's they don't have a list that's nested

94
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.910
within a larger list here.

95
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.720
OK.

96
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.400
Let's take a look.

97
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.570
So I wanted to print first the SARAH.

98
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.340
Sarah simply is contained within the next list.

99
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.630
Right.

100
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.800
Which is an eastern list.

101
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.590
Do you ever take it print.

102
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.300
My list or prescribe jackets.

103
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.330
First I wanted to say okay what's the location of this element in the larger list in the big lists.

104
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.880
I have elements zeo all that has an index of one right.

105
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.170
This is in books too.

106
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.500
This is Indicus three.

107
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.980
And what I need to do here the thing I wanted to key to prevent to get the index of one so that's one

108
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.780
that will get me in the larger list here sorry in the nested list.

109
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.750
Right.

110
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.800
And I wanted to get the element or the name Sarah in there.

111
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.960
Right.

112
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.270
In order to do that I need to say okay in my less nested list within my nested list I need a team.

113
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.650
I'm sorry I want to talk in Sally and I apologize.

114
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.200
I get up in this element right this element actually to open again this quebecer and say okay this is

115
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.810
index of zero within the smallest This is in the of one within the near smallest and make it 1 1 4 on

116
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.820
it that will you.

117
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.280
Oh my apologies that my list.

118
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.350
And we'll open.

119
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.220
One one actually didn't run it sorry I didn't find it.

120
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.760
And then when you run it you come up with Sally which is basically the element that we have here which

121
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.520
is three.

122
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.850
Next one is I wanted to print.

123
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.460
Sarah Sally NGO which is simply all this is actually pretty easy that's an easy one.

124
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.410
It's like meac Print.

125
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.550
I open my lists square brackets and just need the element number one which is simply this has the element

126
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.900
of zero in the larger list.

127
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.390
This is all that is basic isn't in the case of one which is what I'm looking for.

128
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.750
And it will come up with serious challenges which is great.

129
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.070
The next one is that one wanted to print Ali was two different ways which is basically the last element

130
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.090
two different ways.

131
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.650
One of them I can use negative indexing.

132
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.160
I think it print my list.

133
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.010
Open square.

134
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.080
In this case minus one.

135
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.060
That's an easy one.

136
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.860
OK.

137
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.570
The other way of doing it is that I say okay I wanted to again copy that.

138
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.190
Copy it here and so doing the negative indexing.

139
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.160
I know this has index of zero.

140
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.530
This is the index of one.

141
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.220
This is index of two index of three.

142
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.000
So if I come here and say OK it is in the three that should basically these two should have been the

143
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.270
exact same answer and that the fact that you come up with the exact same answer which is exactly what

144
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.010
I was looking for which is great.

145
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.810
Alright.

146
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.660
The next question that we have is they wanted to print the length of the list and add your name to the

147
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.840
list which is kind of you know I want you to do some extensive research here.

148
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.780
So if you guys can see here we have.

149
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.140
This is my list and I wanted to simply print the length of the list.

150
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.990
We have done that before.

151
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.800
We covered it before hitting a silk print.

152
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.660
Right.

153
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:54.570
And I need to get up in the length of my list was easy for that you would come up with four that's why

154
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.100
which makes sense because here we have actually four elements in my list.

155
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.220
Let's assume they wanted to append say a pen.

156
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.760
That means I wanted to add an additional element of the list.

157
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.170
We did a couple of them before but again he tried to give you kind of a hint to guess and look it up

158
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:16.280
so it could say I can apply in method let's call append to append or add additional elements to my list.

159
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.630
Listicle Look I misspoke in my list.

160
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.970
Okay which is the name of the list ocasek in dot which is applying a method to my list of a silk.

161
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.660
P.

162
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.200
Open parentheses and then write whatever name you want.

163
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.700
7 7 mining for example if I had done that nothing happened everything is good.

164
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:42.750
That means the cell has ran and if I say okay let's say prints my list now which is my new list.

165
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.650
If I add on that the owner would come up with you'd find the name line has been added to it which is

166
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:46.950
great.

167
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.890
That's exactly what I was when I was asking for the question.

168
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.640
So let's stop here and let's continue in the next lecture through the next questions.

169
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.940
I hope you guys enjoyed that lecture and see you in the next one.
