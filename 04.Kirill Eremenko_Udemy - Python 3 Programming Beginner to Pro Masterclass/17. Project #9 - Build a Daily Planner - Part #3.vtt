00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.730
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the PBS lectures.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.190
We learned how can we divide develop our username and password system right.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.410
And we saw how can we call our day planner function and we actually stopped by building our day planner

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.700
function.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.030
If you guys are to call the planner function takes the time and hours.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.050
Right.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.100
And here we define kind of a dictionary that has let's say a time 10 to ten program lectures I'm twelve

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.670
computer vision and so on so forth and here we're ready to simply compare the time that we've got with

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.090
our data dictionary and simply print out our lecture that we should be attending.

10
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.270
Let's see how can we do that.

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:53.130
I mean it's okay for we're going to simply take our task on this court time in daily task

12
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.340
dot Keyes.

13
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.840
So what I'm asking you to do is say okay let's go to the daily task.

14
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.540
Okay.

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.900
Dot Keyes if because remember these are the keys right.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.770
These are the values because that's why it's called dictionary called a key value pair.

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.410
It's the key and the value associated with it right.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:23.070
So when I say okay for task time in daily task got keys if you find the time which is sent here to the

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:35.510
function on the score H underscore now is less than or equal to the task on this court time okay.

20
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:47.440
Well we could do a circuit print printout you should attend and what we could do here.

21
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.720
We could pass along the value associated to the dictionary.

22
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.090
You're right.

23
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.480
We gonna say OK you need to stand daily task which is go into into our dictionary daily tasks.

24
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:06.620
Right and let's fetch out the task score time which is very associated to that specific task type.

25
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.890
All right.

26
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.770
Please bear in mind that here this is not the only way.

27
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.550
This is actually like kind of a like not not an amazing way of doing it because we don't have kind of

28
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.170
a window right.

29
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.170
We can actually create like you know more complex waves of keep the time but you say between 10 and

30
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.840
let's say 12.

31
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.450
Exactly and so on here.

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.820
This is just you know kind of a lazy way of doing it.

33
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.340
We're saying okay at the time let's say let's say the user sent 10 9 for example if the 9 is less than

34
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.500
let's say 10 right then we're gonna print out the daily task is programming lessons on if the user let's

35
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.840
say insert for instance Eleven.

36
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.290
All right.

37
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.050
So we're going to go here compared is eleven less than 10 know is 11 less than twelve yes then it's

38
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.270
a computer vision and so on.

39
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.370
And then we'll get actually we're just going to kind of limiting.

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.200
Very limited to let's say between 8:00 a.m. in the morning and 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon.

41
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.500
What we need to do afterwards after we print it out we just need to break.

42
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.750
Right.

43
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.720
We don't need to do anything afterwards.

44
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.440
That's pretty much the function and the function I'm going to turn anything the day planner function

45
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.580
just takes the time compares it to the database that it has and just printed out.

46
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.780
That's pretty much all worried what it does.

47
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.640
Okay.

48
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.060
And then afterwards we're just gonna break it.

49
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.080
All right let's go ahead and test our beautiful code let's run our function first let's see if it works

50
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.410
or not.

51
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.640
Well what a train.

52
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.050
That's good.

53
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.840
And let's go ahead here and let's run this introduce a name so let's try uppercase and let's try y es

54
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.720
K percentage 1 to 3 if you run it well user name and password is not correct.

55
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.710
Axis the night makes complete sense because here the user name was all uppercase.

56
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.310
Right.

57
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.460
Okay let's try one more time.

58
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.160
Let's run again.

59
00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.330
And I'm asking you to introduce a name when I say OK it's R Y N and asking for a password.

60
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.450
So going to say OK password is why is K percentage.

61
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.220
One two three four.

62
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.560
For instance let's try just to test if that condition actually does the ending operation or not.

63
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.400
Let's run it.

64
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.950
Well username or password is not correct.

65
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.160
That's perfect.

66
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.610
Now we tested the user name portion and the password portion as well.

67
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.020
And both of them works perfectly.

68
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.510
All right.

69
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.470
Let's run one more time enter user name.

70
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.870
So I'm going to say okay user name is Ryan.

71
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.150
Password is why is key percentage.

72
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.950
One two three.

73
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.070
And Access granted.

74
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.580
That's good.

75
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.100
Now we're here somewhere and the mascot they use it to insert specific time.

76
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.110
So what's the time right now.

77
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.120
I'm going to say let's say the time is let's say eleven o'clock actually.

78
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.790
Let's go to something easy let's go to 9 a.m. and it's press enter.

79
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.060
And here we go.

80
00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.700
The function printed out he should attend programming lecture room a which let's go up that's actually

81
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.950
makes complete sense because until 9:00.

82
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.350
And anything below 10:00 right should be authentic programming lecture room.

83
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.100
All right.

84
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.980
And afterwards after we went back from the function day planner what happened is we printed out to the

85
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.900
users basically our our final operation here and that's what we've got here.

86
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.590
So I got you know what went out we had the file and that's the coding exercise you know printing out

87
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.040
the lecture notes from left from the previous lecture.

88
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.620
All right let's test it one more time.

89
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.200
It's tested again and again and again.

90
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.080
Let's introduce a name Ryan let's add why is K percentage 1 2 3.

91
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.000
What's the time right now.

92
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.350
Let's for example go for twelve and half OK.

93
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.830
Let's see what's going to happen.

94
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.290
He should be.

95
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.570
You should be in a lunchtime with the cafeteria which makes sense because now between 12 and 13 that's

96
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.850
where the lunchtime cafeteria time is right.

97
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.990
Okay let's test it one more time.

98
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.380
Take it.

99
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:10.300
Ryan let's add the why escape percentage one two three and ask what's the time right now please enter

100
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.780
a 24 hour format.

101
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.680
So when I say OK maybe let's try.

102
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.120
Let's try 14 which is 2 o'clock then a rally should be a group meeting group project meeting room E..

103
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.900
So let's go ahead group project meeting room.

104
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.940
OK.

105
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.890
So our code actually works great right now.

106
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.990
All right.

107
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.620
So I'm gonna leave you guys for a very quick challenge okay.

108
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.340
And I want you guys here to make the username not case sensitive.

109
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.590
So let's say they use user insert for example are y n uppercase or lowercase or whatever.

110
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.190
You know the user of the system will stick and accept it.

111
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.990
Okay.

112
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.000
You might need to do a little bit of research or refer back to the basics of the programming in the

113
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.830
pita section.

114
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.430
We actually covered that before.

115
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.800
Okay.

116
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.570
It's kind of an operation that we could do to the string to actually convert it into a lowercase in

117
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.870
a way.

118
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.520
Okay.

119
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.540
And that's the first challenge.

120
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.030
And the next minute challenge that I want us to do.

121
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:19.920
And I want you to instead of doing the filing operation here in the main I want you guys to do the file

122
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.990
operation is how to open the file and actually printed in inside the function.

123
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.210
So the planner.

124
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.700
Okay we're gonna call it day let's say day planner and let's say and lecture notes for example like

125
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.790
lecture fetching for instance is to obtain the lecture notes and we want to do the file operation within

126
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.420
our function to.

127
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.430
All right.

128
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:46.370
Please go ahead guys and pause the video and these do these two challenges and see you guys after the

129
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:53.850
challenge.

130
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.570
All right.

131
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.640
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

132
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.940
So what I ask you guys to do is to make the system a little bit more robust.

133
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.600
All right so let's let's go ahead and see what they mean by this.

134
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:11.220
So let's run this one first and if we go here if we run it OK I'm asking to enter user name so if I

135
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.170
see Ryan for example our way in all uppercase OK.

136
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.760
And I asked enter let's say a password.

137
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.110
All right.

138
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.520
So the password is gonna be like why ASCII percentage.

139
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.970
1 2 3.

140
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.270
They mean well username and password is not correct even though the name is pretty much the same.

141
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.480
However here this was you know very case set case sensitive or was uppercase and all of them why N has

142
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.090
to be lowercase.

143
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.240
So what we could do here we can say OK instead of having this I'm going to make it all lowercase.

144
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.600
All right so all of them are gonna be right here and whatever the user we're going to be inputting here

145
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.680
what I'm gonna do I'm going to convert it into lower by basically doing dot lower.

146
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:57.180
And that will convert wherever the user is gonna be inputting here into lowercase.

147
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.860
So when we do the comparison you know if they use it and insert it that's lower case that's fine if

148
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.680
we insert for example all of an uppercase that's fine if we insert the first letter as uppercase that's

149
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.990
fine too.

150
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.460
Let's give it a shot.

151
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.030
Let's run it into user names so can say Ryan.

152
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.580
Well if you guys take a look here you'll find that here I added a line here to print input user name

153
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.210
so you find that the user name he has become becomes lowercase.

154
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.450
Right.

155
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.230
So it just converted whatever the user is going gonna be inputting into lowercase enter your password.

156
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.580
Let's give it a shot wise key percentage 1 2 3 access granted.

157
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.640
What's the time right now.

158
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.260
It's 12 and here you go should be attending computer vision and these are the lecture notes.

159
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:38.640
All right.

160
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.840
Looks great.

161
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.200
The next challenge that I ask you guys to do is to simply move these commands move the finding operation

162
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.060
into the function.

163
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.010
So after we do this I can just go here and do that here.

164
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.810
That's it.

165
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.240
Let's give it a shot.

166
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.740
So it's run.

167
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.460
That's good looks good.

168
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.000
Let's run.

169
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.680
That's user name.

170
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.700
All uppercase.

171
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.060
I don't care anymore.

172
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.550
OK.

173
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.190
And then I'm going to insert y ASCII percentage 1 2 3.

174
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.860
Time right now.

175
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.830
Let's say it is 8:00 a.m. in the morning and here we go.

176
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.570
You should be attending programming lecture.

177
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.040
And here are the lecture notes.

178
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.880
So we simply can insert as well or the filing operation within the function with no problem.

179
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.530
All right.

180
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.650
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

181
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.350
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you guys in future projects.
