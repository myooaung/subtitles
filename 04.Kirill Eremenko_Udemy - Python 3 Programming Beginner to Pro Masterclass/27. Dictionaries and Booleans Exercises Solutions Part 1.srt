00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,630
Hello everyone and welcome to this election.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,090
Let's get started.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,890
Let's try to solve a couple of the questions that we have here.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,680
OK.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,770
So first I ask you to create a dictionary we see of your favourite friends and their respective age

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,890
and print the age of the second meme you choose.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,400
All right.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,700
Let's get it straight talk talking a created dictionary.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,940
Call it let's say my friends.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,670
My friends.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,800
And here I'm going to did declare or define a dictionary can you scrawly brackets.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,280
And let's assume let's create a couple of new cells here just to make a little bit readable.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,600
And what it could do here.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,510
I'm going to say okay then my first friend let's call a Killick column for example lylah for instance.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,270
And the age let's say is 25 I bracket comment.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:49,940
Okay.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,400
Let's find the second name.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,470
Let's call it Sally for instance.

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,910
And we're going to call it 22 years old comma and let's say again a third name with good solid quality.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Rob for instance and their age is let's say 31.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,130
All right let's make a little bit clear here.

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,680
So here they have my beautiful dictionary okay for it it's right.

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,960
And it actually come here.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,490
And guess it it prints.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,610
And I can pass along my friends and you'll come up with the beautiful dictionary.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,610
Right.

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,070
And I'm asking you to print simply this second the age simply of the second name you choose which is

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,140
whatever name you choose you get.

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,190
So what we do here.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:38,410
Say it prints little X's second element and say okay go to my underscore friends pocket dictionary and

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,930
again to access that specific value for you as a member.

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,990
I can access the values within the dictionary using its key which is Sally here they open square brackets.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,150
And here I can specify case Sally and that's it.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,670
So if you access it at 22 that's exactly what I was looking for.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,330
All right.

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,980
Perfect.

37
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,600
I hope you guys were able to figure that out.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,690
That was pretty straightforward.

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,800
Let's delay couple of cells here and let's enso Couple of nuisance here.

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,780
Second question is I wanted to create a dictionary with some of your favourite friends and their respective

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,980
hourly wage.

42
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,280
End up Kane the average of all the standards.

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,100
OK that's pretty interesting.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,830
So let's get started.

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,340
And I say Okay my underscore for example friends.

46
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,910
All right.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,120
And I'm going to say okay equals two brackets.

48
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm going to say Okay.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,650
First name is let's say again I'm going to stick with the C names lylah and let's say I was making 25

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,780
dollars an hour.

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,760
Second one we're going to be let's say Sally and Sally is making for instance twenty two dollars an

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,210
hour.

53
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,470
And then the last name let's see equality Rob and Rob is let's see making for example thirty one dollars

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,040
an hour.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,030
Whatever you guys can call it whatever.

56
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,500
Or I could do here.

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,300
And then I say okay that's good.

58
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:02,320
And I can come here let's say to Prince for example my underscore friends I'm going to print my dictionary.

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,230
Looks great.

60
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,850
And he don't want to talk cane.

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,030
For example the average little kid the average I need to go into my dictionary.

62
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,720
Access these numbers add them up and divided by three.

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,700
That's pretty much it.

64
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,720
Let's get let's see.

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,660
Can we do that and say OK I wanted to first access my first element which is my friends.

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,680
Right.

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,840
And I wanted to access the first one I can access again using the name lylah that will return the first

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,510
value which is 25 right.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,500
I can.

70
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,040
Let's say.

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
Copy and paste.

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,910
And instead of lay low it is going to say OK I need Sally right for a minute.

73
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,550
They'll give me twenty two a second venue.

74
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,390
Great.

75
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:48,790
I can copy it again and I can put raabe and you for it and that's that should return me back so want

76
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,700
which is so so then perfect.

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,550
Now I need to simply I can put that just copy this and put it here.

78
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,410
Plus and copy it.

79
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,850
Copy.

80
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,620
This one and plus and copy it's perfect.

81
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,150
Now I have to master the summation of all of them.

82
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,450
I don't mean the summation of the average.

83
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,320
So to some of them up we're going to users are going to add parentheses here.

84
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,880
For example right here know some of them up and now I can simply buy them divided by three.

85
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,350
Sorry just to give the average right.

86
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,520
And I can put that lets say into a variable called Average for example.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,990
And if I run it and I can go here and print for example my average and if I had done it you would come

88
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,820
up with a value of 26 which is basically the average of all these numbers.

89
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,530
All right.

90
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,680
That's pretty much how can you update the axis elements within dictionary and an opt in their average

91
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,490
beauty.

92
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,160
Perfect.

93
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,430
The next question that we have here is let's create new cells.

94
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,010
And I'm asking you to update the previous dictionary we still have your next favourite fans and the

95
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,360
respective salaries too.

96
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,240
And then the average of all the salaries.

97
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,090
Let's this again copy our Again the exact same one here.

98
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:11,140
I mean I'm trying to test you and or your abilities on how to add additional elements to your dictionary.

99
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,660
It's OK to do that and say okay my underscore friends and I will love to add in your line I am going

100
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,290
to say okay.

101
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,420
Square brackets.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,230
I have to specify the key for us.

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,770
See.

104
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,780
For example Mary and I'm going to associate the value of 22 for example as her salary.

105
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,040
Again add another line my friends or the new key value pair and I'm going to call her for example or

106
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,620
call him exemplar Peter.

107
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,810
An ominous sign.

108
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,810
An hourly wage of 25 for example.

109
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,960
And that's fine and that looks good.

110
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:51,010
Nor etta's if I wanted to print for example my apologies print my underscore friends all around it.

111
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,090
You'll come up with lylah salyer ROBB Mary and Peter which means that you have successfully added these

112
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,190
two new elements.

113
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,780
Right.

114
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,960
What if I want to talk in the average or right or pin average as we done before.

115
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,680
We can go here and do this exact same stuff you get but I need to add.

116
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,850
First and it did this make it 5 because now I've done the average of five elements but I need to add

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,910
two more elements to do that.

118
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,880
Then I say okay I'm going to copy this right.

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,140
In a sea of kit plus pastes plus and paste but only to update it.

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,600
Obviously here is a good garbage in this market.

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,680
Mary Ann come here to update this and make it okay.

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,110
And let's make a little bit better.

123
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,290
Let's run it.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,000
So we're on.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,510
That's And I can come here and print the value of the average and that then you would come up with a

126
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,320
value of 25 or OK.

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,020
OK.

128
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,750
Perfect.

129
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,800
Again this is kind of you know a very basic way of actually paying all the elements with addiction.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm going to show you one forward that there's a better way of actually doing this just all in all elements.

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,020
Now in the summation of okay how can we do that.

132
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's actually cover it right now right away.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,050
In order to do that.

134
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,230
Another way of doing it.

135
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,630
I'm going to say Okay want it all.

136
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,900
All the elements within like I want to say 25 22 31 22 and so on.

137
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,930
Well let's do that.

138
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm going to say OK.

139
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,470
Go to my friends.

140
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:18,960
OK.

141
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,720
And apply a method that we call it values and open basically prentice's that we're just going to go

142
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,330
there and open in all the values right away.

143
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,620
You don't need to go and Axxess each element separately which is the beauty of Python that's actually

144
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,550
very powerful.

145
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,590
But just using this simple method you can opt in all the values right away and then you can upload you

146
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,220
can do wonders with them.

147
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,750
I think what I could do here I say okay I need to some play function.

148
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,230
It's called Some nation.

149
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,910
Right.

150
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:54,470
That's some of the values and after you do this just multiply whatever you're going to get here by five.

151
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,980
All right.

152
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,100
And let's print that and let's print that.

153
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,570
So if I wanted to print it it is going to go here and print their value for it.

154
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,690
You'll come up with the exact same answer which is great again.

155
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,740
Just to clarify it I'm printing.

156
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,810
With the print right.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,970
I'm told to print again.

158
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,050
It is a summation.

159
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,780
It is a summation function of trying to some right some summing up elements.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,090
Right.

161
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,800
And.

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,560
The summation simply dividing by five walked in the average.

163
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,580
And this returns all the elements.

164
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:32,040
This simply returns all the values and getting hit 25 22 31 22 and 25 which is in a just one shot of

165
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,670
writing all these lines.

166
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,120
I can just do it here in one simple show.

167
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,100
All right.

168
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,440
Let's take one more example.

169
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,810
Okay so here I'm asking you to write a code that multiplies all elements in the following dictionary.

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,670
Okay.

171
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
So in order to do that what I would do here.

172
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,290
You're going to say okay I need to for example to multiply all elements are going to find kind of an

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,200
accumulator or a variable that is going to be be using to just pick an element and multiply it so it's

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,100
okay.

175
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm going to set it to one gay and every time I'm going to say okay my total value equals to my total

176
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:19,290
or are old and will get to multiply by go please to my dictionary which I have here and please is the

177
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,170
first element so I can access the element data one.

178
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,110
All right.

179
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,140
So that we're thinking in a go here or in the first element.

180
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,700
Right.

181
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,880
And multiplied by 1 and then we're going to be the total here.

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,710
Okay.

183
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,480
I want to do it again in a very simple form I'm going to do it you know and kind of on separate lines.

184
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,670
OK.

185
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,290
So going to copy this and I'm going to go here in a paste and paste.

186
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,130
Every time I'm going to go get data to an income give it a three.

187
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,580
And my total value and then here is going to go and print my total.

188
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,080
Right.

189
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,760
So on this.

190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,420
Let's run through on this first.

191
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,570
This and this any would come up with the total which is simply the multiplication of all this.

192
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,460
Again I'm going to leave it for you guys.

193
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,100
You can again do it again in one line obviously but I'm just showing that to you because moving forward

194
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,640
I'm going to show you how can we use 40 loops to actually do all this operation.

195
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,070
Just in a very simple just one single line.

196
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,620
And it's not like of course which is the simple truth.

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,710
All right.

198
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,550
Okay.

199
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,420
And that's pretty much what I have for this election.

200
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,420
I hope you guys enjoyed it and let's continue with the next exercises in the next election.
