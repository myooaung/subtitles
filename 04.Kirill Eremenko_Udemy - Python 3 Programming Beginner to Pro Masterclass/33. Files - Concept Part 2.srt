00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello everyone and welcome to this new lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,900
We're able to do some basic operations with files like opening the file you know like writing information

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,190
to it and so on.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,060
And this section I'm going to show you how can we create a new file from scratch.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,340
How to maybe add some folder loops and maybe like you know do some operations within the data we're

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,410
going to be reading out of the file.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,020
We're going to be pretty pretty interesting.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,130
OK let's assume they wanted to create a new file.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,570
OK.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
Whatever new file you can call it whatever name.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,530
So if you go up here you will find that X if you open the file for exec purposes that means you are

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,430
creating a new file.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,730
All right.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,310
Let's see how can we do that.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:46,370
So what we could do and say F equals to open and we can open something here for X purposes for x.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,960
That means going to create it from scratch here.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,670
You can call it whatever you want.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,740
He's going to call it let's say like you know the files file new.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,230
Okay obviously I have tons of files in there.

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,450
Okay.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,830
Please can you can call it whatever you want to call it let's say five new during let's say filming

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,900
so you guys can can know like separated from the other files that we have.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,370
So this is a new file we created during filming during the actual lecture that I've been doing right

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,030
now.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,270
So now I created a new file with that title.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,550
All right.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,390
The question is how.

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,560
What do you want to say into it.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,860
What do you want to write into it.

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:26,430
So I gonna say F dot right and here I can write whatever I want so I can say again I am learning Python

31
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,530
now something like that shift.

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,110
And then you need afterwards to make sure that actually if not closed the file that should close it

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,010
you've entered.

34
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,810
Here we go.

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,910
As long as you can find any errors you should be fine.

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,710
If you come here you should find like five new filming for example.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,410
OK.

38
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,250
All right.

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,040
My apologies.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,860
I actually made a short quick mistake so you need to include the the type of the file so there's a dot

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,590
text dot text I should enter.

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,520
Here we go.

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,550
If you go back you will find you should file and yet my new filming that text document open it.

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,060
Here we go.

45
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm learning Python now which is exactly matches what we have just wrote here.

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,970
OK.

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,320
All right.

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,680
That's great.

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,570
Let's see how can we for example open a file and create a for loop that loops on the actual content

50
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,870
of that file.

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,970
So what I could do.

52
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,410
Okay let's go back to our files and say F equals to open.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,820
Can open again my file that we had before.

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Okay.

55
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,990
The text and you can open this for reading purposes.

56
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,930
And afterwards I'm going to create a for loop will say for line in my file.

57
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:42,340
So every time I go to my file extract line and print it and print my line enter it we go and we've been

58
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,240
able to simply go ahead and extract every line individually.

59
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,340
OK.

60
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,480
This is just kind of a way of how can you actually extract information and loop on on the actual content

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,120
of that file.

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,650
OK.

63
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,220
All right.

64
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,850
Let's take a look at another example.

65
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,490
Let's assume that we wanted for instance to open the file and read the content.

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,240
And for instance let's say a split or the content of that file into let's say different words.

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,380
How can we do that.

68
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,670
It's going to take it with let's say open or you can define it before as we have done before.

69
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,680
Equal open.

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,980
This is another way of doing it.

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,270
Take it with open and here they can specify let's say I wanted to take the fight I wanted to open which

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:31,590
is my file the text and I can open that for reading purposes and you can say as if this is simply exactly

73
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,690
the same or exact equivalent and that's OK.

74
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,550
No change.

75
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,540
All right so the first step and then what you could do is going to take a text for example data which

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,120
is the actual content of that file equals to f dot read lines right.

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
So shift entry we go.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,070
So now we're able to access actually can do this.

79
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,660
You can access text data.

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,600
So now this is simply all the data contained within the file.

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,860
Right.

82
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,960
OK.

83
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,640
Next step what it could do.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,860
You're gonna say okay for line in our text data every time.

85
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,050
Go ahead extract the line and simply when I wanted to do here I wanted to split kind of split all the

86
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,330
content of that into just simple bunch of words simply.

87
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,410
Okay so when I say for line in text data I mean it's split simply our text data.

88
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,640
Our line each line going to be taking here I'm going to do dot splits so I'm gonna split it into simple

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,180
words and I'm going to put them in words and then afterwards when you're done please go ahead and print

90
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,700
my words enter.

91
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,220
Here we go.

92
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,820
So now we'll be able to extract only eye information only and then am separately and then becoming a

93
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,230
pro and so on so forth.

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,060
That's kind of another way of extracting information and maybe visualizing it when we dividing it into

95
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,910
a bunch of strings a bunch of you know like characters on this using the line got split.

96
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,850
Okay.

97
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,470
All right.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,180
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,650
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

100
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,610
In the next lecture I'm gonna walk you through again pretty much the same final operation but using

101
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,950
C as V files instead of text files.

102
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,930
OK we're going to get much more interesting.

103
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,740
Stay tuned.

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,780
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
