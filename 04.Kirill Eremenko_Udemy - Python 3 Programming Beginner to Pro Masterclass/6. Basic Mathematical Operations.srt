00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,190
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,730
We're going to cover three important topics mainly call variable assignment.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,860
And then we're going to cover what college presidents of the order of operations.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,040
And then we're going to cover how to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition subtraction

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,530
multiplication and so on.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Right.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,700
Just a quick overview before starting you know with the first Jupiter notebook here.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:36,760
When you guys go and open the course package you will mainly see kind of like a standard folder where

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,930
you going to see that we can introduce any concept like for example here we're introducing these tings

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,480
concept.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,930
So you will find that it's a lecture three a concept that has ching's followed by the exercise right

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,240
away.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,710
See you guys again in this quarter you would find tons of exercises.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,130
Right.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,410
So you can make an attempt to actually solve the exercise on your own.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,140
And that's where you would find it has it be index here and then afterwards you guys are going to find

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,460
the solutions right away.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,010
All right.

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,880
So again in general for each topic we're going to be introducing you will find that there is a concept

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,250
lecture just in deducing what it is.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,950
First all right and we have some examples as well followed by the exercises questions and then are going

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,350
to find the exercise solutions afterwards.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,040
Right.

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,410
Okay.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,640
So let's get started.

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's first cover the first topic that we have here which is very Simon's presidents and basic mathematical

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,240
operations.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,400
And then afterwards are going to cover the topic too which is how we do print operation and how to get

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,160
user input and then we're going to cover topics three strings.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,870
Followed by topic four which is lists followed by Topic 5 which is dictionaries and booleans.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,230
And they call it going to cover top execs which is polls and says Alright guys enjoy this.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,180
There's like you know there's tons of information here and this is kind of the you know the basic foundations

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,090
to do any programming and mainly for Python programming language.

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,760
All right.

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,370
So let's get started.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,300
So first OK we're going to cover is how can we do basic mathematical operations.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,950
Alright Alright so here's what you guys can see here.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Is that in the dupatta notebook.

39
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,540
What I try to do with it is try to include text along with the codes.

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,270
So here in these cells we'll be able to go ahead and actually write lines of code so any lines of keuning

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,020
here could be actually executed at OK.

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,100
However here these are not actual cults.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,850
These are the we'll call it mark-ups down right down cells so if you actually click here on any of these

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,310
cells you would find that they are listed as marked down right.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,880
Another option is the filter you listed as code.

46
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,770
Well I'm going to be using you know heading means you're going to be focussing on code and mark down.

47
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,530
So mainly here are the all these are nouns which means a few For example I came and said look.

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,360
Hello for example.

49
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,650
Hello world.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,270
All right.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,580
Well I guess I can see here this is LIST right now as code.

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,150
All right so if I try to run it you know we find that there's an error.

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,440
There are new invalid syntax because it doesn't mean anything to python.

54
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,860
However if I go here and a chain that says to mark down or right and you run it then you will see that

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,340
actually becomes kind of you know like a like a heading or a tidal.

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,050
Okay so you can hit.

57
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,010
That means that Python were not going to be executing any of the lines in here.

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,800
Right.

59
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,930
Okay.

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,870
So what we could do is that we wanted to delete this cells to delete any cells dupes.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,290
You come here you press here and then you press double deep OK.

62
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,170
You press deep deep so deep deep okay that will remove the entire cell.

63
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,860
If you want to add the new cell you can press a.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,510
That will create new cells in here.

65
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,650
Delete them.

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm going to go Press deedy to delete different cells.

67
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,600
Let's get started.

68
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,880
So first let's assume that we want to perform kind of you know basic addition.

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,790
Actually Python is very intuitive it's actually very easy and simple to use.

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,220
So what we could do if you wanted to add any two numbers you can simply go and just straight into a

71
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,060
numbers and add them.

72
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,110
Let's give it a shot.

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,010
So it's a tumour.

74
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,720
And I wanted to add let's say five plus 10 stores in say five plus 10.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,100
All right.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,070
It's like you know writing in a calculator.

77
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,330
And if I wanted to run that self way you could do they can press shift and enter shift and enter mainly

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,440
goes here and run this cell.

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,720
That means it actually execute the cell and generates an opiate for you.

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,790
So if you press shift to enter you will see that the python is at a play.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,890
Back to you kind of telling you okay so five plus 10 that's actually is it means 50.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,580
All right.

83
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,430
OK.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,110
It's pretty pretty simple.

85
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,090
If you wanted to subtract to number of say again you can perform subtraction.

86
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,830
So let's say if it's four text five minus 10 or right and you'll run a shift and try again that would

87
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,000
give me minus minus five.

88
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,090
When I perform multiplication.

89
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,860
Then you can say five times 10 again I'm going to stick with these two numbers per say and shift and

90
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,530
turn and they'll give me 50.

91
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,960
I said again would apply back with the answer right away.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,680
Again it's like a calculator in a very simple form.

93
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,550
If I wanted to do division again you can divide 5 and then back like kind of a slash and then you press

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,310
10 you're on it.

95
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,290
That would give me point five which is you know kind of the end of it if I want to greater a new sensitive

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,110
and I press a.

97
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,660
That would create new sense for us.

98
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,770
If I wanted to heal I'm just trying you know these different kind of operations.

99
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,370
Okay I'll try to summarize all the operations here for you.

100
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,980
So here again if you want to do addition in oil cover addition subtraction multiplication division.

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,170
What do you think one is for example to cover let's say like floor division.

102
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,710
All right.

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,380
So let's give it a shot.

104
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,580
Of division.

105
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,460
Case and divide.

106
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,480
For example let's say 10 divided by five.

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,480
Okay.

108
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,750
That would give me two.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,760
But if I do float a division which is divide the kind of two backslashes and around it that would give

110
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,810
me two as well.

111
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,080
All right.

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,510
So here you don't see the difference.

113
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,710
However if a change in the market it 11.

114
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,190
All right.

115
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,020
And if I just make it one division only if I had on it that would give me two point two.

116
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,750
Right.

117
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,800
Which means you know like a give me the actual selection and he inflection fetch in value.

118
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,940
However if I do the double division here or double double.

119
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,360
However if I wanted to do the 11 kind of you know like floor division as you can see here if you do

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,780
double double the max Max less five and around it that will give me two which means it's just giving

121
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,050
me the cushion value it's not giving me the actual remainder as well.

122
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,630
All.

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,700
This is just newbert all idea of using it when I'm going to be using it much.

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,520
But what we're going to be using extensively is what we call it mod or module or here which is a mod

125
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,730
be alright which is a percentage.

126
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,750
This is very important.

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,380
Right.

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,700
So let's assume that in one or two let's say divide again 11 divided by 5 or around that would give

129
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,390
me two point two.

130
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:54,640
However if I do 11 module Loaches percentage sign 5 if I run it that will give me the actual remainder

131
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:01,450
value which is simply if you divide 11 by 5 that will give me two right.

132
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,270
And there is a remainder of 1.

133
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,070
That's kind of the demesne out of it or out of the actual division operation.

134
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,540
Okay so the remainder here is important because that will help me in the future to identify if that

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,240
number is even or if that number is odd.

136
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,120
So for example so number 11 we know that the number is odd right.

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,700
So if I divide number 11 okay by let's say two for example and ranit.

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,450
All right that would give me five.

139
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,000
As the caution however it will give me one as it may mean that.

140
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,360
All right so if you want to do any test tips to see if that number is even or odd I can simply divide

141
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,130
by two and get the remainder.

142
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,760
If there is a remainder in this case that means that number is over.

143
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,710
If there is no remainder of the remainder is zero that mean that that number is even.

144
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,400
Which is pretty critical.

145
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,590
So let's give it a shot.

146
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,410
Let's assume that we have for example Number 10.

147
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,180
If I divide and divided by two getting that to mean that if I run it I know that 10 is divisible by

148
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,250
2 which means 10 divided by 2.

149
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,090
That would give me five with zero remainder.

150
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,770
Then I can tell this number is actually even right.

151
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,240
Let's give another example.

152
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,090
Divide 15 by 2 and take the remainder if I run it you merely mean that one which means that that number

153
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,860
is odd.

154
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,210
Then by doing that operation I can tell if that number is even or odd.

155
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,270
Which is pretty cool.

156
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,360
Or the next operation I want to do I need to take let's say any variable and we can actually add like

157
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,490
a minus sign to it.

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,050
You know kind of negation or don't want to do negative for Lent so I can do negative let's say 10 and

159
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,940
run it to those in the UK that there is no negative then OK it's pretty pretty simple.

160
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,500
What if I wanted to get the absolute value.

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,100
Actually that's again pretty straightforward.

162
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,490
I can do absolute All right.

163
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,660
Okay so if I take for example any number absolute and if I open brackets and I'm right here for example

164
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,800
and minus let's say 50 and you focus on it.

165
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,460
Oh OK.

166
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,990
The VA actually absolute of a minus the value is actually 50 as well.

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,820
OK.

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,710
As you can see here the absolute of minus 5 minus 50 is just returning the positive value out of it.

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,440
What if I wanted to do the exponent.

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,680
What if I wanted to take let's say a and give the exponent of it so I can do this.

171
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,830
Let's say I wanted to perform for example five or eight and a do I want to give the exponents do multiply

172
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,590
multiply again two.

173
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,320
If I run it that would tell me it's mean kind of 5 square and that will return 25 right.

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,140
OK what if I wanted to attain.

175
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,400
Let's say the square root.

176
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,590
Right so if I have an n like number and I want to talk in the Squidward of that number right.

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,660
In order to do that you have to import what you call it amodio.

178
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,410
OK I will get a copy of the modules in the future.

179
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,340
But in order to import that kind of you know in Python in general we have different modules.

180
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,920
If we wanted to let's say import for example.

181
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,170
Like trying to print some for example graphs.

182
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,510
There is no specific modules are meant only for printing.

183
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,230
If I wanted to do maths operations there are some modules mainly used for importing operations so here

184
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,130
because we're going to do mass operations we're going to we're going to do going to say okay import

185
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,320
right and list maths and that we're going to import kind of the you know the module form to perform

186
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,090
any mathematical operation.

187
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,130
And what we're going to do here.

188
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm going to say okay I need maths.

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,810
All right.

190
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,490
Dot.

191
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,920
Square root.

192
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,470
All right.

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,410
And then open bracket and then going to say let's say the number that they wanted to get the square

194
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,380
root for it.

195
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,550
So square root of 25 if and that educate.

196
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,740
Well that ends this fight.

197
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,480
Which makes sense.

198
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,090
I know that.

199
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,450
So I wanted let's say to get square root of 16 for go here make it 16.

200
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,550
Run it they'll give me four or eight.

201
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,380
That means they got the square root of that number which is again to do that.

202
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,040
You can go and just do maths.

203
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,610
That's square throw it away.

204
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,120
You have to actually import again the the maths and then I'm going to be covering tons of modules again

205
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,980
in the future.

206
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,810
That's pretty much all what I wanted to cover in this lecture.

207
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,810
So in this lecture kind of an introduction lecture.

208
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,560
Now we know how to perform addition will perform subtraction multiplication division to the floor and

209
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,140
get the module module or when we know how can we how can we use mode to get you know to indicate that

210
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,510
number is even or odd.

211
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,230
We know as well how to do negation was just to get negative value of any number.

212
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,540
How to get an absolute value as well of any number.

213
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,150
So if you have a negative number if you do absolute of that negative number that will generate no return

214
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,950
back a positive number.

215
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,930
Now we know how to get now to the power of which is five for example to the power of two.

216
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,090
That would give me the square value of five which is 25.

217
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,970
If I wanted to attain the square root I can as well do it.

218
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,620
But I have to import the maths module and then perform maths.

219
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,420
That's where we do it and then pass along the number that will generate back our square to value.

220
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,970
Right.

221
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,350
And that's pretty much what we have for this lectures.

222
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,520
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next election.
