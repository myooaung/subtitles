00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.330
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.820
We're going to continue solving the exercises for the searchings.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.620
So the question that I have here is I wanted to expand on the previous code to print hello first name

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.720
and then last name.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.380
So simply put just a quick refresher for you guys.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
We have done here is that we ask the users to input e-mail.

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.090
We split the e-mail on the at sukarno April we were able to open the user name and then afterwards I

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.220
wanted to again kind of split it up in the first name and last name.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.620
OK.

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.970
Assuming that the email has the first name or last thing and they're going to say okay print to the

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.180
user hello first name and then last name afterwards.

12
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.840
OK.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.160
Actually going to be taking kind of you know like tons of the same code.

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.110
Pretty much what I do here.

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.870
So using an input and puts training.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.950
I'm going to go and split it as we've done before we come up with alpert's String.

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.000
The question is let's take a look at the posting first and say okay that entering all acting as they've

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.440
paid much for their Ponette Steve you know I'm sorry Mitch.

19
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.660
Steve at g mail dot com for that then I'll come up with a pretty thing if I wanted to view it.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.500
If I run it then it would come up with Mitch.

21
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.310
Steve and Jemmy.

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.970
I don't care about that story.

23
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.930
What we care about is they wanted to print first name and last thing.

24
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.490
So simply I need to take this right and actually kind of split it again in a way and wanted to split

25
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.150
it but not on the at this time it's actually on the dot this time how can we do that first.

26
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.390
How can we access the first element actually can access it using again out and Discordia thing.

27
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.990
Right.

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.700
If I had said zero and I run it that will just return the first element only.

29
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.210
Again this is a list and then wanted to access only the first element you're again using the index as

30
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.860
you know.

31
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.740
What if I wanted to apply a method on this.

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.260
Actually you can still do it.

33
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.930
You can apply the method directly.

34
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.940
Can say okay dot splits.

35
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.840
Right.

36
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.970
But you're going to be splitting on the dot because they wanted to actually split it here to come up

37
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.990
with a first name and last name separately.

38
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.490
And let's put that in a different stringless but it helped string and it's called a two for instance.

39
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.720
All right looks good to me.

40
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.670
Thrun it looks great.

41
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.330
Let's take a look at our pricing to on it you come up with Mitch and then Steve.

42
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.720
Perfect.

43
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.950
That's exactly what I was looking for.

44
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.870
What I wanted to do right now I wanted to print Hello.

45
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.670
And then right first name and then last name.

46
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.310
Let's do it and stick a print or in parentheses and let's say hello.

47
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.330
And I wanted to list the first name and then list the last any open queally brackets hello first name

48
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.540
and then get to space.

49
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.150
I'm going to say last thing.

50
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.090
And then I'm going to do with a format method called format.

51
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.410
And then you need to list the first name alasania how can we do that.

52
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.590
Again this is a list right.

53
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.570
So what we could do with it when axe's again the list using its index list of zero and list of one.

54
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.720
Let's do that.

55
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.730
So get out of this quarter string underscores to what we need of zero which gave me the first one comma.

56
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.260
I'm going to say key out underscore this string underscored two but then we're going to print one key

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.080
which is indicating Steve.

58
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.690
All right looks good to me.

59
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.410
Let's run it and that's it.

60
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.990
Hello.

61
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.560
Steve.

62
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.530
Perfect.

63
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.900
Now we actually have a functioning code that you could use for example let's say to go ahead and look

64
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.850
at employees for example and emails and extend their first name a lessening.

65
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.100
That's actually comes pretty handy.

66
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.010
We're going to make use of it more than 40 world.

67
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.170
And some of the practical exercises in the future.

68
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.960
All right.

69
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.640
Let's take a look at example 7.

70
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.730
So I want you to add a code request the first and last name and the age and then print hello first name

71
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.400
last name.

72
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.960
That's actually pretty straightforward listicle look.

73
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.780
So let's again define first.

74
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.880
For example I'm going to call it you know ongoing input user input and then I'm going to ask the user

75
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.110
to enter your first name.

76
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:22.780
That's easy and they can ask last minute input again and then ask the user to enter your last name right

77
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.640
and maybe add make it a little bit like you know what kind of readable or easy.

78
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.260
And then when I get to you've been asking for the age and again say input again I'm going to him okay

79
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.360
enter enters your age.

80
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.890
Looks great to me.

81
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.500
And then what I'm going to do you're going to say okay print.

82
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.710
All right.

83
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.370
It's pretty easy and say OK.

84
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.380
Hello.

85
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.300
All right.

86
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.640
And then curly brackets All right.

87
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.830
And then I'm going to say okay you are whatever it is all right.

88
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.070
We've done that before.

89
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.930
And then what I wanted to do here.

90
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.180
That's kind of the new thing.

91
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.690
Okay.

92
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.490
Why for example give him the kind of a note you know like motivation you know like age is just a number.

93
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.500
Okay.

94
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.270
You are younger than ever.

95
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.850
OK.

96
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.810
It's something you know like like fun like that.

97
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.650
And then what you could do you're going to use for method method format and pass along them basically

98
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.190
in order first.

99
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.180
Sorry first.

100
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.750
And then last.

101
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.760
And then H.

102
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.240
All right.

103
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.250
Looks good to me.

104
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.530
Right.

105
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.150
And let's sit on it.

106
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.390
When we're done it two minutes okay.

107
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.190
THREE last name let's call for example Ryan let's call it whatever you know or like Steve and then into

108
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.550
it aid fiscal 23 and they say hello Ryan you are Steve years old.

109
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.770
OK.

110
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.860
Something is wrong here.

111
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.570
We have done something wrong here.

112
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.130
And then you know age is just the number actually if you go here.

113
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.360
You would say like you would find that you know like we didn't simply wanted to print first and last

114
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.610
name.

115
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.180
Well guess what.

116
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.270
Then he got that something wrong one or two.

117
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.940
We only have two brackets and he actually listed three rates.

118
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.750
Something is wrong so I could do.

119
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.200
I would need to see okay first and then let's add space in here.

120
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.730
Okay.

121
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.110
So I'm going to say okay F to like this.

122
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.600
All right.

123
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.470
And then we'll get into our our kind of artificial space.

124
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.940
So which means that first and then space.

125
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.530
And then last they'll get to be that first and last name and then get the list the age afterwards gillett's

126
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.450
about it again.

127
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:40.820
Are they going to say Okay Ryan Young in college Steve age is 23 and then I say Okay hello Ryan Steve

128
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.710
you are 23 years old age us to somebody who are younger than ever it looks great to me.

129
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.260
OK that's actually pretty simple pretty straightforward.

130
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.850
It's actually delete these cells D to delete.

131
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.080
Question number eight I'm asking you to repeat the previous exercise.

132
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.840
But print the name and age in a new line.

133
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.180
And that's actually very important.

134
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.360
Again I want to do you with the question was I didn't cover the backslash.

135
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.850
Okay which is kind of a very famous thing that we do in general programming in general.

136
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.250
If we wanted to print a new line it's actually a copy of executive stuff here.

137
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.390
Simply put what I'm asking you to do is they want it to print.

138
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.240
Why are you.

139
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.950
Age is just a number in a new line.

140
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.550
That's the important objective.

141
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.620
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

142
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.090
How can we do this.

143
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.750
Okay we can do this easily by inserting what we call a backslash n or a in the actual string which is

144
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.140
pretty.

145
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.590
Very interesting actually.

146
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.220
You can come here if you wanted to print let's say this in your line.

147
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:48.170
You can actually do it by coming here and inserting becs flesh just the backslash.

148
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.270
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.190
What you what you could do again you can come here.

150
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.100
You can consider backslash an hour and that's it.

151
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.860
That will simply create whatever comes after.

152
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.330
And we're going to be formatted or put in a new line.

153
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.730
That's it.

154
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.810
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

155
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.840
Let's run it again.

156
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.190
OK.

157
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.410
Ryan Steve 23 if you're on it you'll find that actually peering into Hello.

158
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.140
And Steve you're 23 years old and whatever came here is actually came in a new line you know instead

159
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.430
of.

160
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.120
He said that we have it it's actually the exact same line here you had inserted in in your life which

161
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.620
is perfect which is great what you could do as well.

162
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.140
You can add let's say you know each one separately could add you.

163
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.540
Hello.

164
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.300
Hi Steve.

165
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.960
Okay.

166
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.960
That's a ad here.

167
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.330
Backslash in and then which means whatever is going to come here in your line and then want to come

168
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.530
here any line to go.

169
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:46.380
So if you're again insecure Ryan Steve 23 think can come up with Laura and Steve and then you are 23

170
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:52.750
years old and then each one in a new line because you added separate backslash from like actually because

171
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.260
here you have kind of there's a space here.

172
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.150
If you actually move this space All right that looks good.

173
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.480
You can actually come you know move that space to go around it's secure.

174
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.100
Ryan Steve 23.

175
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.750
You've come up with actually more.

176
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.170
Hello.

177
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.640
And Steve you are 23 years old.

178
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.340
And then you know we are you age is younger than ever.

179
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.970
All right.

180
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.920
OK.

181
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.020
Perfect.

182
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.460
Let's take a look at the next example I wanted to try to call that because they use email and count

183
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.660
the number of users characters.

184
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.620
Like.

185
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.760
So I'm going to do here and say okay input underscored a string and then ask the user to input.

186
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.910
And I'm going to ask him to empty your email.

187
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.830
The email address.

188
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.980
So that will be the first one and I'm going to do here.

189
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:43.420
I'm going to.

190
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.490
I want to again wants the user input the e-mail to split it.

191
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.010
So can I say Okay out.

192
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.790
I'm just caught.

193
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.510
String equals two input underscored a string.

194
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.660
And then use a split method and they wanted to split on the act.

195
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.490
That will give me the split here.

196
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.950
Perfect.

197
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.780
So again if you as a member if you actually run that.

198
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:15.200
Now tell me okay let's see Orion got Steve G mail dot com where I've done that before and if I want

199
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.290
to create new cells if I wanted to view what what's happening in out drawing for an I'm that has come

200
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.910
up with Steve ajmer Look come on the net before I'm asking you to do that I wanted to simply count the

201
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.890
number of user characters just the user names year on and count them.

202
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.890
How can we do that.

203
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.590
An asher wanted to print them on a screen as well.

204
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.880
Let's do it in a circuit print.

205
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:44.540
Anyone to let's say say okay there are a number of elements that are to whatever elements characters

206
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.580
get in your youzhny.

207
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.610
And here I wanted to use the dot former dot format.

208
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.710
Oh my.

209
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.280
Whoops.

210
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.180
I see.

211
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Dot formats and then create again.

212
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.160
Here is what I wanted to do.

213
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.850
They wanted to print out how many elements in there actually can add to print common elements we are

214
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.780
going to use the lenth mini function to do this instead it scanning the length.

215
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.070
OK and I would pass along here.

216
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.480
How many.

217
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.550
Basically the variable that it wanted to count one to Canada in pirate outsetting I just want to count

218
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.040
the first element within our list.

219
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.640
To do that I'm going to say okay out I'm just sitting I'm just going to access the first element of

220
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.330
zero which is simply this tournament.

221
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:40.870
So simply here again you're going to just three turn how many elements are varied within the string.

222
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.940
Okay so let's set that one good on it.

223
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.600
Look me OK.

224
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.390
Hello.

225
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.690
Actually there are 10 characters in use in it which is perfect.

226
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.910
Now I have you know Ryan has four names for characters.

227
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.180
This is the fifth one.

228
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.520
And then Steve has five.

229
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.040
That means 10 looks great.

230
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:03.760
What if I wanted to carry a g mail dot com which is supposedly like 1 2 3 4 5 right.

231
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.020
G.m. Right.

232
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.070
And then there's dot which is 6 and then 7 8 9.

233
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.810
So I've been there 9 9 in character so do I change this and make it one.

234
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.680
They.

235
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.920
Tony Well there are indicated in youzhny.

236
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.160
Looks great.

237
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.790
That's exactly what we expected.

238
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.800
Perfect.

239
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.210
The last example that we have.

240
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:29.000
They want you to local That expect the world hello from Hello world.

241
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.500
So if I give you my string.

242
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.530
OK.

243
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.990
And if I find my string to let's say hello world.

244
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.310
And I wanted to exact the word hello.

245
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.950
Using two different ways of two different picnic's.

246
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.260
Okay.

247
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.380
Let's take a look at the first one we actually cover the hundreds of times you get used the split method

248
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.340
to actually perform the vision.

249
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:49.700
Okay.

250
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.170
Okay.

251
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:58.810
Out on the Discordia string I'm going to call it a K equal to my string K Dot splits.

252
00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.580
Right.

253
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.120
And I want it to split.

254
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.960
Simply that sets a bit on the space right.

255
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.410
And they were just going Ed simply my outstanding.

256
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.620
And what I wanted to do there one was simply here print my out string as well.

257
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.750
But I want it to print simply the first element only.

258
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.210
Okay because I wanted to print only the words how long.

259
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.580
Right.

260
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:19.960
Right.

261
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.980
And that that would just turn and look perfect.

262
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.030
What about the other way.

263
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.270
How can I do with this.

264
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.480
Actually it's much simpler going to see a print.

265
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.350
Right.

266
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:34.390
And when I'm going to do I'm going to do what we call it slicing right which is again we're going to

267
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.750
cover it extensively when we go through a list in the future.

268
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.200
But what I could do.

269
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:47.300
They can actually go to my it's basically sitting here and kind of want slicing slice couple of characters.

270
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:47.880
Okay.

271
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.810
By using.

272
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.340
Okay which.

273
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.470
Where should they slice.

274
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.310
I need to specify two numbers.

275
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.430
The first number.

276
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.040
Okay.

277
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.190
With a beginning end the end.

278
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.540
Right.

279
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.130
That's what I wanted to specify.

280
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.210
So again what keep doing it and do again my Easting and you open square brackets and then I'm going

281
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:10.120
to specify what the first element to the first element has an index of zero and then in a to column

282
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.740
I am going to say okay I need now to write here.

283
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.730
This is my first element of com 0.

284
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.680
This is 1 which is e.

285
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.840
This is true.

286
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.110
This is 3.

287
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.790
This is four right.

288
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.370
So let's write for and see are we going to get here if I do this.

289
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.670
You would come up with help.

290
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.810
You know you basically you skip the O.

291
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:38.740
Which means that Python simply doesn't take the and the last element into account so which means that

292
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.650
it goes from 0 up to 4 and not including.

293
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.360
Okay this is a very important.

294
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.500
It's a little bit confusing but you will get used to it which means you just need to increase it by

295
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.870
a number from 0 to 5 which means any H 0 E which is 1 L..

296
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.630
Which is to the next.

297
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.840
L is 3 0 is 4 and fifth.

298
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.640
I don't need it.

299
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.940
I just got to 855 and here.

300
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.850
Spicing.

301
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.680
We're just going to go to the number 5 and excluding the number if not including so we're just going

302
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.300
to go from zero to 4.

303
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:19.830
There's the overall idea if you run it and come up with hello and that's pretty much what we are expecting.

304
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.930
Again if you go anywhere do some research on this string slicing you can go here to learn.

305
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.520
Learn a lot here and that's it.

306
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.310
That's pretty much all what I have for this section.

307
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.280
I hope you guys enjoy the seating section.

308
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.510
Now you know how things work.

309
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.280
Keep it up you guys are building up your knowledge you're doing great and we're going to keep going

310
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.880
into a new topic next lecture.

311
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.000
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

312
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.160
See you in the next.
