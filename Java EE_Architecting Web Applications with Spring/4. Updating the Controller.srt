1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,210
[Autogenerated] we saw previously in the web to we had a controller.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,740
Our article controller and a controller used the repository.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:09,870
What?

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,800
We no longer want to use this repository.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,540
Instead, what we want to use is our jacket article, services.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,630
So let's rename this from repository to service on

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,640
rename the Associative variables as well.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,340
So instead of our article repository, we don't use our jacket article services.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,840
We also need to inject that,

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,320
so that will be here on now we have access to the

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,200
service rather than the repository.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,360
Now we also need to update the methods this was calling Final a.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,170
Now we need to call get or articles on the service instead.

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,960
And that returns a list of get jacket article rather than a list of entities.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,130
So here we have our get all articles and get all articles,

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,050
returns, a list of jacket article.

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,140
So let's use of are here to make this slightly easier.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,740
Then after that, then the code the same.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,320
So the services articles also has a title.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,430
So we get the title out of these service articles we can then pass

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,340
the articles back to the page for the page to use.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,140
So in the control we've updated.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,140
We're trying to inject this service,

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,920
but we need to tell spring that this services injectable in

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,640
the same way that we can inject repository.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,790
So back in my service code, I need to add an annotation to this.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,830
I need to say at service on in the same way that we add at

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,600
Repository to tell spring that as well as being named this

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,850
thing was a repository on my service.

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,310
We add at services on it says this thing as well as being named is a service.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,540
And again, this is a Met annotation.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,740
Once we have that, I should be able to run the project.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,100
If I flip across the Chrome and go to local host 80 81 then sure enough,

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,840
we're getting data again.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,940
So again, everything is happy.

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:01,000
But now we're going through a service rather than going through the repository directly
