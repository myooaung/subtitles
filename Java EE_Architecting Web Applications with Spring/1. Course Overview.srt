[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,480
My name is Kevin Jones.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,920
Welcome to my cause.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,600
Architect ING web Applications With Spring I am a

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,960
developer and owner at Rock Solid Knowledge,

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,950
a software development company based in the United Kingdom.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,480
There are many ways to structure an application this course

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,740
concentrate on something I call horizontal design.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,230
With this, rather than break a project down into its layers,

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,840
such as database and services, we break the projects down into components.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Which component project contains all that component needs?

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,260
Some of the major topics we will cover include breaking a

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,540
spring application down into components.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,260
Using spring repositories to access database is securing

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,840
the application with spring security,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,110
separating concerns with met annotations and using

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,440
migrations to manage your database.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,860
By the end of this course,

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,540
you understand the benefits of designing application around

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,240
components before beginning the course.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,150
You should be familiar with Java,

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,740
and some familiarity with spring would also be helpful.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,460
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to design

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:30,000
spring applications with the architect ING web applications with spring course at Pluralsight
