00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,390
[Autogenerated] So one of the things I mentioned at the start of this

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,140
cause was about going through some of my four processes.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,620
For example, here we're using a repository.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,240
We have a jacket repository project.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,230
But if I look in this repository, we have no repository classes.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,460
What we have instead now are just models.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,870
These are just the entities for our project.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,650
That's what I should do is to rename this from

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,140
jacket repository to jacket entities.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,240
So even though we're inside idea here, this is all based on a great URL file.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,250
So what I'll do is the renaming through the great

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,530
URL file on the file system on, then reimport the project.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,900
So, in the root project, if I open up my settings,

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,840
Doc Raedle, it says, jacket repository.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm going to change this to jacket entities on then in the bill grade.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,990
URL far for this Everywhere I have a jacket repository.

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,660
I'm going to change that to jacket entities.

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,410
So we have a dependency here.

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,000
We have a reference here.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,220
I'll add a base project entry as well for this.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,440
So having done that and also rename this from jacket

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,500
repository to jacket entities on the file system.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,170
So here in the project folder,

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,740
we have a jacket repository folder and I'll rename that to jacket entities.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,300
And if I do that on,

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,380
go back into idea we can See already ideas found

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,990
that the far system has changed,

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,040
but it doesn't yet know the jacket entities is a

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,740
project because we haven't reimported it.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,510
So I got a grade.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,740
All do a refresh.

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,780
And sure enough, it now knows that jacket entities where it should be.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,090
If I run this, sure enough is built on run.

34
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,440
Okay?

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,540
And if I go back into Chrome and a refresh, then the date is there a swell?

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,630
So this seems sensible.

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,040
It seems more realistic here Oven entities project

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,440
rather than a repositories project.

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:02,000
When you're building software, naming is really important. So having these names correct seems to be the right thing to do.
