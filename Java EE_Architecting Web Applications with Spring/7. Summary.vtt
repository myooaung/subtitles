00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.010
[Autogenerated] so we've seen the component on.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.370
We see that with the component.

3
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.220
We are both the data access code on the service code

4
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.190
into the component we've now added.

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.840
The component is now part of the project.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.460
However, there's still one thing missing from this component.

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.240
What about tests?

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.370
So in the next module,

9
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.800
we'll see how we can add unit tests on integration

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.900
tests into this component and a,

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.000
then end up with a complete component that we can take and move anywhere along with its tests.
