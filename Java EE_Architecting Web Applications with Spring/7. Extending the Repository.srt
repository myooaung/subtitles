00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,020
[Autogenerated] We can also extend these repositories so we can

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,640
do that by adding our own methods to them.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,640
So, for example, here we can have a fine by title method.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,880
On this was January code to do a search in the articles table

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
for any article with this specific title.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,340
We got to see how to do that now.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,330
So back inside the code inside the articles repository I cannot.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,240
Another method here without a fine by title method,

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,700
so find by title will return a list of article this will take.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,460
A string on that string will be the title off the article.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,250
Be trying to find what will happen when I add this and we compile.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,920
The code is that spring, when it generates the proxy will generate this method.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,910
For me, it knows there's a title property,

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,090
you know, a database,

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,540
and it will generally code to find things in the database based on that title.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,330
So let's see if we can use this So in the article controller,

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,020
rather than doing a final here, let's do a fine by title on passing news on.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:11,140
Then, if I rerun this code, then go back to the browser and a refresh.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,930
Then we only get the one entry is this is working on its

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,640
returning the correct values from the database.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
So what if we try and add something that doesn't exist?

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,840
So if I go back to my repository, duplicate this line rather than find by title,

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
that's are fine by person.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,750
Now there's no person property in my database on If I rerun this so notice,

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,700
I don't even need to use this on spring blows up.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,580
If I look in the console window here when we get an error,

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,130
which is this unsatisfied dependency exception,

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,700
we can't create the being article controller.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,900
The reason we can't create the article control of being is

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,540
that we can't create articles repository.

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,880
So even though idea doesn't detect, this is invalid.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,330
This blows up a runtime even before we even try and use the method.

33
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,620
So spring is very powerful in the way that it can detect these methods

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,000
forests and generally code based on the method names. So long as those properties exist
