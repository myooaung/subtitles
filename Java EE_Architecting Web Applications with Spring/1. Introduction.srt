[Autogenerated] Hi, My name is Kevin Jones,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,150
and this is the securing the application with Spring

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Security chapter from the architect ING web application

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,340
with spring class from Pluralsight.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,590
So, up until now,

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,200
we've built the application using a mixture of

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,640
horizontal design on vertical design.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,770
We've added repositories.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,030
We've added services.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,440
We've added tests.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,730
Now what we're going to do is take a look at how it is.

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,940
We have security to the application.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,220
We want to add both authentication and a

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,740
authorization support to the application.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,540
We'll talk about how they differ in a moment.

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,640
We're going to use spring security to do this, so authentication is who are you?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,530
But I logged onto an application to give it some credentials,

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,640
such as a username on password.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
And given these credentials, these application will know who I am,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
and it may assign some roles to me.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,860
Based on who I am on may be based on those roles.

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,540
The application will then decide what I'm authorized to do.

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,220
So authentication is working out who this user is.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,240
Authorization is allowing the user to do certain things based on that identity.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Spring security is a set of libraries that come with spring.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,840
They allow us to easily and security into an application.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,790
It's a nice library.

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:28,000
It's very extensible and very easy to use. I will use that library in this module.
