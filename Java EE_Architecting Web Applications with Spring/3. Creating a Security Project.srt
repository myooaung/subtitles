00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,840
[Autogenerated] So I'm going to add a new sub project to this project.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,200
This is going to be jacking security.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,940
Obviously, this project is where will rely on our security.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,240
So I'll do this in a similar way,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,040
the way we added jacket articles earlier in this course.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,140
So in my settings,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,870
great URL file here will include a new project called Jacket Security and then

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,610
in the build greater file for this project will create a new project entry for

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,140
jacket security and then set up the dependencies.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,740
So my jacket security project will depend on jacket entities.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,100
Jacket articles will depend on jacket security on jacket.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,640
Web will depend on jacket security.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,890
I also need to update the integration tests,

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,940
so jackets security can also have integration tests if needed.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,840
So, on my far system, create a new directory called Jacket Security.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,870
And if I go back into idea and reimport the greater project build,

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,640
we see the Jackie security is now recognized on here as a project.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
So inside here, I need to add a build file.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,940
So I do a new file.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,220
We call this build Docker cradle and a Bill find Looks like this and a.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,970
It's the One difference here is that we have a compile time

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,040
dependency on spring Bootstrap charter security.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,240
So this gives us the basis of our security project.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,440
We also need to create the source directories here.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,040
So in my jacket security,

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,560
I quit a source directory with integration test main and test in.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,280
Each of these has a java and resource is subdirectory inside it and back inside.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,140
Intelligent idea.

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,540
If I reimport cradle, then these directories are now correctly recognized.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,290
So we've said the Jackie Security relies on Jack and entities.

31
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,710
And that's because inside Jack and entities is a Java class.

32
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,040
Come up onto the user's table.

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,540
We righted a class here called User.

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,940
This is the first name last name email in our password.

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,440
We've also added the relationship between our art class and a our users class.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,540
That's the one to many relationship.

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,700
And then in the art class, we've added the corresponding change.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,470
Added the minutes.

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,000
One relationship between article in user that a joint column to see how these things are joined together
