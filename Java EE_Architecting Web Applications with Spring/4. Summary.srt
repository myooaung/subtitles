1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,650
[Autogenerated] So this is great.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,970
The code actually works, Okay?

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,950
We don't know the code works, but it is tested.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,970
So we have tests.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,640
We have repeatability.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,340
So at the very least, we can go back we can run the tests again if we need to.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,860
If we refactor if we change things now,

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,700
at least we can prove that the code does what we expected to do.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,630
It might not be a 100% complete, but at least we have test written.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,840
At least we can prove it's doing what we think is the correct thing.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,220
So I'd like to add one last thing to this is part of

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:38,000
the application that security. So for this, we don't use spring security, that will be the next chapter.
