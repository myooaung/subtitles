[Autogenerated] so in summary,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,140
then we know that our application will consist of different layers.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,500
They could be physical layers.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,340
They could be logical layers on.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,190
Traditionally,

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,540
we've built an application functionally to follow the physical layout.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,000
What I'd like to do in this course is to show how we maybe should use the

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,340
logical layout on Build the application out of components.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,940
We know that functionality cats across layers,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,320
but ideally, we'd like to structure the application functionally.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,740
So build it off these components.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,740
I will see over the next four or five chapters how we do that.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,170
So we know the application letter user interface.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,150
We know we'll have some services on.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,540
We know we'll need to access data.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,050
One of the key things you ever think about when building these

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,440
applications is how we manage the database.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,450
Now it might be within your company.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,150
You have a full database team on a design the schemers and lay

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,370
out exactly what the schemer should look like,

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,540
and you can't touch the database.

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,390
But in many companies, large and small, that's not always the case.

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,940
We as developers, are also responsible for the database schemer,

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,040
so we'll see how we do that.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,180
It's also true that within the application will need to know how to

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,360
access that schemer how to access the database.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,740
So what?

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:25,000
APIs what mechanisms to be used to do that, and that's what we'll cover in the next chapter.
