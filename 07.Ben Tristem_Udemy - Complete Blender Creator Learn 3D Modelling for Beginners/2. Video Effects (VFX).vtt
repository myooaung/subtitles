00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.340
Welcome to video effects or often shortened to VFX.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.900
So what's coming up in this section.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.670
Well this is all about combining our computer generated imagery with real world environments.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.280
Or if you wanted to combining it with other CGI eyes.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.140
So this this can be your models that you've made it can be your particle systems can be anything.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.810
You've generated on the computer and combining it with in this case a still image so we're going to

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.260
start with a still image and place a model into it and make sure it looks relatively realistic.

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.040
Obviously that would depend on the quality of your model as well.

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.880
Now after we have mastered that we will go ahead and conquer video footage as well which has some other

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.730
nitty gritty things that we need to sort out.

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.010
Choosing your subject now you can follow along with me.

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.170
You can choose your own path or indeed do both.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
One of the best ways of learning is to also go off on a tangent and work on your own project as well

14
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110
either in parallel or just after you've taken the section.

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720
It's a great way to reinforce your knowledge.

16
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.150
Now remember to keep it simple.

17
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.070
This goes for both your model if you're going to make your own and the real space that it is going to

18
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.210
occupy.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.190
If we get started get too complex at this point in time it's going to cause you issues.

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.320
So remember to keep it simple ain't talkin about keeping it simple.

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170
It's time for a nice simple challenge for you.

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.300
So the challenge is to plan your scene.

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.750
We are going to put a 3D model into a photograph.

24
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.140
Now ideas for a scene.

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.950
The photograph itself perhaps an empty road or a runway or a desk a windowsill or any other work top

26
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620
or work surface.

27
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.840
Of course it would be great when were going to use a model so what model are you going to use.

28
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.900
Be great if they matched up with the scene doesn't have to be interesting if it didn't.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.540
As opposed.

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.880
But for an empty road you might put a car on their runway a plane a work top perhaps in a kitchen.

31
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.680
Well perhaps any kitchen utensil plates glasses nice simple models remember simplicity.

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.460
Now use existing models and scenes where possible this whole sections go in about bringing these two

33
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.540
things together rather than making them so.

34
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.200
One other thing you can.

35
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.310
One of the things you can do here is use somewhere like blend swaps do go in and check out w w w dot

36
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.430
blend swap dot com for your models.

37
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.840
If you're going to use them and remember to credit others for their hard work as well check out the

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.290
Creative Commons licence.

39
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.380
All the blend files on blend swap tend to have one of those.

40
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.860
Just make sure you credit others for their work.

41
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.620
So Paul's video now and give that a go.

42
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.720
Okay guys.

43
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.720
Welcome back.

44
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.850
Did you plan your scene.

45
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.700
How did it turn out.

46
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.740
I'm going to go through what I've planned for my scene now and then will crack on and get on with it.

47
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.620
So what do I want to do.

48
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.250
Well my scene is going to be a runway at sunset and the object I'm going to do a fighter jet because

49
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.770
that kind of call that's what I like and that's what I'm going to do.

50
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.020
Of course you guys can follow along with this or indeed go down your own route as well.

51
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.920
Please share with us.

52
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.210
Over on the forum what you guys are going to be up to what your plans are perhaps you've done some sketches

53
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.740
of the scene that you want to do.

54
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.170
Perhaps you got some awesome resources in there.

55
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.790
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys are going to create and I will see you guys in the

56
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.790
next lecture.
