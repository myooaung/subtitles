00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.920
Welcome to creating the base mesh.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.910
In this video well we're going to crack on and start modelling.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.740
I know you've been itching to do this.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.460
We've gone through a lot of preparation and now's the time to put it into practice.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.440
So remember you can add images as planes This allows you to see them all the time in the viewport.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.340
I personally am going to be adding images to the background and then it's only going to be available

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.410
when in orthographic view when viewed from the top or bottom left right front back etc..

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.870
And that also allows me to focus on the model and put the image in front and make it basically transparent

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.720
so I can see through a model.

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.130
Now create a base mesh to start with and save as when you reach a point where you can branch to make

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.360
different models.

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
Do remember to save as you go and do please remember to use reference material.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.930
So go ahead.

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.940
Pause video now expect this to take maybe 10 minutes or so maybe 20.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.050
So pause a video and I will see you guys back in a bit.

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.520
Okay guys.

17
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.460
Welcome back.

18
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.070
Let's go make a base smash the rim blender.

19
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.520
Okay so I'm gonna start with the default cube I'm going to scale it up just a little here.

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.020
And yeah I'm happy with.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.690
I'm gonna hop into edit mode.

22
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.430
Now I'm not going to hobbins adipose jets.

23
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.650
I'm being indecisive here.

24
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.830
I'm going to go down the route of a subdivision just looking at my notes that have got to the side here.

25
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.690
And of course once I've applied that what I can do is hop into edit mode go round to the front or for

26
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.360
graphic turn or a D selects everything turn wireframe on highlight half of the model and delete the

27
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.540
verses.

28
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.230
I'm going to go back in here and add in a mirror modify and turn on clipping so I can't go over the

29
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.680
middle part.

30
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.840
I'm not going to apply the mirror modifier though that's just going to sit there for the moment.

31
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.400
So that's the basic shape sorted out.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.710
The next thing I'm going to do here is each drood outs the necklace cells and circle extrude that down

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.760
and let's can I have a couple of loop cuts in it.

34
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.910
I am pretty sure Glueck should it all the way down to here and then.

35
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.280
Or how many.

36
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.270
Maybe for around there but that looks pretty good.

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.460
K And of course down here if we're getting a rough shape I'm going to grab these two here.

38
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.820
Now I'm going to turn on proportional editing at this point in time.

39
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.010
So down here.

40
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.030
Turn that on.

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:41.050
Of course that's the o key is well turn on and off with a literally go round to the front and which

42
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.670
I've made in back to front.

43
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.920
Never mind I'm going to pull that out because a got proportional editing turned on it.

44
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.240
It pulls out the other bits as well and that's a relatively straightforward way of getting some detail.

45
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.170
What I'm not doing of course is using any reference images so let's slap my hands and add some naughty

46
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.720
naughty is not going to be too far off.

47
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.500
What I've got I hope it could be horribly horribly different.

48
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.230
So let's go ahead and open up see how incredibly easy it is to try on jumping crack on and then realize

49
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.540
that you haven't quite got what you wanted something to import.

50
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.260
The front and put it on the front.

51
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.670
MM or maybe the bat.

52
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.110
I'm not sure MM As popped on the front first but I'm pretty sure that I've made my model the wrong way

53
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.850
round an.

54
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.520
And then the those go down hill.

55
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.310
Add another image.

56
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.490
And then open.

57
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.510
Or not.

58
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.860
Bear here.

59
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.430
Must remember a stall in the side so let's just hop in to orthographic and set this to.

60
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.210
I dunno whether it's going to be left or right at this point.

61
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.670
So that looks good at the moment looking down there.

62
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.380
So moving to the front.

63
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.020
We get that purrfect solely to scale things up there but that's a good start looking from the side which

64
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.570
side door wants to work from.

65
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.320
Preferably the right actually so let's have a look at putting this on the right one now.

66
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.500
Good chance here I'll need to flip it horizontally so it fits.

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.330
Okay so that's looking good so far.

68
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.950
I'm going to go and select everything and just scale it up so it's in you know roughly in the right

69
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.600
place and I have to move it back slightly to fit in so that's that's a good start.

70
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.890
I'm going to move that round to the front and make the capacity just a little smaller as Haswell so

71
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.330
I can actually see my model.

72
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.860
That much more clearly right and round at the front as well.

73
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.100
So.

74
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.640
Well that's kind of good.

75
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.660
The way I pulled that up because that stretch the head and it's pretty much how I want it needs come

76
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.920
down a little lower here but we'll work on that in a moment so let's go round to the front image and

77
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.600
to minimize the right as I don't need it at the moment and put that in front.

78
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.850
A There I am staring at myself.

79
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.270
It's a bit freaky.

80
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.460
Okay so I'm going to start just moving some of these out and again this is only a rough guide at the

81
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.690
moment.

82
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.820
Pull that up just get the F face roughly right so that's going to be the bottom there that's going to

83
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.540
be roughly where the chin is so that's the bit I'm going to pull down it's a whiz.

84
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.560
Background to the front and pull that down.

85
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.030
I'm going to have to expand with the mouse wheel that so it got there now the neck is far far too thin

86
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.230
at the moment certainly for me are not that thin at all.

87
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.210
Let's move that out slightly.

88
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.460
That's starting to look better so that's Gramp this one down here was around to the front pool.

89
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.190
That's how that's looking better.

90
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.800
Going to pull that up but reduce its okay so we're almost there.

91
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.590
I think we need to pull this one out a bit further and pull this one up and that will be kind of a rough

92
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.710
shape starting to come together on a course.

93
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.670
You can spend a lot of time doing this and at the moment I'm not interested in spending a lot of time

94
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.750
doing this.

95
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:41.370
What I do want of course to make sure is that the model is not oddly shaped so I'm going to pull some

96
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.190
of these bits out just to round off the head a little.

97
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.680
Looks a bit odd from there so that's flic round to the side now and work on this.

98
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.740
So I think that's the middle Yes it is back around to the side.

99
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.460
You'll find yourself nipping backwards and forwards quite a bit some just rotating here to try and make

100
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.200
it a bit smoother as it goes round.

101
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.840
Pull that up a little more right where it goes in to the back of the neck.

102
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.880
Paul that's how it's now.

103
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:21.200
Again this is only a rough guide because obviously I need to build up detail later on rather than now

104
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.050
so.

105
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.650
That then let's pull this down to here.

106
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.060
Again I'm just using the reference material to make sure things end up in the right place.

107
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.330
A case of this needs to be pulled out much much more.

108
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.050
I'm not quite sure where my neck ends here.

109
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.620
And again I don't spend too much time at this stage basically faffing about with it because as you all

110
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.650
know you can end up spending hours and hours on modelling when that's not what you want to do.

111
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.730
Perhaps you want to spend some time with your family or just go out and enjoy the sun.

112
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.600
There we go.

113
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.580
So that's a that's a good rough shape going on that's a bit pointy round the front.

114
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.230
What we can do now of course is just check what loops we have at the moment.

115
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.370
So there is one going around the entire face.

116
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.170
Now that is good.

117
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.890
I'm probably going to add a couple more loops in now to help definition.

118
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.360
So where the eyes are.

119
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.450
This loop here is roughly in the right place.

120
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.500
What I can do here is put actually she just grab it.

121
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.040
Shift it up and make sure it sits in the right place.

122
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.310
We're going to need another loop songas going to grab that and push it in ever so slightly.

123
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.760
That's better.

124
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.460
So you going to need a couple of loops defining where some other bits and bobs are.

125
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:50.930
I'm gonna use such control in art have put in at the bottom of the nose for the moments and the top

126
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.210
of the brow.

127
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.720
That's the wrong way.

128
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.060
That's undo that's top of the brow here.

129
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.180
I can just get that in.

130
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.190
There we go.

131
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.930
So that's around there.

132
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.690
And of course remember you can go in these aren't be perfect first time round so you might have to go

133
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.270
in and modify these to make sure they fit.

134
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.020
We can see here that there would be quite nice to have a line go probably going through the centre of

135
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.040
the I.

136
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.120
So let's give that a go now.

137
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.170
There we go.

138
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.520
That's going to the centre of the eye not necessarily where we want it to be going round the entire

139
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.260
model.

140
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:39.450
So we just got to move things about kind of try and keep things going round features move the as possible

141
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.480
so on definitely want that bit in the middle.

142
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.400
Probably want this bit in slightly So we start to define the nose.

143
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.660
You could start to see shapes coming together.

144
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.350
Make sure that's the.

145
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.970
Make sure the proportional editing isn't.

146
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.810
Changing too much at any one time.

147
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.560
Or sometimes if you want to make a big big change is quite useful.

148
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.940
Having that now.

149
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.260
This bit here I feel should be brought down to next.

150
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.190
The front of the chin is literally where everything is going to go to.

151
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.550
So let's pull that down to about there.

152
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:25.400
And I'm probably going to have to not use Bridgeport just proportional editing probably grab a few extras

153
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:32.860
here and move them all down at the same time they're going around the face and nicely there s that change

154
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.440
the front.

155
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:40.370
So no it's quite a sharp edge there or smooth that out in the bits or even now start pulling things

156
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.500
back ever so slight to help define as we go.

157
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:52.130
And again we can refine this again and again and again as we go so obviously as this as you worked for

158
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.710
it from one angle you move things about.

159
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.070
You may have to come back to another and work it out from there.

160
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:04.130
Of course what it could do as well is have more than one view open once and hop between them.

161
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:11.510
I've not got too much luxury on screen space so I am not going to do that at the moment but that is

162
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.960
starting to come together quite nicely.

163
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.850
So we need a few extra loops.

164
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.440
We got a top and bottom of the nose rolling through the eye the brow in there I'm happy with that.

165
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.650
I want one around the bottom of the mouth as well.

166
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.230
As we can see here these things are lifting up as they go around the model.

167
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:39.910
Now that's not always desirable so I'm going to pull these back down ever so slightly.

168
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:46.120
It's just to help them go around the model in what feels like a more natural way.

169
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.100
There we go.

170
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.870
And the fact is.

171
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.490
Starting to look quite good now.

172
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.470
We can just go around the model check from the side and I am missing any features on the side.

173
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.310
I think probably the brown sticks out a little too far.

174
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.750
There we can look here.

175
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.540
Which one of these is the centre of the eye.

176
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.510
It's that one there so we can actually go well hang on a minute.

177
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.120
These pictures aren't perfectly aligned.

178
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.700
I just noticed that I thought they would be.

179
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.670
I do apologize suède the side one here and I'm going to let me just lift it up.

180
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.610
So that that's in the right place.

181
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.360
And then when we flip from here to here it is in the right place.

182
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.580
Now that's going to be the centre of the eye socket so I can actually pull that back to roughly there

183
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.430
and then we can work on a definition going around later and able to pull that one back ever so slightly.

184
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.930
I'm going to raise the capacity here.

185
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.580
I am having trouble seeing so we can see here.

186
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.560
I'm coming down foot for this particular reference model or me and coming down a bit too sleek steeply

187
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.140
there.

188
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.990
And probably about there would be good seat.

189
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.270
Again you move these things around and you get roughly not not perfect we're not shooting for perfection

190
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:10.130
at this point in time but so we get so roughly a right shape.

191
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:15.800
Now this is obviously all quads at the moment but we are starting to get some loops going around our

192
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.140
model we got a nice loop going around there to define the face itself that is important.

193
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:29.090
We'll be getting to the ear later on but it's worthwhile putting a loop cuts down there as well.

194
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:36.350
And then we've got the ear defined within a certain area and of course we can grab some of these other

195
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:43.240
ones and just move them ever so slightly to help define the contours of the head itself.

196
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.970
And again this is not the only way of doing this.

197
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.310
There are lots of different ways of doing this by like this sort of base mesh that's going on so I can

198
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:58.860
see what's actually going on underneath and start building up from a low poly upwards.

199
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.660
As you can see in about 10 minutes or so we've got a lovely base mesh.

200
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.940
Now there are a couple of other things I'm just going to do some can hop into object mode and I'm going

201
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.370
to turn on smooth shading to make it look a bit smoother.

202
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:18.770
And I'm also going to add a subdivision surface modifier on top of this so I can just get a feel of

203
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.640
how it's going.

204
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.420
Now you can see here it does look a bit pointy round.

205
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.270
Our round the actual front where it's mirroring.

206
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:32.270
So I do have to be conscious of that and it's worthwhile having a look at that now and working out if

207
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.460
that's going to cause us any issues.

208
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.120
Now of course at this point in time are a couple of ways we can solve that.

209
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.370
The first reason it's doing it is because the angle here is quite steep.

210
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:50.930
So we can see them make it not too steep but or I was going to say but that my interrupt whatevers here

211
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.080
in the first place.

212
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.020
Of course we can add in another edge loop and work to have our way.

213
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:03.320
So in this case I'm going to make sure it's turned on in edit mode which is so I can see if we grab

214
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.470
this here.

215
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.760
Basically we wanted to line up.

216
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.500
More or less with that for moments.

217
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.480
And that should help take off some of the pinching now around the nose.

218
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:27.600
We do want some pinching of course because well it's the nose is going to be more defined on the face

219
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.380
so that's starting to look a bit better around the brow I think it just needs to be wider in general

220
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.660
at the top point.

221
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.780
Here of course be careful what you do you can give yourself horns which is well depending on what you're

222
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.390
making if you're making a character that resembles the devil or something along those lines.

223
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.170
You very well might want horns on your model.

224
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.200
So go ahead have some fun grab something and put it up like that.

225
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.820
And there we go.

226
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.860
That's what I would look like if I were the devil.

227
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.650
OK.

228
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.240
Right back to modelling.

229
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:06.220
But do you seriously do have fun as you go it takes some of the annoyance or when you're moving vs.

230
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.580
round bit by bit trying to smooth out your model.

231
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:16.390
Sometimes having a bit of fun helps move things along and you never know you might actually end up creating

232
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:22.370
a character that you absolutely love but thought it was going nowhere initially.

233
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.880
Now I'm pretty sure it's a bit of a pointy chin for me as well.

234
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.750
But again that's something we can work on later.

235
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:38.970
And if it's just not wide enough as it goes around there so that should help move that out.

236
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.160
That is starting to look pretty good.

237
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.360
There's a bit pinching at the back but I'm happy with that as it is at the moment.

238
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:52.030
I'm going to push this bit in here zuki of the neck a bit more form and make that bigger as well of

239
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:57.640
course if you make this proportional editing really big you can do some strange things with your models.

240
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.120
So just take care with how that is okay.

241
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:11.450
I am going to get rid of this pinching at the back here iscan to try and just lift a few bits up.

242
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.900
To prevent that from happening.

243
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.080
Of course it depends whether I'm going to give myself hair I probably won't see what I look like.

244
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.800
Now there we go.

245
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.490
See what I look like with no hair.

246
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.580
I don't look great with no hair and look like some sort of fuck so I don't really want to make myself

247
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.190
with no hair.

248
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:35.300
Of course one of the other things here is if we're working on a model one of the things to remember

249
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.430
of course is subdivision shrinks thing so if I keep if we just lower this subdivision level you can

250
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:46.860
see as I increase its level the model shrinks as we go.

251
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.460
Now obviously that's got to stop at some point but it's worthwhile knowing when you start making features

252
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.910
when you turn up the subdivision's and it's worthwhile having this on so you can see what it looks like

253
00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.680
once you smooth things out a little.

254
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.390
Once you've got that on have it.

255
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.690
Are your features getting too small.

256
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.680
We'll find out more about that later.

257
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.630
So I'm happy with that as my base mesh some are going to go ahead and save as why I haven't saved it

258
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.560
at all yet so slapped my hand again for doing that.

259
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.060
So I want to make sure I'm in the right folder and I'm going to call this.

260
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.770
Mikey's head.

261
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.460
Why nots.

262
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.450
And I'm going to save ours.

263
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.220
And.

264
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.350
I'm actually going to save it and then save as a.

265
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:41.140
Or what shall I call it head base mesh or something along those lines.

266
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:47.170
So now I know Virts I can work on mikey's head saga and reopen that site and make sure I'm on the right

267
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:47.680
file.

268
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:54.310
I'm going to work on mikey's head and I'm going to keep the other one in case I do something horrendous

269
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.860
with this one it gives me a chance to go back to it.

270
00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.360
Or of course if I want to make some someone else it's a great start.

271
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.280
Obviously I need to move things around now you will have to of course balance the points up if you've

272
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.380
got a template for head.

273
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:14.320
But the person who you are doing is significantly different than the head you are working on.

274
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.840
You may have to start again anyway but it's worthwhile just weighing up.

275
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.130
If there's a significant difference.

276
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:26.890
Probably best to model it a fresh rather than try and alter lots of vertices as almost reet apologizing

277
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:32.320
about point which we got to kind of avoid wherever possible because of the time involved.

278
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.440
It's a necessary evil sometimes.

279
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.580
Anyway I am done with my base mash I'm quite happy with that.

280
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.140
How did you guys get on.

281
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.690
I've obviously modelled myself as you modelled me.

282
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.030
I'd love to see that.

283
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.560
Of course if you model yourself or a character you've created love to see that as well so remember to

284
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.170
share.

285
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.600
And of course I will see you guys in the next lecture.
