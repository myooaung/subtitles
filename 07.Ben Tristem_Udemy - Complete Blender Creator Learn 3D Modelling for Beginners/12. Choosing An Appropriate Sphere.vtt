00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.310
Hello everybody and welcome back in front of us here we have three spheres now I'm sure some of you

2
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.200
are scratching your head at this point go Mike you've lost that you've been playing with Blender too

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.860
long this is definitely a cube in the middle well we can also make that sphere and each one has different

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.580
merits and drawbacks when we use it let's go to find out more okay so we have our default cube in front

5
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.690
of us we know what that looks like I'm gonna press G Y and 3 just move it out of the way let's add in

6
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:43.330
we shift in a another mesh object and we should pick the U V sphere and then finally we shall add another

7
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.380
object the IKO sphere and then we're going to move that's on the y axis it's probably minus 3 so it's

8
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.760
out of the way.

9
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.900
So if we have a look at these three objects the first one on our left here is an Iko sphere so it's

10
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.410
made up all of triangles and you may have heard that triangles are bad and evil well they're not they're

11
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.530
very useful in certain circumstances and in others they can be a real hindrance so it's just their application

12
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.190
that we need to watch our U V sphere which is typical if you think of maps of the world has the drawback

13
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.370
of having this point in the middle so can also cause a few issues because if we zoom in really this

14
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.300
top here is a series of triangles but otherwise this is a pretty useful for a bold for a planet for

15
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.790
many things along those lines this sphere on the very end isn't a sphere I'm hearing you shout but it

16
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.240
is it this is a typical sphere that we call a quad sphere it's actually a sphere made of all of chords

17
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.570
it's just incredibly low poly at the moment it only has six sides and a sphere obviously has infinite

18
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.020
sides but these two here on the left the ICA sphere and the u v sphere they don't have an infinite number

19
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.210
of sides they're just getting closer to being that.

20
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.810
So what do we do in order to get our sphere closer to that whilst in object mode we can scroll down

21
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.470
and go to our modifiers tab when we add a modifier we've got this option under generate so we're generating

22
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.700
additional geometry subdivisions surface and if it's set to the cats model clock what we will find is

23
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.660
it will squish together more and more into a sphere type object where we increase the view levels now

24
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.180
this will end up with a slightly smaller as we can see here if we look at it from the right side a slightly

25
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.590
smaller than usual sphere and also slightly cube if you have a look at a slightly squat in certain directions

26
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.530
so we can get around that now we do have to pick a level in order to do this I'm going to roughly three

27
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.580
here it looks roughly the same amount of faces as I V sphere but then I'm going to click apply so no

28
00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.210
longer are we modifying existing geometry we've created that geometry now when we go into edit mode

29
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.040
there is real geometry there if we'd just gone into edit mode before it has still been a cube and then

30
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.600
the final thing here to make this more spherical I'm not press F 3 to search and we can type in 2 sphere

31
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.120
when we do that so 2 sphere.

32
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.920
There we go we can make this more spherical it's a very subtle change and it's a change between 0 and

33
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.100
1 but when we do that now we have a more spherical object and if you really wanted to match size we

34
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.920
could then just scale it up until it's approximately the right size again and there we go and the benefit

35
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.850
of this is it's made up of quads which means that if we ult and click we get our face loops running

36
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.000
around our model if we try and do that on ITV sphere whilst we do get them going around the rings the

37
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.670
segments are literally just half and it doesn't go all the way look you lose the triangle at the top

38
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.040
and as for the IKO sphere well you cannot have a face loop running around it because it's made up of

39
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710
all of these triangles.

40
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.560
So there we go.

41
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.830
There are three different types of sphere each with their own uses each with their positives and their

42
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.070
drawbacks as well you just need to pick an appropriate one for certain situations and talking about

43
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.740
picking the perfect one for certain situations we need to pick the right one for our bowling ball and

44
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.390
that should challenge Okay so your challenge is to create a new blend to file the reason why we're creating

45
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.030
a new blender file is because in a bit we'll be bringing two separate blender files together so as create

46
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.210
our bowling ball in a new blender file and I'd like you to think carefully about what type of sphere

47
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.010
is gonna be great for a bowling ball a couple of tips here think carefully about which type is most

48
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.850
suited which type will enable us to place the holes easily if you think about how the geometry of the

49
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.570
topology of each one of those spheres is different.

50
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.660
Which ones do you think is going to be great for enabling us to place for holes for the fingers and

51
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.150
thumb and then create a sphere that's the right size for a bowling ball and just be aware that a bowling

52
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.580
ball or any circular object sometimes it's measured by its radius which is from the center to the outside

53
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.160
and sometimes its diameter which is all the way across.

54
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.380
Just bear that in mind we don't want any bowling balls that are twice the size they should be or half

55
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.250
the size they should because they look a bit silly next to those pins positively are now and give us

56
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.930
a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

57
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.500
Let's go ahead and create the base for our bowling ball.

58
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.930
Okay so we start off with picking the appropriate sphere.

59
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.280
I'm going to rule out the U V sphere completely because it's geometry changes quite significantly as

60
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.250
you go across the surface of the sphere.

61
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.910
So I'm going to get rid of that.

62
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.000
The same can be said but to a lesser degree when it comes to the code sphere.

63
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.240
Now let's think about where we might put the finger holes.

64
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.940
Oh.

65
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.390
It's gonna be off center if we choose that.

66
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.470
Can we just space it out a little more perhaps.

67
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.630
No because this is all even and there's no odds around it's going to be a bit more difficult.

68
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.440
This one is possible.

69
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.920
We could certainly let's say in sets one of these faces and then extrude inwards to create the hole

70
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.180
that might work.

71
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.390
I don't think it's where I'm going with this one though so I'm going to get rid of the cord sphere.

72
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.260
So the last one left is this one and I'm in a brand new blender file I'm going to position it using

73
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.240
the properties window to the appropriate places center in our scene.

74
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.590
Perfect.

75
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.270
So this is going to be I think the ideal one.

76
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.800
Now I'm going to actually delete this.

77
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.620
I want a bit more detail on here.

78
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.360
That's certainly too low poly so I'm gonna add a new mesh object an icon sphere.

79
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.790
I'm going to bring up the properties and the subdivisions here I'm going to increase it by one level.

80
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.880
I think to just going to be it's far far too detailed.

81
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.490
So let's leave it at three subdivisions there.

82
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.880
Now we can pick some places and just pretend that we're going to place the holes.

83
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:13.050
So if we go ahead and let's say pick here here and here we can do that relatively easy.

84
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.340
Yeah that looks good there.

85
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.750
Now there are some differences but you will find across the surface here we have hexagons in many places.

86
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.010
Then occasionally where there's kind of a corner as it were there will be these pentagons as well.

87
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.820
So it does vary throughout.

88
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.070
So we'll have to pick somewhere where the Pentagon's themselves is another Pentagon or you could you

89
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.470
could argue that those three spaces if you had a very big hand would be suitable.

90
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.450
I don't think it would be in there but because we now know now know the locations of those we could

91
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:52.070
certainly pick this area here this area here and this one here for the finger holes themselves.

92
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.000
I think those would be pretty appropriately spaced.

93
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.510
But of course would refer to our reference material for making those decisions.

94
00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.900
OK.

95
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.560
So we've figured out that this is the appropriate sphere now it just needs to be the appropriate size

96
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.690
there are a couple of ways of approaching this.

97
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:12.330
I once again I'm going to use the dimensions in order to do it and then apply my scale because I don't

98
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.770
have a clue at what scale in fact without doing some maths that it's going to have to base at the moment

99
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:23.280
this is a very very big bowling ball is two meters in its diameter.

100
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.510
Now looking at the specifications the diameter usually is around 22 centimeters it does vary.

101
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.810
There is some variance in it but if it's gonna be 22 centimeters that's absolutely fine.

102
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:41.190
So I'm going to set the X Y and Z dimensions so I'm going to hover over and dragged down and that's

103
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.200
going to enable me to edit them all at the same time.

104
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.710
So 22 centimeters is point to two of a meter in diameter.

105
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.920
So well obviously that is a lot smaller but that should be more representative now of our actual size.

106
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.310
We can view it from the top.

107
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.350
And if we really wanted to we could just see these big squares here.

108
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.170
Dunno if you can see that but these big squares here are one meter by one meter.

109
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.370
So these smaller squares that we're talking about these ones here which are now the biggest growers

110
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.970
are 10 centimeters each and we can see that is around 22 across.

111
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.820
Okay perfect.

112
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.750
I've lost it.

113
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.600
Where's it gone.

114
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.110
If that does ever happen to you remember you can use the number pad period kill full stop or of course

115
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.540
go to frame selected.

116
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.740
Remember we had our sphere selected if it wasn't selected we could select over in the outline.

117
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.560
So the final thing to do here is call it what it is that's going to be a bowling ball.

118
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.490
So that's right there.

119
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:48.390
And then finally just save it as the bowling ball so you should have two files bowling bowling okay

120
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.770
bowling ball you should have two files in the directory that you're working in at the moment.

121
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.090
I would always advise to keep the lessons together in separate directories.

122
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.760
I wouldn't dump them all into one folder.

123
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.610
It could get quite confusing later on when we're dealing with multiple models.

124
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.370
But there we go.

125
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.750
My base for my bowling ball is ready to go.

126
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.920
Causes several steps that we have to do in order to get there.

127
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.740
Now I haven't told you yet to set the shading level to smooth but if you have done that well done.

128
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.610
I'm going to set it to shade smooth now so that it's all done and ready for the next video.

129
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.800
Okay brilliant.

130
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.220
How did you guys get on.

131
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.710
Hope you've picked the IKO sphere as well.

132
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.580
I'm just wrapping up now and I realize I've not applied my scale.

133
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.270
I will do that so that we don't end up with anything funny happening later and there we go.

134
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.440
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
