00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,870
Welcome to rooting face loops using polls in this video.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:13,940
You'll learn more about where polls are really useful how to use a poll to terminate edge or face lupe's

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,950
how they can guide and redirect edge or face loops.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,180
And remember an edge or face he doesn't have to link back onto itself.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,500
It's useful when it does in certain circumstances but that won't always be the case.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,060
So just a reminder here that Paul is a virtex when multiple edges of faces meet.

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,970
So in the case and we're going to be dealing with cords here polls can happen with any shape whether

8
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,440
it's a triangle or an other thing gone.

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,260
But we're only going to be dealing with quads and if we have a look at this picture here we can see

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
three highlighted avoid all sharing one vertex.

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,440
So that's a three part well here we have five quads.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,490
These are the most common.

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:09,770
By the way about your come across and that is where Five quads share one vertex and again this is smack

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,510
bang in the middle and we'll go through a few other examples of where you can find these and that will

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,960
help you explore the world of face loops.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,440
So one thing the final thing to go over so before we go exploring all this in blender there is one final

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,710
thing that I would want to go through and that is a loop flow.

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,610
Okay so let's talk quickly about loop flown now with quads.

19
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,770
Of course this doesn't apply to any gods or triangles.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,530
Think of the edges.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,470
If you were to count around either clockwise or anticlockwise around day that's to just take a symbol

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,660
one a square.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,320
The first edge you look at his number one then number two and number three the number four then you

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,570
get back to edge number one again.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,910
Now I like to think one in three and two and four has been joined together.

26
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,560
This will help you visualize a face Lou and also help you to construct it and control the direction

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,210
in which it's travelling.

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,080
So enough with theory already let's go play with this now and hop on over in a blender.

29
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,810
Okay so your head should be coming along rather well at the moment and let's not go and muck that up

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,350
at the moment.

31
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,780
Let's go ahead and open up a brand new blender file.

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,330
Okay.

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,090
And then we get rid of the default Cuban can delete it completely.

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,290
And I'm going to add a new mesh object and I'm going to call it.

35
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,870
I'm going to call it a grid it is a grid and I'm going to stick with the default one and I'm going to

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,380
Scotia show over into the top few and zoom in just a little and make sure it orthographic projection

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,980
for the moment so I can see these grid lines properly.

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm going to hop straight into edit mode.

39
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,950
So you've got a 10 by 10 grid here that we can play with.

40
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,360
And the first thing I'm going to do is just hype the 3D manipulator which I'm not going to need it.

41
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,800
Let's explore making a loop around our particular mesh.

42
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,960
And this is only a 2D one obviously in three dimensions.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,910
It can take on a slightly different feel as well.

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,200
So want to go and grab the knife tool.

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,740
And this starts at a virtex here and go roughly into the middle of it in all the way up to the top and

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,810
the press space to apply about.

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,830
And I'm going to grab the knife tool again and this time go all the way across to the other side.

48
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,460
And again I'm going to press space to apply that.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,900
Now let's have a look at what that's done.

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,330
That has created a flow running around here.

51
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,450
And this is similar.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,200
This is exactly the same as the picture we saw moments ago where we have one vertex in the middle here

53
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,000
just behind that 3D kerson phone bill move through the cursor at the way for the moment exactly where

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,740
the origin is as well.

55
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,360
And we have the five quad just here as well.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,250
So what has happened here and what has it broken so let's go explore what it has broken.

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,660
So as we go along here we can see it goes along there.

58
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,740
Has it broken anything along here.

59
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,220
No.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,270
Has it broken anything along here.

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,310
The Breaks how we might not want that flow.

62
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,950
That's one thing to consider.

63
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,190
So everything appears to be okay.

64
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,940
But there might not be desirable flow here.

65
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,420
All right hap's we've added too much geometry into our model and if we wanted to change that for instance

66
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:41,120
we could group these four quads together and that would make modelling a tad easier if we started to

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,790
get too much detail in one place.

68
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,510
We can simply do that by dissolving some edges.

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,870
So these unguents which affects her face may have These are going to be joined together.

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,970
These along here not into one big lump.

71
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,510
This is just one of the things we can do here.

72
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,650
Just to remind you of that will depend on what you're doing.

73
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:11,070
So if I dissolve these edges here and then dissolve these edges will.

74
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,330
And why go the right way these ones here dissolve itches.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,810
Now that should get rid of the vertex in the middle.

76
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,120
Now we have a triangle here.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,240
So we need to get rid of that edge there as well.

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,790
So this isn't quite there yet because if we follow the edge flow if we talk about the one two three

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,450
four that we're talking about before.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:42,500
So 1 2 3 so 1 and 3 will be flowing so that be here here then we've got one while we've got too many

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,050
here.

82
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,500
So there needs to be another flow here.

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,480
So this does solve those edges and not the flow here.

84
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,290
To solve those etches offers one more just down here.

85
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:02,240
So now we test that again we'll see that the flow goes around there nicely and round here nicely says

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,760
another way that you can go around and reet apologize and neat things up.

87
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,110
Now did say there was another example where you will find a basically a five foot pole going on and

88
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,010
that is when you decide to extrude something.

89
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,510
So here we have a series of quartz we've gone into the 3D realm here.

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:31,680
And if I extrude that up if we do a little count here one two three four five we've got five quads that

91
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,330
are connected to one pole just here.

92
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,230
So it's very important that you realize that just extruding up like this has also broken the flow and

93
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,110
we've generated an edge float around here.

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,090
If we look at the very top begot one two three.

95
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:56,850
And that has essentially terminated the edge flow around the top here where we go one.

96
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,490
And it just doesn't know where to go.

97
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,400
And that's one of the reasons why you can have an edge loop around a plane.

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,540
But the moment you convert it into a cube it doesn't like to talk because it doesn't know where to go

99
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,900
around the bottom here.

100
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,890
It doesn't know where to go it doesn't know where to go because there's a poll.

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,320
Now if we may to this one at the bottom here in2 So it was just one two three four chords.

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,810
We could probably faff about to do that.

103
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,960
We would end up with the edge flow going around the bottom again.

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,450
Okay so I'm going to go over to a real example here.

105
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,760
Show We're back over at my human head and it's coming along fine.

106
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,460
There are a couple of things that I do want to sort out.

107
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,670
So one of the first things I'm going to have a look at is this flow around here.

108
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:57,810
So if I select this edge around here we can see it flows round and down here it stops.

109
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,890
Why does it stop.

110
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,080
But it stops because there's a pole which is this vertex here.

111
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,550
And we've got one two three four five.

112
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,570
So there's a couple of options.

113
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,830
You can and geometry.

114
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:19,950
You could cut it in with a knife tool or do no no end of things or you can perhaps dissolve some edges

115
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,220
in order to get there.

116
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,060
So let's explore both options whether it's right or wrong at this point in time.

117
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,780
And we just don't know at this early stage of the model.

118
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,090
Sometimes it will be the right thing to do some type of thing.

119
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,150
Are you going to have to go back and dissolve that later on.

120
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,100
So this particular one here I think by cutting through here.

121
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,540
And around there I'm going to hit the space bar and just highlight that okay.

122
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,400
It seems to be going up all the way around to the top.

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,890
So Perfect that's regain that loop around there.

124
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,510
But of course when you do something like cutting the question then is have I just moved the problem

125
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:10,660
onto the next set the adjacent set of polygon So if I go back in time before I put that cut in and just

126
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,590
see if this one hit No that one there's also terminating.

127
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,530
So everything's terminating along all like the bottom of the jaw here.

128
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,690
So getting the knife tool going along here all the way to the edge is not actually breaking any thing

129
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,590
and that's always the concern I would have when using the knife tool because it's very easy to just

130
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,780
shift the problem onto another area.

131
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,470
Now let's have a look at the triangle I've got on top now triangles can be dealt in a number of ways.

132
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,600
I could add even more geometry coming through here cuts through this triangle in a certain way which

133
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,240
would generate quads but it would also give us more geometry and at this point in time I don't feel

134
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,040
I need any more geometry round the top of this head any more geometry itself is unnecessary it's not

135
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,270
defining any detail.

136
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,620
It's a four head.

137
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,830
For a start I mean you could argue at this point in time you know what that's going to be under a hair

138
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,520
line.

139
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,260
No one's ever going to see that even of the face deforms massively during an expressive moment.

140
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,480
It's still not going to be seen as on the hairline.

141
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,270
Then the person who just wants to get everything right inside of you goes well there are going to leave

142
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,510
the triangle there for the sake of it I'll just tidy up.

143
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,270
The other thing of course is it does block this edge loop ball this surrey's fazli Running down here

144
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,840
just stops it in its entirety and I would like that fazli to exist.

145
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,980
So looking closely here are one of the things we can do is merge this together and we can do that by

146
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,460
selecting this edge here and dissolving it.

147
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,700
Okay so what has that done to our flow does our outflow now work.

148
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,190
It doesn't and it doesn't.

149
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,530
Let's just can we edges here make sure one two three four five okay we've got five.

150
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,140
It's not a quad.

151
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,610
So what's it linked to is linked to this one here.

152
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,200
So let's dissolve that hedge as well.

153
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Now let's see what happens.

154
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,180
We should have an edge flow going round.

155
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,520
We do perfectly goes right round the outside of the face and no surprise terminates just under the jaw

156
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,470
line here as the other one did.

157
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,530
And if we look closely it's one two three four five.

158
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,260
There's another angle on down the bottom there.

159
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,010
So let's go back up to the top and just check a few of the things.

160
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,940
Do we still have loops running around there.

161
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,400
Yep and we can see here this link this link.

162
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,220
This loop kinks in rather quickly.

163
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,440
And that's girn of course from defamation.

164
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,770
If we're not careful uneven so we can grab that.

165
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,660
And I haven't I'm not really sure and moving that in the 3D world it's always best to check it from

166
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,480
several angles just to make it a bit more even as it flows round.

167
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,860
Otherwise some of these look a bit crooked and they could certainly be much support even as they flow

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,500
around and define the shape.

169
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,050
Unless of course it is a bumpy head so let's just try that.

170
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,620
Now we move stuff that works around there.

171
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,500
These ones are working and terminating at the top as expected.

172
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,110
Yeah.

173
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,050
I'm absolutely happy with that.

174
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,130
And of course now comes a challenge.

175
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,110
I'd like you to go ahead and define the five main faced groups.

176
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,910
Now you may already have done this in which case it would give you an opportunity to refine them but

177
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:41,400
to go ahead and define the five main face groups that make up the face and don't worry if you if you're

178
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,890
not quite sure I'll be showing you through them in a few moments before I say Paul's video.

179
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,760
Now do expect to make mistakes.

180
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,640
Go with it.

181
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:59,220
And remember to save often or even save as once you've got one area nailed and be prepared to start

182
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,800
over from the base head a few times.

183
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,200
If you make a right mess of it but don't worry.

184
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,570
This all happens especially when you're new to face topology.

185
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,230
And finally of course we haven't done it yet but create the nose allergist a little hint there about

186
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,680
the extruding creating the five pole that we can use for the nose.

187
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,750
Perhaps that's just one way of making it.

188
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,590
Of course.

189
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:31,170
Now before I say pause I just want to define those five main areas for you see you know what you're

190
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,370
looking at.

191
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,950
And here we go we have a basic face in front of us and I have colour coded them all.

192
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,360
Hopefully this is clear for everybody including those who might be color-blind.

193
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,560
No you can't distinguish between green and red often so I haven't included red.

194
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,550
We've got a yellow border running round the entire face.

195
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,390
Obviously we've got a Rest of a head here to do.

196
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,150
But I'm only focussed on the face at the moment.

197
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,820
We've got the loops running round the eyes themselves.

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,490
We've got the loop that goes across the bridge of the nose and round to the chin.

199
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:10,560
We've got the one that goes around the nose and it'll be interesting to see how you guys come about

200
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,130
making that nose topology.

201
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,650
And then we've got the ones that run around the mouth and the lips themselves.

202
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,620
So there we go off flicked this round into front view.

203
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,620
And we're in orthographic mode so you can see what's going on.

204
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,280
And they go there's your reference material that you can use as a guide.

205
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:37,070
Incidentally you can see we've got polls five polls rerouting our model as it goes round here.

206
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,120
We split away from one another.

207
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,950
There's a five poll on the right hand side of the eye here on the inside of the eye where the nose comes

208
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,350
down where the nose actually is where this breaks away there's a five pole here a five pole.

209
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,840
There you can start to see them all over the place.

210
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,800
When you start looking in fact there's a three poll just here on the right hand side.

211
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,640
Okay so there's one final thing here.

212
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,720
I want to show you guys to help you when it comes to creating these areas where there are five.

213
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,470
All hang on a minute.

214
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,670
I've got an example bit of material here.

215
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,050
It has got a whopping great big N gone sat here.

216
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,550
Mass not in condition.

217
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,570
You guys actually just breaks what I've just told you.

218
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,260
So I'm going to have to sort that out.

219
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,490
And also just like to show you how to get this cut sort of curvy effect going on that's called enabling

220
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,210
the cage.

221
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,470
I don't want the end panel there I actually want the properties panel so I'm going to have to do a bit

222
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,100
of manipulation with the windows here.

223
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,670
And let's go to the modifiers.

224
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:51,230
So the subsurface modify here I have got turned on on this mask that I've made I've got turned on the

225
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,580
cage which is the mesh data sort of triangle that we've got there.

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,060
And when we click on that you can see that all of a sudden everything ends up a lot smoother.

227
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:10,280
And I like that on when we're looking at it just looks better and of course you can turn off the smooth

228
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,380
whilst in edit mode as well so the subsurface modifiers not shown.

229
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,940
You can't have that not shown and the cage turned on at the same time.

230
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,760
So I'm going to turn both of those off so I can actually reroute this.

231
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,180
This particular line this face loop running around here so I can demonstrate a point for us.

232
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:39,200
I want to make something to add in a face loop there grabbing the knife tool join those two up.

233
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,110
Now hopefully I have not broken any Fink so let's us have a look.

234
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,050
A facelift running around men this face Loopt should continue round.

235
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,170
Perfect.

236
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,190
So what I wanted to demonstrate here is the two changes in direction.

237
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:58,100
The if we switch to edge mode here we have an I'm going to turn on the smoothness again because it just

238
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,440
flows a bit better.

239
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,990
We've got this edge floating around here and then it's broken as it flows around here.

240
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,490
It's broken again and flows underneath because we have these five faces here and these five faces here.

241
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:21,440
Now you'll notice that that particular Paul of the five pole there and the five pole here both lay on

242
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,270
the same age as it flows round.

243
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,410
And that is important that they are located on the same edge.

244
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,990
If it's going to control the loop around in a circuit like that so bear that in mind as you go ahead

245
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,010
and construct to your head or you're certainly your face in this point.

246
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,230
Now usually I'd say pause the video now and go do the challenge.

247
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,420
Unfortunately I'm not going to have enough time to K3 of a challenge if I do that.

248
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,750
So go ahead do the challenge and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
