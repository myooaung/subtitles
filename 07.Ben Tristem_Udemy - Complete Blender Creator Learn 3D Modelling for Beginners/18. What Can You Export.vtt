00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.420
So let's talk about what you can export in this video you will understand what will export.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.310
Realize some elements of your models will not export or will once or not properly at all.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.110
It does depend on the target package that you're exporting to.

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.480
So what will appear on import.

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.740
Well often you will have no problem with meche data including the U.S. maps armatures and animation

6
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.780
data will appear to support it in the target package.

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.840
So for instance if you were moving a mesh in the animated lamp that we've done into something like unity

8
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100
or unreel you'll find the animation is there.

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.860
If you're trying to import that into something like Sketchup which doesn't support that type of animation

10
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.960
then it just wouldn't be there.

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.540
Now textures may appear that once this is one of these odd ones or the simple diff based the fused texture

12
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.820
that comes when you make your model but often that will appear there once and then not update anymore.

13
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.870
So what we have to do in a lot of cases is if we're working in another application is a lot of reconstruction

14
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.050
so texture's often have to be reapplied whether they're in normal mapper or a diffused map and will

15
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.580
go over those types of map in much more detail shortly.

16
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.900
Shaders how it actually renders the image work differently in other packages.

17
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.910
And what that basically means is any of your materials would have to be remade.

18
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.630
So we've got our texture's on one level whether they're a bump map showing as artificial surface detail

19
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.440
or whether they're a diffuse map which show is the base colour of a material the materials themselves

20
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.380
will often have to be reconstructed.

21
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.800
So that means if we're working primarily in another package and we use using blender to model with then

22
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.800
you shouldn't be focussing too heavily on materials within blender you need to focus on materials within

23
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.120
the target package particle systems are local to Blender.

24
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.060
So if you've made something with hair and try and export it the hair won't be there.

25
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.590
You can solidify the hair.

26
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
Sure you can make it a mesh object and then it will come across.

27
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.680
But that might put your polygon count through the roof.

28
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.540
Of course one of the best things you can do is test.

29
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.190
So if you want to move from one package to the other.

30
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.940
Just test what you want to do.

31
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.890
Be very lean about to just make a hairy cube and see if that opens up in an external package.

32
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.850
If it doesn't ask yourself why is that.

33
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.820
And then you drift back and you go well is this a particle system or you've made the cube look like

34
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.540
glass.

35
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.330
So it's a glass paperweight on a desk for instance and then you test it and it just comes across as

36
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.110
a cube.

37
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.250
Well then you need to set up the material in the target package so we don't want to do is waste time.

38
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.430
In blender if youre moving your models straight over to an external package of course that's not what

39
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.470
were going to be focussed on entirely here because it is a course on blender.

40
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.710
So we'll be focussed on actually all of these things within blender and how to get them out as well.

41
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.270
If you want to use them there.

42
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.230
So a quick challenge for you here.

43
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.340
Where's your models end points.

44
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.200
So where is the model you were making going to end up.

45
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.880
Is it going to end up in a game engine.

46
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.460
Is it going to end up in a completely different package.

47
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.580
Are you moving between the two.

48
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.070
We need to make these decisions now before we start moving ahead and are wasting time in one package

49
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.080
when we should be putting up that effort.

50
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.930
For instance materials in another what do you need to do in blender vs. the external package was the

51
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.100
video now and give that some thought.

52
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.830
Guys welcome back.

53
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.460
Now I'm going to go through my challenge answer.

54
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.550
Well I'm going to remain in blender for the entire project.

55
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.840
So I of course is a course focussed on blender so I'm going to be doing that.

56
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.950
And so the materials will be fleshed out in blender.

57
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.270
Textures will be made in blender but kept unpacked.

58
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.900
So before we've had them packed into the blend file I think I've still got it.

59
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.030
Default sets being packed so I'm going to have to sort out when I looked at my data block it did show

60
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.140
me that they were packed so I need to change that and then I can use any textures I create across multiple

61
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.930
models because they are not going to be stored in the blend file they're going to be stored on a folder

62
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.930
probably at Textus folder on the actual computer itself which is incredibly useful.

63
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.510
Now I just need to bear in mind that if I do move my models out and I will do throughout this section

64
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.970
to make sure that they're working externally that things that I've had to make a particle system I just

65
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.710
need to be aware that that isn't going to come across.

66
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.350
The lighting in the scene that's not going to come across etc etc..

67
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.600
There's lots of things that potentially I could do that have no impact in an external file so that may

68
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.140
aid.

69
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.640
Glenda.

70
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.530
Well it's not going to aid anything else moving out so I'll just bear that in mind and wherever possible

71
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.880
limits things like the particle systems and special lighting effects etc..

72
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.660
How did you guys get on.

73
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.410
Are you working in multiple packages at the moment.

74
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.180
Please share how your working what packages you're working in are you moving between two 3D modelling

75
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.970
packages like sketch up through the s Max and blender.

76
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.850
Perhaps you use one for one thing and one for another.

77
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.070
I know a lot of people out there use Z brush for sculpting and then hop back into blender for rendering

78
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.920
etc..

79
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.860
Or are you working with the game engine.

80
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.130
Please share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
