00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.370
Welcome to getting the right skin tone.

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.000
So what are the right settings.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.370
Well as with most things in blender there aren't any.

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.350
It all depends on what you're trying to achieve.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.800
Sometimes a more porcelain look more than a natural look or any other sort of carrot to look that you're

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.180
going for will dictate how your model has to be made.

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.390
Helen materials have to be set up.

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.260
But skin itself is a complex surface so you can't really get away with just setting or one shade type

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.540
and leaving it to it because it just won't work out what it might work depending on what you're doing.

10
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.400
But in general it won't work.

11
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.530
It has more than one tone.

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.590
We're not just one colour across our face and the rest of our body.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.580
It changes depending on surface detail.

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.810
It's shiny in some places it is dry in others so you have greasy patches on the face usually on the

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.050
top of the nose obviously the lips can be wet or indeed they can be dry of your character is dehydrated

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.280
as well.

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.790
Skin can be thin or thick letting some light through or blocking it all says lots of things to take

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.630
into consideration.

19
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.590
Now what to do when picking a base colour.

20
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.890
Well you need to start somewhere so you can use the colour picker on your own reference material if

21
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.070
you've taken a photo of yourself or indeed I would suggest searching on Google for skin tone.

22
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.100
RG B reference annual have an absolute ton of information that you can then actually see what the colour

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.530
looks like and use that as your base colour.

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.840
So things to consider and focus on ignore skin tone changes due to wrinkles and folds.

25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.010
We don't really care about those at the moment because of that wrinkles and folds are an effect of light

26
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.890
rather than colour.

27
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.380
Ignore areas of sweat or oil.

28
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.050
Now we've mentioned the actual sort of like the shiny areas that you can have on the face but that will

29
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.070
be a specular map that we end up generating and that will be applied with a gloss shade later on it

30
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.360
will not be something that we need to paint in at the moment on the base colour that we are going for.

31
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.600
You may want to consider freckles scars spots some moles that cause discolouration.

32
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.950
Those will be a completely different colour to the rest of it.

33
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.970
And if you do decide to start adding detail at this stage make it rough.

34
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.080
Call it a place holder detail.

35
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.320
The mesh is still under construction.

36
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.230
It is going to change so if you think I'm going to give beauty spot or there's going to be a mole there

37
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.270
just you know paint it on roughly and then just leave it for the moment.

38
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.130
Some of those things to consider.

39
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.640
Let's go and add a base colour to the head over in blender.

40
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.170
Okay so we're over in blender now and we need to create this diff use an arm start with a diffusely

41
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.190
we didn't have to.

42
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.880
But I'm going to just pick at the fuse colour that will roughly match my skin.

43
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.780
Now I am going to actually use the reference Chandler termly a passage of the reference material.

44
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.930
Up to one.

45
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.060
So I move round the front.

46
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.820
I can just see that and want to go ahead here and go to the material section.

47
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.540
Also the defog material that's already been applied to our model.

48
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.310
I'm going to call it skin bass because it is just the base colour.

49
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.070
I'm going to go to the diffuse kind of itself.

50
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.130
Go to the picar and literally just pick a random area that looks representative of most of my skin.

51
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.740
Now we can see Miles.

52
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.300
We're having a look at this picture.

53
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.150
There are certain areas that are not the same colour as the skin colour I have picked here.

54
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.830
We've got a freckle.

55
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.280
I got some freckles here and it's lighter across the years or around the top of the cheeks and the fore

56
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.930
head now can be a bit difficult to discern what's a reflection in the room this.

57
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.290
This was taken in Certainly I'm not certainly shiny on the side of my head that just happens to be light

58
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.740
bouncing off of or coming through a window so it's worthwhile just taking a good look at the colour

59
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.360
variation on a face itself.

60
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.480
We can see here there's a vast difference between this colour here that's grab just literally grab another

61
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.000
area and this one here we can see there's a huge difference between the two.

62
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.660
See if I can undo that note.

63
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.410
Let's go and pick the same sort of area again a bit more neutral.

64
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.070
There we go.

65
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.470
So I'm going to switch back round and we can see the he's already applied it to our model.

66
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.680
If I go to rendered view at the moment because we got no lights in the scene it's cancer looks pretty

67
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.790
dire.

68
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.830
Now there are certainly some other areas that we can apply straight away or at least get the colour

69
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.760
ready for the lips as we can see here.

70
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.830
There nothing like skin colour so I'm going to add a new material.

71
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.140
I'm going to call that whole new material.

72
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.470
Call it lips underscore base because I may have.

73
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.420
Later on when we do our maps for the face we're going to have a gloss layer.

74
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.020
And so we're going to want to make sure we separate the materials out into their areas.

75
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.390
So with the lip space I am in fact is just going to be one texture later on.

76
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.820
But just for the sake of getting this right at the moment as a place holder colour there you go there

77
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.430
that the bearer of that's the colour of my lips who wouldn't know.

78
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.950
Now I've got that's ongoing always bit random.

79
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.000
Also to make sure the skin is applied to this and not the lip space.

80
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.210
I'm bit confused now as to which one is applied to this model.

81
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.950
I will look at material.

82
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.280
Yeah case the skin basis applied there.

83
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.310
So having a look at our model itself are a couple of things that I wanted to sort out.

84
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.510
There's this triangle here and I think facking go by literally removing this edge loop running around

85
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.310
the model I just realized that's the colour that I've chosen is very close to the core of the orange.

86
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.900
That may be difficult to see.

87
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:43.020
Now there is something that we can do in the viewport to make sure that we can still see lines that

88
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.400
are going on now I can see that fine after my eyes adjust by don't want to be second guessing.

89
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.270
So if we scroll all the way down and the skin base to settings and open maths up there is a view port

90
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.680
colour and we can change that to what we likes.

91
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.400
I'm going to make it a lot lighter but still roughly skin coloured.

92
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.720
Now we're in material mode at the moment but when we go back over the solid mode it will be a different

93
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.550
colour which is much easier to see anyway.

94
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:16.140
So let's go ahead and not delete the edge but dissolve the edge and that should have repaired the damage

95
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.870
there now vs.

96
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.790
I'm pretty sure these lips are far too wide.

97
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.240
And what I'm also concerned about is when I was trying to slip to a face earlier they weren't being

98
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.670
selected a select them for some reason zooming in and turning off the modifier.

99
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.050
I see that I've got a trying door here.

100
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.310
I've probably got another triangle hiding away in here and also it's very very ugly around here with

101
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:48.000
it's well with all of this mesh It's folded in in itself in certain places so there needs to be a bit

102
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.540
of a tidy up here.

103
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.960
Now the first thing I'm going to do is literally LOL.

104
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.500
I don't quite know.

105
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.060
There we go.

106
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.240
I managed to do it.

107
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:07.320
Yes so I've got two triangles we've got one here and one here and that was all those were probably created

108
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.850
when I had the merge vertices automatically turned on and I was just moving the lips around.

109
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.270
It looks like I've snapped into place and cause myself of a problem.

110
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.510
Now there are a couple of ways that I can fix this.

111
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.430
I'm just going to literally go in with the knife tool and hopefully cutting there will give us two triangles

112
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:36.660
there and there and another two there and there and with two triangles you can dissolve it into one

113
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.620
face.

114
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:45.300
Now I'm going to select the edge itself in the middle and dissolve edges and here dissolve edges.

115
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.390
Now is the time where I need to test my edge loops 1 2 3.

116
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.470
Excellent so that is working fine.

117
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:59.580
It still looks a bit ugly around here and that's going to take a while to sort out all I want it to

118
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.440
roughly do is not be folding in on itself any more.

119
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:13.050
And of course make sure that those face loops are still working which they are perfect right so I need

120
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.820
to have a look at this from the front and I think this is one of these instances where I'm going to

121
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.540
have to.

122
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:25.410
How lovely a pastie off my image for a start but also just manipulate my image as well because my head

123
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.120
is at a different angle.

124
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:34.380
So this is all too wide at the moment so I'm going to select the face on the inside JERs there and with

125
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.650
proportional editing turned on and asking going to move in and make sure I'm moving.

126
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.880
A lot of it in once now hopefully.

127
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.200
Where was the edge of my mouth.

128
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.050
I can't actually see that I need.

129
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.840
There may be a little bit more if I can do issues that circle as guidance though we get sets turning

130
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.290
a pastie bet down that looks good.

131
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.050
There's some more editing to be done.

132
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:09.430
And by the side we can see here all has some horrible horrible folding going on in the middle there

133
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.280
so let's sort that out as well whilst we're looking at it.

134
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:23.200
This isn't really kalila stuff but it's certainly important and we can move this one back again in fact.

135
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.590
It used to come in.

136
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.900
We can come up.

137
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:37.100
The whole all of that inside can come up and then lower that down so let the Edge loop and raise the

138
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.260
whole thing up.

139
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.310
Perfect.

140
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.570
Then these will have to respectively go inwards slightly.

141
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.150
And there's lots more of modification that can be done.

142
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.510
Here's the face isn't so deformed.

143
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.300
So I'll leave that like that for the moment.

144
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.710
In fact when you're looking at things like this you must have a subsurface modifier applied Otherwise

145
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.860
you could be doing lots of work for nothing.

146
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.840
But now we're on the side or not that's the wrong image.

147
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.540
No from the side.

148
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.360
On the side there we go.

149
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.970
So the mouth comes too far back as well so that now on a side we can actually I'm sorry to repeat myself

150
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:26.250
five times but now we're on the side we can actually see that those movements that we've just done aren't

151
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:26.970
white.

152
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.250
Right because of the myths.

153
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.430
The face itself.

154
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:41.010
And it goes back to far some women grab their inside face again and just literally shift it forward.

155
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.220
And down to about there.

156
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.380
Now hopefully that hasn't distorted the model too much hasn't.

157
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.950
Well looks like I'm pouting So that just needs to be smooth out.

158
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.030
In fact there isn't some nasty edges around the whole model.

159
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.710
And there's one thing that you can do called smooth virtex.

160
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.900
It's a virtex command and we get it through the night.

161
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.710
Looks like that's the last thing that I've practiced using and I'm going to apply that so you can also

162
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.610
get it smooth.

163
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:17.800
Vertex under the mesh but sees smooth vertex just there.

164
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.430
Now the great thing about the smooth virtex is that it smoothes out the entire model.

165
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:27.230
The bad thing about this is that is that it makes things shrink ever so slightly as well.

166
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:33.080
So we can see that nose has been pulled in it doesn't seem to have affected this that much.

167
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.140
And of course has some work to be done down here as well.

168
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:44.540
It's shrunk the four head a little but it has meant that there's no or not as many jarring areas as

169
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.450
there was before.

170
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.330
Okay.

171
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.350
So we've got our base covers here.

172
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.570
And of course it's now time for a challenge.

173
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.830
I would like you to go ahead and get your base colours sorted.

174
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.830
Make sure you have a base colour applied to your model.

175
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.670
Tidy up anything in your model that is standing out as bad or wrong.

176
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.130
Just like I was going around earlier and saying where the mouth is too wide it's in the wrong position.

177
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.720
Is your neckline right.

178
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.340
Etc. it's worth doing some tidying up at this stage.

179
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.260
Check all your loops are working as well.

180
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.050
I had a few triangles and I'm sure there's something else in the background.

181
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.360
There's going to cause me a problem later on.

182
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.210
But go round and check and make sure your main loops are actually working.

183
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.360
Now here's an optional one for you.

184
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.890
We are going to do this later on as well but feel free at this point to unwrap your model and add even

185
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:48.090
more detail so with it unwrapped you can actually paint directly on to the model.

186
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.180
Don't worry so much about how you can unwrap it.

187
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:58.640
If you go down that stage but just be aware of the seams on your model itself and make sure if you do

188
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.170
decide to unwrap it.

189
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:07.790
You keep the face as a face because that's the area where you don't want a seam causing you any problems

190
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:08.890
anyway.

191
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.520
Balls of video now make sure you have a basic colour applied to your model.

192
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.770
Okay guys.

193
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.870
Welcome back.

194
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.390
Let's hop back on over into blender and just go around my model and see if there's anything else that

195
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.100
I need to sort out.

196
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.230
Okay so one of the glaringly obvious areas is my eye.

197
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:40.090
Know I'm not going to focus too much at the moment on getting it absolutely perfect but it does stand

198
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.540
out at the moment as not something suitable.

199
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:50.270
So I'm going to select the edge loop running around the eye itself and just pull that forward knots

200
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.360
Oh lots.

201
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.130
Births first about there.

202
00:14:53.140 --> 00:15:00.070
I'm also going to flip around the sign just make sure that we've got the right amount of wealth of detail

203
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.990
that it goes back far enough.

204
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:09.320
So looking at VAT's the eye the eye itself is not quite in the right place and the move that.

205
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.090
In fact we need to make a decent eye at some point.

206
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.310
Okay so now that VAT is in roughly the right place now we can start moving the other bits and bobs will

207
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.670
notice straightaway by looking at this and weave was round to the front and I can't see anything.

208
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.350
Why can I not see anything cause the.

209
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.920
Or a pass at sea.

210
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:33.040
Or put it on the wrong area so the lips here I've moved upswell have to move it back down again for

211
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.130
V.

212
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.010
And this is where I can start moving some vertices to help define the shape of feet.

213
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.840
I just a little bit better.

214
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:50.620
So here we go I'm literally just spinning the video up here because I am literally moving Firths backwards

215
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.380
and forwards and tweaking the shape of the eye turning proportional editing on and off as I need it

216
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:03.430
as I'm doing this I start to realize that the brow isn't well formed at the moment some just moving

217
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:10.370
the verses around and adding in a new face loop to actually get that looking much better.

218
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:16.060
And now we see here that the eye is not pointy enough we start moving around some vertices and hopefully

219
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.790
up with time and practice.

220
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.090
You guys will be able to form the shapes that you desire as you go.

221
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.600
Some of it however is just trial and error.

222
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.900
Remember to view your model externally all the time just to make sure is looking right.

223
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.810
In the third dimension as well.

224
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.470
Excellent.

225
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.470
So looks like a bit of a grump on then.

226
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:44.110
Also looks like I'm embossed watching a little from nisbett of my for head which is not natural.

227
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.580
However it is natural to have a brow itself.

228
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:55.060
So I'm just going to try pulling that forward ever so slightly that should lessen the impact here and

229
00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.100
also pulling this area forward ever so slightly as well.

230
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.180
Okay that's looking pretty good.

231
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.610
The eye itself still needs a bit more refining.

232
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:13.810
And again you will just have to go around here and it may be a case that we do actually require more

233
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.420
detail.

234
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:21.050
It may be that we've got too little detail in this area to define the eye properly.

235
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:32.880
In fact one of the issues here is the IDE does not fly round in quite the right areas.

236
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.960
He's got a fink of the various areas of the I as it goes around.

237
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.640
So you got this area around here that's now too high.

238
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.280
But what does it look like from the side caterer's stand to get some nice defamation along the top here.

239
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.150
I think I need that to continue.

240
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.480
No it does fade off around there but I would like it.

241
00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:01.480
Following this line just a little closer so I can move that whole long.

242
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.910
There you go.

243
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.610
That's a much better definition now.

244
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.250
This is a bit extreme here.

245
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:17.590
So again we'll have to lessen the impact slightly by pulling it back again and again we can go and tweet

246
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:23.710
and tweak and tweak can tweak and tweak until now until a blue in the face now that's it.

247
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.220
Well one of the problems here is I don't think that corner of my eyes quite this high.

248
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.930
So let's sort that out.

249
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:36.270
And I am going to have proportional editing turned on at this point to make sure I can more.

250
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.350
I don't need that much but I do need to move quite a bit down at the same time.

251
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.890
Yeah it's looking much better now.

252
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.260
Actually the smooth this bit out.

253
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.050
And again this is where smoothing the verb.

254
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.640
You've got couple selected can help out massively as well.

255
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:12.670
Okay.

256
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.550
I'm liking that form at the moment.

257
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.010
Is there anything else that I need to sort out the top of a head.

258
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.160
Has some funky things going on.

259
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.850
But I think we all believe that until another lecture.

260
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.480
How are you guys getting on.

261
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.270
Have you made something that's frowning a bit like that.

262
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.400
Um actually I think I'm smiling there.

263
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.750
I'm not quite sure yet.

264
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.190
How are you guys getting on.

265
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:40.180
I'd love to see your heads how detailed they're becoming now make sure you share in the discussions.

266
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.920
And I will see you in the next lecture.
