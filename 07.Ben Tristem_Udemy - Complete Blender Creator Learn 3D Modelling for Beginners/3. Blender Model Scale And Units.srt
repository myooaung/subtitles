Hello everybody and welcome to this quick tip on the blender model scale and what do we mean by that.
1

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,170
Well put simply if this cube here represents in a building but we had everything set to millimeters
2

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,790
that would be bad.
3

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,640
That would be the wrong scale to have set up meters would be much more appropriate if we were making
4

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,460
a,
5

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,210
An oil tanker working in millimeters would be the wrong scale to use.
6

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,480
Now I'm obviously interchanging here millimeters and meters.
7

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,880
You can use inches and feet if you want and we can do that over on the side panel here.
8

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,460
So if we go to the properties panel and go down to the scene view.
9

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,270
So we're setting the units for the entire scene.
10

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,900
That's important because you can have multiple scenes within blender with different units.
11

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,040
So no go ahead and click on the scene here and we'll see that we've got an option here for units if
12

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,600
we click on that it gives us a couple of options.
13

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,270
The one that we're mainly concerned with at the moment is the unit system at the top.
14

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,390
So if we go ahead and click on that we end up with Imperial metric and none.
15

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,490
Now if you use the blender in the past it used to come with no units and by default it would translate
16

17
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,420
those in the background one blender unit would have essentially been one meter so you can switch between
17

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,710
imperial and metric.
18

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,120
And once you've done that you can change your length settings here.
19

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,700
So micrometer's, millimeters, centimeters, meters, etc
20

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,360
Or if we're in imperial you can switch between thousandth of an inch,Inch,Feet
21

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,640
Miles and adaptive which is an interesting one.
22

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,080
Now in general you want to pick this for your project and work on it.
23

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,270
Now in general I would recommend working in S.I. units.
24

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,330
It just means that everything is uniform and the majority of the time you'll be working roughly in a
25

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,550
metric scale of around 2 meters the human body sort of size.
26

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,430
And so everything is a good starting point from that.
27

28
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,610
And that's what I'm going to do throughout this course I'm going to be mainly focused on the metric
28

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,300
and under the imperial system of course you can have your pound just stone.
29

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,320
I've never heard of a centum weight.
30

31
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,870
There we go.
31

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm learning something.
32

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,530
But here we go this is where you get to this area here and to be quite honest it will probably depend
33

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,560
on what you're used to working with but what's really important is if you're working in a team you will
34

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,280
want to make sure that you're all using the same units.
35

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,420
And remember what you've set here because you may think you're working a much larger scale than you
36

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,270
actually are.
37

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,580
And that will cause you some issues you can see here that this cube that once was two meters across
38

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,100
is now six foot something across because we've changed it to feet.
39

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,910
So the uni,
40

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,400
The units that you create your objects in.
41

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,570
In this case it was a to me to buy two meter cube by two meter.
42

43
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,590
We can see if I switched back to metric.
43

44
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,220
It fits perfectly in that meters.
44

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,770
If I switch to centimeters again it sits perfectly there but the numbers that i then type in would
45

46
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,670
default to centimeters if I go to Imperial you can see it changes the scale along the side here and
46

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,170
the scale of this underlying grid and then if we go ahead and go add new mesh objects a cube and here
47

48
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,340
we put two in.
48

49
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,790
You can see this two foot cube is significantly smaller.
49

50
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,130
I've just clicked away or hid it.
50

51
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,080
There we go.
51

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,010
It's significantly smaller.
52

53
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,540
So if you thought you were creating another two by two meter cube and you weren't when you went and
53

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,830
imported that into another scene you'd have loads of conversions.
54

55
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,020
So make sure ever you've selected you stick with for what you're working with.
55

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,230
Don't mix up imperial and metric stick with either one or the other.
56

57
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,520
Now when it comes to actually picking say you wanted to stick with Imperial for the rest of the course
57

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,130
that's absolutely fine and working in feet.
58

59
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,670
What you can then do is go to file save your start up file and then you don't have to worry about setting
59

60
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,140
it to Imperial every time because by default it will be a metric.
60

61
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,100
And of course I'm going to be working in metric as I've mentioned.
61

62
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,420
So I don't need to do that.
62

63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,070
But if you do want to make sure that any of the settings that you've got a permanent every time you
63

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:27,540
open up blender for all new blend files you can go to file and save your startup file just a word of
64

65
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,170
warning.
65

66
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:34,190
If I saved it with these two cubes in the scene well those two cubes will be there every time you start.
66

67
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,540
So make sure you've got a bland scene a basic scene that you want to start with.
67

68
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,940
So I often play about go load up General again tweak the settings that I want to tweak and then save
68

69
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,510
my start up file from there.
69

70
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,540
So occasionally I've removed the default cube from the scene because I haven't been using it much but
70

71
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,810
it always seems to come back.
71

72
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,080
I love that default cube anyway that's the end of this quick tip and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
