00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,020
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,140
In this lecture I'd like you to go ahead and create your remaining building blocks your modular building

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,750
blocks.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,240
So create some extra ones if you have what you thinks are complete sets.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,760
Perhaps there are a few other things you'd like to include bring them from across from your nice to

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,150
hams into your will have in your scene.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,710
Now obviously there are other models as well that we'll get to making later on in the section.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,540
But for the moment we just need to finalize.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,720
For me it's going to be a corner piece and I'd totally forgotten to think about the roof.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,550
Now I'm going to have two roof pieces I'm going to have a large one to go over the main area and then

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,110
smaller ones on the side.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,910
Although thinking about I can probably only use the word get away with.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:58,700
But I think I can get away with essentially our wool piece cuts from one corner to the other meaning

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
that it's just a right angle triangle I should be able to use that as a basis for the roof.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,320
But we'll see how we go as I start stacking things together.

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,250
Okay so one final thing you'll hear me say there's lots.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,180
But keep it simple at the moment.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,160
You want some basic building blocks to flesh out your design.

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,350
Suppose a video now and give that a go

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,200
Okay everybody Welcome back.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's go ahead hop on over into blender and finish off our extra modular pieces okay.

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,390
So I've gone ahead and I've opened up my standard church scene and I'm going to go from my building

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,770
scene here into my export scene so everything's together.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,850
And so I can start putting a few of these pieces together and trying to work out what size corner piece.

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:54,160
Now I could make this really really straightforward and have it be a four by four piece and then I know

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,590
that my door and everything else will fit together really nicely.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,610
I'm going to take that approach.

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,180
I think it will be fine.

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,180
We're going to start with the wall in order to do this and then work from there.

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,160
So I'm going to select everything in my scene and press H.

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,550
Now bear in mind if you do do what I've just done.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,680
When you go ahead and look at things through a rendered perspective there is no light in the scene anymore

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,700
so it's not all really work.

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,450
Of course the camera is also hidden even though we can see through it still if we need to.

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,460
Okay.

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,770
So find the wool piece for me.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,990
I'm going to duplicate that.

38
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,010
I'm going to call it corner.

39
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,550
Okay.

40
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,560
So this is the corner piece a couple of ways that I could approach this I'm going to go into edit mode

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:50,230
and duplicate my mesh again and I'm just having a look at how it's positioned in our world because ultimately

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,490
all of our pieces line up externally.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,730
So let's make sure we can still do that with a duplicated let's move it.

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,970
So g x four minus four.

45
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,910
There we go.

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,440
Ah Z one eighty they're not.

47
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,050
1 1890.

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,640
Of course that's placed it somewhere completely random for me but I should now be able to bring it across

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,690
the right location.

50
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,910
Okay so the last thing we've got here is just to merge all of this together.

51
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,960
Now there are a couple of ways that we can do this.

52
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:32,500
The first thing I'm going to do is to select all and I'm going to search for merge and then select merge

53
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:40,090
by distance and that will have removed these two double vertices here and here.

54
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,480
So that's very useful it's just this last bit here too and there are a couple of ways that I could do

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,150
this.

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:53,980
I'm going to change snapping snapping he says snapping to the vertex select and I can go e to pull it

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,560
out and reluctance to snap it to a vertex they're now going to select everything.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,880
And once again it will remember my selection when I press EF 3 remove two extra vertices.

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:12,460
But if we go into wireframe mode we'll see we've got an internal face just here which is no good.

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,990
Let's go ahead and delete.

61
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,290
That's only the face if we delete the vertices.

62
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,610
It will look rubbish.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,510
Okay values good as a war piece.

64
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,350
Let's turn back on solid shade.

65
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,300
Yeah I'm happy with that as a basic wall piece and it should fit together really well with everything

66
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,230
else Okay so let's go ahead and hide that corner piece.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,650
Excellent.

68
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,030
And then the wall I want to grab that again duplicate.

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,170
I'm not going to use this as the basis for my roof piece.

70
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,700
So I'm going to call this roof as you can probably guess 45 degrees.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,140
I think that's the slope of the roof.

72
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm going to end up creating.

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,380
OK.

74
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,510
So we need to decide on the size again I'm going to stick to my four by four grid.

75
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:07,320
And this part here I'm just going to delete these two vertices here or essentially that edge.

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,520
By doing that I can then reconstruct what I want to make and we can base everything else off of that

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,660
slope just there in fact.

78
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:17,990
OK.

79
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,440
So we want everything to be on the positive side here.

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,700
So I'm going to grab this as it's here set.

81
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,350
That's a four on the y axis for here.

82
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:38,660
And then finally for the top 0 it means that for although it was already out for there.

83
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,060
Okay.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,290
So that's the rough shape that I want but I don't want the roof to be flat whilst I'm in there.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,550
So it's a matter I think of getting rid of these two faces

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,050
that's pretty good.

87
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,820
And going ahead and just hopefully producing the right side so let's look at this from the right angle

88
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,240
that we need.

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm going to go e to extrude the edge Z points to that's gone up which is fine I want to do the same

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,730
with this edge so e that point so I'm going to join those two together and then all being well I should

91
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,060
be able to do these as well.

92
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,160
Excellent.

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:41,670
I'm going to grab this lower edge here and I am going to extrude that not by much I point for recap

94
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,470
so that should match up and butts up against anything I need to rule 45 degrees.

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,840
Okay.

96
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,130
I think that's good.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,700
Let's go back into our building see and start thinking about bringing those pieces in and essentially

98
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,730
where they are going to be appearing.

99
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,160
I can see actually a couple of potential issues so I need to put in my my corner pieces and work out

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,980
where there's going to be so where would the roof piece go here.

101
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,540
Is there going to be a piece going in the end as well.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,230
So it's gonna be an extra piece needed if I'm not careful but the rest of this I think we can sort out

103
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,700
with our corner pieces.

104
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,120
So let's go back to our export scene go and grab our corner piece and our roof.

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm simply going to copy those and bring them straight into the building scene making sure in object

106
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,680
mode I can paste those two pieces in.

107
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,020
Okay.

108
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm concerned that one of them is just cold war but no it's not.

109
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,000
We've got our roof.

110
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,090
Let's go ahead and just have a look.

111
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,540
Okay so that's not going to work in our particular case.

112
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,020
Look at that slight issue.

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,090
But is supposed to be the other way around.

114
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,140
But regardless that's going to cause us a few issues.

115
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,860
So we definitely need to think about how this is going to be put together.

116
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,580
Anyway we've got a couple of corner pieces to be put in as well.

117
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:17,030
I'm I'm tempted here to go ahead and shift this out of the way grab all the slots and just move it up

118
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,620
and out of the way for the moment let's focus on the front door Let's rotate this round on the z axis

119
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,600
by 90.

120
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,820
Looks good.

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,730
Let's move it to the right location.

122
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,640
This is Oh I thought I had solved that perhaps I didn't.

123
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,100
Let's go in and sort that out.

124
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,710
So where should be over here by the looks of things.

125
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:50,540
Go ahead select the appropriate vertex shift an S cursor to select to come out right click set origin

126
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,250
to the 3d cursor.

127
00:08:52,340 --> 00:09:00,510
Okay so now we can fix that up what we think actually it's here we want but one massive shift that's

128
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,000
just selected.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,690
Easy to miss that comes through.

130
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

131
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,050
Which happens to be zero so we've got this bit here.

132
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:19,980
Let's go ahead and duplicate that along the x axis to here and then rotate it on the Z by 180.

133
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,160
Now not 180 is just 90 again.

134
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,690
Okay perfect.

135
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,830
So our building is going to take on a slightly different look now but we can see that we can actually

136
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,260
slot these pieces together.

137
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,130
We are lacking a few fundamentals here.

138
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,910
I completely forgot.

139
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,960
And it was just very fortunate that these numbers worked out but completely forgotten that lines up

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,890
here.

141
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,040
We of course have this overhang just here.

142
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,980
And of course this front piece we don't have a 45 degree front piece here either.

143
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,250
So there's a few things we all need to sort out but they can certainly wait for a bit.

144
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:05,680
Now I'm just going to as normal go through and reconstruct a building based upon this of course is going

145
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,540
to take me a few moments to do

146
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,190
okay everybody.

147
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,570
So I've patched together this so far and I've come across a few extra parts that I am going to need

148
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,330
I'm going to need some sort of filler parts if I want to keep this current style.

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,380
We've got the issue that the roof pieces themselves when it comes to an end piece.

150
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,640
We may need to have a special end piece because the wall comes out and of course the roof doesn't.

151
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,620
We've got a problem with the.

152
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,210
Not there not being a smaller roof piece.

153
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,210
So we can't bring this together at the top.

154
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,000
I think leaving like this is fine for the moment.

155
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,110
We don't have an end window.

156
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,400
Not a big issue I've just stretched one for the moment and I think it's just a smaller corner piece

157
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,600
as well that we also need if we have a look at here I don't mind the styling that's absolutely fine

158
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,520
it adds a bit of interest to the building but obviously we're just making do with the pieces we've got

159
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,330
at the moment.

160
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,400
So when we go into first person mode speed up my movement turn on gravity and have a look.

161
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Excellent.

162
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,330
I'm liking this.

163
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,140
It looks like a much better building.

164
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,690
The horrible Z fighting.

165
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,340
OK.

166
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,630
Let's also hop into rendered mode and just see how that is looking.

167
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,810
Z key rendered.

168
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,880
Wait for a few minutes to just refresh.

169
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,520
Now of course this is going to obviously take a while to get some information in there the lighting

170
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,740
information.

171
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,340
I think that's looking pretty good.

172
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,720
I think this could be a lot bigger.

173
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,110
Again it's a temporary piece.

174
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,910
Anyway what does it look like in eevee.

175
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,540
Probably a bit rubbish at the moment.

176
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,900
Yeah that looks very rubbish for the moment anyway.

177
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,410
It's definitely working better in cycles for me with the lights.

178
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,380
But we can talk about lighting and things like that later on when we make the scene look a bit better

179
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,770
in blender.

180
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,650
I remember things like lighting there actually handled by the game engine itself the things that we're

181
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,580
doing in blender with our lighting.

182
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,320
Well it will she transfer into any game engine.

183
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,210
It's really to give us a feel of how the buildings coming together how lights might interact within

184
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,860
the building as well.

185
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,130
Anyway I'm liking how miners coming together.

186
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,930
I'm probably going to have to make a few extra pieces but I don't want to commit to those just yet because

187
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,930
I certainly have a few extra things to put in our scene like the pillars etc. So the overall layout

188
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,480
may change again but I'm liking how it's now coming together really looking forward to seeing what you've

189
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
done with your buildings.

190
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,770
Did you have similar issues to me as you start building up your pieces and again.

191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,450
Oh no I needed a few more I might need an end piece or a corner an extra corner piece.

192
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:49,710
It's amazing how all of these suddenly starts appearing as you puts more detail into your model.

193
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,310
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all over in the next one.
