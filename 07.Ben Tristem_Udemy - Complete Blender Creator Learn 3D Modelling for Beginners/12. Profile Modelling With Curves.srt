00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,880
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:13,060
In this lecture instead of using extrusion we will use two curves in order to create our geometry that

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,690
has the advantage of being a lot smoother.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,980
As we go up and meet at the middle.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,890
In fact the curve will end up going all the way round.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,520
If we want it to so curves are a little bit weird.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,480
They don't always work very intuitively.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,070
So what we're going to do in order to simulate this first is hide our original archway that we've created

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,430
in fact we've not called it archway so let's do that archway.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,950
And we've also asked what anyway.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,480
And we've also not put it in the building part of our collections.

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,380
Okay.

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,160
So that's sort of the door mirror.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,790
She probably also put that in there as well.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,070
Okay.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,740
So are archway here.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,730
I'm going to put here extrusion rather than anything else.

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,190
Okay.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,740
And we go into take a copy of the base piece here so we can use it in our curve and you'll see it's

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,410
able to generate a much smoother transition but you'll also see that it doesn't quite follow the rules

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,930
you'd want it to.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,220
Now there are a couple of ways in which we can do this.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:27,210
I'm gonna go into edit mode and find the bottom face I'm going to duplicate it with shift and D I'm

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,370
then going to press pizza separator in separate of the selection.

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:39,390
Okay so let's convert this mesh object to a curve object it's an object operation so let's go back into

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,710
object mode object making sure we've got the archway curve selected and further down this list here

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,070
we go.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,240
Convert to now these are grade outs at the moment suggests I've got more than one thing selected and

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,230
we will want this one here we want to create curve from mesh so that's D select everything and then

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,420
just select our arch recurve if you noticed there the orange that was it was highlighted with was a

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:14,010
dark orange meaning it was selected but it wasn't the active objects are object convert to there we

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,510
go we now have these options available to us and convert from mesh to the curve we can see that over

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,540
in the outline itself we now have the curve icon there rather than the mesh icon that's brilliant so

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,930
we can hide away our extruded archway and look at our curve now it needs to follow something that's

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,750
the important thing here but it doesn't always work as you would expect it to we can do the same trick

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,090
on the archway itself so I'm not sure if I go to edge Select and Select this front face and yes unfortunately

37
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,250
it's selected everything but it's going to be quite quick holding down shift and just selecting these

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,460
outer edges.

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,420
So what I had done there was I selected the loop the edge loop running around and I just remove these

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,100
last edges so I can then do the same thing here so we can duplicate that has a nice path for our curve

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,880
to follow and then we can go ahead and separate that and once again we need to give it a name and I

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:24,830
will call this archway curve again direction no curve direct I'm gonna have to put something here direction

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,050
and the other one is the archway profile that's important profile there we go.

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,900
Now the curve direction is still a mesh objects at the moment so let's go into object mode once again

45
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,870
with that selected Look it's dark orange it's not going to work the doorway is currently active selected

46
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,930
items so let's click on archway go that light orange color we can go to object convert to curve okay

47
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:57,230
we now have two curves which is brilliant because we can go to the first curve the direction that we

48
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:05,000
want it to follow go to the curve properties and then we can scroll down a little and go to the geometry

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,880
tab.

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,450
Now this is really awesome because it enables us to pick an object to be the beveled type.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,150
So at the moment we can just increase the depth of the bevel and we get something like this happening

52
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,400
which is pretty awesome.

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:26,690
So you may think Okay brilliant or how about if I go ahead and select an object it's going to have to

54
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,490
be a curve and pick the archway profile hey would you look at that.

55
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,710
That's pretty awesome.

56
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:42,640
But then when you have a closer look at it you go Well hang on a minute why is that not going over what

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,440
I can see down there.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,970
Oh interesting.

59
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:53,340
And this is one of the issues that you'll run into that the curves position in our 3D world matters.

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,610
So what doesn't matter is obviously where the archway is.

61
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,750
That's absolutely fine.

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,280
You need to have a path to follow.

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
That's absolutely fine.

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,570
But the other bits this archway profile here if we move that in object mode it doesn't make a difference.

65
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,140
However it's position from the origin of the world does make a difference.

66
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,160
So if I was to go ahead in edit mode looks slightly different because it's a curve select everything

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,540
and then move it around you can see it makes a difference.

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,810
You can see I've got two objects in here so the mirror is working but it's all the way over here.

69
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,690
Well that seems quite odd.

70
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,750
And of course it is the wrong way round.

71
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,240
So this takes a bit of playing around with to get your head around.

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,280
But because a curve is a two dimensional object we have to treat it as if it exists only on the x y

73
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,780
plane and we can see right here that these are just in the wrong place at the moment and they're probably

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,380
rotated round incorrectly as well.

75
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,810
So not only do we have to consider the curve object that's making the three dimensional shape it's pretty

76
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,050
awesome then it goes straight into there like clouds.

77
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,990
But if we have a look at the archway curve direction that we've made let's make sure we've got nothing

78
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,890
else selected.

79
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,940
So the curve direction that comes round if we go into edit mode on that and select we've got a couple

80
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,060
of options under the properties panel so we can bring this open with the end key and we've got these

81
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,790
three options down at the bottom mean Telstra's going to be the interesting one look at that we can

82
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,740
rotate it round and we can get it's almost to match.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,800
So I think by moving it 90 degrees it looks like it lines up really well apart from this bit going across

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,110
the middle there's something funky happening there but there we go by moving the mean tale we've managed

85
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,480
to sort that's out but why is this bit going across here.

86
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,390
How is it being generated.

87
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,030
Well the plot thickens.

88
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,370
OK so let's go back to our archway profile and we can also rotate that's around as well.

89
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,140
Now I wouldn't recommend doing it around whatever I'm doing at the moment which looks like it's the

90
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,850
mirror point but let's change this to the medium point so I can rotate on the z axis and just move it

91
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:28,040
around so if we rotate it all the way around there that happens how about moving its Would you look

92
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,590
at that perhaps it needs to be over the middle here.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,150
There's many many ways that you can go around and fiddle with this and you know it's pretty awesome

94
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,860
some of the shapes that you can make.

95
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,220
I can imagine this right now working really well as the outside entrance way.

96
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,940
So do feel free to play lots and lots and one of the issues that we've got happening here right now.

97
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,390
You notice that it also doesn't matter on the z plane if I just shift this up and down on the Z.

98
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,790
It really doesn't matter.

99
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,950
That's what I was saying but you have to just think about it as a 2D object.

100
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,940
I really liked by accident.

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,190
When I'm trying to show you what's going on.

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,860
But yes this will vary but the reason we have this double arch is because we don't need both of these.

103
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,790
If you go back to what we had before we just had it going up and down.

104
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:30,560
But with two of them we go up and down twice which is why when we shift this back we're able to get

105
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,490
ourselves an arch here and a very big arch as well.

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,260
Notice that the distance the same distance we've just moved it.

107
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:45,440
So in order to clean this up one of these has to be deleted and you're probably guess is this one here

108
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,910
deleting that's away and delete the vertices there and there we go.

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,990
That's pretty awesome.

110
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,980
The great thing about this of course is it means that our profile is following the curve of the archway.

111
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,830
Exactly.

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,410
If we bring up the other one that we've done we can see that it doesn't look like it's at all in fact

113
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,490
it's a bit shorter than what we might have got otherwise.

114
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,760
And of course you can use this as a basis.

115
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,790
We could go in now to the archway.

116
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,200
Which one is it's heavy extrusion.

117
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:23,880
Go into edit mode and adjust these faces so that they more match the curvature of the door itself.

118
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,440
Again that's entirely up to you and kind of just artistic license at this point in time.

119
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,510
But there we go there's profile modelling using curves.

120
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,050
Very easy to end up with doubles everywhere if you're not careful.

121
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:45,170
And again we can shorten this and then mirror it if we want and indeed you can go from the curve that

122
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,860
we currently have here the archway curves direction which is this object here.

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,050
And what we can do is we can solidify that if we want to which is really cool.

124
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,660
We can then convert this whilst we're not in edit mode it's only half the curve direction so let's say

125
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,190
go objects and then we can convert to mesh from a curve and we can keep the original.

126
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:14,510
I like keeping the original because it gives you the choice to change it later on if you need to or

127
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,110
you can just hide out of the way.

128
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,060
But then we end up with a mesh object in our scene.

129
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,700
It's the only one here at the moment so we can focus on it.

130
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,850
And there we go we can then do mesh operations on this if we wanted to like I think actually the subdivisions

131
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,280
surface modifier works on both of them but there we go by smoothing it out and maybe right clicking

132
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,590
and shading smooth we end up with a completely different aesthetic and this will give you an idea of

133
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,540
smooth shading within perhaps a game engine that's very important.

134
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:52,910
In fact let's lower the oil viewport shading is fine at one subdivision that won't increase the geometry

135
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,790
count too much in fact down at the bottom here we can say well actually the archway being maybe twelve

136
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,590
hundred faces might be a little bit much for the level of detail we're getting so let's remove it and

137
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:10,490
have a look at what it looks like with only 320 you know there's a little bit of balancing to go backwards

138
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,640
and forwards and again there's no reason why you can't go subdivision surface modifier and then pick

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,540
something like that decimates.

140
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,280
Now this sounds really weird to put the two together if I wouldn't do I don't know.

141
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,640
You know we've got some back down to maybe half of it even though we're subdividing then and subdivide

142
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,920
perhaps picking one of these other options would be better.

143
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,060
It's entirely up to you how you approach this type of work and ultimately it's in your game design documents

144
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,710
as well.

145
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,930
What's your polygon budget.

146
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,570
And sometimes it doesn't matter.

147
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,440
Modern game engines can probably run this absolutely fine and there's not going to be too many of them

148
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,170
in your scene.

149
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,100
Of course it will look much better as well when we get around to texturing it's of course the one thing

150
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,390
looking at the bottom of our model that we need to be careful with with the curve is it leaves it's

151
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:09,110
hollow and we we might want it filled in this particular case of being a game asset you can probably

152
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,750
leave that how it is you're never going to see that hollow however let's go back to the curve for a

153
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,010
moment and here we go has a low resolution version that we've got.

154
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,130
You can fill in these if we go to the make sure it's selected the curve properties.

155
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,120
Now where were we.

156
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,510
Let's go to our bevel.

157
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,060
There's an option here to fill caps and that will fill these n pieces really really useful if perhaps

158
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,270
you're doing a cable and it terminates in your scene.

159
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,120
You probably do want the ends caps.

160
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,870
I'm going to leave it uncapped because it adds as if I toggle this on and off it adds around 36 faces

161
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,270
and their triangular faces because the tri counts is also going up by 36.

162
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,460
Okay.

163
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Awesome.

164
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm going to get rid of my mesh version of the archway so that select that and get rid of it and turn

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,210
back on my doorway.

166
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,760
Excellent.

167
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,060
Now if you have gone ahead using the curves and it made an awesome doorway please do share it over and

168
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,260
the discussions are really look forward to seeing it.

169
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,550
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
