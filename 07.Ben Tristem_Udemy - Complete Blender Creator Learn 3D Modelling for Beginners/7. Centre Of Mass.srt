1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,640
Welcome to the centre of mass.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,130
So where is the centre of mass and what is it.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,680
Well it is where ever the origin is.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,220
Blender uses the origin as the centre of mass.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,330
Now that means you have control over all over this which isn't always a good thing.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,250
If you've inadvertently constructed something away from the genome bit from the origin itself that geometry

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,230
is going to act very weird.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,540
When you start applying physics to it so it can lead to some strange results.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,920
Now they might be desirable depending on the type of thing that you're doing.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,390
Now blender can calculate for us the centre of the mass and you've probably seen this before when we

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,670
move the origin to the centre of mass.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,310
Now in most object that's going to pretty much put it in the middle unless you've got a lopsided object

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,190
in which case you'd want to adjust the centre of mass so it behaved realistically when it comes to physics.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Now let's go ahead and hop on over into blender and play with the Centre of Mass.

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,240
Hey so welcome over into blender.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,570
Now at this point we're going to focus on something very similar to the wall you saw that the tank was

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,940
breaking through earlier.

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,290
But we're going to build it up from scratch.

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,090
So in order to do that we're going to use a raise.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,040
So my first mini challenge for you is to pause a video and go ahead and make a wall.

21
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,290
This isn't going to be one of those major challenges but this is a mini mini challenge.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,270
Challenge yourself to build a wall made of standard size bricks if you will or a pretty standard ratio

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,910
of bricks you don't have to worry too much about the size at the moment.

24
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,170
So go ahead pause video now and give that a quick go.

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,290
Okay now did you give that challenge a go.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,710
It's very important to practice your skills.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,910
Now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to build up my wall super quick here.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,390
I'm literally going to scale in the y direction my break by half and scale it's in the z direction by

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,140
half.

30
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,930
I'm going to go to the control not the control panel sorry the Properties window for the 3D editor and

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,070
shift it up by point five.

32
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,470
So I've got my brick here.

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,180
Finally I'm going to apply scale now because we're working with physics.

34
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,850
It's good if things are the right size from the beginning.

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,580
Now I'm going to shift this across a little over here and I'm going to add a ground plane in and whilst

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,550
I'm at it.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,100
And you might not have done this because I didn't ask you to create a black a ground plane that's absolutely

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,770
fine you can pop one in now is your following along.

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,440
I've added a ground plane I'm going to make sure I start saving my work and can as save as wall because

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,210
we're going to start applying physics and physics can crash blender occasionally.

41
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,570
Now whilst I've actually got selected I'm going to go ahead and apply the scale that I've just bumped

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,060
that floor up to four and whilst I'm here I'm also going to apply a rigid body and make it passive because

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,990
the wall needs somewhere to stand.

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,020
Now with the array itself I'm going to use 10 bricks and then build it up from there.

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,600
So let's go ahead and add an array and if I'm happy with how it looks let's go to 10 of them.

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,560
Okay let's shift over here a little so it's more in the middle.

47
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,900
Excellent I'm happy with that.

48
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,240
Apart from the gap in between I'm going to go for one point one nine bit big so I'm going to go for

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,710
one point not five.

50
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,010
That looks much better.

51
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:32,050
Okay so that's my first array am now going to a race a race so relative offset I'm going to say that's

52
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,090
a zero for the moment and says Z to one and I'm going to just going to zoom in here so I can see the

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,290
relative gaps now because my brick is half as high as it is wide.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,500
I should imagine that the relative offset here if we said it's a point 0 5 like the other one we are

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,010
going to end up with a gap that's half the size which has happened so by go one point one.

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,730
We've then got a nice gap between here let's say for the mortar or anything along those lines.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,880
And it's a good idea to keep an idea.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,230
Or it's certainly an eye on these numbers that we've used because we're going to use them in a bit for

59
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,120
the margins for physics.

60
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,900
Okay so now I have done that I just need the offset in the x direction by wellpoint one would be one

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,530
brick because there are 10 bricks so I won half a point once again open in 0 5.

62
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,020
Okay so that's the first stage and the second stage of the wall down and now it should be a matter of

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,740
just offsetting in the z direction going up.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,360
Now that is too big.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,420
So that again that's point nor a one point not 5.

66
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,230
Excellent.

67
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,420
In fact if we go to prospective mode we can see it from the side and that looks even which is nice.

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,700
So orthographic MO go from perspective mode and we can use a couple and make it super high.

69
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,370
We wanted so that's fine with me.

70
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,480
In fact we could link this together and build a building but I'm going to leave it as a wall for the

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,110
moment.

72
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,930
Now looking at that the ground is far too small some deerskin to scale it up a little bit more and apply

73
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,840
that scale.

74
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,590
Okay so now we've got this wall on this ground.

75
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,780
We've got a basis to work from there.

76
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,630
If I go ahead and apply physics to this whole wall you probably guessed the ball was going to move as

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,870
one object with its centre of mass.

78
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,810
Interestingly enough all the way over here so that's not where the centre of mass of this would be at

79
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,430
all it would be somewhere in the middle of the wall.

80
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,160
And if we go ahead and run the physics engine it just wobbles because already sat on the ground.

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,690
If we were to just let's say for argument's sake lift the wall up so it was up here and then dropped

82
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:53,570
it onto the ground rules see that again you saw there it twinged or twinged around that centre there

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,510
so that's wrong.

84
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,740
That's just wrong.

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,620
It's not going to work like that in real life.

86
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,570
So we need to separate out all these bricks.

87
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:07,850
Now it is important at this point to remove the physics from the break itself.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,460
Otherwise when you try and move the origin and stop that from bouncing around if you try when we go

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,880
to if we scroll down here and set the origin to the centre of mass Well it's not going to work is all

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,870
based around here.

91
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,190
And of course at the moment we still got all the array modifiers UN applied.

92
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,950
Now remember to turn this off some going to do that now.

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,220
And I'm also going to save my work that is always important.

94
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:40,070
If I use the right shortcut keys ever get up save my work and I'm ready to do a challenge.

95
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,330
But before we get on to that challenge I just want to run through with you really quickly a small change

96
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,880
that's happened since this video's been recorded.

97
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,920
Has it jumped forward now to two point seven.

98
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,530
This is the end state of what you'll be going for.

99
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,570
And of course when we go ahead and set the origin we have a few different options.

100
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,650
We've got set the origin to the centre of mass by the surface or by the volume.

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,250
Now in general unless you've got a reason to do so I would recommend using the volume itself.

102
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,100
So there we go.

103
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,830
And in this case because they are cuboid us it's going to be the same no matter which one you pick anyway.

104
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,410
But just to say there's two separate options there.

105
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,550
In general I would pick volume unless you've got a reason to pick surface.

106
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,070
Now here comes your challenge.

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,070
I would like you to go ahead and create a physically stable wall so.

108
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,640
So basically one doesn't fall over or explode on us one not yet anyway.

109
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,140
So all bricks should be individual so they can be acted upon individually.

110
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:49,410
Now move the centre of mass for each brick to the right location at the moment is all focussed around

111
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,850
that original brick and that's going to end well that's going to cause some interesting results and

112
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,830
we'll certainly throw the bricks around something crazy.

113
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,050
If he had chaske leave it where it is you might want to just try where it is currently.

114
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,660
Just to see the effects.

115
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:12,090
If you want to take it so they should rest on some invisible mortar or gap that matches the existing

116
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,720
gap.

117
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:20,400
So when you add the rigid body to the actual bricks themselves remember to include a margin so that

118
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,620
the bricks essentially float on top of one another.

119
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,330
But that is to imitate more to being in between them so they're slightly separated.

120
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,110
Now make all the bricks have the same physical properties.

121
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,270
And remember you can do that in one fell swoop rather than doing it individually.

122
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,760
If you start playing about with bricks and given them slightly different properties that's fine.

123
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,230
That could add to the realism of a scene but it be good to have a starting point where they're all identical.

124
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,370
There may be some instances where you'd want to change that but not in this case.

125
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,470
So go ahead post a video now and give that a go.

126
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,910
Okay guys welcome back.

127
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,470
Let's go ahead and create a physically stable wall.

128
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay so we left off over here with our wall as individual items.

129
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,670
Now I'm going to go ahead straightaway and hop into edit mode.

130
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,700
And of course we've got all of these bricks.

131
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,780
Well no actually we can't do that.

132
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,150
I'm getting ahead of myself.

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,440
You see because they aren't individual bricks.

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,090
They're in a ray at the moment all silly me.

135
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm applying my array in the wrong order so apply from the bottom up.

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,740
We go and the final array.

137
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,430
Okay so now when we go into edit mode there we go we've got all individual bricks now let's go ahead

138
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,520
and separate them by loose parts because they're not connected anywhere at all.

139
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,670
We can just literally separate them apart.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,210
Now that we've done that we can well literally apply physics to them.

141
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,590
So in order to do that there are a couple of things that I'm going to do to make my life easier so I

142
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,080
can select them all every time is I'm going to turn off selection for the camera and I'm going to turn

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,960
off selection for these these items here just in case I managed to select them.

144
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,840
The lamp as well and the playing I don't want to be selecting the floor and changing its properties.

145
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,270
Now whenever I select all I should be selecting in object mode I'll be selecting only these mesh objects

146
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,640
themselves and nothing else.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,530
Literally nothing else in the sinkers and nothing else selectable ho case.

148
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,180
Now we've done that we've got all of these bricks selected and an active selected brick.

149
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,530
So the one that's active is the one that's going to take on the rigid body and it was actually the furthest

150
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,260
one away from here so if we go ahead and well basically play that.

151
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,490
We will see once the it starts it falls down and does something weird when it hits the floor.

152
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,560
It does something weird it gets dragged along because its centre of gravity is actually passing beneath

153
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,890
the plane itself so it's actually being pulled in line with it.

154
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,260
I think we're going to need some more frames.

155
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,200
Anyway I'm going to go up to one hundred fifty so you can see here.

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,300
He gets pulled in so it's directly above that and then scoots around the surface so it's worthwhile

157
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,060
knowing that that centre of gravity will be funny when we apply it to the rest of this.

158
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,040
And let's do that.

159
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,630
It's all going to be sucked into this one place here.

160
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,830
So good to go to the physics tab and copy from active.

161
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,380
And will we do that the whole thing boils down and all gets sucked into one place.

162
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,320
Yay.

163
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,610
That might be here a.

164
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,630
Awesome effective a portal opened up and you wanted it to be pulled into one place.

165
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,160
Well that isn't what I want to happen here.

166
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,160
I want them to be individual.

167
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,550
So in order to do that I'm actually well kind of stuck here because I've just applied physics to everything

168
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,050
and I can't unsupplied physics to everything without undoing so I am just going to undo.

169
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,600
In this case another case in point for saving is that you don't want to end up doing a ton of work and

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,290
then having it ruined or stop the playback for the moment and reset it to zero.

171
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,780
And now I'm going to remove the rigid body from that can select everything again and then whilst we're

172
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,070
in object mode and it gives the tool shelf and I'm going to set the origins of the centre of mass now

173
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,840
because there are now separate objects and it's got no physics applied.

174
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,520
There you go.

175
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,760
Everything's now got its own centre of mass.

176
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,290
Let's add a rigid body to the active one and then go into the physics tab copy from the active one to

177
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,230
everything else.

178
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,390
And of course hit play says go ahead and hit the right keys.

179
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,680
Now well that's actually dropping from quite a height.

180
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,590
We did play with that earlier.

181
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,000
So let's set that back down to zero.

182
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,300
Does that make a difference.

183
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,020
No.

184
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,280
No of course it doesn't.

185
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,950
So let's move everything back down here.

186
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,830
Case looking at this.

187
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,320
What have we move moved with just moved this one down.

188
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,720
So that's Paul.

189
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,120
I don't know where it was before some was going to have to undo to that's in the right place.

190
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,730
Okay so everything there is at the beginning of the scene and now removing the whole block as a whole.

191
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,310
That looks like it's now on the surface again.

192
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
That's what whilst were in orthographic maybe can confirm that.

193
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,020
Perfect and let's run the physics simulation.

194
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:13,080
Now the moment the bricks drop on top of one another which is fine but we need to leave a gap for mortar.

195
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,440
Now we remember earlier we had a margin something to enable collision collision margin and I'm going

196
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,410
to set it to nought point five.

197
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:31,160
I think that was what we had before and well Convex Hull is not working so I'm going to try mesh K mesh

198
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:38,120
isn't working quite as I expected to either stop the physics simulation here and rewind and just see

199
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,950
if that makes difference.

200
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,680
K It is not making a difference which is surprising.

201
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,010
I thought it would have done up the margin now to 1 hour you know whats happening.

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,990
Tony forgot to apply from the active side to copy from active.

203
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,080
So going down that point.

204
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,340
Well let's actually be funny.

205
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,020
Let's set it a point five and I'm going to hit copy from active.

206
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,140
Boom.

207
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:05,060
The bricks are literally so confined together that they literally explode.

208
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,170
Now that's not the faked we're going for although it is quite interesting so let's try.

209
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,220
Nope.

210
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,040
The point oh five again.

211
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,970
And then copy from active that's important and how it's not being crazy anymore.

212
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,590
Let's go around to the front again and zoom in.

213
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,110
That is that gap right.

214
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,930
It is.

215
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,170
And you could see they're kind of jostling and floating on top of one another almost as if there was

216
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,410
a magnetic field around them.

217
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,560
That's a bump that up to 150 again.

218
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,500
And this brick is toppling away.

219
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,100
Oh.

220
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,570
Well hey the whole thing falls over eventually.

221
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,700
So it's not inherently stable at that point.

222
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,440
But we can tweak the physics settings in the bit to improve that.

223
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,470
Okay so after a few minutes of confusion the wall just kept falling down and I thought well hang on

224
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,380
a minute all my trial runs that I've done this has not happened so.

225
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,810
But the other thing I did do is make the wall explode violently.

226
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,430
So perhaps something ahead crashed.

227
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,280
I remembered some of the physics of a splosion and was toppling for some reason.

228
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,630
Now I don't understand why it would do that.

229
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,130
But it turned out that going down to the shape itself and switching it from mesh to Convex Hull I thought

230
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,590
at first.

231
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,090
Okay.

232
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,890
I just picked the wrong colation shape.

233
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,950
But when switching it directly back to mesh again well what happened.

234
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,240
Well it was still working okay so this is a case in point that sometimes the physics can get a little

235
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,540
bit confused.

236
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:37,060
So switching the collisions shape can almost reset the physics engine itself and do some recalculations.

237
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,700
And literally after switching between those two it started working again.

238
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,370
One of the things you can do when this thing is moving is if I grab a brick and move it.

239
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,470
Well it really starts throwing things about course it resets.

240
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,250
So after sorting that out.

241
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,110
That seems to have fixed everything.

242
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,180
The other thing of course that we need to sort of figure out at this point and we can have a look at

243
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,200
this brick that's tumbling is does it look like a break when it hits the ground.

244
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,170
Is it too bouncy.

245
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,530
Not particularly bouncy but it does slide a little.

246
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,940
So let's go ahead and sort that out so I'm going to go ahead and select everything again.

247
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,640
And we need an active Brecken let's use the one that's falling.

248
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,330
So select everything after selecting the active one.

249
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,210
And let's go ahead and have a look at physics properties.

250
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,570
So it's got strong friction.

251
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,490
And if we set the bouncing to one as we've discovered before it's a combination of both.

252
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,080
The floor itself the floors properties.

253
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,990
And this here we discover that in the last lecture.

254
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,940
So we don't want any bounciness because bricks don't bounce.

255
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,380
I'm going to up this number again.

256
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,540
The resistance to translation and a little bit of resistance to rotation see if that makes the break

257
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,090
just a little more.

258
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,700
Yeah that looks a bit better.

259
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,200
And of course up here the mass of the brick.

260
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,850
Now these bricks are quite large.

261
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,270
They're not to scale.

262
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,410
That's certainly the fact there are whole metre long.

263
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,100
She's huge.

264
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,800
That brick is not going to weigh one kilogram.

265
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,840
It's going to weigh significantly more so let's say it weighs 10 kilos.

266
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,920
And let's see how it tumbles from the wall at this point of course is going to do more damage as it

267
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,650
does.

268
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,460
But that feels like that brick now has more substance to it.

269
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,480
So of course that's actually apply that to all the rest of the bricks as well.

270
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,660
And they should now be inherently more stable anyway because they're a bit heavy for their size.

271
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:35,080
If we set Well let's do it let's set the mast to point one so we've got a 10 Gramp now 100 gram break

272
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,690
and then copy from Active's of the whole wall is like this.

273
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,130
It it's not going to come to a complete stop when it lands.

274
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,350
In fact if we make it even smaller you see it doesn't even affect bricks at this point.

275
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,850
So that set back up to 10.

276
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,820
Now here's a good example because those bricks don't weigh anything anymore.

277
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,730
They were 100 grams and this weighs ten thousand grams.

278
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,080
You can see the effect it's having on the wall it's actually shifting the entire lot sideways as it

279
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,950
falls because it's so much heavier than the rest of the water.

280
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,960
Now of course at this point I'm going to copy from active again to the whole wall and now you have to

281
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,130
wait for the physics engine to reset of course go back to the beginning and there we go.

282
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,110
There's the one brick tumbling to oblivion because it's got no support.

283
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,820
Excellent.

284
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,670
So how did you guys get on did you manage create a wall that was stable.

285
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,440
Do you have any problems like I came across and have to troubleshoot.

286
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,590
Please share your falling walls in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
