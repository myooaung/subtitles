OK so before we get into editing this stuff let's have a quick rundown of how the 3D world works.
1

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.210
You have points in this 3D world called vertices or one vertex.
2

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.890
These can be connected together with lines or edges.
3

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.040
Once you've connected at least three together in a closed loop this is called a polygon which can define
4

5
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.690
a flat surface or in blender a face.
5

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.910
Many of these faces interconnected and joined together form our 3D structures.
6

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.960
Of course this is not quite what we're used to seeing yet.
7

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.860
We need to shade in our models and then if a flat surface is not what we're looking for we can turn
8

9
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.340
on smooth shading in various ways which is something we are working towards.
9

10
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.190
And then we need to define how light is reflecting off of the surface.
10

11
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.850
And we do that with what's called a material.
11

12
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.320
And the materials don't have to be a plain color.
12

13
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.990
You can apply further textures to any object to make it look realistic.
13

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.270
OK.
14

15
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.090
So now we have that background there that gives us a fundamental understanding of what we're about to
15

16
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.730
start manipulating editing and moving around.
16

17
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.230
When we start editing our vertices edges and faces over in Blender.
