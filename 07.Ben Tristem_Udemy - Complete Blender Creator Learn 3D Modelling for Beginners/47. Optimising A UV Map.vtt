Welcome to optimizing a U.S. map.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.250
In this video you will be using blender render.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.330
So even though we're doing our full renders in cycles for the actual text just set up an newey mapping

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.240
we're going to use Blender render because it gives us a real time view in the viewport which is far

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.170
better than waiting for cycles to render out.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.130
We're going to be making your UV map more uniform.

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.520
So making sure that we're minimizing distortion and optimizing the image use We're going to be understanding

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.400
the use of margins and how they are important.

9
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.260
And then we're going to learn more about seams and their placement.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.880
So let's now hop straight on over into blender.

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.050
Okay so back over in blender what's we going to do is we're going to experiment with optimizing our

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.670
You've V maps not on our church scene but on something a bit more complicated.

13
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.610
So I'd like you to go ahead and make sure you've saved your work of course and go ahead and open up

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.180
a new blender file.

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.480
We are going to go ahead and delete that default cube and add something a bit more interesting to work

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.930
with.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.220
And we're going to add a mesh and the monkey and the monkey's name is Suzanne.

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.030
Now that we've got Suzanne in the scene what we can do is straightaway apply a uniform texture across

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
this model so we can see how that texture is being distorted.

20
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.380
So we need to be in blender render to do this some kind of changed my rendering type to blend a render.

21
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.070
I'm going to just pull this area out here and change it to the U V.

22
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.910
Ed So there we go.

23
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.140
So let's go ahead and first of all let's go and unwrap our monkey without any seams or anything.

24
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.170
And we can see there that it is quite a horrible unwrap.

25
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.310
I think this area in the middle of this splodge is the face.

26
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.470
However it's not particularly clear in some areas are quite open they're all packed together really

27
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.130
tightly.

28
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.320
So I think there's going to be reflected in it when we actually come to apply the texture so let's do

29
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.190
that now let's click on new for a new texture and this time I'm going to leave on Main this actually

30
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.150
under name at u v grid and the generated type I'm going to switch to you v grid and click okay.

31
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.860
Now this gives us a a uniform texture a unique grid across our entire model and this will help us identify

32
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.420
areas of distortion.

33
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.730
We can't see it on here at the moment.

34
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450
Oh we could if we went textured view.

35
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.430
But the problem with going to textured view is that huge car it's shadowed as well which makes it difficult

36
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.150
to see.

37
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.530
So there's something else that you can do and that's enabled textures in solid mode.

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.710
So in the 3D editor properties pain which you can open with any if it's not open already.

39
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.540
Scroll down to where it says shading.

40
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.750
Now the moment the option won't be there because we're not in solid mode.

41
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.050
So let's go ahead and switch to solid mode.

42
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.310
And what we're looking for textured solid will appear brilliant Now we can see the chequers on there

43
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.510
and I'm going to hide tool shelf and the properties window.

44
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.480
Zoom in a little and hop into object mode so we've not got the mesh all the edges and vertices appearing

45
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.660
and we can see here that we've got a bit of a problem.

46
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.950
We've got some areas like around this I where it's really compressed where these squares are very very

47
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.870
small.

48
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.330
However around the back of the head we've got oh dear we've got one square almost taking up the entire

49
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.160
back of a head.

50
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.960
So there's a lot of distortion going on there now make it very difficult to do anything with that texture

51
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.870
in fact it will be stretched and distorted over the place.

52
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.170
So how can we make that better.

53
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.410
Well the good use of seams will help with this.

54
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.220
So let's go and split Suzanne and unwrap her.

55
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.110
Now one of the best ways of unwrapping a head is going down the back because the back is not the focus

56
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.700
point.

57
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.520
So if we go from this edge here and just go backwards I would select an edge loop but I would end up

58
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.070
having to undo a load of edges rather than adding them.

59
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.100
So I prefer in this case to add them themselves so we have got a continuous edge around to the bottom

60
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.200
of the chin.

61
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.300
So let's go ahead and mark that as a seam.

62
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.050
Select everything again and unwrap and let's have a look at how it changes.

63
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.960
For a start I can see the susanne's face on the yuva unwrap and not only that but the model itself the

64
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.370
squares on it are much more uniform.

65
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.390
It's a little bit of distortion around these.

66
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.210
I still am but it's much much better.

67
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.150
Much more uniform.

68
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.530
Now you can see the one of the problems with generating a seam down the model is there is some distortion

69
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.340
where the two halves meet and it can be very challenging to make sure that these two halves actually

70
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.420
match up.

71
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.440
Alas that is a topic for another day.

72
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.860
So now we've got this looking a bit more uniform as a couple of other things that we could go ahead

73
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.400
and do we could separate the ears and make them their own you v map and we can certainly add a few more

74
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.110
seems to help break this apart but this gives you a good idea of how to start optimizing the layout

75
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.020
of any euv Map.

76
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.020
Now having a look at the U.S. map itself over here what we can do is start doing some extra bits and

77
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.570
bobs.

78
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.400
So in the uv's menu there are a series of options which can help with distortion.

79
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.660
So one of the thing is packing islands now the islands themselves are these individual items so the

80
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.040
eyes of Suzanne are two separate items as is the rest of the head.

81
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.070
So what.

82
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.130
We can do is change the distance between those.

83
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.440
And this is very important when it comes to games because you can end up with some horrible effects

84
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.760
happening if these margins aren't big enough.

85
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.400
So what we can do here is just increase this just ever so slightly.

86
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.230
And in the.

87
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.090
Operator panel.

88
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.920
And you do have to do this in 3D Ed head.

89
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.140
We can change the margin and you can also do that when you originally unwrap as well.

90
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.460
And you can see that moves the actual eyes away from the rest of the model over in a bit.

91
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.460
When we come to painting that can be incredibly useful.

92
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:33.020
You also get this as I was saying when you actually go and do the unwrap we have a margin there as well.

93
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.800
So once you've played with those options there are a couple of other things that you can do so you can

94
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.990
pack the islands and that tries to optimize the space on your image via these islands.

95
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.840
And then we can also go ahead and average the island scale now doesn't look like that's going to do

96
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.110
much in this case.

97
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.070
But if these AIs themselves were much much larger on this yuva unwrap than the rest of the model was

98
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.920
it will help average outs of the squares are more uniform across our model.

99
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.830
Another option for us is minimizing stretch with control and V.

100
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.770
And you can use the scroll wheel there to go backwards and forwards and this can help control the model

101
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.560
itself.

102
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:22.480
Now at the moment it looks like a blend of one is a good option for us there and we can also see down

103
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.190
at the bottom there we can use the plus and minus skis.

104
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.950
I'm presuming I don't have my number pad with me today.

105
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.520
That's probably the number pad to go plus a minus and move in and out.

106
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.130
Looking at the U.S. map itself it's certainly better looking like that Brilliant's a one final thing

107
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.250
to consider when you're placing scenes.

108
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.950
Now can you identify where the seam is on the model.

109
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.170
So this is going down the back of a head.

110
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.720
So if I was to highlight a particular face as I am going to switch to face select let's say this face

111
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.140
here if I was to highlight that particular face would you be able to tell me where on the model it actually

112
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.960
was.

113
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.560
If you can't if you can't easily work that out so obviously sometimes you do have to think about it

114
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.180
a little.

115
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.560
If you can't easily work that out then it might be challenging later on when you're trying to apply

116
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.850
textures or even more detail to the model itself.

117
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.460
So it's important that you unwrap not only to minimize the distortion that you can have and make your

118
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:31.480
U.S. map more uniform but also so it's clear for you to work with so you're not spending your time trying

119
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.950
to work out what's going on.

120
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.160
So with that in mind.

121
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.680
I've got a challenge for you guys.

122
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.770
I would like you to optimize your current unwraps So pick an object and check it's unwrap.

123
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.250
If it's something you haven't unwrapped yet then you can start afresh and make sure as optimized from

124
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:57.230
the beginning load in the UVA texture image texture to check for distortions on your model.

125
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.230
So go ahead.

126
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.560
Balls are video now and give that a go.

127
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.320
Okay guys welcome back.

128
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.900
Let's go optimize a V unwrap.

129
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.490
Okay welcome back to blender so I've decided to work on my pillow over.

130
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.910
Gone.

131
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.390
Al colon so I'm going to hop into object mode here so I can see what's going on now.

132
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.380
I'm not sure.

133
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.020
In fact I'm going to hop into edit mode select everything and unwrap it.

134
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.520
I'm going to use a smart U project to see what I get with that.

135
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.470
I don't think I've actually unwrapped this one at all yet so it'll be a good practice right from the

136
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:40.760
very beginning and I'm going to add a new image here and I'm going to use the generated type here euv

137
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:48.250
Grid and click okay so this will give us a good indication on our model here of how it's looking.

138
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.790
So let's go in to text mode here and just see how that is working.

139
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.180
Are not applied this yet so bear with me a few moments.

140
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:05.760
Let's go sign a new material and I'm good to set the colour as an image colour.

141
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.970
Could go round and do it this way and tight.

142
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.650
There we go.

143
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:18.860
So I'm not seeing much on when I've got it in edit mode because of all the all the edges highlighted

144
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.570
etc. Some of them hop out of that and just go round the model and see how it's unwrapped.

145
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.130
Now smart TV projects here may actually do everything that we want it to so there's always the chance

146
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.650
that I don't need to do anything more.

147
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.500
Now this area around the top here strikes me as highly distorted.

148
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.200
We can see it's got loads of joins in it slows a little.

149
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.840
Suppose a forwards in on itself.

150
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.430
But actually I'm not too fussed about that and the reason for that is quite simply you're not going

151
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.780
to see it.

152
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.910
And that is the best place for distortion if there is any where no one's going to spots it.

153
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.510
So let's have a look along here.

154
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.110
So this looks okay.

155
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.290
These squares all of an equal size.

156
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.540
Let's scroll down a little.

157
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.880
Hit the right key.

158
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.360
Pan down rather than scroll.

159
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.460
Case of that is looking okay around there as well.

160
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.700
We can see there's a scene.

161
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.690
I don't think that's going to cause us any particular issues.

162
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:26.480
In fact there's a lot of seams around the bottom so this is one of the places where I can take an opportunity

163
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.590
to perhaps create a new set of scenes and running straight down the middle so it can peel open.

164
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:40.070
I'm going to give that a go now so going to hop into edit mode and if I have preserved my hedge loops

165
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.630
I'd be able to select all the way up.

166
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.940
In one fell swoop.

167
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.640
Unfortunately when I did this in setting that did break that functionality.

168
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:59.120
However I should with a bit of care be able to continue all the way up the model and select the wrong

169
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.690
edge.

170
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.180
There on that one there so I think that's all join together relatively well go all the way up the top

171
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.410
so no use control an E and Mark a scene.

172
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:16.040
Now I'm hoping what this will do is unwrap it and fold it round relatively concisely So let's just have

173
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.760
a look at the U.S. map.

174
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.750
Okay so we might need to do something else here.

175
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:26.270
I don't know whether it's meeting at the top that looks like it needs to be cut open and separated so

176
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.770
it's not pinching but more importantly what does that do to the actual texture of our object to distort

177
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.720
it massively or not.

178
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.120
So that looks obviously much better at the top.

179
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.180
Now this flowing round really well we've only got the one seam around our model so we won't have too

180
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.910
much distortion going on.

181
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.740
So at the top there looks okay and does the bottom look okay well as we can see on the bottom we've

182
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:58.700
got some well as drastically different size squares here so we've got this these ones here and those

183
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:06.010
are kind of similar but these ones on the bottom and that is very much distorted.

184
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:11.640
So what we can do here is again hopping back in forward to and from edit mode.

185
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.900
I'm going to decide where to cut these off and I'm going to see if I can select the first stage loop.

186
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.980
There we go around the middle there and then add another seam in it and that's just going to completely

187
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.530
separate it all together I can select everything and unwrap again.

188
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.140
Or of course in the U V image editor I can just hit E and it will unwrap again.

189
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.480
And that's starting to look well.

190
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.360
It looks much better here and looking at the model itself these squares seem to be a little less distorted.

191
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.540
Again they are going round and pinching and I just wonder if that's because of the base here.

192
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.700
Well that looks okay.

193
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.730
OK again on the bottom here we can see they're nice and big.

194
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.090
Which is great but we're not going to see it.

195
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.160
So you don't really need to concern ourselves with that so that's looking much much better now.

196
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.250
I don't think I need to do anything around the top here.

197
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:07.390
But again if I wanted to try and minimize this pinching going on I could select a particular edgerley

198
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.290
and select one that's lower down.

199
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.390
Mark that as a seam.

200
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:17.690
So Mark seen they're now going to go to the very top here and Mark the very top edge as a seam and what

201
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.860
that would do is basically separate it into its own circle and that will prevent the pinching all together.

202
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.550
It's going to mark that as a seam and I'm going to do the same.

203
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.630
Down the bottom.

204
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.310
Now of course you have to be careful if you make too many seams because it can make things a little

205
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.810
harder to handle.

206
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.550
And we certainly don't want to make things more difficult for us some select this edgeley Running on

207
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.180
the bottom.

208
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.940
And also Mark that as a seam and this will be the final one that I do for the moment.

209
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.700
London to highlight everything and unwrap it and we can see there that we now we've actually got much

210
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.550
more uniform size squares that works out tremendous there.

211
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.370
That's fine and up the top here as well.

212
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.420
So that's brilliant.

213
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.300
Actually taking this step at a time and moving forward a little bit at a time.

214
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.170
Certainly we've progressed much quicker and taking things section by section rather than trying to do

215
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.450
the whole lot at once.

216
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.410
Do a little bit see how that affects the unwrap.

217
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.530
Continue doing that and cutting it up logically.

218
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.970
Imagine you had a 3D object in front of you.

219
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.560
You had to try and slice it.

220
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.720
That's what all these scenes are about.

221
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.940
And obviously when we put the scenes in the right place we end up with minimal distortion to the actual

222
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.520
underlying texture.

223
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.970
How did you guys get on.

224
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:37.750
I hope you manage to optimize your u v maps and of course I will see you guys in the next lecture.
