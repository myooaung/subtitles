Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to get the chance to play with origins
1

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,870
and position things exactly where we want them.
2

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,540
If we have a look at our three pawns in front of us here.
3

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,670
The one on the left hand has its origin smack bang on the bottom.
4

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,360
This one has its in its center of mass.
5

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,570
And this one is over here in the head of another pawn or almost there.
6

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,100
So there are various reasons why you might want origins in different places.
7

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,730
And it is important to select the right one for what you are doing and trying to accomplish at the time.
8

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,830
And also knowing that you can move the origin around to your heart's content depending on what you're
9

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,830
trying to do.
10

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,560
And this is especially important.
11

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,900
For instance if you're working with someone else or yourself and exporting to a game engine you may
12

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,150
need to have your origin in a very specific place.
13

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,210
That's not where you'd naturally have it's when creating your model.
14

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,890
Let's find out more.
15

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,260
OK.
16

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,050
So let's start off with our pawn that we've got here because there's lots of things that we can do.
17

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,870
The first thing I want to show you.
18

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,470
We've covered it briefly going past it's in the past but this time I want to really hone in on it.
19

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,980
If we select an object and right click on it it brings up the object context menu which has in it the
20

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,980
set origin and we've got a series of options as to where we can place that which is really awesome.
21

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,010
And we've covered these before.
22

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,900
The important thing to realize here is that the origin is not only the position of this object in the
23

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,580
world but it is also used for physics calculations as well.
24

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,720
So you may have it in one place when you're constructing your model and move it to another.
25

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,080
When you start calculating physics and being able to interchange between the two is important.
26

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,030
So at the moment we know that we've set this up at the very beginning to have its origin at the center
27

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,050
but perhaps you've missed that step and inadvertently made your model with the origin elsewhere.
28

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,320
I mean for instance let's look at this from the side.
29

30
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,810
You could have built everything around there so if I go into edit mode I can move the mesh data independently
30

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,130
and let's just say I move it down on the Z axis to roughly there.
31

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,370
Now the downside of this is if we were to make several pieces, let's duplicate this object a couple
32

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,550
of times and duplicate it once more.
33

34
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,870
Okay so let's say this one here was going to be let's scale it up by one point three three.
34

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,260
Just like we did before then scale on the Z axis by one point two or something.
35

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,090
So that's our place holder Bishop for instance.
36

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,170
Now you can immediately see one of the issues here.
37

38
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,080
How do I align all of these bases.
38

39
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,350
Sure you can go up here and use the snapping tool, we can turn on the snapping tool and go to face select
39

40
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:57,880
and then hope that as we whiz around here if I've got this selected and go G and Z just lock it in the
40

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Z axis and snap it to there hopefully aligns faces that are closest.
41

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,230
Looks like it does but there's no way of testing if these are actually lined up now other than optically
42

43
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,260
because if we select this object we get a different location for the object than this object.
43

44
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,450
In fact I do lie.
44

45
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,630
There is one way of testing and that's to go into edit mode of one of these objects and select and an 
45

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,600
individual vertex and remember that says two point 2 6 3 5 and then go into edit mode on this one and
46

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,230
go to three.
47

48
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,650
Okay.
48

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,350
Vote two are aligned or certainly those two vertices are aligned.
49

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,330
And the other thing you can do is if you've got multiple objects selected we could have hopped into
50

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,070
edit mode of both of them and quickly switched between these two.
51

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:48,220
But that's a bit ambiguous having to do that across two models is a pain enough if you had to do across
52

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,850
multiple models.
53

54
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,830
That's a real pain in the backside and would ultimately lead you to not doing it.
54

55
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,180
You just line things up visually so let's have a fake board.
55

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,660
And of course it's added it where the 3d cursor is on the center around our scene.
56

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,260
And now if we wanted to align these at the moment the easiest way of doing that without knowing about
57

58
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,500
moving these objects around is to just lift them up and kind of place them roughly in the right place.
58

59
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm going to delete this I one for the moment we don't need it for our purposes.
59

60
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,740
And then of course we look at our scene and we go well let's turn a bit shading on so it can see some
60

61
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,260
shadows and then we realize we don't have a light in our scene so we can't test that and let's add a
61

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,310
lamp real quick.
62

63
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,630
So at Lamp point lamp source wow that's really bright.
63

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,790
Not surprising these objects are tiny that shift shift the lamp all the way over there.
64

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,370
Of course the lighting at this point because it's so small we're going to have to tweak this later we
65

66
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,440
don't see any shadow so I'm just going to quickly switch across to cycles so don't have the FAF around
66

67
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,640
with those settings and we can see here.
67

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,410
I want to switch it to GPU as well.
68

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,850
Otherwise I won't be able to record this properly.
69

70
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,560
Now we have to come back here and we start moving around we see that there is in fact a gap underneath
70

71
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,490
both of them.
71

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,890
And before you know it you're just faffing around with things would be much easier if we could just
72

73
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:16,270
say at the moment we want the bottom of the model to be where the origin is and it's to be in the center
73

74
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,750
so we can align things perfectly with our board.
74

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,440
Of course if we just type can zero here our bishop or place holder bishop here just disappears into
75

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,250
the floor which is kind of fun but not the look we're going for.
76

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,680
So the simple way of getting around that I'm just gonna go G, Z and lift this back up again until roughly
77

78
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,900
the right place so there we go roughly that.
78

79
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,260
So how would we go ahead and do this.
79

80
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,840
Well I'm come on come out of rendered mode for a moment.
80

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,900
The first thing that I would go ahead and do is go into edit mode and select the face that we want to
81

82
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,200
position our origin on.
82

83
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,140
Now of course we've got this make believe board in the ways I'm going to go to the outliner.
83

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,650
And where it's as plain I'm just going to click the icon it will hide it in our viewport for us and
84

85
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,690
let us go ahead face Select and Select the face itself once it's selected we can move the 3d cursor
85

86
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,700
to that position.
86

87
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,860
Now the origins position didn't have to be in the middle of our object which I want it to be at this
87

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,420
point.
88

89
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,880
We could just select the 3d cursor and click on this surface and we will know that it will have aligned
89

90
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:28,110
perfectly and then we could come out and right click and set the origin to the 3d cursor.
90

91
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,640
Now that's definitely on the bottom.
91

92
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,480
I can say Z equals zero and it will be flat to our plane that we created.
92

93
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,670
But if I wanted it smack bang in the middle with that face selected I could go shift and s and cursor
93

94
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,620
to selected.
94

95
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,350
Now in this particular case the middle of that face because that's what is currently selected.
95

96
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,140
So there we go.
96

97
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,880
It's moved the 3D cursor just a little bits across and then we can go ahead, come out, right click set
97

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,090
origin to the 3d cursor and now we know it's smack bang in the middle of the object.
98

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,710
Now if you wanted to use the object menu you could also do that and set the origin to the 3d cursor
99

100
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,560
there and the radial menu the shift S cursor to selected that we had done earlier.
100

101
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,940
You'll find that when you're in edit mode under the mesh menu under SNAP and then we go we've got the
101

102
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,460
same set of options that we've never had before.
102

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,810
Okay.
103

104
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,930
Armed with that knowledge it's time for your challenge Okay so hopefully a very straightforward challenge
104

105
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,260
for you.
105

106
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,750
I'd like you to check your pawn, your bishop and your base piece.
106

107
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,700
All have their origins at the center bottom of the piece itself.
107

108
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,270
You may have already done this in which case I do want you to still check.
108

109
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,670
That is the case.
109

110
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,480
Pause the video now and give it a go okay.
110

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,690
Everybody welcome back.
111

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,110
Let's go ahead and check ourpawn, bishop and base piece before we make any others because they're all
112

113
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,980
going to be derived from these pieces or have their origins at the center of the bottom of the piece
113

114
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,080
OK so we're back over in Blender here.
114

115
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,930
I've been playing around with my pawn file so let's go ahead and revert it back to normal.
115

116
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,450
Now I'm pretty certain that all of mine are already set up but it does only take a few seconds to go
116

117
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:21,160
through and check so I can go ahead here select this bottom face with the face selected.
117

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,710
I can go shift S, Cursor to select it and we can see that the cursor has gone to the appropriate place.
118

119
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:35,240
Then I can come out right click to open up the context menu and then set the origin to the 3D cursor
119

120
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,680
and we can see here for whatever reason it was slightly off.
120

121
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,630
That is probably a rounding error heh i'll make sure now the object is sat on the bottom and save that
121

122
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,990
file and I'm gonna do the same now for my bishop.
122

123
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,910
Let's go into edit mode select the bottom face.
123

124
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:58,910
We go shift and S, move the cursor to selected, come back out and we can see here the cursor, 3d cursor
124

125
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,680
is also off by about the same amounts and again that is probably a rounding error.
125

126
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,100
I'm going to also apply my scale whilst I'm here as well so let's go ahead right click, originto the 3D
126

127
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,570
cursor set the Z value is 0 its going to have moved it a very very small amounts I'm going to go control and A
127

128
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,510
to apply and apply the scale that's on this model that's going to be important for the next lecture
128

129
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,160
let's go ahead and save that file and the final one of course is the chess piece base so let's go and
