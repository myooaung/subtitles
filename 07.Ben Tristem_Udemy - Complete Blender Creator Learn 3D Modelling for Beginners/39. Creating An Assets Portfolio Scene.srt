Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,380
In this lecture we're going to create an assets portfolio like the scene in front of us here we're going
2

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,590
to be able to switch backwards and forwards between scenes to show off our different work.
3

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,660
And this has the benefit of not only showcasing your materials your models your textures that you've
4

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,870
made but also it's a bit of fun as well.
5

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,270
Let's hop on over into blender and find out more okay.
6

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,230
So we have our current scene in front of us.
7

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,140
And to be quite honest we need to create a new scene before we start playing around any further with
8

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,740
this.
9

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,400
So in the top right we have our scene selection at the moment.
10

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,850
If we click on the dropdown there's only one scene.
11

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,590
And let's just call this playing chess so we know what this one happens to be when we click the little
12

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,700
copy icon add new scene by type.
13

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,980
We can have a blank new scene.
14

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,660
We can copy just the scenes settings but no models will come across.
15

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,450
We can do a linked copy.
16

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,690
The downside to doing it linked to copy is that everything that's in there.
17

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,370
If you change if you move it will reflect in every other linked copy as well.
18

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,150
So if we go ahead and move our pieces and rearrange them they we'll rearrange in this one as well which
19

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,930
we don't want.
20

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,480
So we want to do a full copy.
21

22
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,640
And that means that anything that we do in this new scene that's call this showcase will not be reflected
22

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,080
back in the playing scene.
23

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,460
So let's go back to our showcase scene.
24

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,280
I know straight away I'm only going to need one camera for this.
25

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,660
Now you might not know that that's what you want.
26

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,490
So that's fine.
27

28
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,110
But in this particular case we only want the one camera.
28

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,870
I'm going to use my wide angle near camera.
29

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,490
I'm also going to only need some of the pieces.
30

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,440
So let's have a look.
31

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,150
We're going to need one of every piece so we can start off here.
32

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,360
We've got pawn one black 001 so I'm going to delete all of the other pawns and then I'm going to do
33

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,080
the same on the other side says one two three four five six seven so nice and simple so far and then
34

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,070
we just need to remove the Bishop, Knight and rook and the same on this side so one two three and remember
35

36
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,450
the notch as well.
36

37
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,300
Now we're in the position at this point where we could probably apply the notch itself.
37

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,740
So let's go ahead and apply it here and here.
38

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,710
You can't really do it before this point because otherwise we you would have a multi-user and we'll
39

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,630
deal with that later on.
40

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,930
But simply put you can't just apply a modifier across multi-user objects.
41

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,380
Okay.
42

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,640
So you've got all the basics sorted out here.
43

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,770
Now if I wanted to move the board slightly down I'm going to look at it from above and let's go G,
44

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,240
Y all of the pieces move with it.
45

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,620
So that's worthwhile bearing that in mind.
46

47
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,100
The next thing that I want to do is grab all of the actual pieces themselves.
47

48
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm going to hide the camera for the moment.
48

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,040
Otherwise every time I drag to select I'm going to inadvertently select it as well.
49

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,440
So let's just move these over here and let's do the same with these pieces as well.
50

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,350
Now truth be told it'd be a lot easier if I hadn't moved all of my pieces around to begin with but I have.
51

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,790
So this gives us an excellent opportunity to play.
52

53
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,760
Now this knight is facing a different direction.
53

54
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,160
So I'm going to open up my properties panel by hitting the correct key.
54

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,520
This is probably going to be minus 90 to have it facing inwards.
55

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,020
Okay perfect.
56

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,340
Let's make that disappear again.
57

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,220
So now we've just got to decide on the order I'm going to select my king and pop him roughly in the
58

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,160
middle there and I'm going to do the same for the other king.
59

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,060
So is that going to be enough distance apart.
60

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,790
We should find if we have a look that it's five centimeters in on either side.
61

62
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,750
Which it is.
62

63
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,860
So let's go to our camera view real quick, I'll go shift and the grave key.
63

64
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,910
Move round here.
64

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,560
Is that about the right distance or do we want them further apart as we passed them.
65

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,070
Good question.
66

67
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,670
I think we're fine with that distance so let's go ahead and just tweak the camera at this point because
67

68
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,120
what you will find is that it's still focusing on one of the bishops.
68

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,980
So when we're moving around it will start flickering out and in because of whichever Bishop we were
69

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,750
focused on before I think it was this black one here.
70

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,090
There we go starts going really funny around there.
71

72
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,390
OK.
72

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,840
So I'm going to go to my camera itself.
73

74
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:39,430
So camera to the camera properties and not set it as bishop one black but set it as perhaps 10 centimeters
74

75
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,700
in front of the camera or maybe less maybe five.
75

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,180
And then that means that as we move the camera forward in rendered mode it comes into focus five's far
76

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,970
too small at these settings.
77

78
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,730
So let's send it back to 10.
78

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,020
Perfect.
79

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,200
And one final thing before I gets into a challenge this gray background is awfully boring.
80

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,380
What we can do is on the right hand side go to the world properties go to the color properties under
81

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,880
the surface properties of the World Color and set it to something else.
82

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,840
In this case I'm just going to simply make it black.
83

84
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,650
But if you want to do something more creative of course you can do that as well.
84

85
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,630
And now that we've got these basic sets up it's time for your challenge and your challenge is to create
85

86
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,210
a new scene like we've already done.
86

87
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,260
But if you've not been following along at this point you will need to create yourself a new scene.
87

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,720
Remember to copy rather than link set up one of every piece in a showcase.
88

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,470
And what I'd like to do is be creative.
89

90
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,890
You don't have to do what I've done and put them all in a nice neat row perhaps there's another way
90

91
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,880
of arranging these pieces.
91

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,020
Pause the video now and give that a go
92

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,660
Hello everybody and welcome back.
93

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,600
Let's hope on over into blender and create our showcase.
94

95
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,410
So we've got the general stuff set up here as a matter of hopping into the top view here.
95

96
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,610
I'm just going to press the W key a couple of times to make sure I've got the right type of selection
96

97
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,030
box select I can see down in the lower left which one I've got some box select is fine now.
97

98
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,500
Which order are we going to do things in let's move these out of the way.
98

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,490
We're gonna need the Queen next.
99

100
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,480
And again I'm going to place this is probably going to be a little bit closer.
100

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,390
There we go.
101

102
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,370
Where's the other queen.
102

103
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,150
So good job that you can tell the difference from from all of these different pieces just by the top
103

104
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,860
view itself.
104

105
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,830
Otherwise it'll be very easy to get confused by them all.
105

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,190
I'm not sure whether it's quicker to do individual ones like I'm doing at the moment or a group move
106

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,950
but I am happy with how that's looking.
107

108
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,720
Okay.
108

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,710
And now we've got them aligned on one side it should be quite easy to align them on the other as well.
109

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,890
Okay.
110

111
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,720
I think that looks good.
111

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,270
I'm going to look at them from the camera's perspective.
112

113
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,250
I'm going to go control in space to go full screen.
113

114
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,660
I want to get rid of the properties panel.
114

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm going to hide all of the gizmos outlines by clicking on the display overlays toggle and then shift
115

116
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,240
and the grave key.
116

117
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,760
And let's move forward.
117

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,510
Wow.
118

119
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,170
Brilliant.
119

120
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,050
Now this is a great way you could screen capture this if you wanted to or indeed you could animate the
120

121
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,510
camera and then render out the animation.
121

122
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,970
We'll get to that in the next section.
122

123
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,480
Wow.
123

124
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,630
Fly away.
124

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,280
Cool!
125

126
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,760
Hope you've had lots of fun in this section.
126

127
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,400
Hope you've set up your two scenes, your showcase and you're playing scene perhaps you set up a different
127

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,610
scene as well.
128

129
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,610
Really looking forward to seeing your final chess boards please share them over in the discussions and
129

130
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,830
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
