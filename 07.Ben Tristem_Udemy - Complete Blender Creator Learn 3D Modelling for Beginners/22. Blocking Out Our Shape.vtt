00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.730
In this video, we're gonna pop down some meatballs and start blocking out the shape of our cat.

2
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.160
Solving the challenge and that challenge is to block out your animal, using medal's block out the broad

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.970
shape of your animal.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.580
So that'll be easier for us to start sculpting it, which will probably be doing in the next video before

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.070
this video.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.650
Just get the rough shape of your animal.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.220
OK.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.850
Pause video.

9
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.690
Take on that challenge.

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.800
I'll see you back in when you done.

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.220
Right for me and hop inside view shift a meatball capsule.

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.830
Now, I think that side on.

13
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.800
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.770
I'm going to rotate on the Z axis by 90.

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.430
Perfect.

16
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.020
Back to my side view.

17
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.160
G to move.

18
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.090
Get into position.

19
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.440
Scale it down a little bit.

20
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.810
S to scale on the Y axis.

21
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.160
Stretch it along.

22
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.860
S just rough and ready for now.

23
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.810
Just getting the general shape.

24
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.980
Okay.

25
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.850
Now what are we gonna do.

26
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.630
A little bit of a neck shift d move s to scale cheetah move into place.

27
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.680
If at any point you want to see all what's going on behind here.

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.760
The way I like to do is just quickly alter Z or Z or you can hop into wireframe mode but find that a

29
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.020
little bit trickier to see.

30
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.620
Okay, I'm going to shift D move down to the back and make a bit of a tail now.

31
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.540
Going to make the tail straight to start off with and I'll pose it into position a little bit later

32
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.810
on.

33
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.700
Shift data move again.

34
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
Shift data move again, doesn't matter if it's a bit lumpy, will smooth those out when we start to

35
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.400
do our sculpting, that's a round about the length.

36
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.770
Might be a little bit too long, but that's probably going to be at length for after.

37
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.470
Okay.

38
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.510
Shift a metal bowl bowl for the head G to move into position.

39
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.860
That's not quite the right size.

40
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.290
Scale it down a little bit g to move.

41
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.670
S to scale.

42
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.170
G to move.

43
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.060
That's feeling like it's mursalin the right spot.

44
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.030
Z scroll in a little bit there.

45
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.620
Move it around.

46
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.800
Was accidentally did a mega scale scale scale scale scale ild z to get out of X-ray mode.

47
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.190
Okay I'm going to find one of these cylinders or just borrow one of the tiles.

48
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.680
Shift D move that down.

49
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.460
We'll start the leg are to rotate G to move up.

50
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.260
Now legs are interesting on cats.

51
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.210
I'm just going to bring up my reference images here, see if I can find an interesting leg.

52
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.670
So we often think of legs on animals as being just sticks that come out of the body.

53
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.880
But if you look closely and I'm not a cat person, I don't own a cat.

54
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.610
So I don't know as well as you cat folks out there.

55
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.530
But you can see that right up here is where a shoulder is happening, even all the way up top there,

56
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.340
the shoulder blade.

57
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.080
And we've got this straightness and then that straightness as well.

58
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.870
And you can see on the back all of this is leg in here.

59
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.050
It's all big, chunky leg.

60
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.660
So I want to make sure we represent that.

61
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.180
We've been putting fur over the top of it.

62
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.830
So it's not like we need to get all the definition, but we need to get a little bit of that lumpiness

63
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.700
in here at this point.

64
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.320
So let me see.

65
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.400
I make this little bit bigger and of course, rotate Araz right in the middle.

66
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.720
That's not the spot we wanted.

67
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.670
So hop into the front view G to move it to the side, probably s X to scale it a little bit thinner

68
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.040
for now because I'm making my catch, not symmetrical in terms of the legs.

69
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.340
I'm not going to have mirror ing on sudsing me a little bit of a pain to create.

70
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.050
This cat has a little bit different.

71
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.320
I might do some mirroring of the head separately, but for now, in a working away, that's pretty much

72
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.370
not symmetrical.

73
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.980
Just what feels good in terms of creating this cat.

74
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.620
Okay, Shift D will make the other part of the leg are to rotate G to move down.

75
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.870
It's hidden in the grass, which is great.

76
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.750
I'm saying and one of my previous videos that that is not a problem.

77
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.400
We will allow that to be the case.

78
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.270
You know what I will do?

79
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.110
I click on Ambuhl, find my minable settings and just change the resolution to, I think, point one.

80
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.180
That way we're gonna get a lot more detail, yet more detail, particularly when we convert this into

81
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.890
mesh and we're ready to start sculpting it.

82
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.600
So this leg, it's in the grass.

83
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.160
My reference image doesn't help me a lot.

84
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.020
So let's have a look and see what it should be doing.

85
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.290
Probably this one over here is a good indication.

86
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.590
We need that back joint and then down, then a little bit of a foot.

87
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.180
Look on the legging question.

88
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.400
Thinning, thinning, r2 rotate.

89
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.850
Okay G and then shift day.

90
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.510
We'll do a little bit of a foot down here, although it probably won't be seeing it.

91
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.040
OK.

92
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.910
How's that looking?

93
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.800
It's looking okay.

94
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.540
Still a lot of shaping we'll do when we get to the sculpting stage.

95
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.100
But it's okay for now.

96
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.490
The other leg wing.

97
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.950
Yes.

98
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.170
Add a little bit because I can't see it from this reference image.

99
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.040
Gee, açaí shift d moving around are to rotate to move back a little bit.

100
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.140
Scale it down a little bit and then I'm gonna go into my front view sheet to move a little bit of a

101
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.580
rotate to the side.

102
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.780
Okay, so now that I've walked through literally the process, you can see how I'm going about doing

103
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.930
this.

104
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.380
I'll speed up the video so you don't have to watch me put down every single limb.

105
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.300
Okay.

106
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.670
This is what I've ended up with, just duplicating, moving, duplicating, moving.

107
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.190
It's pretty straightforward stuff that we've done a bunch of.

108
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.030
I've ended up with something that's not exactly in line with the cat image.

109
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.750
I've been using my other reference images as well just to get a movie inspiration.

110
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.650
How would things look?

111
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.760
Trying to pose it in a way that feels good for me in terms of what I'd like to do with this cat.

112
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.320
Haven't put any is yet.

113
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.310
We'll do that later on when we're sculpting and putting more attention into the head.

114
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.040
And you can see that I've just gone and shrunk in my inner let's see, my inner meatball.

115
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.040
That really made a difference when I did that just to get the shape of it.

116
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.450
So some of these shoulders started to show through a little bit and we can pay a bit more attention

117
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.830
to that when we're doing our sculpting.

118
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.680
Just a quick note.

119
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.760
There are other ways that we could have gone about creating this pose.

120
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.140
I've gone with a little bit of a tricky appose if I just do this pose at the back, you know, the side

121
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.870
the front view over here, just the cat sitting there doing not much.

122
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.260
Then I could have mirrored and that would have sped up the workflow a lot.

123
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.950
So if you want to mirror yours, by all means, go ahead and do that, particularly when we get to the

124
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.880
sculpting stage.

125
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.850
And we can also put bones within our object and we can use that to pose.

126
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.920
So we put the cat in the equivalent of a cat t pose and then use the bone so that we can move the legs

127
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.370
into shape.

128
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.410
But I wanted to practice on my practice, my art medal placement and my sculpting skills.

129
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.860
So I've decided to go with a non symmetrical image for the cat and just start with that from the get

130
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.070
go.

131
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.490
But just wanted to point that out that you could totally put bones and go with mirroring and go as symmetry

132
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.570
that will save time.

133
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.400
It is my particular preference in this instance that I wanted to model it like this right from the start.

134
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.470
Also to bear in mind I'm going to be putting grass over the whole bottom part of my cat.

135
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.240
So a lot of the details don't.

136
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.950
Down the bottom don't matter so much for me.

137
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.830
So I'll be skipping over those a lot and not worrying about the detail.

138
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.120
And also going to be covering up my cat with hair, obviously with fur.

139
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.510
And that means that a lot of the detail in here we don't need as well.

140
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.930
So that paws in particular are not going to be putting a lot of love into.

141
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.280
But in the next video, we'll start doing some sculpting and add a little bit more shape to our cat.
