1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.530
In this video, we're going to be giving our animals some eyes.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.010
I've got a cat eyeball texture that I've crafted that I will share with you so you can use that if you're

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.120
also making a cat.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.320
Otherwise, go find yourself a texture online that you think matches.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.310
We going to do this in a very simple way.

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.260
It's not going to be overly complex because.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.490
Well, for me anyway, my camera's going to be way back here, so I'm not really going to see the detail

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.180
on the eye.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.670
So I'm not putting a huge amount of effort into it.

10
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.720
Now, you say I've already dropped this fear into my scene here, which I'll talk about a little bit

11
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.380
more in a moment.

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.990
But the reason I've dropped it in here is so I can show you that it's a little bit terrible around my

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.770
eye socket.

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.110
You see my cat over on the side here.

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.250
It's nice and crisp.

16
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.470
It's got a proper kind of eyelid type thing and a proper recessing within the eye.

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.750
Full disclosure, I probably should have been working having the eyeball in when I was sculpting so

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.520
I could see how that area was working.

19
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.050
So I apologize for not doing that.

20
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.160
That's one of the things we can learn as we go that woops, I forgot to put the eyeball in there and

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.590
now it's a little bit mushy because I didn't pay attention to that.

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.740
But if you do want to go in, tighten this up a little bit, it's often easier to jump into edit mode,

23
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.740
not on the eyeball, Rick.

24
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.560
On the cat jumping the edit mode when you're on your animal and then add some extra geometry in edit

25
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.430
mode rather than trying to sculpt it because we've already remade and we've already put on our hair.

26
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.110
Things can go a little bit.

27
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.370
Blender complains a little bit if we're trying to mush things around at this point by sculpting.

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.760
But if we jump in edit mode, gonna grab my knife to K and remember Wolf for this anyway, I'm not looking

29
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.380
for pretty geometry.

30
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.200
If we were to Rita apologizes, I would do it very differently.

31
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.830
But at this stage, I'm just looking to add some more detail.

32
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.860
So using the knife tool, it entered a close that off.

33
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.280
Where else would we want a little bit more?

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.070
Probably a little bit stronger along here.

35
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.540
So like I say, this is not topology or geometry that I would win any awards for, but it's allowing

36
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.520
me to get a little bit more complexity, a little bit more pushing and pulling when I'm going to be

37
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.780
manipulating my eyeball.

38
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.120
So you might want to go and put a little bit more love around your eye socket trying to create some

39
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.720
rings here.

40
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.710
That might make sense.

41
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.530
And then one more.

42
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.810
Along here, just fast and loose at the moment.

43
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.440
Just to get some extra jump trees.

44
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.560
So I did want to pull this out.

45
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.660
Let me just hop into pushing one.

46
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.020
You know what?

47
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.110
I might grab these faces, pushing three.

48
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.310
Grab a few of these faces just to make a stronger eyebrow.

49
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.250
Gee, and then constrained to why I think I won't just put out a little bit like that.

50
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.780
There you go.

51
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.570
Not too much.

52
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.160
Just a little bit g y.

53
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.210
Little bit out there.

54
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.010
I've got proportional editing on.

55
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.090
That's why things moved.

56
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.620
Not just those faces.

57
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.500
So proportional editing is often our friend at this stage.

58
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.970
And then of course we need to mirror.

59
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.020
So we're seeing on both sides.

60
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.940
So let me just show you this and a little bit more detail.

61
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.690
I've added in a sphere, so shift a you guys know how to add a sphere by now.

62
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650
Find yourself a UVAs fear not in edit mode though.

63
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.700
Sorry, object mode.

64
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.740
So shift a mesh.

65
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.430
You've a sphere scale that get it into the right position and rotate on the x axis 90.

66
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.510
So I do like to have the circles facing to the front like this.

67
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.130
The face at the front and the mirror around.

68
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.900
Move it around and get it into the eye socket.

69
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.450
So you guys have seen me do that sort of stuff a bunch.

70
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.010
We don't need to see it exactly again.

71
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.430
Then you might want to play around a little bit with your eyebrow, get it looking the way you want

72
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.560
and the inside of your eye.

73
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.820
We need to do now and here.

74
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.710
We could probably push that in a little bit more jump into render view so you can see how this looks

75
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.030
in terms of how we're doing.

76
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.130
The hair looking, looking.

77
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.920
Okay.

78
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.860
Little bit of boldness just around the inside of the the hair where the eyeball is.

79
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.630
So that might be something that we need to address.

80
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.360
But for now, like I've said, I'm gonna be cameras give me way back here.

81
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.620
So it might not be that noticeable, but I'll be putting a little bit of time and effort off camera.

82
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.710
I think mostly just updating the eye socket and having it look good.

83
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.450
One thing you might notice at this point is that your hair or your particle systems has gone a little

84
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.080
bit crazy.

85
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.330
And that's because we're changing the geometry, changing the mesh and the hair particle system is really

86
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.750
like that.

87
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.360
I've got weird whiskers that I will be addressing in the next video, I think, and also obviously make

88
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.210
sure that you have painted the weights so that your particle system is behaving the way you want it

89
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.920
to do around the eyeballs.

90
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.040
But let's get back to the main thing we're here for, which is the eyeball.

91
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.540
And I have a challenge for you.

92
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.880
And challenge is going to be to let your animals see, obviously at an eye if your animal.

93
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.920
So we've gone and added our sphere just now.

94
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.310
Start with that sphere shape at scale it place at all.

95
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.040
That kind of good stuff flatten out a little bit at the front as we've done.

96
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.900
We've worked on our human heads at a at an eye texture, which is the important part here.

97
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.140
And like I said, I'm just slapping that texture right over the top.

98
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.840
I'm not trying to have the geometry match the texture.

99
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.690
So Cats Eye has more of a slip up and down.

100
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.120
I'm going to leave my geometry on the sphere as it is and not worry about the fact this is not lining

101
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.320
up exactly with that geometry.

102
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.950
That's all good.

103
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.590
So any challenge, if you want to do that and jump in and add the texture to your eye.

104
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.480
Go ahead and do that.

105
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.710
And I'll see you back here when you done.

106
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.760
And I'll go through the rest of the process for myself, adding the texture to the eye.

107
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.930
Okay, C.C., I've already got my UVA window, sir, down yonder we've got UVA Ed and I've also already

108
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.450
got my Qader Ed. They're the two we're interested in.

109
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.480
Let's click on Material View so we can see what's going on.

110
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.070
I'm clicked on the eyes.

111
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.640
Perfect.

112
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.670
Jumped down to material properties, actually gonna to hide the cat for the moment.

113
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.460
What I want to do is just find where abouts the ring.

114
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.680
And so it's just on that.

115
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.660
That's the first one second one.

116
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.270
Third one.

117
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.600
And just on the fourth one, which I may want to trim, that's I'm not actually seeing the fourth one.

118
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.870
So we'll say that our texture is gonna be one, two, three rings.

119
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:54.220
Now we can hide the cat and jump into edit mode C for selecting and selects three.

120
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.740
Right.

121
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.620
Click first of all, three and then see.

122
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.980
Okay, selecting faces C on our two.

123
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.500
We've got the first ring, the second ring and the third ring selected.

124
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.630
Looks decent enough when how you've unwrapped it actually at the same time looks pretty terrible.

125
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.950
So you've are right.

126
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.180
Click to exit that you v smart you the project and then.

127
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.740
Okay.

128
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.630
Okay.

129
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.550
So I can pretty.

130
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.030
Pretty.

131
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.860
Now I need to make myself a texture so click on the material properties.

132
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.330
Click on plus.

133
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.120
Oh we could we just clicked on new and double click.

134
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.980
Will name this two eyes into a click a sign.

135
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.370
Now we need to go in and find ourselves something to actually put in there.

136
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.850
So over in our shader editor, I'm going to shift a I like to search for things.

137
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.180
I'm just gonna type in texture and then I'm looking for image texture.

138
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.130
Add that into place.

139
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.730
Sorry.

140
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.370
If you're having trouble seeing this, Mike, give ourselves a bit more room.

141
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.830
Connect colour with base colour.

142
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.080
It should go black.

143
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.340
Has now we don't have a base colour.

144
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.970
I'm going to click on Open because I want to find an image from my computer and I have a cat I.

145
00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.360
J.

146
00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.840
Peg.

147
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.780
I'll open that up and you can see it's brought in this image.

148
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.780
This is the texture that I'm working with, the image I'm working with.

149
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.490
You should go find your own or make your own or are crafted or grab it from somewhere you can use mine

150
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.970
if you want.

151
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.750
I've made that available for you and you can see it comes in rotated.

152
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.770
Don't worry about all the nonsense around the back because we're not going to see that being a little

153
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.430
bit like as a fast and Lucier things we're never gonna see.

154
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.130
Does matter.

155
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.600
We can leave it easy.

156
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.490
So as I was babbling, I've selected my in my Yuva editor here.

157
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.930
I've selected all of my use.

158
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.280
These are to rotate and rotate the cat eye slits until they are vertical.

159
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.360
Right, that looks pretty good.

160
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.690
Now it's going to quickly pop.

161
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.030
Turn the cat back on.

162
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.750
Okay.

163
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.560
You can see this little bit of a bit on the outside that I need to attend to.

164
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.400
Okay.

165
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.460
Now, the pupil is larger than I'd like to like it to be.

166
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.960
So just a little mini challenge for you here.

167
00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.090
How do you think we can change just the size of this black area on the pupil and not the rest of our

168
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.620
texture just to make that inside a bit smaller without making our line here change?

169
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:05.820
Okay.

170
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:13.470
Well, if you thought that if we jump back into our EUV, Ed hit three, select the middle center part

171
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.810
is to scale and scale that.

172
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.620
Let's see.

173
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.480
Not in, but out, out, out.

174
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.450
You can see that it gets a little bit of distortion has made it thinner, which is what I wanted.

175
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.830
Now, if we look at our cat reference images, it's more of that thinness.

176
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.470
You can see the eye in the background there is very thin.

177
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.330
It looks like it goes all the way from top to bottom.

178
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.250
That's a similar sort of nearly top to bottom over there.

179
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.460
So this is looking a little bit more the way I like it.

180
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.450
Honestly, it looks a bit creepy because I'm used to looking at human heads and it's not perfect.

181
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.190
So you can see we don't have perfect geometry.

182
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.530
They have a little bit of that bump on the inside.

183
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.440
If I was up closer, I would need to put a little bit more love into how I'm the geometry on the eyeball

184
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.940
to make the relationship between our UVB mapping and the actual texture look closer.

185
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.110
But because we're gonna be backyard, I think we're going to see that little bump.

186
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.140
So I'm letting that go.

187
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.400
But just want to flag to that.

188
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.440
It's not a great workflow.

189
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.640
If we were up closer, we would notice that I've got a little bit of an issue around the outside.

190
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:09.900
I'm just going to move around my mesh off screen so you don't have to watch me doing it.

191
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.070
I'll be back in a moment.

192
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.350
Let's do a little bit of a play around here to see what we want in terms of specular and metalic.

193
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.270
I'll do it more specular, more shiny.

194
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.380
Now, again, if we weren't really close, we would see that there's specular and shiny on our black

195
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.210
pupil and they've got that little bumpy indent part there because we don't have perfect geometry.

196
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.110
That's all fine.

197
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.020
I just want to get the general ballpark of how it should look at the moment.

198
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.210
There is specular tend to be metallic.

199
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.020
Probably not.

200
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.350
And a little bit less roughness, and I'm going to darken the eye and add a little bit of coloring to

201
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.470
it.

202
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.160
So we're back over in our Shada Ed shift.

203
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.240
The texture and the base color.

204
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.830
Then I'll hook up my other color into color.

205
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.700
Apologies from bazooms out here.

206
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.780
So we're going to go in the Greaney yellowy sphere and click on Dorkin.

207
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.560
So we're not doing anything weird to the black area in there.

208
00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.860
So it's a little bit darker.

209
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.210
It's kind of getting in the ballpark.

210
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.190
It's a little bit tough to see when I don't have the full light shining on it.

211
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.330
So let's look at our render view.

212
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.660
We'll play around with it here.

213
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.520
It's still looking very bright, isn't it?

214
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.900
These bright green eyes.

215
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.840
So make it even darker with the color that we're adding.

216
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.950
Darker, darker, darker.

217
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.990
And until I get to the point where I'm happy, it might be a little bit too much specular on here.

218
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.730
Luby Too much specular tint.

219
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.330
And in terms of the darkness of the eyes, not too bad, I think the last piece for me to make them

220
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:35.800
look less beedi had them more recessed into the actual head itself and have the sockets or the eyebrows

221
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.730
protruding over.

222
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.340
So the color I'm okay with for the moment.

223
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.860
And I'm just gonna play around with the positioning a little bit more.

224
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.890
But that essentially is it.

225
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.010
We've given ourselves some eyeballs and we've placed them into our cat so I can deliver positioning

226
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.580
off camera.

227
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.150
And I'll show you how it ends up when I've positioned it.

228
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.060
Okay.

229
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.760
It's not perfect, but it's generally where I want it to be for the distance where you'd be looking

230
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.030
at it.

231
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.910
You can see I put a little bit more Eyebrow Ridge in their position.

232
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.560
The eyes turn on our material mode here.

233
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160
It looks a little bit dark.

234
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.940
And when I do a rindo, when I'm in render view and we hop back to probably where I'm gonna have the

235
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.620
cat, then you can see it definitely looks like eyes are roughly in the right position and you can see

236
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.430
that they're slits.

237
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.580
So I'm going to call this done for the moment.

238
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.840
If you wanna put more finesse and love and precision in yours, that would be amazing.

239
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.340
But for now, this is good for mine.

240
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.180
So I hope you've gone okay with your eyes and I'll see you in the next lecture.
