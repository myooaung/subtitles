00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.970
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.610
We're going to take our lamp here and make it one unified object which does use the armature to move

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.310
it still and it will then work pretty much flawlessly whenever we export it.

4
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.080
Now there is a specific order in which we need to do things if you do them in the wrong order.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.710
You will end up with your lamp blowing apart.

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.810
Now I'd like to take you down the journey of your lamp blowing apart but it's a bit frustrating because

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.430
we have to go right back to the beginning and repeat everything.

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.310
But I can show you that really quickly if we grab the whole idea behind this is that we grab all of

9
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.010
our model and we join it to just one object.

10
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.960
We can see this.

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.580
There are some issues there where we go ahead and play it with city arm which is still moving but everything

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.050
else is pretty rigid.

13
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.470
Course the base moves around there which is why we can see it.

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.230
Now what happens if we go ahead and what we need to do is apply an armature modifier to this.

15
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.530
And if the bones and named the same as the vertex groups what will happen is it should just work.

16
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.850
Well let's go ahead and have a look at adding that I'm going to need a new window just down here and

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.070
it's going to be a property's window.

18
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm going to go down to our modifiers who's going to play the subsurface modifier for the moment scroll

19
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.990
up and at the top of the deform column the third column along we've got armature.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.330
We go ahead and select that and under the objects we select our armature what we should find is that

21
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.310
it moves along.

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.160
And as you can see here the lamp blows apart and this if you get this effect then you've missed a step.

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.180
So it is quite critical that we don't do that.

24
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.500
Now before I go and revert the file back to the very beginning I just want to note here note says that

25
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.970
the arms themselves look horrible now.

26
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.780
If I don't even think they're mirrored and know that they married I haven't a clue.

27
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.390
It's certainly a big mess and we need to make sure that we apply modifiers as well before we start joining

28
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.790
things together because everything will inherit the modifiers of the object.

29
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.590
It's joint too.

30
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.900
So first of all let's go to file and revert our file.

31
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.410
Okay.

32
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.480
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to grab everything to do with my model here and I'm going

33
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.290
to unpack and say I'm gonna remove the parent to the armature.

34
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.770
If we don't do that first.

35
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.550
That's one of the reasons why it will blow apart.

36
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.370
Okay that's done.

37
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.750
But the first problem we've got here is the mirror modifier.

38
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.530
We've obviously got a mirror point in here I can't remember what we're using and it's now offsets and

39
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.050
we can solve that very easily especially since we're about to apply the mirrored modifier as well because

40
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.610
all we need to do is set it back to perhaps mirroring around the origin.

41
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.470
So let's do that now.

42
00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.650
Let's come out of this view of control and space and we have this lower arm.

43
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.760
If we create ourselves a number window properties window scroll down to our mirror modifier.

44
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.570
Yes here we go.

45
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.700
The lower arm mirror.

46
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.600
I'm just gonna get rid of that.

47
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.980
This will be just reflecting about itself.

48
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.310
So how about we use something that we know is centralized and that's going to be the lamp base.

49
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.520
There we go.

50
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.240
Yes that's absolutely fine.

51
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.610
And we only need it for this one moment because we're about to apply all of our modifiers now do make

52
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.860
sure you apply them in order and by in order I mean from the top of the stack to the bottom if I now

53
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.170
apply the subdivision before the bevel it gives us a completely different result.

54
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.130
It's the same as swapping them round if we swap them around.

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.160
It would give us the same results.

56
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.410
So what we want to do is make sure we apply the ones on top first and we need to do that to the rest

57
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.680
of our model as well won't takes too long to do we've not got too many modifiers to apply.

58
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.800
And indeed your model perhaps doesn't have that many either lampshade none there.

59
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.220
Okay.

60
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.670
So that decouple from one another but there's still individual objects.

61
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.330
What we need now need to do is join them all together and the process of joining them all together.

62
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.810
If you cannot select them like this I'm having trouble selecting this lamps them here because of the

63
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.520
armature so we could hide the armature.

64
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.560
That would be one way or we could dive straight into the outline and select everything from the outline

65
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.350
that providing everything has been named appropriately.

66
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.450
But I'm pretty sure that I can manage to select the other two bits here.

67
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.120
Now I'm going to join them together with control and J noticed.

68
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.210
Now there's no changing of any of the objects themselves because they're not inheriting any of the modifiers

69
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.660
that have been applied to our model.

70
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.420
The next thing we do now need to do is add another modifier.

71
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.880
I'm going to scroll up here.

72
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.000
We've got an armature.

73
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.660
I'm going to add the armature modifier and we need to select an object.

74
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.310
So I'm going to pick the armature because the only one in I'll scene and notice these are moved back

75
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.000
straight away.

76
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.020
This is looking good.

77
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.340
And notice here there's a tick in the box that says bind to vertex groups in the modifiers options.

78
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.270
That's important.

79
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.350
That means that if the bone and the vertex group name are the same the bone will control that Vertex

80
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.910
group which is incredibly powerful.

81
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.690
And now let's go ahead and press play.

82
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.520
Eek.

83
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.300
Okay.

84
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.250
So I'm going to guess here that there's something wrong with the naming to do with these two objects.

85
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.310
So that's going to be your challenge.

86
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.440
Eve you've named everything the same.

87
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.560
You probably now have a working model and working animation if you haven't.

88
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.430
What's I'd like you to do is go ahead pulls a video and corrects that problem and I'll see you back

89
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.300
in a few moments

90
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.270
okay everybody welcome back.

91
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.920
So let's go ahead.

92
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.930
I'm going to leave that plane because I think you never used to be the case but I think now we can modify

93
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.800
these in real time and actually see the effect it has.

94
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.160
I don't know the names of any of these vertex groups so let's go have a look.

95
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.710
We've got a base a stem a lower arm an upper arm and a lamp shade.

96
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.250
Okay.

97
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.890
So I think the stem itself is called something like lamp STEM but we can go and check that says hop

98
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.850
over into edit mode of our armature.

99
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.290
Here we go even though everything is moving around now so let's have a look at what these bones are

100
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.590
called.

101
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.090
We've got lamp stem and just shade at the top everything else appears to be working.

102
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.800
So shade and lamps them.

103
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.360
Let's go ahead and do that.

104
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.230
Select our model.

105
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.990
Go to the vertex groups.

106
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.190
So this is called lamp stem a look at that.

107
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.220
It's moving straight away.

108
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.270
Perfect.

109
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.670
Let's go to the lampshade and just make it called Shade case and nothing's happening there.

110
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.170
Now I know what the issue is here.

111
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.930
I thought as soon as I saw the padlock not sorted that it might be the case.

112
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:03.050
Let's go into the object itself into edit mode and I think that I did not assign a vertex group I'm

113
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.760
going to clear with a double A.

114
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.690
Okay with everything d selected if I go ahead and click select yes.

115
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.030
Okay.

116
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.610
So at some point I've forgotten to select or remove all of the detail at the top.

117
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.250
Okay.

118
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.810
So in that one respect this could be a real pain in the backside but fortunately because we've done

119
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.110
everything else we can just select the inverse of everything else.

120
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.740
But if that wasn't the case I would literally have to go in perhaps select this individual vertex here

121
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.100
and go to control and plus to expand it but that only goes so far I can press the L key remember to

122
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.790
select linked objects as well for a fact I think I've selected everything there.

123
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:47.180
But if that wasn't an option for you the other thing that we could do in this particular case which

124
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.890
I think is quite clever is that we can make sure nothing selected we can select the base.

125
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.260
Let me make this area a little bit bigger.

126
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.470
Select the base.

127
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.150
Select the lamp stem the lower arm the upper arm and then with our cursor in the viewport we can go

128
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.930
control an eye then we get the inverse we can select shade assign an and lock that down.

129
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.000
Clear the selection and just make sure it works.

130
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.290
Okay.

131
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.210
So I don't know why that wasn't the case before.

132
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.350
I'm pretty sure I did do it but perhaps I got caught up in something else.

133
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.950
Now with everything named appropriately and all the vertex group selected a model is moving exactly

134
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.880
as we had it to let's make it look a bit prettier.

135
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.760
Look at that's awesome.

136
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.970
I'm not sure what type of rendering I'm doing at the moment.

137
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:40.700
I've actually switched over to using Linux at the moment so I'm very interested in seeing the apparent

138
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.970
improvements in a render speed.

139
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:50.660
That's certainly something that I've I've heard that you can have over Windows and Mac OS now it does

140
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.560
appear here that I don't have a ha I need you to scroll up on those tabs.

141
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.720
Something to watch out for is these tabs scroll.

142
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.500
There we go.

143
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.180
So yes someone GOP computes.

144
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:08.840
I think that's a bit faster than it used to be but I can't say objectively that is true.

145
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.540
Okay so I'm really liking how that works out.

146
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.430
I'm going to switch over to eevee for a second so I can see it in a bit more real time.

147
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:21.600
Take a few moments for the shaders to build and then we go look at that.

148
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.730
Perfect.

149
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.460
Now of course I've not got the lights turned on for TV sets up to turn those off.

150
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.310
Master you're using cycles but brilliant.

151
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.450
How are you guys getting on.

152
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.370
Did you manage to successfully rerecord your model.

153
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.020
Now it may seem at this point well why didn't we do that in the first place.

154
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.720
Just remember that to do things like the mirror modify hair might been a bit of a pain in the backside

155
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.570
if it wasn't a separate object to begin with and it's enabled us to build our model up piece by piece

156
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.960
without worrying about linking it together.

157
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.520
And when it did come to creating the vertex groups we just need to select the objects as a whole and

158
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.780
assign the vertex group.

159
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.630
It will keep the name of that Vertex group even though everything is joined together so it's kind of

160
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.670
a shortcut.

161
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:11.630
But by all means in the future if you're doing something like this you can just assign vertex groups

162
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.550
