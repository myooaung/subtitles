1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,570
Welcome So quickie explode.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,140
Well what is Kabuki explode.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,570
Well this may be all you need if you want something quick and explosive.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,680
Of course now it can be used also as a starting point especially if the type of explosion it gives you

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,520
is what you want.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,550
Now we will explore what it is actually doing for us in the background as well.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,230
So without any further do let's hop straight on over and explore the quick explode in blender.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,730
Okay so I've opened up a brand new blender file here and one of the first things I'm going to do is

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,310
I'm going to create another window and I'm going to change it to a time line.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,450
The reason for this is it's going to give us control over the start and end frames and some playback

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,250
buttons as well.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,470
Now it's kind of like an animation.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,190
But usually physics is involved.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,710
And physics has to go from frame to frame to work out what is going on.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,440
And later on you'll see that this can be incredibly computationally heavy if you decide to do too many

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,470
things at once.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,910
So you do have to be careful when it comes to doing anything with the blender physics engine just like

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,940
you have to be careful if you subdivide too many times.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,380
It just really taxes the computer.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,530
It will look like you've locked blender up.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,510
But in fact it's just busy thinking about stuff anyway so first of all let's go ahead and use the quick

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,610
explode function.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,610
Now you can get to the quick explode function through a couple of ways.

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,870
My favourite is by hitting space and time burning quick.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,940
Explode as you can see I've been practicing.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,820
So if I go ahead and typing quick you can see that it.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,180
We also get quick smoke quick fur and quick fluid as well.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,310
Now we're just going to pick quick explode.

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,040
Now what's happened.

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:59,010
Well I can see over in the outliner that's a spanner has appeared or a wrench which means to some modifiers

31
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,420
have been applied.

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,260
We see that a particle system and then explode modifier have been added to our scene.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Okay that's that's a good start.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,590
Now let's just go along to the particle system okay.

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,960
It's a hundred I don't know whether that's going to make a difference.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,260
Probably not physics and no physics is enabled at the moment.

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,720
We'll get into physics in another lecture.

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:33,880
So looking at these modifiers we can see that it's going to cuts the edges for a nice end nice as shrapnel.

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,480
Okay.

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,150
So this can give us an idea of what it's going to do.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,930
And it looks like it's cutting edge along here.

42
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,260
I don't know how many pieces it's going to explode into.

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,580
Let's go ahead and press play.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,510
Okay.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,810
And it seems to break into two pieces.

46
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,670
And also after 50 frames we can see that's there's really nothing else to do something to change.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,650
My end point to 50 frames now looking at the time frame itself here the timeline.

48
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,680
Now we've got this red bar moving along here and that is cached information.

49
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:13,010
So when we go and change something what blender does is actually play it through it caches those changes

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,420
it caches the movement of what's happening when the thing explodes.

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,520
It happens in a similar way as well if you use the physics engine which we'll see later on.

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,870
Now what is happening is it's not remembering so it doesn't have to do the calculations again and again

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,740
and again as it plays through.

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:39,170
Now as you can see up in the top here we got frames per second at twenty four which is great because

55
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,960
I believe that's what the whole scene is setting.

56
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,530
So we've got it just breaking into two pieces.

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,890
Now that's not very exciting.

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,570
Now we really want it to break in to lots and lots of pieces.

59
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,660
And of course that lines us up now for a challenge.

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,110
I would like you to go ahead and make some smaller pieces please.

61
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:09,010
So use whatever method you'd like to make the cube explode into smaller pieces.

62
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,300
Pretty straightforward.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,190
Give it some thoughts.

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,010
Pause the video now and give that a go.

65
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,610
Okay guys.

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,380
Welcome back.

67
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,540
Let's hop back over into blender and make it explode into smaller pieces.

68
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,550
Okay welcome back.

69
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,090
So we've got our cube here just really splitting into two are not doing anything exciting.

70
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,340
I've got to stop that animation because it's a wee bit dull and I'm going to go back to frame one.

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,040
Well we'll see.

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,290
Frame 1 it's already broken apart.

73
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,330
Let's go back to frame 0.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,180
So if we wanted to go in too many pieces it wouldn't be logical.

75
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,580
If we had many pieces for it to go into.

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,050
Okay so let's go ahead and go into edit mode.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,640
And I'm literally going to enable the tool shelf go to the specials menu hit subdivide specials with

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,770
the W key and hit subdivide elam is going to increase the number of cuts I'm going to go all the way

79
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,370
up to 10 which it will allow and of course you can go in and type the much higher number if you wanted.

80
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,660
And I'm just going to leave it at 20.

81
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,740
Now hopefully that's not too many we can have a look up here.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,170
It's generated 5000 Triangle's that's fine if you sargen here up into millions you're probably going

83
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,670
to slow the computers down massively.

84
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,410
Okay guess now we've done that let's hop out our into object mode and let's go ahead and play back and

85
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,130
see what happens here.

86
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,390
Now that looks a lot lot better.

87
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,560
The pieces seem quite big vote.

88
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,290
That's interesting that the pieces do seem quite big.

89
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,400
Let's see subdividing it any more makes a difference.

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,620
Also see if just using a subsurface division modifier would have done the same thing because I do like

91
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,750
to keep things so that you can edit them are much easier.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,970
And of course with 20 subdivisions that's not going to be easy to edit.

93
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,410
So let's go ahead and explore a different way of doing this now.

94
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
It's going to hit the UNDO key.

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,530
In fact I'm going to hit the UNDO key so we get rid of the quick explode around there where it's broken

96
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,590
it in two.

97
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,460
And let's go ahead and go to the subdivisions.

98
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:25,190
Surface modifier over in the modifiers tab now where it happens to be in the chain.

99
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,330
May make a difference.

100
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,900
Some just gone up the view counts to four.

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,690
And let's see if anything happens.

102
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,300
Okay so it literally breaks into what looks like a burger bun in two.

103
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,960
Let's shift this up.

104
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,430
To the very top hat.

105
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,490
Excellent.

106
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,080
So we can see here that we can go back to the simple as well so it remains a cue ball.

107
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,290
We can do the cat mould Clark and.

108
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,430
Well that's doing something.

109
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,970
So I think there's a much better way of doing it without cutting things up.

110
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,830
Now we ski we can see here that as we increase the subdivisions all the frames per second is dropped

111
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,520
right down.

112
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,480
10.

113
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,430
You see that because we've added a lot more information.

114
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,810
But there does seem to be a finite amount that the explode will cut these up into pieces so if we go

115
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:23,090
back to one or sarino subdivisions it pretty much cuts in if we go to one subdivision I can't count

116
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,030
all those pieces.

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:31,450
I don't want to but it's less pieces than if we go to every go the 3 We seem to get even more pieces.

118
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:38,660
But after that it doesn't seem to get any more finer It doesn't get into space or dust or the very small

119
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,130
debris.

120
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,990
So it's worthwhile knowing that we'd have to play even more of the settings to get that sort of effect

121
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,870
going on.

122
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,960
Okay.

123
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,720
Brilliant.

124
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,240
We've just done a quick explode.

125
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,220
It's useful for certain things.

126
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,840
Obviously there's a lot more to be done with this and we can explore that later on.

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,750
Until then I will see you guys over in the next lecture.
