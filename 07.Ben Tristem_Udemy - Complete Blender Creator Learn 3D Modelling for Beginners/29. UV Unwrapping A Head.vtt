00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.010
Welcome to you v unwrapping ahead.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.900
So in this video we're going to be thinking about your Seems a where the placement is.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.310
We're going to try and leave the face intact.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.360
That is without seems how we're going to discover any parts that might need their own island.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.480
So let's hop straight on over into blender and unwrap our head.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.140
Okay so we've back over in blender and I've done a few final tweaks on my model.

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.190
I brought the chest forward a little.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.690
It was very far back in fact and probably come forward even a little bit more.

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.070
The plinth just going to turn off and hide it out the way for the moment.

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.980
And the head itself well it's bulging ever so slightly and I do need to fix that because otherwise it's

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.010
going to look horrible So let's look at it from the front skew it slightly to one side and then scale

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.090
it in using proportional editing.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.950
Not all the way because it will look like a hole in my head but about their CO that looks much better

14
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.140
and is going to do these two here as well.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.280
Now I could faff about with a mirror and try and do both sides then mirror it background but I would

16
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.130
probably end up ruining my sculped if I were to do that.

17
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.590
Okay.

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.360
That's looking much much better.

19
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.990
Okay so now I've got the head here.

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.330
What we need to do is think about unwrapping.

21
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.640
Now we need to think carefully about which areas we want to include in one part of a V mesh.

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.550
Now the IS themselves can be separated from our model.

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.040
That's a definite yes in this case.

24
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.430
We don't need the ears as part of our model.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.040
It's only going to cause problems having them there or confusion all had inhaled downshift us or selecting.

26
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.250
Okay.

27
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.140
So now I have selected both of those.

28
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.560
I will use control and E to mark a scene.

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.430
Okay so those are the is separate.

30
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.640
Now we've got to think carefully about our scenes.

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.350
If we cut out that just let's say grab the face running around facing use that's or find is we end up

32
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.880
with a line where we start texturing our model and we don't want a harsh line on the side of the face.

33
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.360
We would notice that.

34
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.330
So really we only perhaps want to come down as far as how or indeed where the hairline would be severe

35
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.640
imagine where the hairline is on the model.

36
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.330
They'll be a good place to have a seam because we can hide it no matter what you do in general seams

37
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.410
will cause some sort of horrible artefacts.

38
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.930
When it comes to your model and we want to avoid that during texturing So we certainly want the front

39
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.270
of the face and cut not cut out as such but on prominent display and then we got the rest of our model.

40
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.540
Now depending on what we want to do and what we want to texture we can just decide to omit some of these

41
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.260
other bits.

42
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.280
But that's entirely up to you as an artist to work that out.

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.360
Now in terms of where to cut it we certainly don't want to seem down face.

44
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.190
I would suggest a T shape running from about here on the side of the head.

45
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.670
So by the temple all the way up to the centre and then back down equally on one side and cut down the

46
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.280
back of the model as well all the way down to the bottom.

47
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.790
And of course that leads us on to a challenge unlike you to go ahead and create your you v map so finish

48
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.420
unwrapping your model.

49
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.980
Think about where you're going to place your seams and optimize your U.S. map to make sure the face

50
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.090
is more prominent.

51
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.650
You may find on your model that the face ends up a very small part of the overall image a video now

52
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.110
and give that a go.

53
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.310
Okay guys.

54
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.140
Welcome back.

55
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.330
Let's go ahead and finish off the UVA unwrap.

56
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.060
Okay so we're back over in blender and the first thing I'm going to do is just try selecting a few edge

57
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450
loops to see if we've got any That suits.

58
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.540
Now this one comes down to the top of the cheek the top of the jaw.

59
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.650
So that's going to be too far.

60
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.850
I do think this one here is going to be our best bet.

61
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.540
So let's bring this down here because that would be underneath the hairline.

62
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.960
Cavers bring this cross here and want some all the way across of course I can then use the loop cutting

63
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.930
tools again.

64
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.040
There we go or loop select tools to select the rest of it.

65
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.550
Now if I go ahead and select this loop here and she goes all the way down the front soddy the have unselect

66
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.160
all of those or just select all the ones down the back.

67
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.800
And I want to avoid actually selecting any on the front.

68
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.560
So let's go ahead and select those for you there.

69
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.640
Before I go any further I am going to mark a scene with control in E and make sure that this bit is

70
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.070
at least started.

71
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.810
Then I'm going to go around and bounced down to the back of the model here and just carry on selecting

72
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.410
these as I go.

73
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.780
I'm going to zoom in here simply because it's going to be a nightmare to try and select these edges

74
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.020
otherwise.

75
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.780
And this is one of those unfortunately slightly tedious tasks when it comes to modelling or he's got

76
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.260
to do something so repetitive.

77
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.690
But it gives us a lot of manual control and there's no other way of automatically selecting just the

78
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.560
ones we want.

79
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.740
So control an E again and mark a seam.

80
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.350
Okay so let's go and see what that looks like.

81
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.080
Opening up a u v image editor.

82
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.260
There you go.

83
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.390
And let's go ahead and also add a new image shall we shall be.

84
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.400
Are diffused maps of let's call it diffuse map.

85
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.970
And let's call it head to fuse map.

86
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.740
Okay.

87
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.070
Now in terms of resolution.

88
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.190
I'm going to choose to go for it too if for right and leave it at that.

89
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.460
So I'm going to select everything here and unwrap and let's see what a mess we get.

90
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.270
Okay.

91
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.820
Now this might be slightly challenging and I can see here in fact but I might have selected.

92
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.670
Yes there's an extra seam on my ears.

93
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.710
Now I am going to go fix that because that will make something unbalanced later on.

94
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.950
So one of them's there I thought I'd got them both no.

95
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.280
Okay so we need this edge here be a martz's a seam for it to match.

96
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.410
And this one here.

97
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.780
There we go.

98
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.870
Mixture of wrong key presses.

99
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.440
There we go.

100
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.060
Have unmarked that lets you ve unwrap.

101
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.490
There we go.

102
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.410
So two ears here are the right size.

103
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.460
Now one of the things I'm going to do is completely hide our 3D mesh for the moment so I can focus on

104
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.820
this.

105
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.850
And you guys can see as well.

106
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.070
So I'm going no using board a select select just the ears and then shift them out of the way.

107
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.220
So I'm going to use proportional editing in fact it's already turned on let's turn it off before moving.

108
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.080
Good place them over here for the moment.

109
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.600
Now of course this textual Naturally unless we tell it otherwise repeats this would end up taking on

110
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.790
whatever part of the texture exists on here we'll move them back in a moment.

111
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:20.460
Because I want to select everything else that's here and see if I can align it that little bit better.

112
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.730
I do want this face part of it.

113
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.920
I mean this is this is a two thousand by two thousand odd pixel picture.

114
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.350
And the head is taking up a tiny proportion of it.

115
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:40.320
So with this with proportional editing turned on we can scale up the head parts of our models.

116
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:48.650
So let's go ahead and do that now and we can scale the whole thing up rather than just the face itself

117
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.190
and then it'll be a bit more uniform when it comes to texturing as well.

118
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.250
Now one thing I notice here is of course you can push it through itself and we don't want to do that

119
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.250
because that will cause some horrible ness as well.

120
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:07.270
So here what we can do is try different types of proportional falloff.

121
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.280
Some will try sharp because that's going to make more of a difference in the middle and less on the

122
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.370
outside.

123
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:21.380
Now if we see when I do this it means that the top of the head and under the chin are basically becoming

124
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.870
more and more compressed in our image and our face is taking up more of it.

125
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.220
I am.

126
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.650
I'm liking that that's now taking up a good proportion of our model or of our image sorry.

127
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:39.410
So the final thing here is to go ahead and how I've still got this one selects its over go ahead and

128
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:39.780
move it.

129
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.190
I'm going to screw things up big style.

130
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.330
So let's make sure nothing selected before trying to move these ears back onto the model.

131
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:54.090
Now ordinarily you do have to be a bit careful when it comes to scaling something so weak chop the face

132
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.530
out separately and scale that up.

133
00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:03.200
You'd find any textures will replying would be different in scale on one part of our model than the

134
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.010
other.

135
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.690
And that will be true here as well.

136
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:11.600
As we go towards the neck or behind the ear so this case I don't think that's going to cause us any

137
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.890
problems even if we do put stubble on.

138
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.220
That should still be fine if it's not we might have to revisit the unwrap.

139
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:25.210
But I've made the face much more prominent so I can add better detail to it as well as your you ve unwrapped.

140
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.610
Go did you get a similar sort of looking.

141
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.600
You've unwrap to me.

142
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.090
If not what did you end up with.

143
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.270
Please share in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
