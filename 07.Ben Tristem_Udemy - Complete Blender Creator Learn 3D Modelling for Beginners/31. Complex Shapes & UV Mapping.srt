00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,110
Welcome to complex shapes and you ve mapping.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,130
In this video you will have a quick tour around my church fault.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,460
It is by far the most complex model that I've got in my entire scene.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,020
And we'll see the challenges that we can have with more complex models.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,550
We'll go ahead and troubleshoot some common unwrapping issues that you may run into and work out ways

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,210
to make an unwrapped easier and quicker.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,890
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,020
So the Volt just to remind you guys is the bit that we haven't really done anything with yet.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,660
There are several of them in the scene here as recency.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,430
There are a few issues.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,380
They overlap one another.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,720
There's some strange edges poking out of them as well.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,970
Have to have a look at that in time.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,030
It's come together really well.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,930
But it's starting to look out of place and a little plane.

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,660
So we could probably do with ah probably not this texture but we can slap that one in any way just to

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:12,070
give it a similar feel even if it's scaled slightly different maybe it's certainly going over the top

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,430
of itself here.

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,090
And in general I don't think it's suitable at the moment for just unwrapping.

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,330
So let's go open the file up and have a closer look at it.

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:33,400
Okay so here is the church vault itself and I will first of all just take you through how it's constructed

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,310
because what you're seeing here is the end result and that's not very helpful.

23
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:43,960
In fact I'm going to probably have to go back from the end result any way and re make some of it but

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,010
that's fine.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,980
That's sometimes something we have to do.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,130
So it's going to turn on all my layers as well.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,020
So I've got something else turned on somewhere.

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,730
There we go.

29
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,420
So the whole thing started with the elodie a which was a very simple is looking funny there because

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,430
I got back face Cowing turned on some was going to turn that off for the sake of trying to show you

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,180
stuff.

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:17,650
So I constructed this basic Voltz and then used it as a basis for some curved base geometry.

33
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,330
So I've gone ahead and created that curve.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,980
There you can see it's more of a square than a curve.

35
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:30,500
But that makes it easier to model with it as well because I can link things to this midpoint in between.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,690
And then I made one going the other way and this one looks a bit different but it's not that different.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,480
It's just got smooth shading applied to it.

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,800
And then I went ahead and did some other things on top.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,670
I put some fake bits where the pillars would go to start to build a tarp and.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,530
Yeah.

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,150
That's it basically and then I skin I joined all these bits together and started skinning if we go to

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,350
the actual mesh itself.

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,030
Hallett's Turn Off these other bits.

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,660
We go to the mesh itself and turn on flat shading certainly helps to see what's going on.

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:17,650
I then went ahead and all I got some more stuff turned on here I'm just going to turn off the length

46
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,580
and I must have been measuring something at some point.

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,210
So the whole part is only this one quarter.

48
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,660
And as you can see it's them mirrored.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,320
To get it.

50
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,140
To get these other pieces out.

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:41,950
Now looking at the model itself you can see that the original arch ways are here and here and under

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,530
here as well.

53
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,210
The reason you can't see some of the other bits if we go into wireframe you can see the original arches

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,140
the ribs.

55
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm going to call the ribs.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,710
There we go.

57
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,520
That make up this and this.

58
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,790
There are simply faces on top of them.

59
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,730
So give it ace top and bottom surface.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:10,930
So now that I've got all of this sort of laid out one of the problems with a u v is well if I try and

61
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,910
utilize this so I then condense that down in so this.

62
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,230
I mean that it so I can't hide it.

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,120
This final model here which isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it's a good halfway

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,110
house at the moment and it's not very suitable for unwrapping Let's see what happens if we try letting

65
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:42,430
blender do it for us so we can see the impacts of having a more complex model and we can go into some

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,010
details in a moment of other things we can do.

67
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,710
So we've got renda result here.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm just going to clear that's going to select it and go into edit monas still got those length items

69
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:59,490
turned on amrullah Select everything unwrap an umbrella you gonna glue unwrapping of you smart you reproject.

70
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,390
Wow look at that.

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,790
Now whilst there is a unwrap it's not very usable.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,970
I don't know which bits which And I'd have to do a lot of cross references.

73
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,480
So this model is too complicated for a basic smarts.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,080
You ve unwrap.

75
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,660
In fact it's too complicated.

76
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,210
Just full stop.

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,180
If we just get rid of the movie image editor for a moment.

78
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,940
This is made up of actually more than one component these windows and the window frame itself so this

79
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:40,740
area here that's doesn't need to be a part of the main model that can be a separate item and that will

80
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,750
make it both easier too.

81
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,890
You ve unwrap in the first place and also when making the vault and introducing it to the main church

82
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,130
I can put windows where there need to be Windows.

83
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,500
The other thing that stood out especially on the Gothic church go see this insitu because we need to

84
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,740
be lean about it not just talk about it abstractly so we have the.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,560
Let's just go in here and just have a look at the aisles and naves.

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,970
Nothing else on here now.

87
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,970
One of the issues with this particular model at the moment is that these bits going across these braces

88
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,220
if you will don't really make any sense.

89
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,210
They make sense to me when I was putting the window frame in as the base of the window.

90
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:43,480
But I didn't really conceive how what would happen if I put all of these bits together and one of the

91
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:53,020
problems that I run into is when we go a long and let's find the transects and put that back on.

92
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,180
Well let's just enable everything else.

93
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,250
You see that the windows facing this way and we need another window here and that's going to be pretty

94
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,890
difficult to do without a separate window piece to go in.

95
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,990
So there's another reason why the window piece needs to be separate.

96
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,110
Now it's worth bearing in mind at the moment that this bit on the end is a customized piece and so's

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,070
this one over here.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Or is that just a scaled version that might be a scaled version.

99
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,740
But this is completely customized.

100
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,340
Which means that any changes I make to these ones will not come across to here.

101
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,100
Some men might have to rebuild that but that's not a problem because that was a very quick scale in

102
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,830
this direction and then put it all back together again.

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,500
You see it doesn't quite line any way so needs to have some more stuff done to it.

104
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,410
So what can we do to our faults to make it better.

105
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:55,610
One of the things we can do is to separate out the things that we don't want as part of the main model.

106
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,810
We could go so far as to separate out the rips and then separate out the roof and then separate out

107
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,870
this that and the other that might be a bit over the top but certainly the main vault itself the support

108
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:15,250
pillars and the roof or the ceiling depending which way of looking at it they are definitely all one

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,180
item.

110
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,210
The window itself is a separate item and so it should be a separate mesh object as well.

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,490
In fact I can call it elodie B vault window to be explicit about it.

112
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,670
So I'm going to have to re.

113
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,660
Well redo this separate them out.

114
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:39,310
Fortunately I kept the old data a duplicated it before solidifying it down to one mesh object.

115
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,850
Turns out that's not ideal in this situation.

116
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:49,630
The other thing that I didn't realize at the time of course is these pet these volpe's share the same

117
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,460
place when we've got more than one of them.

118
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,440
We put them next to one another and we end up with intersecting like that so we end up with meshes on

119
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,850
top of one another.

120
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,680
Of course when we end up with meshes on top of one another we end up with it getting quite horrible

121
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,210
and nasty and we end up with lots of artefacts in our model.

122
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,780
So quick challenge now for you guys.

123
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,270
I'd like you to think about breaking down complex models.

124
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,520
So do you have any parts of your scene that are going to cause you a headache if you try to unwrap the

125
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,410
mess they currently are.

126
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,220
Are they actually made up of multiple components.

127
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,950
In which case it's likely that they need to be separated anyway.

128
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,620
Can they be broken down.

129
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,950
Are they really more than one model.

130
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,920
Something to take some thoughts on.

131
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,620
So pull somebody agao look at your models that you've got.

132
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,840
Think about if you can increase the level of detail to elodie see on any of these is anything you are

133
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,010
doing now going to impact that model further down the line.

134
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,400
Pause video now and give that ago.

135
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,350
Okay guys.

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Welcome back.

137
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,040
Let's have a look at my vault and break it down into its component.

138
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,260
So just looking at my model itself I do have separate items as I've kept them.

139
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:23,570
I think first of all they need sorting out and so before I do anything else will remove the modifiers

140
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,220
that I have applied.

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,130
Obviously if you've built your walls up without modifiers this won't be that much of an issue.

142
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,360
But in this case I'm want to remove the.

143
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:42,040
All those can have both modifiers gone out the window outline again modifiers gone.

144
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,260
In fact this outlined here is completely irrelevant because it's part of a window base.

145
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,990
So this and this are all part of one object.

146
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,720
So the question is should they should be part of one object shouldn't they.

147
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:04,610
We can sort that out so let's make sure that we've got the mirror at all for the moment on any of these

148
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,370
bits.

149
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,830
So I'm going to remove the mirror there as well and you can see him using the mirror to my advantage

150
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,740
and the solidify as well.

151
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,160
And I've got a few other bits that I need to correct on here that stray edge that was somewhere down

152
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,920
the base here.

153
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:23,120
And I'm going to remove these feet completely and make them part of the pillar rather than parts of

154
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
the vault.

155
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,750
Oh looking at that I've also got intersecting geometry here as well so there's lots of things to go

156
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,420
ahead and fix it.

157
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,590
This particular model that doesn't look like it straight down there even.

158
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,750
No it's not so there's plenty of things to go through.

159
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,540
In fact I'm probably going to remodel this with the.

160
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,200
Just making the window by itself.

161
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,860
Here I am.

162
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,990
I'm working on the window at the moment.

163
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:58,870
I've set up a bevell objects to some a circle for there are curve to follow and I've decided to use

164
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,590
Curves because they give some quite awesome results.

165
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,910
So let's just give this a go now so I'm going to select the first point and control and click control

166
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,650
and click here and here you can adjust that in a moment come back through here.

167
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,860
All the way down here.

168
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:26,160
There you can see straightaway that we can start to get some really really nice shapes going on.

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,240
Obviously some of them the tweakings have an not a not so random kennett's that's that's quite nice.

170
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,090
It's a bit cluttered in the middle here and like trying to get things that all crossover at the same

171
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,250
point.

172
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,900
And it looks deliberate servers three things crossing over here.

173
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,920
I will move that in to pass.

174
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,140
There they go a bit more of an interesting shape.

175
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:58,190
So you can end up very quickly with a source of a pattern that might be a little sparse for a window

176
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,400
this large.

177
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,980
But one of the other ones that I was working on look came out and looked a bit like an angel which I

178
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,000
thought was rather cool.

179
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,690
I get round the right way.

180
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
So that was pretty cool there.

181
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,260
And then I tried another random shape and I also tried setting it to vector's to get more of an angular

182
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,850
display as well.

183
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,200
That's pretty pretty powerful on how to get those sorts of quick shapes out there and make it look a

184
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,700
bit more like it was made of obviously stained glass or something along those lines.

185
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,910
Hey Okay so I've been enjoying myself and playing around with various window designs and I've come up

186
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,220
with a few great fun.

187
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm making my way very very quick to do so I've got this one in front of us named window Why don't know

188
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,200
why but there we go.

189
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,440
The standard window profile son was the one we had first of all I've got my angel.

190
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,560
And I have gots this which is my first attempt at squiggling over V over the window.

191
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,740
So all that's left for me to do now is convert these curve objects into mesh objects and then make the

192
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,260
various windows from them.

193
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,400
Right so I've been in I've done my conversions that I need to do sir.

194
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:26,460
Now all those curves are mesh objects I created each one of the windows individually with its own frame

195
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,670
as well I don't think that needs to be separate so that's gotten all the complication of the actual

196
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,400
window part out of the way I've removed the base bits that don't matter anymore so that just leaves

197
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,720
us.

198
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,460
This still somewhat complex object.

199
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,780
It's not just like a solid object.

200
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,570
It goes back on itself.

201
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,510
So in order to get this done and cut it up appropriately we're going to have to use something called

202
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,580
seams and would talk about that in the next lecture.
