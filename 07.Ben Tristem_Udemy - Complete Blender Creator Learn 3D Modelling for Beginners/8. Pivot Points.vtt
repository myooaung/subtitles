00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.630
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.180
And in this lecture we'll learn about pivot points which shall enable us to do things like this.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.460
In this case we have manipulated our pivot points so that we can adjust this trapdoor and open it up

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.800
to various degrees.

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.970
And of course later on we'll learn how to animate that sort of thing as well which is incredibly useful

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.650
as hop into blender and find out more.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.960
Okay.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.080
So the first thing we need to deal with is where is the pivot point.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.220
And what is it used for.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.710
Well by default when you go ahead and you rotates an object it will rotate around its origin.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.410
If you've only got one thing selected.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.360
So in this case we have our cube selected and if we would go ahead and rotate it you'll notice it will

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.570
rotate around that center point the objects origin.

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.280
If I were to include the lamp and the camera as well.

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.110
When we go ahead and rotates it rotates around some arbitrary middle points.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.580
By the looks of it.

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.690
Now that's not an arbitrary middle point that is in fact the median.

18
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.220
If we go up to the very top of our head a bar there is two circles with a dot in the middle.

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.350
Now if you've played with yours that might be different but if we click on that we get a dropdown that

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.460
is the pivot point dropdown and as we can see there you've got a series of options bounding box center

21
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.580
3d cursor individual origins which can be very useful the medium points and the active elements.

22
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.430
So the medium points is the average point of all of these objects.

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.090
Which is why let's whiz round to the top so we can see exactly in the grid where B it is there.

24
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.640
Now the bounding box is gonna be slightly more to the left because what the bounding box will do is

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.370
it will draw around all of the objects including the mesh data.

26
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.700
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to press scale again and just mark roughly where it's going

27
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.480
to be.

28
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.990
So we've got four in and two down roughly.

29
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.800
Okay.

30
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.730
Now if we go ahead and change the bounding box center hopefully it will be different enough.

31
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.270
Yes.

32
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.140
There we go.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.910
It's changed significantly.

34
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.540
And the reason why it's changed significantly is because we're drawing a box around all of our objects.

35
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.420
Now the camera and the lamp are infinitely small they're just the origin point but that cube.

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.460
Well it's two meters by two meters by two meters which changes where the box would be drawn.

37
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.890
And then we go to the center of that box.

38
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.870
I rarely use that option to be quite honest the main ones the IOUs are either the medium points individual

39
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.690
origins or 3D curse.

40
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.980
So let's deal with the individual origins.

41
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.890
Now this is really useful because it does mean that things will rotate around their own origin.

42
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.360
So if I was around to the side here and press the Aki you'll notice that all of these objects are rotating

43
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.620
around their own origins.

44
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.920
Now the lamp because it's of type A POINT lamp I believe it's called Let's go click on the lamp and

45
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.310
check out its properties and the properties pane.

46
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.560
Yes it's a point lamp.

47
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.410
It doesn't have any direction.

48
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.100
If I were to change that to a spot lamp now it has direction.

49
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.010
Now we can select everything and if we rotate we can see that all rotating individually.

50
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.700
If that was still on median they would rotate in a much different way.

51
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.590
They all rotate around together relative to each other.

52
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.310
Finally the 3D cast and now the 3D cast is a really useful one at the moment 3D curses in the center

53
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.840
of our scene.

54
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.620
And if we press the Aki we can move and rotate around that point.

55
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.340
But what it does enable you to do is select anywhere so we can use the 3D selector tool in the tool

56
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.710
shelf if that's not their press the key to bring it up and then we can go ahead and put the 3d cursor

57
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.480
anywhere we want and then it will rotate around that new position.

58
00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.130
If we select another object you've got to remember to go back into the tool shelf and go back to your

59
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.800
selection tools as well to select box.

60
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.570
There we go.

61
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.320
Now rotate around that point.

62
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.510
That's incredibly useful if you're trying to open doors but you need the origin of an object to be in

63
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.680
a specific place.

64
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.290
That doesn't mean it's a pivot point because we can move the origins around and as you've seen when

65
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.720
we're in edit mode.

66
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.170
If I were to move the cube over here and then when we go ahead and rotate.

67
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.010
So if we change our pivot points back out into object mode change our pivot point to medium because

68
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.070
the medium point is just this individual cube here it's going to rotate around there.

69
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.820
So if we wanted it swinging around a central point we can make it do so.

70
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.580
So the final one which I want to discuss here is your individual origins.

71
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.030
This can be really really useful when you're actually modelling.

72
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.630
So if we go into our cube let's select this face and extrude this one out.

73
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.460
So let this face extrude that one out and select this one extrude that's out.

74
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.880
It's a bit arbitrary at the moment but let's select all of those.

75
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.760
Now if we go ahead and just scale is going to be scaling based upon the central point or whatever the

76
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.220
pivot point is now how do we use another shortcut here and bring up what's called a PI menu.

77
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.640
So if we go ahead and press the full stop or period key on your keyboard it'll bring up a menu that's

78
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.510
got those pivot points in it.

79
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.730
So we can change it to the 3d cursor or we can change it to individual origins.

80
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.100
Now it's scaling them individually which is what I intended to do rather than scaling towards the pivot

81
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.710
point we had previously and in this case it wouldn't have been the previous pivot point here.

82
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.510
It would be the medium point between all of these faces which can be a real tough one to find.

83
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.610
It looks like I've got some funky chair leg being designed here.

84
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.860
Okay so there we go.

85
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.690
We've got a very brief introduction to pivot points we're gonna play with them lots as we go through

86
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.090
the course they're going to be incredibly useful whenever you need and articulating objects or as we

87
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.980
just demonstrated here.

88
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.440
If you need to scale multiple objects all at the same time or multiple faces all at the same time but

89
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.900
don't want them scaling in towards the center.

90
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.520
Really really useful.

91
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.940
We need to solidify that knowledge now in the form of a challenge.

92
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.140
Okay so your challenge is to create a doorframe and a door at separate objects and then using pivot

93
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.470
points control the door so that you can open and close it.

94
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.770
And just a reminder how that should be looking.

95
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.760
If you cast your mind back to the beginning of the video you will remember me adjusting a door like

96
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.320
this.

97
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.290
So I've set up a pivot point with the door so I can move it and rotate it around backwards and forwards.

98
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.110
In this case along the y axis and yes this isn't a traditional door this is more of a trapdoor that

99
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.620
I should be making.

100
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.790
So go ahead pause the video now and give that a go.

101
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.880
Hello everybody and welcome back.

102
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.180
OK so I'm going to start off here in a default scene now.

103
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.000
Blenders in spaces ever so slightly different.

104
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.960
We've got a few extra bits here and there.

105
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.500
I'm just in a future version and I've come back.

106
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.650
But the basic premise of everything is still the same.

107
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.810
So let's start off by making this trapdoor.

108
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.890
Let's zoom in to have a look at the Cube.

109
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.530
I'm going to scale it just on the z axis to create the trapdoor itself.

110
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.930
So let's scale it by point 1 and looking at it I think that'll be better if it was scaled a bit smaller

111
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.280
so point nought five nought point nought five.

112
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.850
There we go.

113
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.020
Yeah that's that's about the right thickness.

114
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.240
The first thing I want to do is straightaway name my final trap door because if you're working on a

115
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.240
scene as you start adding things in it could be very very confusing if you haven't done that as you've

116
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.240
gone okay.

117
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.880
So the next thing I'm going to do is create the surround that goes around here.

118
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.400
I'm going to start by using a cube as well.

119
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.780
There's several ways you could do this and you'll probably end up using a different way to me.

120
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.780
I'm going to scale that cube as well down by point nought five.

121
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.550
Now just duplicated the original one as well that would equally work.

122
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:11.030
I'm going to have a look from the top and I'm going to go to my snapping tool at the top make sure it's

123
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.820
turned on when it is turned on I've got it set to increment at the moment so I can snap and move things

124
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.380
around.

125
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.740
And what that should enable me to do is move things based upon the grid that already exists.

126
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:30.050
So if I a g not Z sorry a Y and lift this up we can see we can align things really well providing I

127
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.520
now scale this down by an appropriate factor I can still continue to do that.

128
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:42.650
So if I was to scale this down by maybe point two but just on the x axis sorry the y axis here we go.

129
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.970
We can see that it still matches up with the surroundings.

130
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.290
So then I can like a g y.

131
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:54.080
I can align it if you happen to have created something that doesn't quite align like that.

132
00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.140
You may get the alignment using vertex snapping and then you can snap things to just an individual point.

133
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.950
But because I'm using whole numbers at the moment and they divide through nicely We're absolutely fine.

134
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.450
So that's one of the surrounds.

135
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:17.480
Don I'm going to go into edit mode so that this is all one object as we produce it and then I can duplicate

136
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.180
this bits of mesh with shift and D.

137
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.910
And because we're looking down from the top I can move it or round very freely and puts it on there

138
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.320
I can then duplicate that again rotate it around by 90 degrees.

139
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.870
We don't have to specify an axis because we're looking through that.

140
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.360
I can then move it to the appropriate location and I can we press s here to scale and we need to lock

141
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.690
it to the y axis but you may notice that it's no longer actually snapping.

142
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.510
Fair enough.

143
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.380
How do we get around that.

144
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:56.670
Well if we hold down control it will snap to the grid again it will re enable the snapping functionality

145
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.630
and then finally I can duplicate that again and there.

146
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:07.840
Now this has a series of duplicate vertices over the place but for the moment we won't worry about that.

147
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.010
Now the thing to do is name this.

148
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:17.710
So it's no longer a cube is it's it's a trap door frame I suppose you'd call it that.

149
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:26.710
Now that we've got that named we can tab out the next thing we can do is set a pivot point for our door.

150
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.380
So if I select the trap door which I now have selected I can move the 3d cursor to this end point here.

151
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.440
Now there are multiple ways of doing that.

152
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.040
I'm going to open up the property side bungler press the Anki to do that.

153
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:45.510
I could have also clicked on the little tab go down to view and would just go to the x location of the

154
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.120
3d cursor and we can just drag that out.

155
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.860
So it's going to be one units we've gone negative here and it also needs to be lifted up.

156
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.580
So on the z axis by nought point nought five then it's definitely in the right place.

157
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:06.900
Then when we change our pivot points to the 3d cursor we can then rotate it let's say around the y axis

158
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.650
and it will open and shut.

159
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:16.320
Now if you were exporting this or you wanted your pivot point to naturally be in another place you could

160
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.200
change the origin location to there as well.

161
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.450
But in this particular case don't need to do that.

162
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.880
And if you did do something like that it basically means that physics wouldn't be calculated properly

163
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.340
if you were applying that and several other issues may start occurring when you move the origins around.

164
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.670
You really have to think about your use case when it comes to that.

165
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.330
And of course we'll discuss that in more detail later in the course.

166
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.720
There we go.

167
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.120
That's it for this lecture.

168
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.570
We can press our hair we can open it up and down.

169
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.870
I hope you've successfully made and aligned and used pivot points.

170
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.390
It's open and shut your trap door.

171
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.930
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
