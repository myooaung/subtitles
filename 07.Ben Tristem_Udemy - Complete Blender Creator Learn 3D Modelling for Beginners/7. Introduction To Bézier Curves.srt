Hello everybody and welcome to the section on bezier curves.
1

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
It's the first time we've played with curves so take it slow.
2

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,550
But by the end of this lecture we'll be able to make an outline of our pin.
3

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,840
As you can see here.
4

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,960
And if I turn on empty we can see it perfectly traces the outline of our reference image.
5

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Let's go over into blender and find out more.
6

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,130
So we left off here before way of our reference material the first thing I'm going to do is add in a
7

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,470
bezier curve and I'm also just going to turn off my text inputs at the top here.
8

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,000
So we'll change it back to my outliner so I can use that there.
9

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,350
And I noticed that it's obviously obvious using a text field down here and now we have something in
10

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,930
it.
11

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm going to reveal the header once more.
12

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm just going to get rid of any text that's in there and then I'm going to right click header and toggle
13

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,980
the header off once more and you can see my keystrokes.
14

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Nice and easy.
15

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,230
I will turn them back on right.
16

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,850
So we've got everything set up here and we're ready to work.
17

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,120
The first thing I'm gonna do is just hide the place holder.
18

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,620
We don't need it at the moment.
19

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,950
What we do need is the image so we can trace.
20

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,170
Now I'm going to go ahead and go shift and A and add in a curve object.
21

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,440
Now this curve object we got a series of options that we could pick.
22

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,630
I'm gonna pick bezier and you might go well there's an orange line that's appeared at the bottom what's
23

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,510
going on.
24

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,280
Well if we zoom out we see that a bezier curve has indeed been added.
25

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,910
And if we press tab was that selected we can see what a bezier curve consists of it consists of.
26

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,970
In this case a start and end point for the curve.
27

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,250
And these are both vertices.
28

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,970
And then you've got these handles and if you select to handle and press G here to move it we can
29

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,480
adjust the shape of the curve pretty easily.
30

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,860
Okay.
31

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,200
So there's is the simplistic view of a curve and we can go down here grab the other handle lift that
32

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,270
up and change the curve accordingly.
33

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,120
So there are many many options and curves we'll get into some more detail about them later in the course
34

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:17,460
but that is the fundamentals of a curve, you have vertices and then handles which control how the curve
35

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,020
flows.
36

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,390
Now we do have curve options as well.
37

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,760
If we go over to the property's view and scroll down until you find the one that looks like a curve you
38

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,060
can change the amount of steps within that curve by changing the resolution preview.
39

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,520
And if we turn up really really really high to 64 we get a super smooth curve.
40

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,270
But if we then converted that to geometry later on we'd end up with a very dense mesh I'm going to leave
41

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,360
it at 12 as the default.
42

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,190
And you'll notice as we start tracing around the outline of our pin sometimes we might need more or
43

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,320
less depending on how we're going.
44

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,420
So we just pick an average number that we can work out later on.
45

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,920
Now one of the first things that we'll see here is the curve is at the wrong orientation to our object
46

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,670
in fact instead of trying to factor around getting this to actually fit the right way round I'm going
47

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,950
to delete it so I'm going to press A to select everything to do with that curve whilst in edit mode
48

49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,310
we're not in object mode.
49

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,040
The reason why we're doing this whilst we're in edit mode is it removes all the curve data and we're
50

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,620
going to remove all the vertices.
51

52
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,530
So we still if we have a look in the outline we still have a bezier curve object.
52

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,940
That's the key here.
53

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,740
We're still editing that object.
54

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,490
It just has no curve data at the moment.
55

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,130
That's whizz round.
56

57
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,870
So the front view and zoom in slightly so we can see what's going on now.
57

58
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,250
Let's go ahead on the tool shelf here.
58

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
If you don't have the tool shelf you can bring it out with the T key making sure of course your, your
59

60
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,430
cursor is within the 3D view itself.
60

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,200
And I'm going to go all the way down to the bottom where it gives us an option to draw a curve.
61

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,520
Now I could literally if I was a super artist kind of draw a rough outline around here and then tweak
62

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,110
things as we go.
63

64
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,200
That wouldn't be a bad start at all if that is pretty close to what I'd want it to be anyway.
64

65
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,040
So there you go there's one option if you're a super artist you could just quickly sketch it in, let's
65

66
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,830
say we weren't such a super artist and we wanted a bit more fine control.
66

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm going to undo that and just click once.
67

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,760
Now the initial placement doesn't matter too much but you can refine it over on this control point here.
68

69
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:43,590
This vertex we can actually align it where X equals zero and then we know is exactly where the mirror
69

70
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,040
point is going to be later when we spin this around and the Z.
70

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Well let's also make it zero.
71

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,720
Why not.
72

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,060
Now the next option is extrude and you can see here the shortcut key for is E so much as we've extruded
73

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,490
mesh data before you can move so extrude when it comes to curves.
74

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,760
That's really useful if we press E we can see we can move it and place it in a rough position that we
75

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,540
want and we can do the same again and again and again and again.
76

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,630
And there we go.
77

78
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,500
We're done.
78

79
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,220
But the problem here is when we've done this type of extrusion for some reason it's decided to make
79

80
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,180
our curve less curvy and more straight which is one of the options it's called a vector it just goes from one
80

81
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,560
point to another.
81

82
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,900
So now that we've done these vector points how can we make them a bit more curvy.
82

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:42,000
Well what we can do is we can press A to select all and press V and what V will do is it will bring
83

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,860
up the handle type and you can also find that under the control points menu if we're in this we get
84

85
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,390
the option to set the handle type back to automatic.
85

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,050
This is what we're used to seeing now that we've got it there.
86

87
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,060
It's just a matter of going in and tweaking.
87

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:08,460
And one of the things that you may ask yourself is do we need this many vertices and handles.
88

89
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,540
Is this too much data.
89

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,830
The answer may be yes the answer may be no I definitely know you cannot create this shape with just
90

91
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,580
two vertices because you can't get this inversion going on here and it coming back round perhaps you
91

92
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,130
can't make it three.
92

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:31,110
You'd thoug,think come out maybe here back in and then round again you might be able to get the rough
93

94
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,830
shape but remember at the top here what we really want is the curve coming to a complete horizontal.
94

95
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,920
And the only way of doing that is I'm going to go back to selection mode so I can select this handle
95

96
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,760
and this handle and this control point really need to be at the same height.
96

97
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,550
So I'm going to copy that value for the control points.
97

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,040
You can tell the control point is is highlighted by the way because both the handles are also highlighted.
98

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,490
We select just the handle only that is highlighted and I can paste that value in.
99

100
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,000
That's the only way of making sure you get a truly flat top that it comes in.
100

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,760
And then we'd also go back down and round and also X here its value is fine.
101

102
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,150
It's important though that the control points X value is zero because that's where it stops and we can
102

103
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,300
do exactly the same down the bottom here.
103

104
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,580
We can find well, Z equals zero.
104

105
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,370
That's that's all we need to worry about there so Z equals zero.
105

106
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,460
And you may notice here we've got global and local.
106

107
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,110
So the other thing that we could do.
107

108
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,120
Well let's whizz round to the top here.
108

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,880
The other thing that we could do here is select our control point and make sure that says point three
109

110
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,820
eight.
110

111
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,090
And there we go.
111

112
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,520
Now as we go through we can click and just press G adjust to make sure that line is flowing round and
112

113
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,870
down as you'd expect it.
113

114
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,500
So now if you have lots of control points down your model you will find that you probably need far less
114

115
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,270
a resolution.
115

116
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,950
So if we have that at six you can see that even though it's more stepped there are more control points in between
116

117
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,080
because this is going to be six steps in between each control point.
117

118
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,240
And as we whizz around here we can see that our curve is going round and down our objects.
118

119
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,780
We can see in 3D spaces going all the way down to the bottom there.
119

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,670
And that's important.
120

121
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,590
One of the things that you can end up with and it's worthwhile checking is that you have no tilt as
121

122
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,880
you go down you shouldn't do providing that you've set up your curve in an orthographic and looking
122

123
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,430
directly at your objects.
123

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,750
If for some reason you were slightly twisted you started adding curve data in there's a good chance
124

125
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,850
that you've either got a tilt to it or it's not laying where Y,
125

126
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,200
In this case equals zero.
126

127
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Now if you happen to have created it from the side you'll find that maybe X will equals zero all the
127

128
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,250
time.
128

129
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,430
But what we should find is every one of these handles and control points in this particular exercise
129

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,620
with sitting along the X plane, the image along this X plane, we should find that Y is equal to zero.
130

131
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,260
If for some reason you've made it round this way you'd expect X to be equal to zero throughout.
131

132
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,030
But there we go that's all set up apart from the fact we need to make it just a little bit neater and
132

133
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,220
see if we can get away with fewer of these control points.
133

134
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,160
Obviously the fewer you have the less control you have but you may end up with a much better shape because
134

135
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,050
you're able to control it better having fewer.
135

136
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,060
So what I want to try and convey but when you have this many control points or even more it becomes difficult
136

137
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,950
to adjust the overall shape.
137

138
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:50,100
And remember we're not going for an exact copy around the outside of our pin at the moment we're just
138

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,090
looking for a good trace around.
139

140
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,220
And that leads us nicely on to your challenge okay see your challenge finish off your bezier curve.
140

141
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,630
Now one question more or less control points, I'll leave that up to you to decide.
141

142
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,390
It does depend on any nuances of the shape you want to convey and how detailed you want it
142

143
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,780
overall. I'd like you to adjust your handles to correct the overall shape.
143

144
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,110
Remember we're just trying to trace the outline of our pin and also remember its only one half that we're
144

145
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,960
worried about because we're going to rotate that profile 360 degrees to create our pin and I'll also
145

146
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,430
like you to think about adjusting your curves resolution so that you have an appropriate level of curve
146

147
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,530
detail.
147

148
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,010
Now I know you're new to this.
148

149
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,890
So what an appropriate level happens to be will vary but basically if you're looking at your curve
149

150
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,950
and it looks like a series of jagged straight lines you probably need to increase its, but increase it
150

151
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,940
until it looks like a curve rather than just whacking the number up as high as you can.
151

152
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,460
That's in itself will cause you problems in future if you just whack can number up as high as it can
152

153
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,570
possibly go.
153

154
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,810
You will find blender will crash or even lock up for a very long time, been there plenty of times.
154

155
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,110
Anyway go ahead.
155

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,130
Pause the video and give that a go. Okay everybody welcome back.
156

157
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,330
Let's go ahead now and finish off the bezier curve. Okay.
157

158
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,710
So I'm just looking at how this is going around the model.
158

159
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,310
We definitely need one at the top and one at the bottom.
159

160
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,750
I'm not sure we need this one here I do think we need this one here.
160

161
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,470
Basically you always want a control point at the peak of a curve.
161

162
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,320
And because this is the top part of this curve we're going to need one.
162

163
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,670
And this where it turns around here we're going to need one there and we're going to need one here.
163

164
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,480
That's that's for certain.
164

165
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:59,810
I don't I'm going to try deleting it and just seeing if we can adjust this handle to compensate
165

166
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,850
ooo roughly.
166

167
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,830
This is what you always run into I mean at this point you need to increase the curve resolution as well.
167

168
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,770
But what we're really playing here we're trying to get a shape and it's really forcing it into something.
168

169
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,180
It doesn't really feel like going in.
169

170
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,150
So that feels much more appropriate in the level of detail we've got.
170

171
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,740
And of course we can just tab out and see the overall shape.
171

172
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,860
So here if I grab this handle and just move it around slightly it follows the shape really well, looks
172

173
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,800
good here comes in a bit too tight here what can we do.
173

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,690
Well what the first thing we can do here is just adjust this handle.
174

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,780
Now remember when you were just one handle it will adjust the other ones as well in fact this control
175

176
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,490
points really in the wrong place it really needs to be where it tucks in so I'm going to come out and have
176

177
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,540
another look.
177

178
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,760
Looks good to me.
178

179
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,550
And wear it bulges out here.
179

180
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm just going to move this one up.
180

181
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,030
Okay perfect.
181

182
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,900
Now much like this top one and bottom one I was saying that they should really sit so that the control
182

183
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,520
points and the handle are level with one another.
183

184
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,870
I think that that rings quite true in other places like here.
184

185
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,150
So I think that the X coordinate of the handle and the control points itself should match.
185

186
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,290
I'm going to copy that and paste it into the handle because they are slightly different.
186

187
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,770
Now it is only a very very minor tweak is it important.
187

188
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,150
Probably not.
188

189
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,280
But I'm going to keep it like thats and I like the way that it's curving round.
189

190
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,770
Now the bottom here.
190

191
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,850
Later on in this section we're going to make sure that our pin can sit on the ground flat.
191

192
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,120
It's going to be nearly impossible to actually get this to be flat so we won't worry too much about
192

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,210
it.
193

194
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,160
So what I'll do here is I'll go G and X I'm only moving the handle along the X axis along there and
194

195
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,750
then we can come out and I think that matches it as close as I really care to make any more time spent
195

196
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,670
on this is probably not going to work out.
196

197
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,920
Now there will be some exceptions to this.
197

198
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,360
If you were trying to model something that you were going to 3D print and it was really important that
198

199
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,490
it was accurate then yes.
199

200
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,050
Spend more time on it and make sure it is accurate.
200

201
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,120
In this case that's as close as it needs to be.
201

202
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,940
So I'm going to call that complete.
202

203
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,930
I'm going to call my bezier curve pin profile.
203

204
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,050
Got caps lock turned up and it is important to get into the habit of naming things as your going so
204

205
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,640
pin profile is absolutely fine place holder lie empty.
205

206
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,550
So here we go here's one that we've missed earlier.
206

207
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,170
So this is not really an empty is it's it's our pin reference.
207

208
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,940
And of course you can shorten that's a pin ref or something along those lines.
208

209
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,550
And here I'm going to also append this with pin.
209

210
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,550
And the reason for having a pin place holder and a pin profile and a pin reference is so that's later
210

211
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:11,110
on if we add other things to this scene which we very well might or may not do well at least then you
211

212
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,650
can differentiate between the objects themselves because in this case liberal prefix with the name of
212

213
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,480
the object.
213

214
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,890
Okay.
214

215
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,050
So that's me done.
215

216
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,970
How are you guys getting on please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the
216

217
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,780
next lecture.
