Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,700
In this lecture I want to show you the benefits of grouping things in collections.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,610
When it comes to exporting and importing in-between blender files so we have are seen at the moment

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,260
looking pretty good.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,110
If we go ahead and go to a new blender file and go to append and then go to the file that we've been

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,890
working on I'm going to pull them this hidden area here.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,330
I hate the way that that's hidden and there's no division.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,280
Hopefully they'll sort that out soon.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,580
And now that we're in here I can see that the chess scene and now starts to become the the questionable

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,460
how do I get the models that I want across into the scene.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,680
If I go to objects we get a load of objects so I can bring them in all individually would take quite

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,220
some time.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,380
What else can I do.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,180
I could bring the whole scene in so if I go and select the scene we can then switch to the very top

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,750
scene 0 0 1 and there are entire scene has been brought across.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,830
But once again this has brought everything else.

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,170
So this was a much larger scene that set us in a coffee shop and there are many many more elements and

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,790
we just wanted to pull this one out.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,810
How could we do that.

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,200
Well if we go and just highlight everything here and delete sets we've got an empty scene again go to

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,900
append.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,860
Now we will remember where you were previously so let's go.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,580
Upper level if we go to collections we can group all of our items that we would typically export in

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,880
there.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,350
So we got our black pieces white pieces board camera and light.

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,250
So be good if our pieces and board were all in one collection.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,270
Otherwise we can't bring everything through.

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,620
So let's go ahead.

29
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,850
Let's cancel that.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,330
Go into our chest scene file and start grouping these things together appropriately so very quickly

31
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,490
we can select the black and the white pieces straight away on the left hand side here.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,160
Now the scene view is currently in scenes mode.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,110
We could switch it into view layer.

34
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,370
It's exactly the same at this point.

35
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,660
Now the chessboard itself I'm going to bring out of the collection.

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:10,600
So currently in the view layer rather than scenes I'm going to control and left click on that and that's

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,010
going to select the board and all of the pieces underneath and then I'm going to press the M key to

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,650
move them and I'm going to move them into a new collection called chess models.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,030
And the reason for moving them into a new collection like that is now we have the camera and light sets

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,180
up brilliant.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,890
All those and then we got the black pieces the white pieces and we've got the chess models themselves.

42
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,570
So what we should now be able to do is save our work go and create a new file and I'm going to delete

43
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,280
the default cube and then I'm going to append what's remembered where we were before.

44
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,830
Now I can go ahead and pick up the chess models and there we go.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,760
Everything has come across but it has come across with out all of the extra gump.

46
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,920
So we've now got the camera that exists in this particular blend far and this is incredibly useful if

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,080
you're setting up your scene with lighting and everything else to demonstrate the scene and what it

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,810
can be or this particular model.

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,140
And then you go ahead and export it to a brand new blend file perhaps you're now using this chessboard

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,980
as a set on a table somewhere in a coffee shop or something along those lines then you won't want to

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,880
bring the lighting and the cameras that came with it necessarily.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
And that's how you'd export.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,130
This is also how you might export it's ready into a file that you might want to then get ready for game

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,660
engine exports as well.

55
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,470
So you've got you're showing off file and you've also got your game export file although an alternative

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,520
to that would be to have different scenes within the same blend file.

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,470
Okay.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,830
That's it for this quick tip.

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,490
I hope you find it incredibly useful.

60
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:59,050
I have always found it difficult to manage the export of multiple objects within a blend file and when

61
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,140
collections came along here was a really really nice thing to work with.

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,940
So I would be families useful and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
