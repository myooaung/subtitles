00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,520
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,370
In this lecture we're going to have a quick look at a review and a recap and a bit more knowledge on

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,630
the timeline itself.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,970
Now the timeline is currently hidden down at the bottom here.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,030
You may have already hidden it away.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,310
Let's say you have and you've made the window disappear.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:29,500
You can come down to the lower corner drag up a new window preferably in the horizontal plane because

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,760
that's kind of what a timeline is it's going to progress from the left to right.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,510
Show us when things are happening and we can click on the other window type and find myself a timeline

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,270
now conveniently it's under the animation column and we'll be having a look at some of the other types

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,800
of edits a window that you can use when animating in a future lecture.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,710
So here we have a timeline.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,260
It starts of frame 1.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,450
That's quite common.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,160
And it goes all the way through to whatever frame that you have happened to senses your end frame.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,720
So currently we set this right at the very beginning and we're going back a few lectures here.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,180
So we have starting at 1 ending at 300.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,600
If for some reason we wanted to change that say we wanted it and 200.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,830
We could use the type that indirectly here or with the playback head let's say over 200.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,830
We can go to playback and set the end frame.

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,400
And there you go.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,290
It's as simple as that.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,540
I don't want that.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,620
I want it at the end of 300.

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,570
So that's really useful being able to play left click and drag along here.

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,610
Now you're going to find it quite useful as we start developing our animation to be able to click and

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,040
just scrub backwards and forwards a particular area whilst you may not get it.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,470
Playing back at a smooth rate is very good to see if there is a problem at some point.

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm sure there will be as we start moving it around you may find that one of these frames that suddenly

30
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,870
the lamp flips to a different direction.

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,510
And that's a key point where you may have to add in a key frame to prevent that from happening or indeed

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:12,130
look at the animation overall our timeline is going to be quite simple but you can zoom in and zoom

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,060
out as well.

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,540
That's incredibly useful knowing that you can do that for our simple animation of only 10 seconds.

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,960
That's not a big issue but on larger projects that may be something you need to be aware of.

36
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:32,830
Speaking of larger projects I would always suggest breaking things down into smaller subsections of

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,310
animations rather than trying to do one big thing at once.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,770
And that's typically the case.

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,190
That's why whenever you watch a film whether it's animated or not it has short scenes you very rarely

40
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,000
have a long long scene with the camera looking at one thing for a long time it often switches and changes

41
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,610
about.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,210
That gives you more flexibility as an editor you can swap things in and out.

43
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,500
It also gives you more scope if you make a mistake that you don't have to re render an entire hour worth

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,130
of render where you only need to do a few seconds in between.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,010
But since our lamp let's say jumping onto our box over here is pretty much the whole animation is only

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,330
going to last 10 seconds.

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,640
We don't need to worry about switching things up like that.

48
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,460
Now one of the things that's incredibly useful on the timeline is you can add markers and that's this

49
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,080
end column here.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,730
We've got the option here to add a marker we can jump between markers and I find these markers incredibly

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,530
useful.

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:42,110
So for instance if by frame 150 we wanted the lamp to have landed on the box we can with our cursor.

53
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,400
That's the important thing with our cursor over the timeline press the M key.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Now unfortunately f 150 frame 150 is what that stands for isn't a great name.

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,670
We can go ahead and we can select markers and drag them left and right.

56
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:09,850
And if we want to rename them control an M so we can come in here and say landing and click Okay.

57
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,840
And of course we can go let's say at frame 40 we might want the jump to happen so we go m control an

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,870
M jump.

59
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,780
Now these are only place holders for the moment.

60
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:29,150
I have no exact plan of when things are going to happen but if you start to plan out your main scene

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,460
like this it can be incredibly useful because you start to have an idea of when things need to happen

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,940
by.

63
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,050
So if we know that at 240 I really want my lamp falling off.

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,470
So 240 I've I want it to.

65
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,020
That's a marker here.

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,330
Control M straight away.

67
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,840
Oh did I hit the right keys.

68
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm not sure I did with the cursor over the marker.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,350
There we go.

70
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,510
And I'm going to call that the crash landing.

71
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,420
I think it'd be quite cool to have our lamp jump up here.

72
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:08,050
I'm going to do a quick animation way and when we're up there for it's grass blocked and hit the ground.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Now obviously at the moment this is rotating around something the 3d cursor no doubt change that back

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,970
to medium points and then Yep way splat.

75
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,450
There we go.

76
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,020
So that's why animation in a nutshell.

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,820
But as we start putting it together let's reset all of those movements as we've put this all together.

78
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,630
It's going to start to feel more and more like an animation.

79
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,540
Oh I think I undid too much.

80
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,090
My marker here has gone back.

81
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,040
Let's call this crash landing again.

82
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,540
There we go.

83
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,520
Ah perhaps I didn't click okay or press enter.

84
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,400
Occasionally when you're renaming something.

85
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,640
I think if you don't press enter twice it's not going to accept it.

86
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,210
Now I like the frame numbers themselves.

87
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,780
Some people may prefer the time along the top.

88
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,600
So if you go to view you can show the number of seconds that you don't see the frames and the seconds

89
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,850
at the same time.

90
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:09,840
So as you can see here we carry through an after 30 frames so go up to 29 30 becomes one second and

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,000
so forth.

92
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,730
So this is frame count and then total seconds.

93
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,500
Personally I'm just happy with it showing the number of frames.

94
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,580
I know we're working at 34 in a second and then unless there's something you really need to key in and

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,230
get perfect then this will be absolutely fine.

96
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,580
Now I'm not going to give you an official challenge for this lecture but what I would like you to just

97
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,420
practice is moving about the time line making sure you're comfortable with that.

98
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,280
Make sure you're comfortable with creating some markers.

99
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,010
These may or may not turn out to be useful during this particular section and the other thing is just

100
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,680
double check that you have the right number of frames and you have the right frame rate that's going

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,290
right back to when we started setting our animation specification under the render tab.

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,630
Sorry not under the render tab under the output tab.

103
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,800
We have a start and end frame and our frame rates.

104
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,480
So that is still how we had it set before.

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Now one of the things I will do whilst I'm in here actually is the resolution of 4 k.

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,790
I'm going to put it in as just back to 100 percent for the moment.

107
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,650
Otherwise I'll be wondering why my renders are taking far too long.

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,610
Okay I'm going to save my work.

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,180
This was important save your work often.

110
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,310
Brilliant.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,490
So go ahead pause this video now play with the time line make sure you're comfortable with it because

112
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,890
we're going to be using it quite a bit over the next couple of lectures and I'll see you all in the

113
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,630
next lecture.
