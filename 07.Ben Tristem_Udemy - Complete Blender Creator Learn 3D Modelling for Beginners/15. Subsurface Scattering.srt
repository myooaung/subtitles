1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,980
Welcome to subsurface scattering.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,800
Now what is subsurface scattering.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,640
Well it's a node that was recently introduced into a blender that allows us to mimic a certain affect

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,220
of indirect lighting.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,200
So long it would penetrate a surface of an object in real life.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:29,270
So whether it's a wax candle a glass of milk or even the human skin light doesn't just hit the surface

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,570
and bounce off it as she goes into the surface and that scatters within the surface before leaving the

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,540
skin again.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,250
So the light enters them arterial and then it is scattered in the material by a certain amount depending

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,750
on certain parameters.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,360
Some light leaves the surface at different points in which it entered.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,390
Now the more the distance that the light travels before exiting the more it will be absorbed so you

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,990
will have less of an effect when it's thick vs. when it's thin.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,160
So thicker areas will absorb more than thinner ones.

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,330
Now most shade as we have used so far are an example of direct surface scattering.

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,830
So a diffuse shader is how the surface reacts to light a gloss shade or again is how the surface reacts

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:27,170
to light subsurface scattering is a form of indirect surface scattering where the light enters the material

18
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,310
and to give you a real world example of this.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,380
And I'm sure you might have played with the lights before.

20
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:40,750
I'll just show you a small clip now of what happens when a simple hand goes over the top of a lightsource.

21
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,480
So here we have a simple light.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,090
I'm using my phone lights here and I've got a piece of cardboard.

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,500
As we approach the actual light itself this is an example of subsurface scattering.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,920
The light is entering that cardboard and actually being bounced about.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,150
And if we go and grab my hand as we start to move toward you can now see with the fingertip itself is

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,800
starting to scatter red light.

27
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,090
And if I move my finger down across the light you can see that the light is coming through the finger.

28
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,150
In fact down this gap in between the fingers it is in fact subsurface scattering again the light is

29
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,200
not getting through directly rather than indirectly through the finger.

30
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,620
So before we go ahead and start playing about with the subsurface scattering though.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,390
I'll just want to show you these two scenes.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,000
The only difference between these two scenes is the lighting itself.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,520
They're just spheres with a subsurface scatting material applied to them.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,770
The first one has a three point lighting set up.

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,430
The second one you can see is very much extreme.

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,490
The light is to the slightly to the right and behind.

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,450
And it is just a single Sprite spotlight and that produces a dramatically different effect.

38
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:11,160
So is important here when we compare the two images that you realize that lighting can make a big impact

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,420
to your scene.

40
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,570
So it's quite useful to get that right first before you start tweaking your materials because you could

41
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:26,910
be tweaking your materials based upon the lighting rather than basing it upon what the actual material

42
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,330
should be resembling.

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,520
So now we've explored these particular topics let's go play with the subsurface scattering node a rim

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,750
blender.

45
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,910
So I have gone ahead and opened up a brand new blender file.

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,370
Now there's one important thing that you should know before we get going is that subsurface scattering

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:55,610
is only supported on GP use from the latest version of Blender which is currently two point seven seven.

48
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,040
Before that if each trying new subsurface scattering on your GP you you'll end up with it not rendering

49
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,500
you'll get an error.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,270
And what will happen is the Rendell come out and it'll just be blank.

51
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,630
I just popped over to my P.S. In fact the balls that you've just seen I rendered on my p.c and I had

52
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,720
two point seventy six installed on that particular computer and I had made it on my Mac when over the

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,450
peasey for rendering and found that everything was black had confused me for a few moments until I realized

54
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,270
that I was just running an older version where the GP who was not supported for subsurface scattering

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,280
the cpq has always been so that's fine.

56
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,460
So if you are finding your having rendering problems do make sure you've got the latest version of Blender.

57
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:45,500
So without any further adieu let's go and delete this cube and add in the monkey.

58
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,740
Hello Suzanne.

59
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:54,870
We're going to then get a subsurface division modifier just to make her a little smoother and add in

60
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,270
a smooth shading.

61
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,570
Okay I'm happy with that.

62
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Let's go ahead now and play with the materials.

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,850
Has a couple of ways that we can obviously get to the materials week.

64
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,910
We're going to need the node editor in a moment so let's go ahead and open up the node editor.

65
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,960
There we go.

66
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,010
And we can create new material on the node editor or in the materials properties over here it doesn't

67
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,740
matter.

68
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,340
And once we've created that let's zoom in so you guys can see what's going on and we can see at the

69
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,940
moment it's got a diffuse shader.

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,070
Now eventually when we build up the actual layers that exist for the skin we're going to use a monkey

71
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,270
as an example here.

72
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,990
A We will end up with a diffuse shade.

73
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,610
But for the moment we can just get rid of it.

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,650
If I had one to get rid of everything just the diffuse shade.

75
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,870
So just start with that one subsurface scattering shader.

76
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,390
So under shaders we got subsurface scattering.

77
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,880
Now sometimes abbreviated to just three S's as well so if you ever see s s s that means sub surface

78
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,940
scattering.

79
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,230
And let's turn my view port to rendered mode.

80
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:09,930
Now we can already see this compared to diffuse is already getting light coming through certain directions.

81
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,160
Now not quite sure where my lamp is in the scene so let's just set up the lighting first.

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,610
If I'm going to put the lights almost directly behind Suzanne so we can really see the light basically

83
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,160
come through the ears to get to the front view.

84
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,590
Pull that down can't really see much here.

85
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,380
There we go.

86
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,010
And I'm going to make that quite bright was going make it five thousand or something so let's just check

87
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,300
and see what that looks like Okay five thousand is going to be too much.

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,500
Again that's was around to the front.

89
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,540
Zoom in and see what's going on.

90
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,590
So we're losing all the detail in the years at five thousand So that is far too bright so we can play

91
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,900
this to our hearts content 2000 to hyatt's get down to five hundred k.

92
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,710
That's possibly there.

93
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:07,050
Let's drop it to 300 and we can see that light is coming through the chin as well Suzanne here as well

94
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,740
as the years.

95
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,380
I am happy with that so.

96
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,290
And then right click back on Suzanne so I can see the subsurface scattering.

97
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,370
And there are a series of options there's only one outputs.

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,200
But when it comes to subsurface scattering there's a lot of options.

99
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,300
So the first option at the top is the fall off.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,010
Now this is how quickly the light falls off as it goes through.

101
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:36,540
And these are just different distributions cubic I believe falls off quick of an Gaussian and I would

102
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,930
have to look up that one on Wikipedia but approximate as we can see here it's an approximation to physically

103
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,660
based volumes scattering which is why it's the default setting the colour.

104
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,340
Well that's like you base colour.

105
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,020
And that you can get a texture being plugged into here as well if you want to.

106
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,290
So we say that to whatever colour that is like your base colour for the model itself.

107
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,820
So if I go ahead and make that slightly peachy we can see that colour of we go make vasseur a deeper

108
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,980
read it.

109
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,890
Well it turns red the scale we're going to come back to the scale.

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,180
It's basically a multiplier for these next three options under radius if we cast our eyes over certain

111
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,550
material properties you'll see it's not collapsed here at all.

112
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,480
It's literally just three options that you can get to.

113
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,300
So the radius will come back to in a few moments because the texture blur would only change things if

114
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,280
you've got a texture plugged in here.

115
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,440
And normal is for normal maps coming in as well.

116
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,070
The reason why this has a purple set there's because it has the three values here.

117
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,750
Now with a radius you'd usually think it was like X Y and Z.

118
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,280
In this case it isn't.

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,200
These are r.g. devalues something to set the colour back to white for the moment.

120
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,970
So you get a good representation going to make it pure white so value of one throughout.

121
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,180
So what we should find here is and I'm going adjust them over here so I don't have to keep having that

122
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:16,900
dropped down if I turn the blue channel and the green channel down to zero we should see that it only

123
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,140
scatters red only red light actually exits.

124
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,510
The model itself even though the light coming in is white.

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,040
And again if we go ahead make that zero the nothink will come through before we go in at this one because

126
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
it's R G B.

127
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,780
This should have green light coming through.

128
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,020
Now we can take a while to actually set these up.

129
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,810
And truth be told you're not just going to be using one node in order to get a realistic material.

130
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:51,910
Those balls we saw earlier were just a one node but our skin is more complex than just one node can

131
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,350
do.

132
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
Now you can certainly make this into a group and perhaps use it again and again if you wanted to.

133
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,800
But in general you've got to think of your skin as a series of layers.

134
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:12,940
Now with this subsurface scattering the way that I would tend to set this up and it varies from project

135
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,450
to project would be to duplicate the subsurface scattering.

136
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,290
Twice.

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,530
So then we've got three layers.

138
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,800
So I'm going to call this light deep.

139
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,520
This horn sort of medium and this one's near the surface.

140
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,780
Now with all shade as we're going to have the user mix shader to put them all together.

141
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,670
And if you think about the this it's the deepest will be dark ready colour whether the blood is there.

142
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,000
We've got so like the fatty layer so we'll make that slightly lighter.

143
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,300
And then we've got the surface of the skin and it well it will depend on the ethnicity of the character

144
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,310
you're doing but in this case I'm going to stick with myself so I'm going to make that quite light because

145
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,080
the surfaces of the skin in places can actually be quite light.

146
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:09,910
I need to build these up now using some Mc shaders and we also want to add in a diffuse shader along

147
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:17,410
with this being mixed and a gloss shade because the surface of the skin does have a bit of spec clarity

148
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,420
to it.

149
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,500
And of course that means it's time for a challenge.

150
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,170
Okay.

151
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:33,470
I'd like you to create your nodes set up so you're going to be linking three subsurface shaders representing

152
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,160
three layers beneath the skin.

153
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,830
Then link the final two surface layers a diffuse angle of shader.

154
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:49,580
So there we've got our indirect and direct scattering use the sand for practice or your own head.

155
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,410
It doesn't matter at this stage.

156
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,700
I'm going to be using susanne's if you want to follow along with Suzanne the monkey.

157
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,430
That's absolutely fine.

158
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,100
And play with your settings until you're happy.

159
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,040
Now don't worry about the cloche shader because that might make the model look a bit waxy as if it was

160
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,380
a are made out of a wax essentially.

161
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,900
But we'll be dealing with that shortly in Cape balls video and give that a go.

162
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,030
Okay guys.

163
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,010
Welcome back.

164
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,740
Let's go play with these notes.

165
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,950
Over in blender.

166
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:31,230
Okay so just before we start this I know that if we hop into rended mode we've only got one light from

167
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,090
the back and that's not going to be good to work out whether he's got the colour right.

168
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:46,080
So I am going to make this window a wee bit bigger for a moment and let's grab a top view and set some

169
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,720
duplicate lights just around here.

170
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,880
I'm not going to worry about setting them up any further than that just to create a a three point lighting

171
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,670
that's go so they can review and move that round render it out at the end to see what it looks like.

172
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,500
Kate almost there.

173
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,340
He fills the frame.

174
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200
Oh that's cold back ever so slightly there we go.

175
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,700
Definitely fills the frame now.

176
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,690
Let's hop into rended mode and see what it looks like.

177
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,260
Okay there's much more light in there now.

178
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,330
I'm happy with that.

179
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:21,670
So let's go ahead and start playing with the notes sarve selected the monkey's head again because I

180
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,470
was still on a lamp.

181
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,420
So so currently we've only got this subsurface scattering no plug in.

182
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,660
So let's go ahead and add in a mix shade up pop that's in place there.

183
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,120
And I'm going to join it here.

184
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,020
So then we've got these two shaders next to one another.

185
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,550
Now what we have got here if I look at the radius is it's still a bit funny here.

186
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,850
And what you'll find is you'll end up with a very very noisy image with subsurface scattering.

187
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,120
If your settings here in the radius.

188
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:05,730
How far light is being scattered is completely different to what happens with the actual base colour.

189
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,650
So you got a base colour of near enough red here almost pure red looking at it's not quite.

190
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,080
But it's almost pure red.

191
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,020
Now we're only scattering.

192
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,670
Red.

193
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,980
Green.

194
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,400
Green light.

195
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,650
So that's not going to work very well.

196
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,230
It's going to end up very noisy.

197
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
You're basically confusing the system at that point.

198
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,670
So if we start scattering some more red and less green because there's no green to scatter.

199
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:38,550
We end up with a clean image and the same will have to be applied down here so the radius here are going

200
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,920
to lower these as we go.

201
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,560
This go for points to point to.

202
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:50,140
I think the other warms a little bit on the high side actually or lower side of number four point three

203
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
here.

204
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,580
Again these are all things that we can tweak over and over and over again.

205
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,810
We're going to need another mic shade.

206
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,340
I'm just going to simply duplicate it and plug in this.

207
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Now this is going to be the top most layer.

208
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,870
And we don't want it scattering that much at all.

209
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,850
So I'm go on the very top but there one just spinning if I'm going to make these values very low so

210
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,680
still scattering but not very much because that's that represents the layer just under the skin.

211
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,920
Look at that that's coming together now really well and then zoom in on the head area specially those

212
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,090
is because they're the thinnest part on this particular model.

213
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,770
So we can see that coming through.

214
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,990
Now what you're not really getting at the moment.

215
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,990
It's it's there but not fully is the detail itself.

216
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,060
In fact the detail is mainly being shown up because of the three point lighting system rather than anything

217
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,730
else.

218
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,720
However we can help that by adding the first surface layer.

219
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,050
So it's go ahead and hand in a diffuse.

220
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,790
And we're going to need another MC shader and we'll worry about other things like the values of all

221
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,410
of this and we've got a colour white here that's going to be too bright.

222
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,630
I'm going to actually lower it down to roughly what I have on for my skin that's just a rough guess

223
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,160
there.

224
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,030
Of course depending on the air from this sea of whatever you're making you can pick any colour you want.

225
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,190
Hey you can have an alien one if you wanted and colour Him mean green.

226
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,430
Okay so I'm going to go back to that rough colour I've got here.

227
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,850
So now we start to see some more detail.

228
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,790
I whacked this all the way up here.

229
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,440
Then we've got off the full diffuse few shader and we can lower that back down and just have just the

230
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,550
sub scattering.

231
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,060
Of course we want a mix of everything as we go through this first layer here.

232
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,810
We definitely want more of the base layer coming through.

233
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,540
I think we do I'm going to play with it a bit.

234
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:43,940
There we go.

235
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,110
He is have gone just that little bit red up there.

236
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,440
The thinnest part not so much of this coming through.

237
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,100
We do want some of the diffuse and then take that to maybe around 40 percent or so and then we need

238
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:04,210
the final layer so we can then need yet another mix shader So I'm going to duplicate that and add in

239
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,470
a gloss.

240
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,260
Shake it up.

241
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,940
Now this will obviously add highlights to our model.

242
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,320
And if we go all the way we end up with a very shiny surface and we go all the way back.

243
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,030
It ends up fully well fully whatever this area is here.

244
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,760
So it's a mixture of the diffuse and the subsurface scattering notes.

245
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,540
So I'm going to bring that up to around 15 to 20 percent just so we start getting highlights.

246
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,130
Now this is what I mean by it starts to look a bit plasticky or a bit waxy.

247
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,080
We can certainly increase the roughness if the roughness is too low it's just going to look well very

248
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,940
very shiny if it's too high.

249
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,640
We're going to lose some of that detail in the highlights some more said it's about point three.

250
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
So we've got some subtle highlights there but we're going to deal with the positioning of those highlights

251
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,330
as there's plenty of ways of doing it but not in this particular setup.

252
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,140
So let's just hit the render key and see what this looks like when it's rendered out.

253
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,080
I've not got a set particularly high on samples.

254
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,450
I don't know what I've got it set to is set to 50 samples at the moment.

255
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm quite happy with that.

256
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,260
It's a bit pink so I could go back or not here.

257
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,160
I want to get back to the node.

258
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,740
Ed it's probably this diffused colour here that's bringing that out so if I make that a bit lighter

259
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,680
and of course I'm going to really ramp the samples up now 300 too high.

260
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
That's just silly at this stage.

261
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,830
When I go to 200 just to get a temporary feel of how this is looking I wouldn't ever recommend rendering

262
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,320
it high samples just for a test renders I mean 200 is not particularly high but it's not low either.

263
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,850
You can see this as well.

264
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,820
It was at 50 it's now 200 it's going to take four times longer than it did before and we can check that

265
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:58,990
because our last render was just over eight seconds so I reckon this was going to be around 35 40 around

266
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,630
there anyway.

267
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,060
So it's just finishing off here.

268
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,540
There you go 30 52 Not bad.

269
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,010
We're eight times four is 32.

270
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,670
So there we go.

271
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,460
So that is looking pretty good.

272
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,150
I'm impressed with that.

273
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:16,510
How are you guys getting on did you do this with Suzanne or did you decide to make it start going on

274
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,950
straightaway with your head that you've been working on.

275
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,830
A suggestive you haven't done that.

276
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,680
You go and apply the knowledge you've just learned immediately by applying this sort of set up and play

277
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,630
with it to your particular head model that you're working on as a way share in the discussions.

278
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,380
And I will see you in the next lecture.
