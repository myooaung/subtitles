1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,330
Welcome to introduction.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,940
T you've V unwrapping in this video you will no longer ask what you ve stands for.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,040
We'll do an overview of the mapping that in the upcoming lectures and understand that will be creating

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,150
these maps from scratch and then using them a gain to speed up further work flow.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,070
So we've had this section so far where we've looked everything emack crow how the pieces are all fitting

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,100
together what the overall building or interior is going to look like.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,470
And now's the time to start zooming in on a bit of detail.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,620
So what does it usually mean.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,500
Well X Y and Z are already used for the Cold War donat system with the in blender itself and you and

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,570
V are like the x and y coordinates of an image.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,510
So you v mapping is the process of projecting a 2D image on to a 3D model's surface and the U.S. map

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:07,280
itself as we'll soon see has so as the geometry as the map and it's placed upon the picture.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,480
So let's have a quick look at something we're all familiar with.

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,340
A map of the earth.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,740
And if you're interested in seeing more images like this of our wonderful planets and indeed some other

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,850
wonderful photographs I've gotten this from the nassr website.

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,850
All of their images are free to use so if you actually want to make a planet Earth a model of that and

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,590
will be doing something very basic like that in a few moments then of course that's the place to go

19
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,440
to get these wonderful textures from and remember the word texture or image is interchangeable when

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,820
it comes to blender.

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,020
Now one of the problems with a map of the earth is Antarctica really isn't that big.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,270
And those Greenland Greenlands actually tiny.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,010
So the South Pole is Antarctica right at the bottom there.

24
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,460
Now obviously that is a 2D representation of the earth.

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,080
So one of the dramatic things to highlight here is mapping can cause distortion in image because that

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,790
image then has to be compressed onto a 3-d shape.

27
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:17,000
Now we all know that the earth is flat like this it in fact looks more like this a sphere or spherical

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,900
in nature.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,700
So you ve tells that texture how to apply itself to a 3D surface.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,720
So what do these maps do.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,210
Well they do lots of things what we looked at a few moments ago could be called a diffused map which

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,320
is creating the illusion of colour on the surface.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,410
In fact it is adding colour on the surface in this case but they also create the illusion of surface

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,170
detail by mapping parts of an image to the geometry on our model.

35
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,990
They could be applied automatically which is great for your basic models and that generates a U.S. map.

36
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,570
But generating euv map yourself does give the best results.

37
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,320
So two of the basic maps that will be colour coming up in the near.

38
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,890
So two of the basic maps now that are coming up in the next couple of lectures we've got a diffuse map

39
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,770
which is the base colour of the geometry itself.

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:23,840
So up until this point we've really only dealt with making either individual faces of a certain colour

41
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,080
or applying a certain material to them or we've been dealing with the whole model having the same material

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
applied to it.

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,140
Now the great thing with a map is it allows us to only use one material but use a texture or an image

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,240
in order to control the diffuse colour.

45
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,060
Another one is a bump map.

46
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,240
Now that tells the shader how to react with light.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,980
So a quick example here we've got this rough moon.

48
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm going to call it a moon and we've got this one.

49
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,770
Now apart from the slight lighting differences they're almost exactly the same but you can you tell

50
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,020
which ones which.

51
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,260
Probably not unless you start looking at some of the micro details in the shadows.

52
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,630
So we have this one which is the high polygon version in fact it's one million triangles just over one

53
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,290
million.

54
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,050
It's rendered with a thousand samples and rendered a full ten ATP.

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,880
So it took a little while to render.

56
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,130
In fact it rendered at seven minutes four seconds in terms of its render time.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,290
Now instead we go down to the low poly model.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,630
If you look around the edge you can see that it's a bit jagged around the edge.

59
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:46,860
In fact this whole model is only a thousand triangles again rounded with a thousand samples and rendered

60
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,860
at 10 80.

61
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,650
Now that rendered in five minutes four seconds.

62
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,180
So that reduced our render time by around 20 percent.

63
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,020
Now what that means for us in blender is that we can make a highly detailed model bake that detail down

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,190
to an image.

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,120
Apply that image back to the model and save a shed load on our rendering time.

66
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,080
Now on the one off image it wouldn't be worth it if we were rendering that image over and over again

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,440
like on an animation then suddenly it becomes werefor instead of spending 10 hours rendering you'd only

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,660
spend eight or maybe less who knows.

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,770
Depends what you're rendering on.

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Now of course this has the added benefit if you will rendering diffuse maps and normal maps and bump

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,810
maps and all these other type of maps.

72
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,650
We can then reassemble our whole model externally to blender as well so this has a benefit both within

73
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,200
blender and when making assets that you're using elsewhere.

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,540
So let's now go make a very basic U.S. map over in blender.

75
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,350
Okay so go ahead and open up a brand new blend far making sure you've saved and committed the work you're

76
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,620
currently on.

77
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,950
So I'm going to start off with a default blender seem like this.

78
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm going to remove the cube from it and add a u v sphere.

79
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,370
The name may sound familiar I don't know if there's any direct link between Eevee maps and Yuri spheres.

80
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,400
But here we go.

81
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:27,030
Now in order to make this a bit more easy to see I'm going to lower the segment count quite significantly.

82
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,250
And the same with the ring so it's going to be a very low poly globe.

83
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:38,030
Now I know this is a bit abstract since we're working on an interior but I think a globe is a great

84
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,900
way of representing a map and then applying it in 3D and understanding how the relation works between

85
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,810
the two.

86
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,060
We're have more detailed interior models coming up soon as well.

87
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,830
I'm going to make the size of my globe just a little larger than four.

88
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,940
So make it five.

89
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,820
Going to make it a little larger than one has.

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,080
One is boring for a Globe five.

91
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,580
It's an epic globe.

92
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,420
And under the tunnels smooth shading So it's as smooth as it can possibly be.

93
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,140
Now this is currently got a default material on it which is fine.

94
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm going to add new material and call it Earth because that's the picture I'm going to use.

95
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm currently using nodes which is great.

96
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,480
Now become apparent why that's important in a few moments at colour.

97
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm going to set the colour to use a picture for the colour so I can go here and use image texture.

98
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,050
Click on that little dot and then Image texture.

99
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:42,210
And I'm going to select from the game asset pack sections the world diffuse Naxal map.

100
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,390
And there we go.

101
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,590
This should now be showing.

102
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,750
He says the map of the worlds going to go to material and it's not.

103
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,920
And why isn't it.

104
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,450
Why.

105
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,540
Why can't we see it.

106
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,710
It's because blender doesn't actually know how to map that image to this object.

107
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:04,940
So we need to tell it and we tell blender by unwrapping our 3-d objects.

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,740
We go from a 3-d object to a two day object.

109
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,390
So let's drag out and create a u v image editor.

110
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:23,190
Hop into edit mode over here on our globe on our 3-d object in the 3-d window and we can go meche and

111
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,520
unwrap and we get a series of options you see the shortcut key there is you know we just go ahead and

112
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,760
unwrap now there isn't an image properly applied yet but it's also managed to grab that because it's

113
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,690
using the image itself and it knows it's a movie mapped image.

114
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:47,850
We can see that it's mapped to every face and that's not what we want and that is essentially what this

115
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,390
square in front of us is showing showing us that the whole image whatever the image happens to be assigned.

116
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,990
You map it to every single face and that is no good for this example.

117
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,670
So let's go ahead and open up the Emmy so we can see what's happening and because it's already loaded

118
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,700
into memory we can click the image drop down or drop up in this case since it's at the bottom and select

119
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,380
the image you are going to have to scroll out a little here and we can see the aspects of the race image

120
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,080
is quite wide.

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,860
It's got quite a wide array.

122
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,630
And now and you may need to do this a few times during doing any unwrap we're just going to reset the

123
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,600
unwrap by here in New ingoing reset.

124
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,760
And that means that any of the previous settings stored when unwrapping will have been white.

125
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,150
Now I'm going to speed things up here when I'm going to go into too detail about altering the you v

126
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:44,190
map but actually the generation we can get away here with going a sphere projection because ultimately

127
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,840
we're mapping it to a sphere is not a complicated object like a face or something like that.

128
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,740
Now we can see that it's not got it right not straight away anyway it's truncated half of the America

129
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,140
and the Far East and Africa has gone really wide on us.

130
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,590
That is no good.

131
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,220
So what we can do here is go over to the U.S. image enter and use the controls much like we would if

132
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,960
this were a mesh that we were altering.

133
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,800
So what we can do there is literally scale it with the ESC key making sure that this area is selected

134
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,470
and hitting the esky of course.

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
And remember we can it accidentally invert it will.

136
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,440
Which will make it all upside down.

137
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,220
But here we go we can scale it out as the right sort of height and then we can scale the width as well

138
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,540
with S and X so X is across an y is up when it comes to your pictures.

139
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,840
And then we can use the G key and move it about so all of these are very much like we used to.

140
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:49,170
You can also grab the individual vertices representing this 3-d object and move them as well to straighten

141
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,700
out the u v map.

142
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,960
If you wanted to now remember we're telling lender at this point which one of the faces is represented

143
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,520
on the image so we can move things about and really skew up the image.

144
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,610
If we're not careful so we do have to be careful when we're moving these about.

145
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:14,550
A time you'll be mapping to an image like this or even generating your own image in which case the alignment

146
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,910
with it doesn't matter because you're creating everything.

147
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,720
Now we don't have to worry about this disappearing into the aether over here.

148
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,620
Is she going to warp around to this side of the image and continue.

149
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,570
So I'm happy with that.

150
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,660
Now let's have a look at our globe.

151
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,010
How is that turnout going to hop out of edit mode so I can look around.

152
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,550
It's a little jagged around the edges.

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,670
The polls seem to be roughly in the right place which is not bad for a rough unwrap.

154
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,190
Occasionally these things can go completely adrift and look horrible.

155
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,280
But that's not bad.

156
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,830
Unwrap for such a low poly model.

157
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,870
OK I remember earlier I said that using nose was important.

158
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,700
Well it is if we don't want to create a separate material when working with cycles and blender render

159
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,280
because sometimes you may want to hop between the two.

160
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:09,630
So here's a little tip for you because psychos uses notes by default when we switch over to blender

161
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,900
render.

162
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,000
We can turn use notes off we see at the moment so is earth material node and then no nodes are associated

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,030
with the blender end.

164
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,520
And that's fine if we turn used nodes off this button next to the material name.

165
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
We say you shade those to render the material.

166
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,440
If we click that it disappears we can't see the image anymore and that's fine.

167
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,880
We can also turn this off by the way under the node editor itself as a little thing on here on the IMI

168
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,240
on the node Ed header that we can tick and untuck use notes.

169
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,950
Now what you want to go back to cycles you need to remember to read tic that or press this button again.

170
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,740
Now blend a render we can assign a picture to the few straightaway we need to do it by the form of a

171
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,530
texture.

172
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,490
Now we've already unwrapped our model so it doesn't need anymore unwrapping a special done.

173
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,440
All it requires is a texture applied we need to create a new texture.

174
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,120
Add to that texture.

175
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Apply that image that we've already got in memory so we can click on.

176
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,990
Drop down or in this case drop up a hand click on mean nassr world diffused image and there we go it

177
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:27,240
straight on a couple of things I would do to change this straight away is the lighting itself is not

178
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,660
very good since going to the lighting properties and put sun on it is the planet Earth after all.

179
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,200
But we're not going to mess around with any of the settings for the sun.

180
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,330
And equally if we're in that cycles render of course the image now goes white because we haven't selected

181
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,920
use nodes but we don't select use nodes on the lights we select on the material.

182
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:53,740
If we start our are not sure about this but I think if I use nodes here and I go back to a blender render.

183
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,650
Oh it does still work.

184
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,870
Okay that is good.

185
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,840
I thought it might not if we switch the lighting across sphere here.

186
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:07,860
We need to go to the materials option and click use nodes again and the object is back again.

187
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Brilliant.

188
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,800
I think it's time for a small challenge for you guys.

189
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,690
Okay I would like you to add a wall texture.

190
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,850
So use your own all the wall texture in the asset pack.

191
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,790
It doesn't matter which one you use.

192
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:31,090
You ve unwrap your basic wall so it's gonna be that basic wall piece without the window in it or anything

193
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,840
else CAN START.

194
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,270
Nice and simple with this unwrapping apply the texture to the wall.

195
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,510
In both cycles and blend a render.

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,070
If you find your texture is 90 degrees out.

197
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,430
Try rotating the UV mesh.

198
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:51,850
Now I must emphasize at this point as long as there is a texture on the mesh in both blender render

199
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,980
and cycles you have succeeded.

200
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,090
This challenge will nail down the actual quality of the unwrapping later on in this section pause the

201
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,220
video now and give that a go.

202
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,870
OK guys welcome back.

203
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,960
Let's go map our wall texture to our wall and hop on over in a blender.

204
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,610
Okay so I've opened up my wall my elodie a wall and we're going to start adding some detail to it.

205
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,650
So this is just going to be text to details so still gonna remain an elodie wall or at this point and

206
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,130
melody a wall.

207
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,100
So no extra geometry involved.

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,410
So I'm going to go straight to my materials tab and add new material name the wall.

209
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,870
Following that I'm going to not colour it in white or slightly off white.

210
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,500
I am going to use an image texture to define the colour.

211
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm going to go ahead and open up go to the asset pack and open up this one called cinder block.

212
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,640
Now that that's opened it needs to.

213
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,090
We need to tell blender how it's mat.

214
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,210
So I'm going to close down at my tool shelf and properties of the 3D editor.

215
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,490
I'm also going to add I've moved across switched my viewport rendering to material so the lighting doesn't

216
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,000
matter.

217
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,930
We will need lighting by the way to see in blender end.

218
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,440
Otherwise it will be black.

219
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,050
So before I hop into edit mode I'm just going to plonk a sunlamp in the scene and sunlamp.

220
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,790
The direction doesn't really matter where it's placed as a matter only the direction counts.

221
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,170
I think that will be okay.

222
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,860
I'll literally hop into rended both quickly.

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah that looks absolutely fine.

224
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,380
So let's hop into edit mode on this.

225
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,890
Everything is selected by default and I'm going to just do a basic unwrapped nothing special and we'll

226
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,530
see how that turns out.

227
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,120
So that's looking pretty good.

228
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,240
We just need to go to the picture down here at the cinder block.

229
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,090
Also looking pretty good.

230
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,410
How are we in material mode.

231
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,000
No we're not.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,350
Let's have a look.

233
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,540
Our AK So we've got vats at 90 degrees.

234
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,880
How's the side and this side is right.

235
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,590
How is the edge.

236
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,850
Okay that's good.

237
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:07,180
We can see here looking at the edge on the u v not on TV Surrey on the 3D view here.

238
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,990
It's compressed because the whole edge has been compressed so this whole image has been compressed onto

239
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,110
the edge itself.

240
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:22,660
It looks so surely because of the way the more time line is still pretty much aligned in the right place.

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,900
Not a great alignment but that will do for this initial initial go at it.

242
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,130
That's really good.

243
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,260
Well it doesn't require much in the way of fixing.

244
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,080
Now down this is a bit wonky here are not happy with that.

245
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,150
And of course what we can do here is select that face making sure in face select and then we're not

246
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,640
going to rotate the face in the 3D view that causes all sorts of horrible artefacts but because that's

247
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:55,020
now selected in the U.S. image too we can actually rotate it and we can see it's kind of granular granulated

248
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,810
at the moment so we can go round in notches.

249
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:05,010
I'm just going to type in 90 because it is 90 and press centre that should have sorted that out.

250
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,570
Perfect.

251
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,000
So we've got our first wall piece absolutely sorted.

252
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,410
I really don't care about this bottom piece am at the moment.

253
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,180
I don't care about it.

254
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,880
I might have to make it a separate piece actually because these are stacked on top of one another.

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,160
It's going to make a line.

256
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,270
Now whether or not that line makes it look odd.

257
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,630
I will have to see later on.

258
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,590
Be lean about it and check that it works.

259
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,750
So that's that texture.

260
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,490
Applied in cycles and it's looking pretty good.

261
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,550
If we go into the full view port rendering we can see that that is coming across really well and that's

262
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,640
just a diffuse texture.

263
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,180
We now need to make sure that it's working in a blender and a and a switch across the blender and in

264
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,290
the middle cereal's propertys.

265
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,340
I need to make sure it's not using notes.

266
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,890
So there we go we can now see our objects and make a new texture and then assign an image to that section

267
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,050
because it's still in memory.

268
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,220
I can just select it there and there we go.

269
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,070
Now obviously with Blender render the spec clarity is automatically applied as well so we go to the

270
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,310
materials and go down in there so we can see that the intensity is quite high.

271
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,900
If we go and turn that down we'll end up with a much lower sheyna to the wall.

272
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,760
What was on generally shiny unless they've got gloss paint on them or they are wet.

273
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,870
And in this case I want Neve so often the intensity is going to turn it right down to nothing.

274
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,640
It's a fall diffuse texture.

275
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,100
How did you guys get on.

276
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,440
Did you manage to map a basic image to the wall.

277
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,450
Did you use your own texture.

278
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,440
I love to see what you guys come up with.

279
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,990
And as always please share your work in the discussions.

280
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,400
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
