Congratulations everybody well done for completing this section and I'm amazed at what we're able to
1

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.950
do already and what you've demonstrated.
2

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.600
You were students when you've been sharing over in the discussions how far you can go with just these
3

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.850
simple tools that you've been given so far.
4

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.450
Of course there's much much more because we've only just scratched the tip.
5

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.880
Now there's a couple of things that you can do before moving onto the next section.
6

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.770
You can obviously share your work that'll be really good if you haven't done already.
7

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.040
Now do remember that practice makes perfect.
8

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.910
So if you're not quite sure not quite confident yet to proceed on do make some other models have a look.
9

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.870
Other students have done for a bit of inspiration as well.
10

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.200
If you're getting stuck there are some wonderful things over on the forums so do.
11

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.830
Go check that out.
12

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.710
And finally if you're ready and you're ready to go then let's jump into Section Two where we're going
13

14
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.610
to start manipulating the fundamental bits of geometry vertices edges and faces.
14

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.360
And I'll see you all over there.
15

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.820
Take care.
