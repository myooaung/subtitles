Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.690
At the moment our board is lacking those new pieces we've made so without any further ado what we're
2

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.630
going to do first of all is just append them into the scene.
3

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.130
Now you can do this several ways.
4

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.990
But since I've got several items to bring in wasn't going to do is I'm going to go to my file explorer
5

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.240
and bring them in that way.
6

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.160
Okay so I've opened up my low poly chest certain to go into my models into my pieces.
7

8
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.400
So we need the king sized drag that's in when we do that we can appendage into the scene and find the
8

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.180
appropriate one.
9

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.660
We just want the king.
10

11
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.980
We go.
11

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.190
He's in the scene.
12

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.110
Now we can just repeat that step for the rest of our pieces.
13

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.440
So we need the Queen we need our rook and finally our knight and there we go with all of the pieces and
14

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.990
I'm going to whiz round to the top of our board and then start placing them so I don't know which ones
15

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.070
selected at the moment.
16

17
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.270
So that's press control and space to come out go back into layout mode so I can move things around.
17

18
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.080
I'm going to turn on lookdev because we've got color of pieces.
18

19
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.000
It's going to be quite hard to see what's going on otherwise.
19

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.210
So we have let's see what do we have here.
20

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.800
I can't see with this particular selection it looks like everything has been moved into the black pieces.
21

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.460
So that's something to bear in mind I'm going to move them out in the hierarchy at the moment until
22

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.200
we move them back in.
23

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.870
And we've also brought in a mirror point so interestingly if we move that around we can see our knight
24

25
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.520
is moving or half on Knight is moving around as well.
25

26
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.830
So whilst I'm here I'm going to select my knight go down to the modifiers themselves and apply that
26

27
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.430
modifier.
27

28
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.990
So it's not an issue.
28

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.880
And then we can get rid of our mirror point that's going to head through that's brilliant.
29

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.250
So we have our king now if we turn on incremental moving we should be able to place these relatively
30

31
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.330
easy.
31

32
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.930
The King I believe goes on its own square. What piece.
32

33
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.770
do I have selected here, Queen.
33

34
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.550
This one is going to be the knight.
34

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.480
We're going to have two of those and we'll use Alt and D to duplicate them since they are the same essentially
35

36
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.870
the same piece and then I'll be able to move it to the appropriate location and then the final one is
36

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.610
the rook.
37

38
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.680
Now occasionally do have to click several times to go get the appropriate piece if multiple things are
38

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.030
on top of one another.
39

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.540
In this particular case it hasn't really mattered because we can just move them into place one at a
40

41
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.470
time and then we go we've got all of the other pieces in the anything I would say here is we've got
41

42
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.960
these two here I'm going to rotate them on the Z axis by 90.
42

43
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.700
It's going to move in correctly.
43

44
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.920
However I want to use individual origins using individual origins means they will just spin about their
44

45
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.460
own spot through the points in this case of their origin so rotate Z 90.
45

46
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.830
There we go.
46

47
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.450
They're all facing forward.
47

48
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.540
Perfect.
48

49
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.220
OK.
49

50
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.170
So I'm not gonna bring up challenge slide for this next bit.
50

51
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.610
What I'd like you to do is do the black pieces themselves.
51

52
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.890
And then once you've done that also think about how you might pose your scene.
52

53
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.470
Are we going to leave it like this or are we going to be a bit more dynamic and perhaps have it mid
53

54
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.630
game so go ahead.
54

55
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.540
Pause video now and give that a go.
55

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.130
Okay everybody Welcome back.
56

57
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.250
So there's a few things we need to do here.
57

58
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.250
I'm going to go ahead grab these new pieces every single one of them.
58

59
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.460
Yep that's correct.
59

60
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.360
And normal duplicate them.
60

61
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.000
And then just move them to the other side of the board and take them all on the Z axis by 180 because
61

62
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.660
we still got origin's turned on individual origins on the pivot point.
62

63
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.010
They've all just flipped around.
63

64
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.140
So these ones here can all be moved into the collection black pieces and these ones can all be moved
64

65
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.280
into the collection.
65

66
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.140
White pieces okay.
66

67
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.350
These ones need to get a material applied to them the quickest way of doing that is to select all of
67

68
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.490
them and then have the active selected one be another black piece and then you can go control an L..
68

69
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.650
And that's going to make links in this case to materials.
69

70
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:24.210
And there we go we've colored those in now we haven't got these parented in the same structure as
70

71
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.280
everything else at the moment the black pieces.
71

72
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
They're not parents to the black pieces up here.
72

73
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.470
So what we're going to do here is we've got the bishop the bishop and the black pawns all parented 
73

74
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.570
which is fine.
74

75
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.290
So we just need to select the black pieces as our last piece which I think is hidden from view at the
75

76
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.590
moment.
76

77
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.010
So we're gonna need to turn that on and the best view in the outline to do this in is if we go to the
77

78
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.310
scenes layouts.
78

79
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.820
Here we go.
79

80
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.590
So now we put our chessboard.
80

81
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.300
Our king.
81

82
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.070
All of these new pieces here.
82

83
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.960
But then we also have the black and white pieces.
83

84
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.220
So let's go ahead make sure we've got all of these selected and I think there's some renaming that needs
84

85
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.440
to be done as well at some point under the UN hide the black pieces.
85

86
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.130
Empty.
86

87
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.940
Select it in the outline.
87

88
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.500
Because that's the easiest place to select it.
88

89
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.190
Then you control and P
89

90
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.040
And parent it to that object
90

91
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.970
Now you may have it moving so we need to make sure that we keep the original transform.
91

92
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.610
Otherwise it would disappear like that.
92

93
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.060
And we need to do the same thing here with these pieces.
93

94
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.330
I'm just going to go along and select all of them.
94

95
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.840
And in fact I have missed one this Bishop here.
95

96
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.710
And again I'm going to select the white pieces in the outline.
96

97
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.890
We need to um Hide it first then select it will go lighter orange selected, Active selected control
97

98
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.140
and P, object keep the transform.
98

99
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.370
There we go then I can hide the white and black pieces empty again.
99

100
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.280
So I think that's everything sorted out there.
100

101
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.630
I'm going to come to the king itself here.
101

102
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:04.980
It's called King and the other one is called King 001 so I'm going to call this one king white and then
102

103
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.320
Queen white and I'm gonna go round and speed up the video here and just named them appropriately.
103

104
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.400
Okay.
104

105
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.800
So we're almost done here.
105

106
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.980
If done all the naming I have done a quick bit to research the king and queen actually live in different
106

107
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.250
places.
107

108
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.760
There was me thinking I knew and I didn't it's the Queen that goes on that same color you can tell it's
108

109
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.500
been a while since I've played chess.
109

110
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.250
Okay so I've got everything all sorted here.
110

111
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.250
And we could actually start an opening move let's move this one not in the Z direction so maybe there
111

112
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.250
is one to here I know it's a standard opening this.
112

113
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.200
So that's pretty much sorted.
113

114
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.340
And then of course you could add some random twists to everything as well if you wanted to.
114

115
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.570
So I'm just going to carry on.
115

116
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.620
So we need to protect our pawn okay.
116

117
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.460
So that's pretty good as a starting point the pieces are in a bit more of an interesting position.
117

118
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.730
Okay.
118

119
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.400
Brilliant.
119

120
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.710
How did you guys get on.
120

121
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.710
How did you end up setting up your boards.
121

122
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.580
Did you make the same mistake I made when it came to placing the pieces lots of different things to
122

123
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.440
go on here.
123

124
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.630
I'm really happy with how mine's organized it's not plain and boring with everything all lined up.
124

125
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.670
So this is a great start and we're about to set up our cameras for rendering and we'll do that in the
125

126
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.390
next video.
