00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,350
Congratulations guys.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,920
We've got an awesome human head some of the work you've done so far.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,110
Absolutely brilliant.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,560
Thank you very much for sharing.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,290
Very important So we've learned a lot in the section.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,770
Just to recap we've done materials really really in depth.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,420
Absolutely.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,240
So hopefully this gives you the ability to make things that are close to photo realistic you're going

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,790
to have to put a lot of time in and doing a lot of work to get it there.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,460
And these things aren't easy but you've got all the tools that you need now.

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,730
And it's not quite the end of the Course yet.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,080
No.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,650
There's plenty more to come up.

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,300
And also we've covered good mesh topology incredibly important when you're dealing with this specially

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,950
facial structures to keep things realistic and to stop horrible pinching going on.

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,380
So great work putting some extra time finish a few model polishing up show in the discussions show us

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,670
what you can make and make you proud of what he's taught you.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,210
Brilliant.

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,090
And we'll see you guys in the next section.
