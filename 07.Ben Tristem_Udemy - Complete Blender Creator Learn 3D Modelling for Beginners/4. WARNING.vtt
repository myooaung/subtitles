00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.430
Okay.
1

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.010
This is a serious lecture because you can lose data if you're not careful.
2

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.680
If you already have used blender in the past you've got work that you don't want to be lost do not open.
3

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.160
It's at all in Blender 2.8.
4

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.630
I'm going to say that as that is safer than just saying do not save it because it's very easy.
5

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.210
I know that I will automatically just save something if I'm working on it.
6

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.380
So make sure you've got a backup of all your prior work.
7

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.040
I mean that's a good thing to have anyway regardless of this bit of advice.
8

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.390
But basically if you go ahead and open up something and 2.8 and save it it will no longer open in previous
9

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.540
versions of Blender.
10

11
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.530
Now that is important because there's no way of recovering it either.
11

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.960
So bear that in mind as you're opening up previous work now as we progress forward of course because Blender
12

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.990
is in sort of a beta state at the moment some things may work some things may not work and a few things
13

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.660
may change as you're going through this course if he spots anything like that.
14

15
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.570
Be aware that the next day there is often another build a blender 2.8 coming out.
15

16
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.170
Try that one first and see if that fixes the issue.
16

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.730
I know I've had that with the grease pencil in the past.
17

18
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.160
The next day's release actually fixed those issues.
18

19
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.700
So do try that first and of course just bear in mind that some things it will just crash and then it'll
19

20
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.310
be fixed again in the future so don't worry that's happening.
20

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.430
It's not just you.
21

22
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.560
Everybody is in the same boat so let's crack on now you've been given the warning please make sure you
22

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.620
back up your work regardless of whether you're opening in 2.8 or not.
23

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.300
I can't count the number of times people have lost hours of work because they save and they didn't backup.
24

25
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.910
So that's quite critical to managing your workflow as we go.
25

26
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.820
So let's crack on now and hop on over in the blender.
