00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.600
Hi guys.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.490
Welcome to building blocks.

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.590
And we're going to be talking about simple shapes initially and this is going to be work in a crack

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.320
open blender has start making some stuff as well.

5
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.980
So simple shapes that go together well.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.220
Well they're all basically triangles right angle triangle as a square splits in two.

7
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.460
And that can also make a hexagon which is three general shapes basic geometric shapes that tests late

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.590
all the time perfectly.

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.010
So a right to hang this is just an example of size of course a right Hagel triangle whose sides are

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.020
one and one and the square root of two on the long side.

11
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.570
There we would go together perfectly with a square that's one by one and of course any other integer

12
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.980
rectangles that are one by one by two one by three whatever those will all go together well obviously

13
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.170
we don't want to smaller building blocks and we don't want two larger building blocks because that doesn't

14
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.660
give us much in the way of flexibility.

15
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.600
You can have an I sausalito triangle whose base is one and the sides are two in length which is very

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:19.710
useful for Roof components and things like that and equal lateral triangles of side length one as well.

17
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.310
These will all fit together really well and consistently.

18
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.130
Now those are very basic shape so what are the disadvantages.

19
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.690
None at this stage.

20
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.450
Later on it can feel and is restrictive.

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.170
That is where you want to be customizing and adding detail.

22
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.850
Not in the early stages we really want to be quick and effortless with our development at this stage.

23
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.790
We'll also be seeing that you can type formulas in the fields in blender which is incredibly powerful

24
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.590
and we can use this to solve otherwise complicated measurements in blender.

25
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.890
So let's go make some simple shapes and hop straight on over in a blender.

26
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.710
Okay so now we're back over in blender The first thing I'm going to do is show you the two things that

27
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.880
I've already created.

28
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.920
Now bear in mind I'm in my game.

29
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.390
Asit pack folder that I've carried under assets under meshes so I have gone ahead and created a mesh

30
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.450
object that's a square with the sizes and dimensions.

31
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.630
Here's two by two by 2.5 in the outliner.

32
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.150
And that matches the name of the file as well.

33
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.290
We've got the origin at the zero and it comes out by point to five in height.

34
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.860
Nice simple straightforward shape to make.

35
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.550
And of course we may come back and alter that later perhaps move the origin itself to a more appropriate

36
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.630
location if necessary or if we find we're need to import these more vertically than flat which may be

37
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.980
an option.

38
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.210
Then we can rotate it round and save it again.

39
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.960
The other one is simply this cut in half.

40
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.650
Let's go and open that now.

41
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.810
And that's the right haggle triangle and that is exactly the same as a square just chopped in half and

42
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.720
that will help us with any corner pieces or braces that we need to put together.

43
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.780
Perfect.

44
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.520
So let's go and hop over to something more exciting.

45
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.960
I'm going to open up a brand new blender file.

46
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.560
And let's go ahead and make the equal actual Triangle.

47
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.600
Now this is probably the first and only time I've use Pythagoras's since I've left school.

48
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.970
I knew there was a reason for it but no one really filled me in with the details.

49
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.590
So I'm going to add a mesh.

50
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.630
But this time I'm not going to add a plane or anything along these lines.

51
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440
I'm going to have a single vertex.

52
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.930
Now if you can't see these options that I'm currently using that means you've not turned on something

53
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.070
in the user preferences an add ons.

54
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.990
Let's just have a look down here sorry.

55
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.690
Yes is ADD meche extra objects you need to make sure that is ticked.

56
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.740
And of course save your user settings as well.

57
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.370
The answer add meche extra objects.

58
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.460
Make sure there's a tick in that box.

59
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.870
Okay so I'm going to add a single vertex which is very powerful because I don't want to end up having

60
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.080
to delete lots of things.

61
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.210
There's loads of ways that you can make an equal actual trial.

62
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.740
Now I want it by two two and two so is equal actually.

63
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.260
All angles are equal or side length a quill as well.

64
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.460
Someone extrude this on the y axis in the positive direction by two and then it is going to line up

65
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.100
with our other models that we've made.

66
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.900
Now the question is here.

67
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.180
So let's spin this round of verticals going up.

68
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.290
So the question is here are how do I make these sides and angles right because unfortunately blender

69
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.080
can shape the angle that you've moved a line relative to another.

70
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.610
But it cannot give you accurate angles.

71
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.080
You can't say I want this at 60 degrees which would be equal to a triangle.

72
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.290
It would make it a lot easier but unfortunately you cannot do that.

73
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.220
So what we can do is select this edge and split it in two.

74
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.420
I won't be split it into two we're essentially making the equilateral triangle out of two right handed

75
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.420
triangles and I am going to have to scratch my head for a few moments whilst I figure out the maths

76
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.710
involved.

77
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.900
This bottom one if I remember correctly the two right angled sides are labelled A and B and then the

78
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:43.370
diagonal moving across is C and it's a squared plus B C squared equal C squared horray I remember.

79
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.200
So we need to find out this one here.

80
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.690
No we don't.

81
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.610
That's one.

82
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.120
So this was a Sorry this one's.

83
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.410
Here's going to be too.

84
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.600
So that's going to be two.

85
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.250
This one's going to be one so one square plus some think squared equals two squared.

86
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.610
And we can break that down we know that this is probably going to be four.

87
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.850
This half squared is going to be all point to five.

88
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.490
And there's an unknown here.

89
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.940
So all we can do here is go ahead and select the virtex that we've just created by subdividing which

90
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.950
is smack bang in the middle and extrude in the x direction by.

91
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.740
It doesn't matter because what we can then do is either in this vector area down here in the tool shelf

92
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.340
or indeed on the properties panel.

93
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.500
We've got an x coordinate for the vertex itself and that means we can type in a formula here which is

94
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.200
really really powerful.

95
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.430
Okay so let's go ahead and whatever we're going to have here is going to be the square roots of something

96
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:54.340
and the shortcut for the syntax what you need to type four square root is s q r t.

97
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.200
Square roots and then we need to open brackets and puts whatever we're square rooting in there.

98
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.140
So for instance if we put nine in there the answer will be three.

99
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.620
When we click on that again it doesn't keep the formula that is important.

100
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.450
It's not like excel where you calculate a formula and it keeps the formula in the background.

101
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.320
It just give you the results of that so Eskew Arti open brackets.

102
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:27.240
Okay so we're going to have Let's to see here there's this going to be four which is two squared which

103
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.370
will be this long narrow edge here's a square of four minus.

104
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.480
So in that square or four square root two which is four sorry the square of two was four.

105
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.990
Oh dear.

106
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.170
This is complicated.

107
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.970
And then finally this bottom bit which is one.

108
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.860
So for minus one was one squared is one.

109
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.230
Okay.

110
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.080
So that is the square root of three.

111
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.620
So let's go ahead and do that now.

112
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.280
One point seventy three.

113
00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:01.110
Now what we should find now is that when we join here and here up there we go.

114
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.340
Fill that in and then do this one.

115
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.700
I'm going to remove this vertex in the middle and keep it as a one solid line.

116
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.370
Finally filling in the face and the other ones will point to five all.

117
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.370
So it makes sense here to go point to five.

118
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400
And then of course we can name it appropriately has.

119
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.820
Well now it does look like here that I've gone the wrong way so just try extruding again.

120
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.570
Bye.

121
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.800
Just minus point two fivers have I made my I think.

122
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.450
Yeah.

123
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.420
Is flip around some is going to flip the Normal's there.

124
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.650
There we go.

125
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:45.340
And now when I extrude the z axis by point to five it should go in the.

126
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.470
Sorry z axis not x axis.

127
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.090
There we go.

128
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.910
It's gone up by the right amount.

129
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.000
Now of course have I named things appropriately it's just called verte at the moment.

130
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.690
That is no good.

131
00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:04.330
So this is a it's an static mesh because it's not deforming in any way and doesn't have a skeleton associated

132
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.060
with it.

133
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.250
Ah what do we need to call this an e q.

134
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.690
Try and go.

135
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.440
And it's simply too.

136
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.550
I don't need to give any more information than that because it's going to be two by two by two.

137
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.430
They go to boy by two by four or five and then I'm just going to highlight that all and copy that so

138
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:30.490
I can actually save it and remember that we're going to save that in our directories So go ahead and

139
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.980
have that.

140
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.480
Yes.

141
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.900
There we go.

142
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.490
Excellent.

143
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.400
So we've got there that one all laid out here.

144
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.470
And of course it's time for you guys to have a challenge.

145
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.480
Okay I'd like you to make some basic building blocks.

146
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:53.160
So go ahead and make a nice sausages triangle with a base of two and sides of four blender units in

147
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.800
length.

148
00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.270
You can use the technique that we've gone through or you could use any other technique that you so wish.

149
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.390
Make sure it has a thickness of nought point to five.

150
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:14.500
Now creates the plane and make it into a 3D object of point 2 5 in thickness and the right Hankel trying

151
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.630
always you should be able to derive from the the square that you've extruded out.

152
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:28.580
Make a basic ball with a doorway and window in it see a gun to take that basic plane that you've got

153
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.770
and starts modifying it slightly to create a doorway and a window.

154
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.440
Don't worry about anything fancy at this point.

155
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.450
Make the doorway a simple right rectangle cut out and the same with the window as well.

156
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.580
In fact you can make the window a smaller square in the middle.

157
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:52.460
I would recommend a size at the most we've got to buy to buy a nice size and you don't have to stick

158
00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:02.000
to this recommendation is 3 in height by four in width by point to five in the depth itself and of course

159
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.910
if you make in different thickness walls then you wouldn't have to use pointy 5 at all.

160
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:14.840
If for the size in all of our wall sections at this particular point and remember to save each mesh

161
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.420
individually so pause a video now and give that a go.

162
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.110
Okay guys.

163
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.380
Welcome back.

164
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.970
Let's hop back over in a blender.

165
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.290
Okay so let's go ahead and start with this.

166
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:35.870
Now it is almost a isosceles triangle we just need to position these vertices in a certain place.

167
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.720
We know it's starting from zero.

168
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:44.100
So we can convert this once again in two to right hand triangles and work it out from there.

169
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.700
We need to know this height.

170
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.980
So it's going to be another square roots Eskew.

171
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.680
So the length along here of course is going to have a base of two.

172
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.170
But this is half of that so it's a one.

173
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.740
So it's going to be something else minus that one.

174
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.680
So let's have a look.

175
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.190
This edge here is going to be a four in length.

176
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.260
So let's pop the four in now.

177
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.060
That's it.

178
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.390
And it needs to be squared.

179
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.520
So this is going to be no.

180
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.070
15.

181
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:18.090
It's going to be square of 15 16 which is four squared minus one squared which is once the square roots

182
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.650
of 15.

183
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.160
There we go.

184
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.220
So that is going to give us.

185
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.250
And again I can do that here square roots 15 I could delete and extrude I'm not too fast.

186
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.960
But there we go there's ah isosceles triangle where we can make that very quickly and I'm pretty sure

187
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.200
that this length here we should verify that really.

188
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.360
So let's go down in the display options down here.

189
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.180
And at some point here we go air overlays mesh display edge info length.

190
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:56.040
So if we switch to link here and select that for we can see that the length is four that's quite hard

191
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.570
to see it's a small number on the screen.

192
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.410
But for so we know that that's worked perfectly.

193
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:10.110
So of course I'm going to guess that himesh I guess triangle or I s missed thing there are a strangle

194
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.530
two by four.

195
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.750
By not point two five.

196
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:24.100
That's fine I'm going to copy all of that and go ahead and save that as and paste that in a perfect

197
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.300
save.

198
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.840
Okay so the next thing I'm going to do is start with a two while.

199
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.740
Let's start with a different shape to play in this time your hunger to draw it with that Vertex of it's

200
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.980
get rid of him.

201
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.970
And these from our scene go ahead add a mesh.

202
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.870
Alan Skinner had a single vertex and that's going to sit at our origin which is fine.

203
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:54.670
I went to work in the positive direction so let's extrude this by four in this direction so four in

204
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.740
the wiser Why four.

205
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.590
Let's then extrude that up in the x-axis by three.

206
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:08.800
That gives us an opportunity of course to create a doorway in the middle and we can create various ways

207
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.630
of doing this in fact because we're working in whole blending units here.

208
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.430
I'm going to abort what I'm doing don't like what I'm doing anymore.

209
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.920
The change it's increments which we can see it's already turned onto and the snapping and just turn

210
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.270
on snapping.

211
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:31.570
Now what this means is it's going to move in increments which is really nice because I can go across

212
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.580
here extrude and go up by two in the x-axis.

213
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.420
There we go.

214
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.810
Make sure I am still there.

215
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.410
I'm going to view it from the top to prevent funny stuff from happening.

216
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.420
And Claire I'm going to have to make it on its side but that's fine.

217
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.050
I'm going to go to there and then back down.

218
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.030
And then I'm going to go across for the other four now.

219
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.490
Oh that's too far as.

220
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.930
One two three four.

221
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.100
So I should have stopped a bit further.

222
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.320
Oh dear.

223
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.850
So let's pull that back to there.

224
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.770
Perfect.

225
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.580
I don't know how well you can see my grid it's broken up into tenths of blender units at the moment

226
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.460
which is very useful for a placement of course.

227
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:19.210
Now I can go up by three cross down there and then back to the start point.

228
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.450
Now I'm probably going to have a double there because I didn't turn on Merge vs..

229
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.080
I'm going to highlight everything before I do anything else and hit space and I'm just going to type

230
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.290
in doubles here.

231
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.510
Robbie hit doubles over the side and there we go remove one vertex.

232
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.710
That's absolutely fine.

233
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.720
Now if I could just make this into one huge n gone at the moment that's not a problem at all.

234
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:46.100
Or I can make it into smaller ones so this edge on the top I could split up here and here.

235
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:53.850
I'm just going to fill it in for the moment and then extrude it up by points to five.

236
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.580
So there we go.

237
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.210
That is that one done.

238
00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.220
Of course I can put this doorway in the centre if I wanted to but I'm going to leave it like that.

239
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.840
Finally I need to go ahead and name it and save it.

240
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.400
So I'm going to call this s m wall door.

241
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:20.260
So we know where it is and it is three by four by 2.5 of its height.

242
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.710
Oh oh.

243
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.290
Point two five not 2.5.

244
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.620
So that's height by width by depth.

245
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.580
Just to make sure you guys are following what I'm doing there.

246
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.390
So I'm going to copy that.

247
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.820
Go ahead to here and go in and save.

248
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.990
It's that save hurts.

249
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.680
So we've got we've built up a nice collection of building blocks here.

250
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.650
We're going to use them soon to build some stuff.

251
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.450
But let's start a new file and do a very similar thing.

252
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:53.280
I can modify that and I think that's going to be far too much to do compared to just adding a new vertex

253
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.020
and this time going through and making it ever so slightly different.

254
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.550
So again I'm going to go in a positive direction here.

255
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:08.370
And again the orientation might flip that one round later on I'm going to make this one in the way that

256
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.120
I can see here.

257
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:16.560
So let's turn snapping on incremental on and we want to zoom in just a little and make it four by three

258
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:23.670
so I'm going to go across by four up by 4 3 which is just there and then back across again before I

259
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.630
make that final one I'm going to merge vertices when they meet one another which is there.

260
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:36.200
I can just check up here vertices one of five Okay that's not a 3D object which is also good worthwhile

261
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.200
spinning around and checking that shouldn't happen when in orthographic projection but occasionally

262
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:47.060
does that seem sort of creative 5 for whatever reason so I again am going to remove doubles.

263
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.640
Now a couple of ways you can put a window in here.

264
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.560
I'm going to fill it in first of all when I could insets and have a window there that gives me some

265
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:01.440
control over what's going on so I can move it in by point one or move it in by a whole blender unit

266
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.940
that's absolutely fine.

267
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.320
I want a bit more control over its placement hand size etc..

268
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.980
So what I'm going to do here is actually subdivide it someone.

269
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.850
Subdivide.

270
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.270
Once that's not going to give us enough to subdivide it again and literally take out this middle area

271
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.370
here so of there.

272
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.070
There there there or indeed i could do any number of modifications here.

273
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.700
Okay.

274
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.320
Now once I've done that I'm going to hit the x key and delete the faces.

275
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.350
That's those gone.

276
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:38.170
And we select our entire model and I'm going to extrude it in the z axis by point to five.

277
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.480
That doesn't look like it's moved quite where I want to spin round and have looked.

278
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.980
Yes that's much better.

279
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.220
Now this is a wall.

280
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.680
So it's on its side.

281
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.810
So what we should do here is rotate it so whenever we import it we don't have to keep on rotating it.

282
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.980
We can probably do that with our door section as well.

283
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.570
I'm rapidly rapidly running at a time so I'm just going to rotate this one round.

284
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.160
I need to be an object married at this point.

285
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.180
There we go sir a take on the x axis and it looks like the normals are not quite right here.

286
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:16.490
I'm going to do that by 90 and I'm going to flip my Normal's hop into edit mode and flip them.

287
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.920
I had that dark blue thing going on.

288
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.890
So there we go we've got a war piece there we just need to do the same for the doors itself.

289
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.700
And there we go we've got some basic assets all made up and saved individually.

290
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.980
How did you guys get on.

291
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.740
Did you make a slightly different variants on these assets.

292
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.930
Please share in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
