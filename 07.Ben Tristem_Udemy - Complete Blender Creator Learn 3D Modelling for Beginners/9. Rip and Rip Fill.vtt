00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.130
Welcome to the rip and rip film told in this video.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.410
You'll learn how to use the rippetoe.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.790
You'll learn how to use the RIP filter all too and you'll understand that this is useful when you wish

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.840
to add detail that would otherwise be difficult or even time consuming to construct.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.120
So let's go play with the RIP tool now and hop on over into a blender.

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.670
Okay so instead of working on our lovely head that's coming together really well.

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.110
And incidentally you can see here that we've got a couple of what looks like construction lines are

8
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.190
coppin's.

9
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.450
It made him just see.

10
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.730
You know we've got a couple of these relatively close together and a big angle and we can see that's

11
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.470
actually making some shapes in the surface of our model so we have to refine that.

12
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.870
We do that later because that's detail raavan Features.

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.350
So let's open up a brand new blender file once we've opened up that brand new blender.

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.080
I'm going to get rid of the felt cube an add in a grid.

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.010
So under the mesh options we can add in a grid and the reason for that is it's going to be much easier

16
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.100
to demonstrate the RIP tool in a sort of a 2D plane like this one will hop into edit mode.

17
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.500
Now it's created that's got a default setting of 10 steps in it.

18
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.770
So if yours may look different have you been playing with the grid in a past environment and ended up

19
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.470
changing some of the parameters but you should end up with something that looks roughly like this.

20
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.810
So let's go ahead and first of all work out where Ripp is.

21
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.020
Well it's a virtex command so it would be under the mesh vertices.

22
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.020
And at the top here weaknesses is rip and rip fill now under edges you can actually rip an edge but

23
00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.540
it's still a virtex command because an edge is as we all know two vertices joined together.

24
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.660
Now we go ahead and try and rip that we could see that the shortcut key for that was v.

25
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.950
And we can see here that it actually pulls it apart.

26
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.950
If I move it in the y axis I can move further apart and we end up with this new shape being formed or

27
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.870
in fact in this case a hole in our model.

28
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.210
And that's very powerful when you need to do things like this.

29
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.460
You can already see that we could now select these two and also move them back on the y axis and that

30
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.300
could have been the basis for the eye that we were working on as well.

31
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.500
So there's plenty of options when you come to a model of or which way to go with your modelling.

32
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.230
So we've got this hole in here at the moment.

33
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.310
Of course we can select the edge running around there.

34
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.780
Now what an edge loop there and fill it in if necessary.

35
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.410
But there's a command to do that automatically.

36
00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.040
So let's go over here to a couple of these two and do the same there and I'm going to use the short

37
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.140
key altes and V which means to rip and fill.

38
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.700
And if I just move that again looking at the wires to there then I can grab this area here and pull

39
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.080
that out and we see that we get a very similar shape but slightly different.

40
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.270
The difference here being that these vertices are still connected whereas before they had been broken.

41
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.610
So it's very similar but you do get a slightly different mesh are doing that.

42
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.250
Now the final thing I do want to go over with the report the RIP Phil tool is that if you have explicitly

43
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.110
selected a face or implied a face by selecting the vertices that may cut that face over you go one two

44
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.210
three four we can see the face becomes highlighted if you attempt to use the RIP tool then it doesn't

45
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.200
work you can't rip that out if you want to do that of course.

46
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.120
You could use p to separate it and move it onto another object and remove it in that way.

47
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.380
There's lots of different ways you could do it and then of course you can move that about.

48
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.350
You could recombine that put that back into the meshuga click this one and the other mesh and join them

49
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.930
back together again as we've done in the past.

50
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.610
Now when you hop here this one itself will be separate to the rest.

51
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.860
So if you did ever want to make a hole that's an entire face you're gonna probably have to do it that

52
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.910
way rather than any other way especially if you wanted this piece here to exactly match where you pull

53
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.340
bits out of.

54
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.620
So that's looking really good there we've got the RIP tool all nailed.

55
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.710
And of course that leads us onto a challenge I would like you to go ahead and define the mouth so use

56
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.830
the report or to help define the mouth geometry.

57
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.090
I would suggest using it to split the lips apart once you've got all the construction geometry in the

58
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.790
right place.

59
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.260
Now once again we are defining features rather than adding detail so just bear that in mind as you're

60
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.740
doing the construction.

61
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.410
Now you end up with a triangle or an end go on towards the corner of your mouth.

62
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.990
Don't worry about it.

63
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.140
We'll be sorting that out in a bit when we learn about polls and how we can use them to define where

64
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.910
are on going.

65
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:32.110
And finally remember to use version control or remember to save as so that you have a point to return

66
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.570
to.

67
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.370
If it doesn't go to plan to go ahead pause the video now and give that a go.

68
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.720
Okay guys.

69
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.770
Welcome back.

70
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.810
Let's go ahead and define the mouth.

71
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:54.150
Okay so we're back over in blender hop straight on over into edit mode and turn off the subsurface modifier

72
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.350
whilst in edit mode and whiz round to the front view.

73
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:07.110
Now I've just done a tiny bit of organization in-between videos and I've obviously just broken my my

74
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.100
model my reference material has gone so I need to saw that I'm just going to read.

75
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.050
That now.

76
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.240
This is something that I sometimes suffer with with version control.

77
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.010
My end if I load up a previous version.

78
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.730
But fixing that's not an issue.

79
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.100
So there we go.

80
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.160
I've noticed straightaway and I think it was like this before as well as that my nose and mouth aren't

81
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.160
actually sensual So I've got a whole downshifts doesn't scoot all over the place and just move it into

82
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.250
the appropriate location.

83
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.600
Okay it's probably a little bit too far one way.

84
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.770
I'm not going to argue too much over small details though so they're all dope.

85
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.130
Get So now that we've got that roughly in the right place.

86
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.310
We need to define the mouth some going to go ahead and or whip out the knife tool straight away and

87
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:10.500
cut a round arm model in a way that gets us through and round sir up started a bit Hi there and a right

88
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.280
click and cancel that into this lower one and when the cuts to their well the lip actually goes up and

89
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.390
then down again.

90
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:25.320
This is of course going to create us a well and N gone which will sort out in a few moments it comes

91
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.360
down a winner.

92
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.500
Go all the way to that edge and back again.

93
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.020
And of course this is also going to produce and triangles but I'm not too worried about at the moment.

94
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.010
And now going to cuts through here.

95
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:47.040
And to the end here I am going to apply that with the space bar and there we go we've got our lips roughly

96
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.380
lined up now.

97
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.860
We've got these other lines go around our model here that aren't quite right.

98
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.140
So I'm going to end up with another loop going round here before I do anything else and I'm going to

99
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:05.380
do a bit of modifying with these verses and I'm also going to split the mouth open as well.

100
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.650
I probably do turn proportional editing off at this point.

101
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.220
So that was it back on you smashed the keys instead.

102
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.480
Okay so we've.

103
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.890
And let's just check and see if we've got any loops going round at the moment so there are no loops

104
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.390
working at this present time.

105
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:28.830
So I'm going to grab the knife tool and actually cut this part of the lip orderer want to do that at

106
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.200
the moment.

107
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.390
Now I don't want to do that at the moment.

108
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.970
First of all I'm going to split the lip.

109
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:39.660
That sounds painful but I want to be in virtex smokers I want to say that one of these ones here and

110
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.920
that one they're not the end one.

111
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:49.130
Now I want to move the lip down so I'm going to have my cursor below where we're ripping Empress V then

112
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.350
I should be able to part it's excellent.

113
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:59.840
Now I don't need this virtex here anymore so I am literally going to dissolve that virtex.

114
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.470
Excellent.

115
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.800
So as it comes around here we've got a couple of options.

116
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.400
We are going to have to do something with this.

117
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.270
Scoot back round to the front.

118
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.670
We're going to have to do something.

119
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:17.460
We have this bit here because that's going to break the loop because it's a five sided end.

120
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.110
Gone.

121
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.530
Just try it again.

122
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.060
There there.

123
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.330
Now I'm going to go up to the bottom of the nose but no further.

124
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:31.710
In this case and press enter to apply that let's just make sure the are face loop is now working this

125
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.050
way.

126
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.730
Yep.

127
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.510
And this way suppose to.

128
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.570
So these two aren't quite there yet.

129
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.680
There's a couple of ways that I can sort that out.

130
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:45.120
I can see the subdivide these two edges are indeed cut it through with the knife and speed wise they're

131
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.560
almost the same sarm going to press W and subdivide specials menu and subdivide.

132
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.740
They have you got the tool shelf.

133
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.700
You could use the subdivide button there.

134
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:01.320
Or you could of course gone control an E Broad's have the menu and subdivide it bears Well lots of ways

135
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.440
of doing this or indeed just cut through the knife to I only want one cuts it divides in two and then

136
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.190
the final thing to do here is with the snapping tool turned on it's just merge these vertices together.

137
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.640
So we need to be invert select.

138
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:25.920
And what that should now do if I can plan my model is actually make a loop going round there perfect

139
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:34.860
their loop stops here and this one stops here quite simply because we've got a in n gone just here.

140
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:42.300
Now at this moment in time of course we got to question well how far round do I want to go because eventually

141
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.680
the eyes and the mouth at such will be defined with much more broadly sweeping loops going round as

142
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.380
well.

143
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.730
So at this point in time I'm happy with the lips that I'm going to hop out in to objet men just spin

144
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.200
round.

145
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.970
The lips are looking good.

146
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.550
Their looks like the face is a little bit forward.

147
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.510
Not a problem.

148
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.090
Looks like one of those things out of Dr Who.

149
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:12.390
Forgive me for not knowing their actual name but yes that's absolutely fine for the moment because we're

150
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:18.660
going to have to do a bit of reid's apology here just to make sure that the loop's run round as we expect

151
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.530
them to.

152
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.540
So great how did you guys get on did you manage to define your mouth.

153
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.810
Please share your work in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
