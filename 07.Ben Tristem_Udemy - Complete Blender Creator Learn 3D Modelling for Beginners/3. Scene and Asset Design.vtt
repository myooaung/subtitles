Hello everybody and welcome to your scene and asset design in this lecture with jumping straight into

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.950
the challenge because this is something you can do without even opening up blender.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.220
However what I'd like you to do is design your scene and assets.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.670
Now I already have an idea in mind what mine will be it will be a ground it will be a maybe a box that

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.780
the lamp will jump on to.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.040
So there's going to be three maybe four main things in the scene itself.

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.960
So whether you use Blender pen a paper or whatever you can go ahead and design that scene and as well

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.980
as designing that scene what I'd like you to envision is how your lamp is actually going to look.

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.310
I'm going to keep mine very simple as well so keep it simple.

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.630
If you're new to this if you have done this sort of thing before be more adventurous.

11
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.800
If you have that greater experience now we're going to be mainly focused on rigging and animating more

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.460
than modeling.

13
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.110
That's something to bear in mind if you want to take it the next step and make a really detailed model

14
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.000
then that's great.

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.140
I'm really looking forward to seeing that.

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.450
And remember once you've done that show off your scene and your lamp designs and then of course we can

17
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.660
look back at that later and actually assess how close you were to your concept when it comes to the

18
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.910
final design.

19
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.840
Possibly now and give that a go

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370
OK everybody welcome back.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.200
So let's go ahead.

22
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.360
I'm going to hop into blender here but I'm going to show you the process I went through when designing

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.200
my assets.

24
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.730
Okay.

25
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.000
So first of all in front of us here I've got a digital sketching program called critter or critter you

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.020
may have heard of it.

27
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.890
It is free.

28
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.550
And this would be a great example of how you might use you know even Microsoft Paint in order to construct

29
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.330
your scene.

30
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.180
I'm going to go grab a line tool here and I'm gonna put my ground on and then a box on top of it as

31
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.360
well.

32
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.100
So this is my basic scene.

33
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.360
I don't really need much else and.

34
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.810
This is certainly easier than showing you pen and paper but when it comes to the lamp design I wanted

35
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.590
to go a little bit more not adventurous but I wanted to play with different ideas.

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:14.070
So I'm definitely going to have a base to my lamp and it's going to be a sort of hemisphere light that

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.280
also maybe the top of one and then it needs some way of rotating so there's going to be an inset there

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.670
with I don't know something so the lamp can rotate independently of the base itself and then from there

39
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.700
I'm going to keep it nice and simple I'm going to have an arm or two arms coming up here with another

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.210
arm coming from it which is really useful.

41
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.300
And at the top here I'm going to have what's known as a ball joint which you'll give me the freedom

42
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.080
of being able to move around the lampshade which is obviously a truncated cone that will sits on top.

43
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.290
So let's have a look at my other fully drawn sketch of this particular lamp and see what I came up with

44
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.380
from multiple angles.

45
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.680
Okay.

46
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.590
So here we go here's a rough quick sketch of kind of maybe the system I want to go for I might not make

47
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.220
it this complex but it's a good idea to have a feeling of how complicated you want to make it.

48
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.670
So having a look at it from the front I have not included lampshade here because that's pretty much

49
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.920
either a cylinder or a cone that we strap on the end.

50
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.920
So we've got a mechanism here that we need to think of.

51
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.960
So we've got an arm or two arms going up and then a single arm in the middle of those two going to the

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.610
top of a ball joint.

53
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.970
And again the ball joint is just to make my life easier and enable it to rotate round completely freely

54
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.120
and not look odd.

55
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.510
The base will come down so maybe a tuning fork style coming in here and coming out again.

56
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.650
I'm not quite sure I may blend these two things together and not make such a complex mechanism down

57
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.790
here and just keep it simple.

58
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.010
This arm here this arm here and the ball joints at the top.

59
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.520
But that's something that I might be aiming for during this as you can see here is nice and simple sketching

60
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.800
I've just hashed it to show you the individual components it's easier to see the side.

61
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.780
I'd love to see what you came up with as well have you gone for this sort of very basic design so you

62
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.300
can focus on the rigging or animation and if you've gone that step further I'm really looking forward

63
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.760
to seeing what your concept lamps are going to be and how they progress as you go through the rest of

64
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.390
this section and actually bring them to life over in blender.

65
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.850
So please do share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
