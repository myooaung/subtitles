00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome to reusing shaders and materials.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.930
In this video you will no longer have to keep making the same basic shaders and materials again and

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.680
again.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.720
We often call for a basic wood a material plastic material a glass etc. and we have so far to create

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.830
it.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.430
Every single time.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.490
But wouldn't it be great if you could just pick from a library the moment you start working.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.950
Of course it would be great.

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.820
So you'll learn how to start your own library of shaders and materials so you can access them whenever

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.040
you want.

11
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.660
And this also gives you the ability to continually improve your shaders and materials and add to them

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.270
as you grow as an artist.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.710
So without any further ado let's hop straight on over in a blender.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.070
Okay so in front of us we have the default blender file.

15
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.090
So let's go ahead and I'm going to get rid of my soft cube that's there an add in a sphere because it's

16
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.470
a lot neater and easier to work with.

17
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.520
Scroll up.

18
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.530
And I'm also going to shift it up on the z axis by a one blender unit.

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.180
I'm now going to create a plane to work on.

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.880
You can see the sort of standard workflow that I'm going through at the moment and repeatedly over and

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.740
over again.

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.100
Now I'm going to add a smooth shader to my sphere and I'm also going to subdivide it a couple of times

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.910
just to make it super smooth and click apply.

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.240
So that's a super smooth sphere on a floor.

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.050
Now going to hop into rended most straightaway and minimise this down we're going to create a standard

26
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.190
shader that we've created a couple of times already which is a mix between the gloss and a diffuse with

27
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.800
a friend Nell mix.

28
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.630
So let's go into the know.

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.250
Ed excellent that's ad material.

30
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.490
We don't have one.

31
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.170
We are on the plane at the moment.

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.410
Now the plane I do want to actually have something attached to it I want it to be a chequer.

33
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.180
So for the colour input I'm going to add and texture as the input a chequered texture.

34
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.330
And I have a plug that straight across.

35
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.820
Perfect.

36
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm just going to race this scale that should make the squares smaller.

37
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.810
I'm going to go for 20.

38
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.630
There we go.

39
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.820
So you've got a kind of a surface for it to work on.

40
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.140
Right I'm happy with that.

41
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.220
Apart from we haven't named the material so I'm going to call this chequer floor.

42
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.470
I can just about see through my mike from the sky in front of me anyway.

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.780
So we've got now this sphere to do so let's.

44
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.580
That's not the spear that is the sphere that we've selected.

45
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.600
Okay so we've got a diffuse shade.

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.860
We need a gloss shader we need to mix those together so gloss not glue smoked glass.

47
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.350
Excellent.

48
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.650
Going to select them both and using control in 0 to mix them.

49
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.250
And then the final edition is the friend nail So let's go ahead and add in.

50
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.550
All right key combination helps friend.

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.260
Now there we go.

52
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.320
So that's a great start to that set up.

53
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.240
Now I want to be able to control this glossy shader with a bit more finesse.

54
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.480
In fact the glossy show there and that if you shave the roughness values.

55
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.610
So I'm going to lower down the roughness value here and just see what's going on.

56
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.160
Have we got the reflections that we want along the edges.

57
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.920
Yes we have that's absolutely fine.

58
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.010
So we're going to get on to making sure first of all that this shader is all grouped together appropriately.

59
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.370
Now one final thing I want to do is give myself a bit more control so I'm going to add in a maths node

60
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.700
plug the output value in both into both of those roughnesses and change that to power.

61
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.230
Case I am liking the set up here.

62
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.740
That is my basic set up son going to select all of the components that are with in this set up so all

63
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.860
the way from power all the way through for a nail diffuse glossy and mix shader and I use a shortcut

64
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.130
key we haven't grouped anything in a while but is control and she and that's going to put it into a

65
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.720
group.

66
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.290
Now whilst we're in this group we can start manipulating now.

67
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.610
The output is what comes out and the input is what we can.

68
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.350
What we actually can input control things.

69
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.100
So for instance here I might want to control the normals for everything.

70
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.140
I'll certainly want to control the value for everything.

71
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.740
That's why this isn't behaving quite right so we're going to have a value slider on the group input.

72
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.260
Now the problem with it just coming across as value is it says value over here.

73
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.630
That doesn't mean anything let's hop out of this group with the tab key and we can see we've just got

74
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.720
value.

75
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.610
It's exposed that control but because it's called value.

76
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.490
It's really no use to us whatsoever.

77
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.950
So go back into that group and change the name of that and we can do that in the properties panel if

78
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.500
it's not open press the N key to reveal it and we can see we've got Scott value here on the Imber and

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.960
we got a name there so set of calling it value we can call it roughness because that is essentially

80
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.050
what it's going to be controlling.

81
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.290
Now that's in there.

82
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.950
I'm also going to change the value of that too.

83
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.510
I can't remember what it was before.

84
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.680
Between 2 and 5 some may settle for 2.5 now.

85
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.310
Other ones that you may want later Ron are your normal maps so you can control things.

86
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.630
So I'm going to plug all of those into normal.

87
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.220
Okay.

88
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.840
And the final thing there I can see is the colour.

89
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.930
So we've got some control over the colour.

90
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.610
Now when we talk about we can see it's exposed the normal roughness and the colour sevi I lower the

91
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.500
roughness down to point 1.

92
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.460
It should end up a lot more glossy than it was before because should be passing on that point one across

93
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.560
and now I can change the colour as well so I can make this a red ball of a saying you can certainly

94
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.370
see the chequers in that much more easily okay you can see here it's actually having that fanelle value

95
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.080
applied properly because it's getting glossier and glossier towards the outside.

96
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.630
Excellent So there's one final thing to do here.

97
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.330
Before we do anything else and that is to name things appropriately.

98
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.760
This is currently called node group and that is no good at all.

99
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.900
So let's go ahead.

100
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.950
Properties panel here let's change node group to p.b. are plastic.

101
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.920
And so we've got this set up now.

102
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.380
Our plastic it's named it at the top.

103
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.320
So we should be good to go if we need to bring that in to another one of our scenes.

104
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.560
Now if we wanted to do this I'm going to save this file now single file save and I need it.

105
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.310
Call it something solona called it p b r.

106
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.880
Test.

107
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.510
Save the blender file.

108
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.430
Okay.

109
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.300
The final thing I want to just check here is my material itself is called material at 001 so I'm gonna

110
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.160
call this PBR plastic.

111
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.520
Cause what we can then do is penned this in two other scenes.

112
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.780
If we want to.

113
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.610
So let's go ahead and go file save.

114
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.440
And then actually start up a brand new blender far and we end up back here again.

115
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.930
So now we've done that beacon go to file a and to add it into this scene.

116
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.050
And if I go and find PBR test here we go.

117
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.170
There are two places we can visit if we want to bring the cross the material we can see the two materials

118
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.810
there check the floor and PBR plastic we can bring them straight into this scene.

119
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.000
If we only want to move the node group across and set up materials afresh each time we can go to node

120
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.360
tree and you see PBR plastic there.

121
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.680
Excellent.

122
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.760
Now once it's in the scene.

123
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:18.980
We will need to make sure it has a fake user otherwise or a real user of course.

124
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.810
But otherwise when you save your file it'll disappear.

125
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.850
And of course that leads us onto a challenge.

126
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.250
I would like you to start your library.

127
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.950
So go ahead and add two materials to your blender start file.

128
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.540
Remember the fake user.

129
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.250
Otherwise it will disappear.

130
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.180
Recommend.

131
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.800
I do recommend a pending so the original is in the start up far.

132
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.620
So if you've already created an awesome material in one of your other projects that you've been working

133
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.290
on you can actually now append it into this start up file so you can use it again and again and again

134
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.750
of course appending it means that the starter file is the source file it also means if you need to change

135
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.170
something you can change it in the starter file.

136
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:09.530
Just remember to save it save your start-up file to make sure that you've solidified that change.

137
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.780
The one thing I would impress upon you is remember what you're seeing on your screen at the moment.

138
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.140
You save your start-up file is exactly what's going to appear every time you start a brand new blender

139
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.740
file.

140
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.690
So make sure you sort things out and tidy up just before you hit back save.

141
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.050
Go ahead and also add to node groups to your start-up file.

142
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:38.370
So have you found yourself not only having to set up obviously repeats materials all the time but have

143
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:44.280
you also found yourself having to set up basic node groups again and again and again are you always

144
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.470
doing glossen to fuse in a mix shader.

145
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.930
Well why not group them together so you can just put them into your scene very quickly.

146
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:58.110
We've already seen that node Wrangler auret Automatically assigns a texture mapping with control in

147
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.680
t automatically adds those three nodes in there.

148
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.920
That's kind of like how this is going to work but only add useful things of this group rather than things

149
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.540
that take seconds to do.

150
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.490
Obviously we're practicing at the moment but later on you'll want to do this with more complicated things

151
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.060
so you don't have to keep setting it up.

152
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.170
Every single time.

153
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.320
Certainly speed up your work flow no end.

154
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.440
Finally consider anything you repeatedly had to set up over and over again.

155
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.890
It's important that this is not a shortcut to just doing something once or for a simple task.

156
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.630
This is a shortcut to stop you having to do the same thing repeatedly.

157
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.450
Now you might want to consider also in your scene a series of test objects to test out your materials

158
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.220
and demonstrate them.

159
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.570
Now you may also want to consider not putting these on Layer 1.

160
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.090
So if you need a preview in test materials you switch yourself over to one of the other layers so you

161
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.660
can work on it from there.

162
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.210
But if you just want to get on with your work you don't have to worry about removing those other objects

163
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.060
from the scene.

164
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.090
And of course hide them away if necessary as well.

165
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.280
In the outliner.

166
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.070
Put them under a an empty called Test objects or something like that so you can keep them out of the

167
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:17.610
way of being rendered accidentally so you can keep them out of the way in general aswell so borza video

168
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:23.940
this might take you a little while to practice and sort out and bring some new materials into your library

169
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:32.090
perhaps try a couple of textures as well in there perhaps rock or wood as two examples how you can do

170
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:40.030
your desks or floors outside concrete things like that supports a video now and give that a go.

171
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.130
Okay guys.

172
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.260
Welcome back.

173
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.850
Let's go to materials and to know groups over in my Start-Up file.

174
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.590
Saan going to append this PBR plastic into my file since it's already on the screen ready to go.

175
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.670
And I'm also going to go ahead and spend that other material.

176
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.780
PBR last if I could a pen a floor as well.

177
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.870
And let's move this test object.

178
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.040
Well that's not a test object.

179
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.500
Let's get rid of that.

180
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.090
I am going to move in my chequered material actually as well.

181
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.510
So let's go ahead and pen the chequered floor.

182
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:24.130
I'm just going to construct a basic scene so I've got a plane I'm going to scale that up.

183
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.020
I'm going to go to my materials and there should already be a check a floor there.

184
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.170
Now of course if I apply these to objects now I don't need to give them a fake user but whilst I'm here

185
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:40.400
I am going to give them a fake user as well so that if any points I decide to remove it from these objects

186
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.970
while I'm practicing I'm not going to remove them from this blender.

187
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:51.650
Some going to go ahead here with this plane and move it to l.a. and I'm going to move it to the rear.

188
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.770
The last layer.

189
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.390
And I'm going to go to that layer.

190
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:54.910
Okay.

191
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.390
Now from this last layer.

192
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.630
And when I add in a couple of mesh objects I'm going to add in Suzanne the monkey and hunger.

193
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.410
G.

194
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.170
Z one.

195
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.800
And I'm going to move my 3-d cursor.

196
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.340
To Z equals one as well so these next few that I add so are seen.

197
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:22.230
Move Suzanne along from there yet the next ones I add to the scene here I'll be able to see straightaway.

198
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.620
I'm going to have mice ecosphere as faceted one because it just looks cool as a crystal.

199
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.060
And what shall I had finally.

200
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.480
Let's had a Taurus have not added to Taurus for a while and glamour tourist nice and smooth as well.

201
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:43.810
So I've got my various objects here Suzanne I am going to subdivide a couple of times subdivisions surface

202
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.840
modifier.

203
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.780
And add smooth shading.

204
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.600
I'm going to do a very similar thing to my sphere but not so many.

205
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.730
All I did was solidify I want subsurface division.

206
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.680
Apply and smooth that out.

207
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.460
That's agony.

208
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.380
Leave like that.

209
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.570
Now I am also going to make this one nice and smooth as well.

210
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.970
And make it a smooth shade so I've got my few objects here and I'm just going to move my camera to reflect

211
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.300
that obviously this is gonna change the default camera position but I don't care.

212
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.900
In this case now going to add this flaum will go into rended mode.

213
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.950
This floor is currently got PBR plastic.

214
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.840
I'm going to change it to.

215
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.520
Check the floor.

216
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.460
Excellent.

217
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.450
Seems a little dark in here for some reason and I'm not quite sure why ever turned off a lamp or anything.

218
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.750
No I won't.

219
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.990
It does seem up to.

220
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.040
Yes the lamps on like one.

221
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.960
Fair enough.

222
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.560
I can see what's going on there.

223
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:51.630
Okay so my ball here has got a PBR plastic on it cause I'm already in the start-up up file here.

224
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.400
I can create my materials afresh in this file or together some long ago new here.

225
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.290
I only call this crystal c r y s t l o vissel K.

226
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.700
It does not help when you cant really see the keyboard underneath.

227
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.880
So we got Crystal here and Anna say that to a glass shader.

228
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.720
Okay so we've got V.

229
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:20.880
The crystal surface here am now going to go into the node editor itself and see if we can refine this

230
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:27.120
a little further and I'll be back in a few moments once I've tweaked about for a few minutes.

231
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.990
Okay so a little bit of a lie there.

232
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.110
I spent quite a bit of time rather than have fume.

233
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.470
It's just playing with my set up here so I've moved everything over to lay low or the very final layer

234
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:48.030
here and as we can see by look at the examples here I've turned off everything but the lamp in this

235
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:55.340
last layer which is a an exact duplicate of the first lamp on layer one has turned everything on.

236
00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:02.790
As we've said we've got a we've got a series of items here and a series of materials as well a pick

237
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.940
from I remember to give them all a fake use to survive.

238
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.310
You decide to delete any of these or don't.

239
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.660
The actual model themselves I don't delete the actual material.

240
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.190
Let's just have a quick look at how all those look.

241
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.240
Take a few moments to render out.

242
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.320
Okay so that's finished rendering out there and we've basically got a chequered floor.

243
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.090
A plastic ring a terracotta teapot a fire ball or just something.

244
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.840
I was playing around with and came up with something quite fanciful there.

245
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:39.260
A wooden monkey and this faceted sort of gem crystal type thing.

246
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.910
I've been working on there so we can take a look at a couple of these you don't have time for a deep

247
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.760
dive into any of them.

248
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.030
Which ones should we have a look at.

249
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:55.440
Let's have a look at this tea pot here so I'm going to hide everything else.

250
00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.710
Starting to render out here we can see that this terracotta teapot has a texture to the surface.

251
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.990
So let's go have a look at the notes set up and see how that one was set up.

252
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.480
Okay so we'll start at the far side.

253
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.060
The right hand side because this is pretty familiar to us.

254
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.530
We've got our two notes that are quite standard diffusing glossy chaser's mix and for for a knells shader

255
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.780
into a mix shader and to the material outputs.

256
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.990
Now the difference comes this side and it's literally just a texture.

257
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.810
So let's have a look at how it's structured.

258
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:40.560
First of all we've got a texture coordinates now the texture claudina Simply tells blender how to map

259
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:48.750
the actual texture to the surface of our object subset its object so it generates the coordinates for

260
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.480
us without having to worry too much about any seams or anything along those lines and because we're

261
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.520
just using a noise texture and nothing else.

262
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.070
That's absolutely fine.

263
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.690
In fact this noise texture here.

264
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.470
If we isolate it we can see what's going on.

265
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:12.660
So um troll shift and click VAT's and then click it again take a few seconds Blender's running a little

266
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.310
bit slowly for me.

267
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.490
Or not responding.

268
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.060
There we go.

269
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.970
I don't know why that was being a bit slow there.

270
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:26.650
I think I'm just having a bit of a slowness issue on the computer anyway so we can see that we've got

271
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:32.800
a black and white output from this noise texture and it kind of looks like some clouds I suppose.

272
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.140
Now this is being put into the bump anode and when that happens is being plugged into the height of

273
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.660
the bump.

274
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:46.340
My notes so we've got high points and low points and that is being spat out as a normal.

275
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.580
So we go to the bump the head itself ends preview that.

276
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.220
There we go.

277
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.100
We can see.

278
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.060
We get a textured output from it.

279
00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.910
Now when we have a look at these individually you can see that the glossy has a little bit of an effect

280
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.570
on it.

281
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.890
The diffuse has a lot.

282
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.510
But even more is the for a nail itself.

283
00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:17.750
It's affected massively by the actual normal mapping is self and that gives us the nice sets of textured

284
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.350
results over the top of the surface.

285
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.790
Of course we can play we can make it look even more mottled by simply increasing the strength to maybe

286
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:32.790
point five really starts to bring out those particular bumps in the surface of the terracotta.

287
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:33.620
Excellent.

288
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.580
How did you guys get on what materials did you end up creating.

289
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.980
I've obviously gone for Terry Cotterell and some other wacky ones here and obviously I can branch out

290
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.080
and create more as we go on.

291
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.180
Remember to share your materials that you've made in the discussions in fact link a blend file there

292
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.340
as well so we can she share our materials.

293
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.600
As you start making them and I will see you in the next lecture.
