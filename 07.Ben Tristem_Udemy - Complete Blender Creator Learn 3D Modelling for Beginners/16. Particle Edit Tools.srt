1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,050
In this video we're gonna be experimenting a bit more with hair we're gonna be giving hairstyles doing

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,150
a bit of combing and brushing and moving around hair particles to create different effects with our

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,140
hair.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,520
Okay let's start a new project file new general I've already done that.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,960
So this is what it looks like now.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,280
It's going to turn a couple of things off.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,060
I normally don't bother doing this with you because it gets a bit repetitive but I'm going to go up

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,340
to my overlays which is up the top near the render buttons click on overlays turn off 3d cursor and

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,940
turn off the floor just a little bit cleaner for the moment.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,940
Select our cube I'm going to double click or F to rename that to head and we're going to find a modifier

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,190
so we'll click on modify our properties add modifier and the modifier will be adding We'll be a subdivision

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:52,450
surface to change the viewport to see for and we'll change the rendering to four as well just to make

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,090
sure it doesn't feel left down we'll click on Apply and we can declare this looks like a head near enough

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,190
is good enough we're just experimenting at the moment I'm gonna hit shift D and then that will duplicate

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,990
right click just to leave it back in exactly the same spot rename what I've just created to be scalp

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,640
scalp is that how I spell scalp scalp I think so and I'm going to hide the head so it's sitting there

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,710
but we don't need to see it with scalp what I want to do is basically delete all of the faces that would

18
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,050
be not where hair is going to grow out of this head Alice pretend head that we've got here so I'm gonna

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,260
come at this from the probably from the front from the y axis at the front and you could mirror with

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,160
this but I'm just gonna do it really fast and loose to jump into edit mode and I've selected on vertices

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,940
that's fine fine what I think is probably the midpoint actually I'll do this right from the very front

22
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:51,460
view find right the middle delete all of those I will delete the vertices okay I was in an x ray mode

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,620
so I missed the ones at the back.

24
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,460
Now I am in a x ray mode up in the top right select like slight delete the vertices.

25
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,400
Okay now let's okay from the perspective of what I'm going to see at the back that's kind of roughly

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,150
where the hairline of my crazy character is gonna be I want to get these ones at the front as well I'm

27
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,820
gonna change back to more of a solid view X I'm just looking at the front not out of Sorry get out of

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,780
the x ray view and hit scrolling so I can see all of my head the hairline is kind of a bit of a natural

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,770
way that the subdivision has left my cube so hit see on my keyboard and find the top left corner sorry

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,550
I'm gonna undo that I'm just going to face mode right click to get out of that and then undo face mode

31
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,560
now hit see again selects select like I can do shift select if I think I've made a bit of a mistake

32
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll come back to that bit in a second just get my area yes down here okay and then is paint in the

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,340
middle that I'm gonna be deleting shift to that get that far corner.

34
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,670
Got it.

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,160
Okay.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,860
Right click to get out of that mode.

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,820
That looks good enough for the rough area.

38
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,790
Hit delete on my keyboard delete the faces.

39
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,150
Excellent.

40
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,310
So then we have a bit of a scalp.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,980
And now if you turn the head back on you can see that the scalp is sitting right on top of the head.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,660
What do we do that.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,920
Why do we bother with this process.

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,840
Well it makes it very easy for us to say just put hair on the whole object and that's what we're gonna

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,340
do right now.

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,210
So find yourself the particle properties click on that and then we'll add a new particle system and

47
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:27,460
rename this to be scalp I guess is a good thing to call it scalp hair click on hair and nothing's happened

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,750
because we're in edit mode sorry.

49
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,770
Back to object mode and we have a whole bunch of hair let's decrease the size under the emission window

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,620
scroll down doo doo doo doo doo.

51
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,910
Make it kind of generally the size hair that you want it to be.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,780
Not too bad.

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,970
I'm going to give my hair some color straight away.

54
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,950
Let's see we'll go to materials a material on that.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Probably the same material on my head I reckon so I'll go and create a new bit of hair material click

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,100
plus new double click changes to be Hey I'm just going to call it straight up hair I think or a head

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,760
hair.

58
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,960
Head Hair.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,770
Apologies if you can't see that head here.

60
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,550
Now we'll make it.

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,950
I think I'll make my go I have black hair just for fun black hair black hair black hair yep pretty good.

62
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,400
Why is it not showing.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,350
That's because we haven't told our hair to use that color.

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,190
Let us go back to our particle system.

65
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,590
Scroll down to find a render on render.

66
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,270
We are going to change material to be had here.

67
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,850
And then it should become black.

68
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,780
Excellent.

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,810
And our head is still white.

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,760
Not a problem.

71
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,880
One thing that we don't actually want to see is this kind of head scalp thing.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,850
It's a little bit weird isn't it.

73
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,880
So I'm going to turn off show emitter on render but it still stays there and if you're like me you can

74
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
search for a long time trying to find one Earth it's still there.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,530
We need to scroll down to find viewport display and then also turn off showing me.

76
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,290
Now the emitter is gone.

77
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,210
You might say Oh but I can't see what's going on.

78
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,520
Well we turn back on the head and there we go.

79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,480
The hair is looks like it's coming straight out of the head.

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,660
And no one ever need know that we've actually got this extra object down there that's acting as the

81
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,560
emitter.

82
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,380
We've got a whole ton of hair particles here.

83
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,270
That's go back to scroll up go to the amount of hair that we've got and turn this number down probably

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,230
to 200.

85
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,800
I think the idea when we're working with hair is that we want to have as few possible to get the result

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,050
that we want so that it's easier to find them and manipulate them and to move them around.

87
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,250
I'll show you that in a second.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,790
So maybe 100 and then obviously as we did in the previous video we can go add children to give it the

89
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,100
volume that we want.

90
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,090
We can either click simple or interpolate it.

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,600
Now I've got to make this hair a little bit tough so you can't see it.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,820
Let me go I'm putting a whole bunch of extra.

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,300
There we go.

94
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,610
Extra hairs in here.

95
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,790
And as we did last time we need to go to render properties and ambient occlusion.

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,280
Now you got to see it a lot easier on screen distance I'll put up to about one.

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,860
There we go.

98
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,720
OK.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,010
And what tab on my own here.

100
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,140
That's probably yeah.

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,170
Well they will sound the materials preview OK.

102
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,010
So you've got a whole bunch of hair that's coming blank straight out of out of our unit just here.

103
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,990
I wanted to show you the difference very briefly between clicking back on the particles properties between

104
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,460
symbol and interpolated.

105
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,640
Now to demonstrate this I'm going to reduce the number of hairs that we've got on our head down to say

106
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,230
10.

107
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,370
So 10 hairs we're currently on.

108
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,750
Simple as our children and you can see here that they clump and the clump is based upon our radius value

109
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,810
of point two.

110
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,860
If we increase that it spreads it out it basically has a radius from the parent particle hair particle

111
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,630
to the children well all the way down.

112
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,490
Then you get the children staying very close to the parent which is good to have.

113
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,740
And the reason that we want to have one parent and many children is if there's any sort of physics calculation

114
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,240
or calculations in general going on then it can be calculated on the parent and it can just blend I

115
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,670
can say to the children just do exactly what the parent is doing rather than having to calculate every

116
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,830
single individual strand of hair separately.

117
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,800
So that's why we use children and don't just put in a whole bunch of the parents.

118
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
OK that's simple now interpolated.

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,960
It says I'm going to do try to do a better job of spreading the hair between the children between the

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
parent hairs that we've got.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,660
So it spreads it out and you don't have that control over having a group or the radius size I guess.

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,790
So why is this important.

123
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:20,100
Well I think when we're doing little strands of facial hair you often want to have the clumps be close

124
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,390
together whereas if you're doing head hair you might want to be interpolated into say just do this for

125
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,720
the entire hairdo.

126
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,960
Now you increase the amount that we've got let's see 300.

127
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,900
Probably a little bit more than that maybe 500.

128
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,510
Obviously if your computer is not enjoying that you've got more on there then you can do less but we'll

129
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,550
start off with 500 and see how we go with that.

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,840
OK.

131
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:49,290
We've got this weird kind of hair just sprouting out now here's for the magic of particle edit and he

132
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,440
got to the top left where says object mode and scroll down fine particle edit and we get a whole bunch

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,180
of tools.

134
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,220
Now I've got just a few hairs in here.

135
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,140
How many hairs grow up scrawls grow up.

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
I've got just 10.

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,190
This is great out.

138
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,820
It says no more changing how many you've got.

139
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
There's 10 in there.

140
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,090
OK.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,360
Cool.

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Great.

143
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,970
And if I go and modify these then it will modify all the children.

144
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,190
What I mean by that well I can click on the first or the comb tool maybe increase the brush F to increase

145
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,300
it and you see I can brush their hairs when I first saw this in blender I was mystified so I can have

146
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,900
all the hairs going floating around that way wind swept to the right jump back into object mode and

147
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,210
look at that all the hairs now magically pushed over in that direction back into particle Edit Let's

148
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,440
see what else we can do here.

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,510
Well I might say I don't actually have enough parents.

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,210
I want to have more in that area so I can click on add up the top.

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,240
You can see radius that's the size of my circle count.

152
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm gonna put that down to one which means that every time I click I'm going to add one new hair standing

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,370
to attention on top of the head.

154
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,020
This is great.

155
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,570
If you want to have a lot of control for example you want to have say one two three four five hairs

156
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,540
round the side will jump over into object mode and then from there you can see has added a whole bunch

157
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,240
of new stylish hairs from there I could go into my comb so back into particle Edit I know there's junk

158
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,090
but a bunch of jumping between particle and edit in object mode.

159
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,790
But that's the way we get a good look at what's going on.

160
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,190
I increase my brush size and maybe here I'm going to.

161
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,290
Sorry I've missed something I need to be on comb I am brushing that down I might have these hairs going

162
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,120
down side now there's three ways that I can be comb your three ways to manipulate these hair strands

163
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,550
up on the top left you can see that we've got selection mode path that's modifying as I comb it it's

164
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,750
modifying the entire path the next one along is point which allows me to zoom in on get precisely in

165
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,820
on a particular point and just move that point all those points any point that you mouse over you can

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,390
see the black dots to get that kind of looks like spider legs now doesn't it.

167
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,380
Or I can modify the tip and as I move that it's just moving the tip of the hair if I want to go and

168
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,450
modify in here you see it's not actually affecting anything but when I find the end of the hair it is

169
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,920
modifying that's a lot more difficult to drag it all the way down that's good if you wanna get that

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,810
nice curl at the end of the hair such as that we'll have a look in object mode and you can see we've

171
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,480
got all this hair brushed down to the side now we still want to be applying our regular old modifications

172
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,090
so if we look back on particle properties if we scroll down scroll down scroll down we can find for

173
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,420
example roughness and play around with for example random to get a little bit of a different feel so

174
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,500
it's not quite so pristine and perfect if you want perfect you go for perfect if you want have a little

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,030
bit of Scrabble in there you can also kind of looking a little bit weird let me go back to particle

176
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,720
edit I'm going to find the puff tool and just kind of puff these out that will have them separate stand

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,180
to attention I'm going to put this back to path stand to attention and just basically like giving someone

178
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,850
a little bit of a blow drying with the hairdryer down at the salon.

179
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,790
There we go.

180
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,350
I do want a couple of extra strands in here is going to pop a couple back in at the back.

181
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:18,070
Don't don't don't give me some control at the back here and another couple on top just so I've got some

182
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,950
coverage.

183
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,320
Coverage how's that look.

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,500
That looks spectacular.

185
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,470
Wonderful.

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,840
Every now and again it's nice to hop into the range of you.

187
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,350
We might want to do a couple of things just very quickly here.

188
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,510
Jump on our light and move that around to a bit of a nice spot.

189
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,090
That's good and something I haven't done much with you but I like to go into world properties find the

190
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,100
background and the colors just click on color and just drop that down a loop to make things a little

191
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,590
bit darker.

192
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,360
I find it gives a nice contrast when the background stock or hadn't been doing that with the renders

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,130
we've been doing so far but I find that gives a little bit of a nice look here so we've got our light

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
shining on our hair.

195
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,370
Isn't that beautiful.

196
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Now a little bit more tweaking I want to do make sure I'm clicking on scalp back over into particle

197
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,170
edit going to hop back into one of my friendly views to look at now I might say this here around the

198
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,070
side is a little bit too long.

199
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,580
So they can do is find the scissors and it literally allows us to give our character a haircut just

200
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,560
snips the hairs down at the end very very handy we had to do that so I'm gonna give this guy a bit of

201
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,180
a short back and sides

202
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,740
okay let's see how that looks back over into object mode okay that's looking delightful probably a little

203
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,600
bit tall at the top there's a couple of ways we can address that as well back over into particle edit

204
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,330
I can click on length and if I hold down my left mouse button it makes things longer and move at the

205
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,970
same time I hold down shift and wiggle around my mouse it's going to make things smaller so this is

206
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,120
an alternative to just doing the cut the cut is literally cut at this point but this way I can gradually

207
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,430
grow or shrink the hair to give it the sort of look that I'm going for.

208
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,870
I think so a little bit short in some of these on the side shots on these on the side a little bit and

209
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,170
then back in object mode.

210
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,520
There we go.

211
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,220
And I think I've got a little bit too much roughness in there so indulge me just momentarily I'm going

212
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,410
to change the randomness down a little bit get things a little bit straighter a bit nicer.

213
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,490
Okay.

214
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,020
Good one.

215
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,410
And then we can style to our heart's content back into particle edit I can hop into the cone.

216
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,300
I could reduce the size I can also reduce the strength but probable or shift F as we do with our sculpting

217
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,920
and maybe give a little bit of a little bit of a wavy ness over to one side.

218
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,280
I think it affects just the tips because I want to change kind of the way the hair is pointing more

219
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
so than changing the middle of it.

220
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,530
Change the way it's pointing change the way it's pointing.

221
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,800
There we go a little bit of waving this maybe a little bit of a pot in the middle.

222
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,090
Been a while since I've had hair.

223
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,640
This is a little we've an unfamiliar familiar situation for me.

224
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,230
It's kind of like reminiscing I remember when I had hair and I had to brush it and put hemp rocked in

225
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,400
it.

226
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,120
Oh they were the days and I kind of accidentally gone and created a bit of a prominent world leader

227
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,060
I think just for completeness I'm going to click on the head and change the material of the head.

228
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,490
I will click on material find the material which is going to rename this to be skin and then just give

229
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,440
it some art and I will make it cartoonish I won't actually be trying to make something exactly correct

230
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,910
so I'll make it a little bit purplish.

231
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,850
Okay that's the foundations of putting on some hair.

232
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,880
I think we should do one more thing to a little pretend character here.

233
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,260
I'm gonna give that to you as a challenge and the challenge is to add some facial hair.

234
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,540
So add a new object add a particle system and style it so that it looks fabulous.

235
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,440
It could be a wise man's beard or a Magnum P.I. mustache whatever your heart desires.

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
And one last step of the challenge.

237
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,070
Make the facial hair a different color to the head hair just so you've got one more time to practice

238
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,400
the different materials and how that relates to the different things with our particle system so take

239
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,990
on that challenge when you done I'll see you back here and I'll quickly put together a bit of facial

240
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,640
hair myself

241
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,140
okay.

242
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,600
I think I'm going to do a bit of a mustache for my supreme leader here.

243
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,570
Not that he's got one but we'll put one on anyway.

244
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:17,550
Maybe a Tom Selleck Magnum P.I. mustache quick on head shift D to duplicate that yet right click double

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,420
click on this rename it to stash I think we'll call that and what do we do this not paint straight on

246
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,720
the head.

247
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,150
Well that gives us a lot more control over the different colors and materials and behaviors of the different

248
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,730
hair systems that we have we might do one for mustache one for eyebrows one for hair one for sideburns.

249
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,450
So it's up to you how many you want to do but this will give us a bit more control rather than just

250
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,110
painting everything straight onto the head.

251
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,800
Okay now hide the head for a second.

252
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,100
And on my stash I'm just going to do a very crude deleting as we did last time but you don't have to

253
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,650
delete it you can just leave it there but when we don't need faces and vertices then let's get rid of

254
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,310
those faces and vertices.

255
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,160
I wasn't in X-ray mode again.

256
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,730
Same mistake as last time.

257
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,290
Delete

258
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,060
and delete.

259
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,410
Okay.

260
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,050
There we go.

261
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,970
Now we've got where the mustache is going to go.

262
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:17,740
Now I can hop into particles click on plus make sure I'm back in object mode so I can see what's going

263
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,030
on.

264
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,080
Change it to hair.

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,920
That's probably not the sort of mustache that we want.

266
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,570
I'm going to drop the hairline.

267
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,230
Beep beep beep beep.

268
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,860
Down a generally mustache size generally down a mustache size I think.

269
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,080
Yep.

270
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,630
Cool.

271
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm going to change the number down to zero.

272
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,780
Slightly different technique this time that I'm going to show you I will change the children to make

273
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,540
sure children is on simple and the display amount.

274
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,410
Not sure here will do.

275
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,100
Say 30 and 30 I think for those and I'm going to for context I'm going to turn the head back on so I

276
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,380
can see where the head is.

277
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,430
See that general area.

278
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,030
Eyes would be their nose would be there.

279
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,600
So do a big mustache just in the middle here.

280
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,520
So over in two particle edit I'm going to click on add and I'm going to hand place a count one that's

281
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,180
good radius.

282
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,500
That's fine.

283
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,080
Let's see we'll do maybe a line.

284
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,740
Do do do do.

285
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,600
Okay.

286
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,850
If you hold down as you do this then you do a whole bunch.

287
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,180
If you just go click click click.

288
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,050
That will let you place them a little bit like acupuncture needles.

289
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,050
It looks like doesn't it.

290
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,290
And I'm just going to do a second row below that just for completeness.

291
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,620
Not exactly sure what is going to look best in this mustache but we can always add and delete and change

292
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,060
it.

293
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,140
Let's just go straight up and see how that looks.

294
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,590
Okay.

295
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,250
Super nice and furry.

296
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,300
We're on simple that's fine I can reduce the radius of clumps a little bit more.

297
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah that looks pretty good.

298
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,660
Down at point zero eight.

299
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,950
Let's change the color wall.

300
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:50,500
I remember I'm going to add a new material click new This will be we'll call it stash which is short

301
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,570
for mustache.

302
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,040
Change the color to be more of a yellowy.

303
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,140
We'll see how yellow he goes and then I'm going to promote that up.

304
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,820
Sir it's the one at the top.

305
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,350
We don't need skin for our mustache.

306
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:03,700
Okay.

307
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,360
Now how do we start the mustache.

308
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,910
I must admit I'm not an expert at mustachioed but let's go and shrink the length of it for a start.

309
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,910
So click on length hold down shift people.

310
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,900
There's a little bit too long bit too long.

311
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,540
Now let's groom it down a little bit room it down groom it down.

312
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,210
There we go.

313
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay.

314
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,170
Get a preview for how that looks.

315
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,920
Okay.

316
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,830
It looks pretty good.

317
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,960
I think there's a weird kind of old man mustache just gonna fit in and add a little bit with some more

318
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:43,590
so back into particle properties simple display amount will make this 60 64 render amount.

319
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,750
Let's pump that up punch 200 and 200.

320
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,250
Okay.

321
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,660
Looks a little bit odd because you can see very clearly the two rows.

322
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,130
So what can we do about that.

323
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,730
So it's not so obviously two rows while we can add a little bit of randomness I think in there.

324
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,600
The rain and a surge merge it together a bit more.

325
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,440
Yeah.

326
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,690
If that's the look you're going for we can also jump back into particle edit mode maybe puff puffed

327
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,430
a little bit.

328
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,580
It's a little bit of puffing.

329
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,300
How does that look.

330
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:11,960
Okay.

331
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,310
It looks a little bit more there.

332
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,660
Okay.

333
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,810
So it's near enough is good enough just for this fun playing around exercise.

334
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,910
I think you get the point of how we create mustache or beard if I wanted to turn this into more of a

335
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,340
stubbly mustache than I find the length of the hair and just put all the way in and then we can get

336
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,470
a little bit more kind of you know afternoon stubble.

337
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,160
Obviously I'd trim it down a little bit and place it around the character a little bit better that might

338
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,170
be a little bit too much volume so we can turn down the amount of stubble that's starting to look better

339
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,150
from a stubbly point of view I think if we wanted to that stubble all over the face and then as we did

340
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,340
before we would need to find the display.

341
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,730
So show emitter.

342
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,100
Turn that off in viewport and show emitter.

343
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,240
Turn that off for rendering.

344
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,400
So if we were to remove the head you can see that the emitter i.e. the object that we had currently

345
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,100
click on is no longer there.

346
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,410
Okay.

347
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,420
I think I'll declare that done for our messing around.

348
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,810
We had fun playing around with your character if you've got something cool you'd like to share then

349
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,590
please do share it with us and I'll see you in the next lecture.
