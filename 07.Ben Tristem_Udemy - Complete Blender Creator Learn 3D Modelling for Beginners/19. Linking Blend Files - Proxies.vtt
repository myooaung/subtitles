00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.670
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.600
In this lecture we're going to have a look at proxies which is a way when you've linked to file that

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.310
were able to edit some of the properties of the original data block that we've moved across.

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.920
Now there are some rules to this you can only have one copy copier linked data in any one blend file

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.220
if you try and bring it in again.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.530
It just won't allow you to bring it in again it will just re reference the original link that can be

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.160
incredibly useful in animation it can allow you to bring complex rigs in as a proxy.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.500
But with some of the more complex bones hidden from the animator which is incredibly useful if you don't

9
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.740
want them pulling on levers they shouldn't be pulling on it will be superseded by library overrides

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.350
which we'll talk about in the next lecture.

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.620
Changes are restricted unless you start making some data blocks local and we'll talk about making things

12
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.610
local a after we've talked about library overrides says hop on over into blender and start talking and

13
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.260
showing you guys about proxies everybody welcome back over in splendor.

14
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.530
So let's start by talking about making something a proxy.

15
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.410
So we've got on board in our scene here.

16
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.860
If we go up to the object menu and go down to relations we have a series of options that we can use

17
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.660
and make proxies the top one here.

18
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.020
Let's go ahead and click that and make proxy.

19
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.260
Notice here that it's moved its position in the world as well.

20
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.680
If you zoomed in you might even think it disappeared and let's have a look over in the outline.

21
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.340
So we've got a cube to link proxy that's interesting as in it and we've lost the modifier that was on

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.880
its as well.

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.350
So that's useful to realize that we've lost that.

24
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.920
And look we've still got our original one there as well.

25
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.210
But now when we try and move it.

26
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.130
Oh it snapped back down here interesting quirk there.

27
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.360
That might be a bug but here we go our cube to link it's now still there and we can hide it away our

28
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.800
cubes link proxy.

29
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
Now this is interesting we can start to move this to other locations.

30
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.650
We can rotate it and we can also scale it.

31
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.450
It's a shame that it's lost its modifiers that we had on there.

32
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
Now there's no reason why we can't go ahead and re add a modifier.

33
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
That's one thing we can do if we want the specific modifiable let's say we can link that data block

34
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.030
file link or currently in the object properties by the looks of it.

35
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.840
Is this such a thing as modifiers.

36
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.210
Doesn't seem to be so modifiers those data don't come across.

37
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.490
So how do we inherit what the other one had.

38
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.050
Well again linking things together whilst we're on the theme of linking we can select our cube here

39
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.550
shift and select our sphere control an el we can make links.

40
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.140
So here we can make links to modifiers and then we go we can inherit that modify we we can also get

41
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.700
to that under the object menu and make links.

42
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:15.370
And here we've got other things that we can pull in as well but now that it is a proxy we can do other

43
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.460
things like use an array modifier on it if we wanted to.

44
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.670
There's many many options that this now opens up for us.

45
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.910
And the main one of course is we can put it somewhere in our scene now I don't want the cube to link

46
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.660
remaining there so I'm going to hide the out of the way for the moment.

47
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.120
Now remember of course you can still duplicate these things and remember a duplicate will inherit all

48
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.200
of the properties of the thing that has been duplicated.

49
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.170
So for instance if we went down to our material we can't give these new balls new material so you can

50
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.420
see with this if you were importing all of your building pieces you'd very quickly be able to build

51
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.410
up your building knowing that any of the changes you make to the pieces will automatically be reflected

52
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.180
in all of the proxies that you've added to your scene.

53
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.590
But one thing to bear in mind is this naming structure can get very very convoluted quickly if you're

54
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.210
not careful especially if you have many many pieces at that point.

55
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:23.270
I would still name them appropriately like a wall piece and perhaps the parts of the building it said

56
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.220
can be handled by an individual collection rather than trying to name things very very specifically.

57
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.730
Now if you really want to give this skill some practice what I'd like you to do is go ahead and rebuild

58
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.910
your little church or building scene that you've got.

59
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.530
But this time importing all into a new blend file as proxies pulls over there now and give us a go

60
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.690
Okay everybody Welcome back.

61
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.720
Well let's go ahead.

62
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.940
I'm just going to save this crazy scene I've got here and create a new scene okay.

63
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.770
So with the new file opened sorry default cube you've got to go now if you're doing something repeatedly

64
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:16.000
you may benefit from going to link for instance right clicking and adding it to your quick favorites.

65
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.620
Then when you're in the viewport you can just go cue select link and then find what you want.

66
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.440
So I'm going to want archway brick 0 0 1.

67
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.180
I'm just going to import all of the 0 0 ones that I need.

68
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.450
So the floor course is placed over there where is and seen anyway.

69
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.510
And this would be nice.

70
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.940
Is going to separate them out so I can see them.

71
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.530
The wall link and I think a window and we're done.

72
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.280
So Windows 0 0 1.

73
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.710
I know if I import this archway for instance in any other way nothing else is combined like the archway

74
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.050
brick 0 0 1 is okay.

75
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.070
And of course it's brought in the materials as well.

76
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.540
Perfect.

77
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.130
Okay.

78
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.690
So now that these have all been brought in I will do a tiny bit of organization after I converted them

79
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.660
or made a proxy of all of these pieces.

80
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.400
Go ahead make proxy and again if this is something you're repeating yourself lots with you may want

81
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.590
to create a shortcut remember you can undo shortcuts at any time but because I'm only doing it four

82
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.240
times I'm not going to create one this time round relations by proxy.

83
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.370
Oh I miss that I always forget you need to double taps and make proxy make proxy.

84
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.430
Okay so it's done some where things were placement there.

85
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.690
But remember we can move things around Okay so I'm going to go create myself a collection here.

86
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.660
So I'm going to do all of the linked files first because those are the ones I cannot do anything with.

87
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.560
So I got all of those slates and I'm going to move them into a new collection and I'm going to cool

88
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.700
this collection linked.

89
00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:00.670
Okay so those are out of the way and these ones I'm going to press em make a new collection and call

90
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.250
it building awesome.

91
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.090
And now it's just a matter of constructing this.

92
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.460
I'm gonna hide away my linked to begin with and then everything else can be put together.

93
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:20.250
So it's just a matter of having a look at what it is rotating it around 90 degrees and snapping it into

94
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.440
place.

95
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.130
This of course we did color code them deliberately so rotate Z 180 so I would know what was the inside

96
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.840
and what was the outside so that things snapped together really well.

97
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.730
That is entirely up to you how you go ahead and duplicate the pieces of your world.

98
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.630
It can be quite challenging to nail down an exact naming structure for but for the building and the

99
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.470
purposes here were absolutely fine just slapping things together as they are this would be rotated as

100
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.800
well.

101
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.370
Let's look from above and move it back in.

102
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.570
Okay we can move our floor piece and we've got our first little bit done.

103
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.560
Now we just need to do the rest and I can't remember how it was so I'm going to use Alton D.

104
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.940
And any changes that I make to those components I can always keep and bring back in.

105
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.010
I think that's the right way round.

106
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.840
Yep.

107
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.160
Now there are a couple of other windows I'm not sure where they were actually so I'm just going to make

108
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.080
this bit up.

109
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:29.040
So let's go here and here then duplicate again rotates Z 180 and let's move this one here.

110
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:34.570
Else d remember I'm doing a linked duplicate here more than anything else.

111
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.620
Which means that if I make any changes everything gets updated and then finally I need a couple more

112
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.590
war pieces so this duplicate this here.

113
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:49.200
We're going to have the intersecting problem that we had before as well on these four corners.

114
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.350
We've not solved that one yet but we'll get there in the fullness of time.

115
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.420
Okay.

116
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.850
And then we've got this we'll piece here.

117
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:03.330
So once again duplicate and move it to the appropriate locations and I think I think that's pretty much

118
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.620
a standard copy

119
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.080
Excellent.

120
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:13.110
I think that's pretty much spot on I can't remember what the other one looked like exactly.

121
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.240
I'm just gonna give this a floor piece outside as well.

122
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.340
And of course this is no different from the other one we can now fly around our scene.

123
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.730
And if I turn on gravity with the tab key to turn gravity.

124
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:26.930
Yep.

125
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.860
There we go.

126
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.220
I can still walk around my scene and explore it for what it is.

127
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.900
Yeah that looks that looks pretty good.

128
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.780
I'm not sure if I had the windows on the end instead.

129
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.970
Oh I've managed to jar.

130
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.720
Okay so that's lots of fun and I've rebuilt it using the proxies of course.

131
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.880
A quick test here that we could do is go ahead and save our work.

132
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.540
That's quite important.

133
00:09:52.540 --> 00:10:00.350
I'm going to call this the proxy church and go in and open up our main file.

134
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.310
Excellent.

135
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.300
And yes we can see here.

136
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.920
That's not quite how I decided the other one.

137
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.030
Anyway I got the gist of it there.

138
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.330
So what else can we do here.

139
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.420
What did I want to test.

140
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.710
Yes.

141
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.170
Let's grab one of the war pieces grab the face on top and extrude by Zed by 2 just making it a tiny

142
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.890
bit bigger for our testing.

143
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:25.300
Save the file come back over into the proxy church and boom they've all been updated and that's the

144
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.480
power of this.

145
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.740
If we had a different church design we moved everything across boom straight away.

146
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:37.360
All of those pieces are updated with the new versions and that's exactly what we want.

147
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.220
Now there are a few of the things to tidy up this would be in a challenge later on like some extra corner

148
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:42.570
pieces.

149
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.660
We just don't have enough to make our building at the moment.

150
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.480
Excellent.

151
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.220
This is coming along really well.

152
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:54.730
I'm going to literally go pack into my church and reverse this change I can't undo it unfortunately

153
00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:02.370
but what I can do is delete those top vertices and then just fill in this top face here.

154
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.480
And of course being true to my word I need to go back and make sure that is updated here as well.

155
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.470
Excellent.

156
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.510
And there we go.

157
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.390
So this really highlights how proxies themselves can add a bit of complexity or linking in general can

158
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:24.300
add a quite a bit of complexity but the benefits of it when you start getting larger scenes and you'll

159
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.940
perhaps got a series of other models that you want to bring into a single scene because you're not always

160
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.990
going to make everything from a fresh start every time that would be a very foolish endeavor.
