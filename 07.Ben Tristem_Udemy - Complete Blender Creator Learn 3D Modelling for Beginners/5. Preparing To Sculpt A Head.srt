00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,110
Hello again and welcome.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,340
I think it's important that if we're talking about sculpting we have at least one go at sculpting a

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,090
human head.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,870
So this is no this is not the output of meat sculpting a human head.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,310
We can do a little bit better than that.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,820
This is me getting myself set up ready so we can sculpt the human head.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,390
We're going to bring in some reference images and I'm just going to do a little bit of scribbling on

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,340
here with the grease pencil so that I've got some starting reference points on how to go about shaping

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,620
my head.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,050
I'm going to say thank you to Frank and Caterpillar.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,620
He served as purpose of allowing me just to play around with the sculpting tools and to start a new

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,260
file so file new and this will be sculpting.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,900
This brings us into a sculpting view.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,830
You can see we've got mirroring on already as we move out mouse around and you can see we've got a ball.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,570
If I click on wire mesh molding see it's got lots and lots of detail in there.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,130
And as I move around we've got mirroring set already which is super if I wanted to look had that kind

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,220
of studio Clay type look then which I do I'm going to go up to my shading click on the arrow next to

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,090
shading to the right of that make sure I'm selected on match cap.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,460
Click on the ball.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,520
And from here I can select a different look.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,790
I'm going to select this kind of red clay type look.

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,640
That's the traditional look when we're doing this sort of modelling.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,820
And then as I model here.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,070
Yep.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,920
Hey presto.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,610
Wonderful.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,570
Now I find it really challenging just to kind of start going for it and to turn this into a head.

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,140
I need some reference I need to make some notes on what I'm doing here.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,700
So let's go through that process together and I'll give this to you straight up as a challenge.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,260
The challenge is to grab some reference images so you get an image for the front view and side view

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,070
of a human head.

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,410
I will share the ones that I'm using this somewhat dubious ones that I'm using for this lecture I'll

33
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,030
share that with you so you can use that if you want.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,250
Otherwise find your own and set them up either on your second monitor if you've got one or on a tablet

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,000
or a phone or as I'm going to show you a separate window in Blender which I think works quite well for

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,790
what we're doing.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,590
I'm sharing the challenge with you now so you can do that as we're going through this process do that

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,550
as at your leisure.

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,860
OK.

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,990
So what we need to do first of all is go to edit preferences.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,850
Look at our add ons selected add on and make sure that we have images.

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,000
So import images as planes selected.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,450
Yes.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,510
And then to save that as we've done before save preferences.

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,110
Excellent.

46
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,950
Now what that will allow me to do is jump up into file import images as planes.

47
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,740
When I do that it will ask me to find where these images are and like I said before somewhat dodgy looking

48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,170
character I can I can use as my images here at the front view first.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,680
You can see we have highlighted when it changed the name of that now because often forget to change

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,890
the name or call this flat.

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,890
Nice and clear.

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:50,110
I will hit G and then Z to move it up out of the way and then are on the x axis and 90 to rotate it

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,720
but we don't see anything that's a bit of a bummer.

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,830
Well if I click on the next view along viewport shading now I can see it.

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,430
However I've lost my nifty color ization because the cut the colonization was in solid mode so it will

56
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:12,170
deal with that in a moment first of all I'll bring in the side view file import images as planes navigate

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,290
g I'm gonna x to pop to the side a little bit.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,450
G z move it up R to rotate X axis and then 90.

59
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,480
Okay I have my two images what I'll do is I'll just arrange them side by side grab the first image which

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,710
I called front and put it just let's see maybe above just above the side image.

61
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,250
Excellent.

62
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,810
And then let's find the side image and I'm just going to rename this to these.

63
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,360
I'd good naming is handy now so that it plays nicely we can jump up into the very left corner where

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,760
you see a little crosshair thing change it's underneath the blender symbol changes to be a crosshair

65
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,220
bring that in BPP poop from left to right.

66
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,530
Okay.

67
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,090
It's already if I slide it a long way it's already in the material preview which is great.

68
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,590
I can see my images there.

69
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,050
I'm going to select one of them and then hit period on the keyboard or full stop as the case might be

70
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,700
just to zoom in on it and then I can position that exactly where maybe I mean a little bit closer.

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,090
There we go.

72
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,310
So we've got that fine fellow.

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,300
Now back over into my main window I'm going to click back on my solid shading and I can see I'm going

74
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,460
to be a little bit distracted by these just behind me so I'll move those over to the left oriented from

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,940
the front.

76
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,250
Zoom in get a position where I want it to be.

77
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,610
There we go.

78
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,180
Then we've got ahead.

79
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,530
Okay.

80
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,090
And now in this view those guys aren't getting in the way.

81
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,230
So if you have a second monitor obviously you just pop it on the second monitor.

82
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,470
But I know a lot of people don't so I like this workflow I can see it right there.

83
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,380
I guess the other thing that I like to do is just at the very start is to draw a little bit of detail

84
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,220
on my my head here because as I'm rotating around I want to know exactly where the front of it is.

85
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,650
That gets a little bit challenging as you do that on like where where exactly is the front.

86
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,740
Oh you know I need to go back from object mode or select my rename this to be head actually and then

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,240
jump back over into sculpt mode.

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,800
I just quickly want to show you a technique you may or may not want to use this but I'll show you this

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,040
technique of using the grease pencil just to put a few annotations onto your head here.

90
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,220
I'm gonna jump back out of sculpt mode into object mode.

91
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,810
Hit shift a fine grease pencil add in blank and you can see we've now got the little squiggly lines

92
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,450
with the grease pencil settings I need to come back over into draw mode and in draw mode I can draw

93
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,130
on the screen.

94
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,650
Excellent.

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,760
When I do that you can see it's going right through the middle of my object which is not precisely what

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,150
I want.

97
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,200
So up in the middle of the screen you can see where it says Origin instead of origin I'd like for that

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,480
to be surface and so that it's not going through the surface of I draw right now you can see it kind

99
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,630
of gets eaten up a little bit by the object which is not what I want.

100
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,660
So within service I'm going to push that out point 0 5 I think should be pretty good now when I draw.

101
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,950
You can see it's being pushed out a little bit off the surface of the object.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,770
So undo that.

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,360
Now what I'm going to do is just say well roughly where's the middle of my face going to be.

104
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,050
I think it's gonna be a roundabout here.

105
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,330
Where's the center line going to be is Gary a round about there where do I want the eyes to be.

106
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,640
Probably generally in this position looking at the beady eyes on my reference and then the nose that

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,880
big old nose is going to be somewhere in here and then we've got a mouth just in there and then the

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,610
shape of the head needs to be a little bit square a little bit more popped up at the top there.

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,380
Nice bold kind of head.

110
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,660
So this isn't I'm not trying to get this precise.

111
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,250
This is not exact it's just giving me a little bit of an early indication of the shape so I know then

112
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,700
what to stop pulling.

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,330
I think this is great particularly when you're learning the tools and you're not super comfortable or

114
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,740
familiar with how to pull and stretch and push.

115
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,470
I think this is a good way to say okay that's the shape I'm going for.

116
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,960
You can see it's not too bad it doesn't matter it's a little bit wonky around the side there and we

117
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,190
have our object ready to go.

118
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,500
This is basically saying you are ready to sculpt me.

119
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,600
So that's all I wanted to do in this video just get ourselves ready to sculpt so we can be sculpting

120
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,030
our head in the next video.

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,260
See you in the next video.
