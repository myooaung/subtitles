00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,310
Welcome to blender camera tracking markers.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,640
So we're going to be talking about tracking markers.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,580
What are they.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,890
Well markers track parts of the footage.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,030
And they can automatically do that as the footage progresses but we do need to make sure they're in

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,220
an appropriate place and they have the right settings applied to them.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,250
You will see that markers use similar controls to the 3D editors so we can literally use the G key to

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,040
grab them and move them about if we wanted to.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,590
Now you will need a minimum of eight in the scene to effectively track a camera.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,670
Obviously the more you have the better.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,820
We'll have a look at pattern size and search size.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,460
These are two parameters that a tracker can have.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,940
Discovering what they can do and I would recommend placing markers manually there's a nice button that

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,270
says Do it for me.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
And to be quite honest it doesn't work or doesn't work very well in most scenes or not at all.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,850
So just do it manually save yourself the headache.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,820
Let's go play with markers now and hop on over into blender.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,950
Okay so there were a couple of things that we have to go over just before we start adding markers to

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,710
our scene.

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,150
First of all we can change our laying out here and move it across to the motion tracking layouts.

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,360
Now when we switch across to that we get a series of view ports which some of which look familiar some

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,740
of which are new to us.

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,890
And we've got three new ones which are all the same.

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,170
The movie clip editor.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,020
Now in order to make this sane for me I'm just going to tidy this up.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,230
Otherwise I will go a bit mad.

27
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,210
And I certainly don't need them all open to demonstrate what's going on.

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,890
The first thing I need to do once I've got a sane layout and indeed if you guys have more than one monitor

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,390
do take advantage of the fact you can spread your work out.

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,800
It'll save you a lot of time.

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,430
First things we need to do is actually bring in the footage that we've already got and unfortunately

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,330
there's no link between the video sequence editor and the movie clip editor.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,400
Annoying yes unfortunately.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,890
So what you're going to have to do any of you haven't done it yet.

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,920
That's fine.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,950
You need to export the video you've just made within blender you need to export that out as an MP 4

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,800
or something like that so you can bring it back in and open it up here.

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,770
If you have any other editing software you can use that as well so don't feel you need to use Blender

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,240
if you've got another bit of software for instance on a Mac.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,150
Quick Time works really well you can trim your videos very very quickly.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,790
And for those following exactly long will need to have to go and open using the open on the movie clip

42
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,690
editor.

43
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:01,400
And let's go to VFX drone footage for cake cuts that will be available for you in the section assets

44
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,080
as well.

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,320
And I've got my eight seconds of air field excellence and now that's loaded up.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:15,260
There's a few extra bits to show around the screen so we've got a tall shelf on the left a propertys

47
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,510
panel on the right would be hopping between those with the markers and we've also got this blue bar

48
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,080
along the bottom.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,760
This blue bar is the caching that we've already set.

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,840
If you remember we've got in the System Preferences sorry in the user preferences under System make

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,500
more sense.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,470
We changed the sequencer and clip editor and I set mine to 8 gigabytes because that's what I felt comfortable

53
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,910
devoting to this process.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,310
We're working with a for K bit of footage here so this might be quite a bit to memory.

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:55,470
The first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and hit play on the timeline and nothing happens.

56
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,280
But when we stop playing back it but we stopped it from 50 it suddenly jumps to that frame.

57
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,860
Little bit annoying that that does not control what we're seeing up here.

58
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,970
However what we can do is whilst the cursor is hovered over the video clip we can actually go altes

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,610
and a and just start it playing.

60
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,840
Now this is going to be a much lower frame right.

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,990
Whilst its caching and on the info head is right at the very top.

62
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,810
If I just scroll this header along you might not have to do that.

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,520
Oh my word.

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,140
We are at four and a half gig's already.

65
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,170
Let's let this go through the entire thing and we notice here on the movie clip ed that blue bar along

66
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,290
the bottom is becoming a different colour blue and now it's entirely cash and how much memory are we

67
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,870
using.

68
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,610
Seven and a half gigabytes.

69
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,560
Wow okay that's a lot.

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,960
So just bear in mind when you're working with high resolution footage you can actually end up filling

71
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,980
your RAM very quickly.

72
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,390
So we've cache the actual clip itself.

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,740
We're ready to go with adding markers.

74
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,030
The first thing I would do before even thinking about placing a marker on here is just the scrub backwards

75
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,860
and forwards for you through the footage which now we can do because it's cached it would be nice and

76
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,920
smooth by just clicking on the time line and dragging across or indeed the graph editor which is part

77
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,820
of the movie clip editor at the top as well we can do it in two places that we've currently got open.

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,090
Now I'm actually going to get rid of my properties panel as well to give me even more space on the left

79
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,470
hand side on the tool shelf.

80
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,080
There's a section for marker and we can add the marker.

81
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:45,950
We simply click the add button and then place it where we want on the screen and that is very very small.

82
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:52,820
So what I advise before doing it placing a marker like the one I have just placed here and I'm just

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:00,320
using the middle mouse buttons zoom in and to scroll as in scroll wheel up and down and if I press and

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,060
hold the middle mouse button I can pan around the scene as well.

85
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,720
So I'm zoomed in to my marker now.

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,570
Ideally we want to place a marker in a high contrast area like where it's white here.

87
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,670
Now I can move this marker that we've just placed with the G key and when I move it around I can just

88
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,520
move it like anything else.

89
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,300
We've moved before now over on the properties panel.

90
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,520
If the tracks not open open up the track and you can do fine adjustments over there as well.

91
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,400
And when we start tracking our footage this is a good place to look to see how.

92
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:43,960
It's moving so we've got a marker placed and we've got some settings over here under tracking settings.

93
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,150
I tend to leave these types of tracking settings as default for the moment.

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,080
Now the pattern size is the area that blender is analyzing from frame to frame.

95
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,900
And if that's too large it just slows blended down significantly so it is important to kind of have

96
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,310
a balance between pattern size and speed of which you want to do the recognition.

97
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,830
So size is how far blend all look from the original pattern to find the pattern again.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,170
Now if you've got some footage that pans or moves quickly you may have to have a large serve size.

99
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:27,940
Now I don't tend to set mine over here so aggressively I tend to change over in the properties panel

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,060
and it will vary from footage to footage as to what you need do now there.

101
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,440
I will expand the tool shelf here and will just carry on to the motion model that can be incredibly

102
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,130
important and will dictate how well blender manages to track the scene and the moment it's just set

103
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,940
to location.

104
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,510
We've also got location and rotation location and scale take slope location rotation and scale.

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,520
A fin an hour fine and perspective these are all different ways of.

106
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,910
Blender interpreting the transformation of anything that we're tracking.

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm going to leave it sets a location at the moment and then I'll look at the image on the right and

108
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,390
as it's starting to track it I'll ball work out well is it rotating.

109
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:23,990
Is it zooming in or zooming out things closer to this camera going to be changing more rapidly than

110
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,460
something further away.

111
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,270
In fact something further away its location just might change rather than its apparent size and matching

112
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,510
key frame matching or whether you pick the previous frame.

113
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,130
Now key frames you have not assigned any key frames.

114
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,530
This is where we had placed this marker at certain points and then it would link between those key frames

115
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,880
or previous frame just looks at where it was before.

116
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,090
In general I've found previous frame a great starting point because just looks at what happened before

117
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,470
because we've placed a marker here and it's the selected marker it is highlighted.

118
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,070
If we hold down control we can also add additional markers and you can see that only one of them at

119
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,530
a time times highlighted but we can select them all with the a key.

120
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,110
Now when we've got them sat all selected and I've just dotted these round at random we can scroll down

121
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,340
a little further and start a track.

122
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,330
Let's start track now and see what happens.

123
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,490
Okay what happened there.

124
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,500
It seemed to stop very quickly.

125
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,450
We're looking at what's happened.

126
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,920
We started this on frain 200 on AIDS and it just went to the end.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,810
We played forward from frain two hundred and eight and it successfully got.

128
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,810
As I said all the way to the end.

129
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,980
We can also play backwards so if we go to frame 209 and pless track selects markers this time backwards

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,590
or we can use as you can see there a short cut.

131
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,850
Shift control.

132
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,570
A..

133
00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:00,270
And it's managed to track quite a way I am actually surprised but we seem to have lost two of the trackers

134
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,370
at some point.

135
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,980
Now I can tell that we've lost two of the trapper's because I can only see two of them highlighted.

136
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,950
Oh no we've lost three because there were five of them in total.

137
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,330
But these ones seemed to have held on the entire time.

138
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:20,400
If we select individual ones we can see at this point in time frame one of these two have tracking points.

139
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,530
And these ones are lost.

140
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,210
They literally turn pink when they're lost and we can see in the preview they're also pink.

141
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,550
Now I'm going to select those three that we've got there because they were just random.

142
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm going to hit the x key to delete them.

143
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,650
You can also delete any selected ones over in the tool shelf as well.

144
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,540
Now if we go ahead and let's have a closer look at this one here and as we're tracking it seems like

145
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,890
that has done and had an actual What a wonderful job in tracking.

146
00:10:52,890 --> 00:11:00,870
We take a look at the preview box on the properties panel we can see that that's working really really

147
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,460
well.

148
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,540
Incidentally when you zoomed in on a scene you want to visually see this.

149
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,930
It can disappear and that can be really annoying.

150
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,090
So what we can do is on the properties panel if we scroll down and have a look at.

151
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,820
Let's just.

152
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,180
Yeah.

153
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,090
Here we go under display lock to selection.

154
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:27,960
That means as we move this backwards and forwards the actual footage itself moves around rather than

155
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,950
our marker which can be very handy when trying to see if it's jumping all over the place.

156
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,750
Now that one there.

157
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:42,720
I'm really surprised with that it's managed to catch her he work in that way now notably here blue is

158
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
going forward.

159
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,610
And red is looking backwards depending on where you're going we can step through with the timeline to

160
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,290
each individual one and the next frame that's being tracked is the next blue marker.

161
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,800
Okay so we've got two in there and they've actually worked out relatively well.

162
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,090
I'm really surprised that that small area of their works as well is it had.

163
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,670
But what we haven't done is customized any of the search selection which can be really handy.

164
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,130
So let's focus in on this.

165
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,430
Bush down here.

166
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,160
I'm going to use control and click to focus on it.

167
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:24,120
Now I can't see the search area it's not visualized unless I go to Mark a display on the properties

168
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,190
panel and put a tick in the search box and this is the area of which is going to be searched.

169
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,920
We can change these area types.

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,960
Not only do they have a square at the moment but we can make them rectangular or even change the shape

171
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,710
completely.

172
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm going to go to Mark Karr and the marker is enabled it's got a position on the screen itself.

173
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,370
And here we have the pattern width and height and we have the search area width and height.

174
00:12:52,370 --> 00:13:00,260
Now this footage pans to the left and right a lot so increasing the width of a search area is a great

175
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,590
start.

176
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,830
Now again I'm on frame 30 here.

177
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,910
Now here's a great time saving tip for you.

178
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,400
I would recommend only placing one marker at a time and then working through your footage.

179
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:18,380
It's very easy to just put several markers down hit play and then you can get quite messy to try and

180
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,510
figure out what was going on.

181
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,970
Also when you put down more than one mark of is a good chance that you'll move the time line and look

182
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,090
the markers no longer over that Bush.

183
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,880
So the market doesn't move until it's started to track now because I'm at frame 30 that may cause me

184
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,030
a slight issue.

185
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm going to use the scale Kaybee esky just to scale up so that the whole Bush is in that pattern area

186
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,520
and I'm going to move move with the G key.

187
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:51,210
It's about or indeed I can grab it over here move it about as well be properties panel.

188
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,620
So I'm happy with that there.

189
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,690
And initially I'm going to play back some are going to go to track and play back.

190
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,910
And I'm hoping when we play forward nearly reached the end or fail and it reach the end perfectly and

191
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,150
we can see to reflect that we've got a yellow line along the bottom.

192
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:13,070
Now occasionally you would do something and it would lose track and I'm I'm trying to find something

193
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,700
that's losing track.

194
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,510
This is going surprisingly well let's place one here and just play that backwards.

195
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,530
In this case.

196
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,180
Excellent.

197
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,350
It's lost track.

198
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:29,060
Now if this happens you may have to zoom in hit the G key and replace and try again and go backwards

199
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,810
from there.

200
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,010
Now what's happening here is because the camera's moving quite rapidly.

201
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,560
The search area is not large enough so I'm going to move that once more.

202
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,510
But this time on the properties panel go down and increase the width of the search area and then play.

203
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,530
And there we go it's tracking much much better in fact it managed to do the entire rest of the clip.

204
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,570
So that is a great way of testing whether the search is going to make a difference.

205
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,240
Now you have to be careful when you've got lots of things that look very similar if you set the search

206
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:06,440
bound to large it will hop about something crazy try and to track all of these little objects here in

207
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,800
a pass test.

208
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,580
I was trying to track these white objects and they would try and bounce between them if I wasn't careful

209
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,070
with my placement.

210
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,720
So that looks really good.

211
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm happy with these few tracks we've got so far.

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,810
And it's time for a challenge.

213
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,100
I'd like you to go ahead and add more markers so add more markers into your footage.

214
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,140
Track them through your footage as well so you should see those red and blue lines backwards and forwards

215
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,110
and try and make sure they track throughout the entire however many frames you've got.

216
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,760
I would aim for at least 10 to be in the scene at all times.

217
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,410
And just a hint here it's better to have a fewer accurate markers.

218
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:59,000
The many in accurate ones and we can go and refine those later on depending on how much refining they

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,380
need done to them.

220
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,430
So go ahead now pause a video and give that a go.

221
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,360
Okay guys welcome back.

222
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,940
Let's go ahead and add some more markers to our footage.

223
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,370
Right so I'm going to zoom out for a moment and I'm not going to bore you with adding loads of markers

224
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,220
to the footage but what I want to get a grips on is this is the starting frame and if I wants to track

225
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,490
something it can't be off of this frame.

226
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,210
At the beginning and it can't be off at the end as well as things move about.

227
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,720
So that is important to remember as we're going backwards and forwards.

228
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,240
Excellent.

229
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,970
So that's a great start.

230
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,430
All that kink at the end.

231
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,050
I don't like fat so I'm going to.

232
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,200
Well withdrawn going to actually pull down my frame count to 230.

233
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,950
So we're going to end there and then we scoot back to here.

234
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:59,450
Now one of the things with tracking that marker there does is it does kind of skew the video just a

235
00:16:59,450 --> 00:16:59,840
little.

236
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,320
And I don't like fat for the moment so I'm going to turn off lock to selection and then it's not bending

237
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,460
the video too much.

238
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,850
Is it going to help with tracking quite significantly.

239
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,640
So there's parts of this that are in the frame all the time and there are parts that are not.

240
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,620
Now I'm going to pick probably a couple of bushes in the foreground.

241
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,600
How long does this one stay in.

242
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,600
So zoom in to where I'm talking about because there are lots of bushes so we've got one here.

243
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,680
Have you got one on the corner there are dark one here that we can track.

244
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,660
Ideally we want it spread off from the foreground all the way into the background as well.

245
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,200
And in the background because we're working with four K or I am I can pick out things in the field like

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,700
of this Bush here or whatever that lump is and some other places in the field that I can use as tracking

247
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,150
markers.

248
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,470
Unfortunately I have not been able to place markers on this scene and I don't think I would have been

249
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,750
able to see them any way if I did.

250
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,250
So there's a dark patch here there's shadows.

251
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,180
All of these things can be used to track.

252
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,930
In fact you could select the entire Bush and track it all there's a white mark on the field.

253
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,430
So let's start adding markers and seeing where we get so I've added this again at frame blooming thirty

254
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,040
five.

255
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,840
That's no good.

256
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,660
So let's go to that frame one and move it to an appropriate location.

257
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,650
I'm going to use the propertys panel here to help guide me and zoom out ever so slightly.

258
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,240
So you got a larger tracking area.

259
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,280
Now I need to decide where I'm going to place it on this on this marker and I'm going to place it just

260
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,730
there and then run forward and see if we've got enough.

261
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,130
That seems to track it the entire way through and I can scrub and see how well it tracked it and that's

262
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,680
done a poor thing that's done a pretty good job.

263
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,530
I won't know of course until we come to solving it later on.

264
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,580
But that's not in this challenge.

265
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,080
Now I'm going to bore you with placing the other ones but I will see you back in a few moments after

266
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,310
I've placed a few more on my scene.

267
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,180
Therefore this would be a great time to jump back in.

268
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,410
I've got one of these one that's going to be a little problematic.

269
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,110
Now when you come across something problematic it's worthwhile considering whether or not to keep it.

270
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:20,240
So here I am tracking this point and then all of a sudden it jumps to hear out what I can do here's

271
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:27,960
just move it back to the right location giving it a new point and then rolling forward again and seeing

272
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,900
if it follows throughout the entire scene following following following following following.

273
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,590
Perfect okay.

274
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,620
Just a couple more to do as you can see youngen to select them all here so you can see various size

275
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,860
search boxes.

276
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,930
And this is coming on nicely it's spread across the entire scene as well.

277
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,740
And it does shift forward so as we go forward probably the last thing at the bottom here we've got a

278
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:00,340
corner of the field and we've also sort of got this corner here that's in the seen that shadow.

279
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,930
That dark patch that might be in there all the time this particular tree here doesn't have a shadow

280
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,950
on it at the beginning because of the way the camera is moving forward.

281
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,440
Sunglasses if I can track the entire Bush that may or may be possible but then I think I've got more

282
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,880
than enough markers perhaps one right at the very top of the map as well or off the scene.

283
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,610
See back in a few moments.

284
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:31,840
Okay so this is my final set I'm just going to highlight all of my various markers that I've got and

285
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,060
as I play through I'm going to just drag across the timeline here I can see I've got a good patch here.

286
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,890
I do seem to have a rogue one floating about.

287
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,230
I thought it was tracking something here however does not do any tracking at all.

288
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,220
I wonder what it was linked to if anything at all.

289
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,870
And that's this one in the top corner here.

290
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:55,970
Okay.

291
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,890
That's not doing a thing.

292
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,950
I'm just going to delete it.

293
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,320
Remove it from the scene.

294
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,170
How are your markers looking Did you use the same scene as me.

295
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,750
If so how did you select your markers.

296
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,060
Where did you select them.

297
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,810
Please remember to share your particular set up.

298
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:17,200
