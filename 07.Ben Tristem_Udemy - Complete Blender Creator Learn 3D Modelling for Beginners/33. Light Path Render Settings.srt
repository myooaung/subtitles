1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,100
Welcome to light PAFF render settings in this video you will learn about like path's and how they're

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:14,450
critical when using transparency so to give you an example of what I'm talking about in this scene.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,510
We have a lot more grass than we've done before.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,920
And as you can see there are these nasty black and shaded areas.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,460
Well that's all to do with the transparency setting how much light is let through and after it's passed

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,600
through a certain number of them it stops and turns black.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,900
Increase the number and you get no more blackness no more horrible artefacts in our image.

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,000
So let's go explore this now and hop on over into a blender.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,080
Okay welcome back into blender.

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,490
And I've just realized I probably didn't have this one before I do like this particular sky.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,400
But I don't quite like the ground at the moment.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,520
I can always go back and change that the one I was using before wasn't a Mirrorball by an equally rectangular

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,080
one.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,580
And if I go ahead and open up the section assets I think it is this one here Sky photo 3.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,720
That's not going to update here until I re render.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,010
So let's go ahead and do that now.

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,090
Yes that's what I had on there before.

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,350
Because it's more cloudy than the other one of.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,560
Hop back into 3D.

20
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,880
You can see as we move about we've got some sky in there an overcast day yes.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,150
But otherwise looking pretty good.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,360
Okay so let's hop over into the 3-d view and hop in to solve it.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,060
No not solid just go solid lump material mode there and we can see our grass.

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,320
So let's go ahead and experience what we mean by light path's and how they interact and to do this example

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm just going to grab one of these and shift it to the side and then zoom into it on a more socgen

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:05,210
to move the camera off of it for the moment so we can move around quite freely and zoom right into our

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,050
model.

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,530
Now we've done this.

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,070
Let's take a peek at the light path's themselves over in the render tab.

30
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:19,770
Now if we scroll down here there will be a heading called light puffs and here it is.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,140
Let's make this a bit bigger after making it smaller.

32
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,690
So this area here is all about how light works in cycles.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,980
And important day there's this transparency.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,860
So anything that light passes through after it's passed through eight times its maximum time it won't

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,710
pass through anymore.

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
So let's put that to the test.

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,510
So let's go ahead and go into rendered mode in the viewport shading.

38
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,410
We've got our blade of grass here.

39
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,490
It is selected at the moment and I'm going to apply an array modifier.

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,740
And it's going the wrong way at the moment so let's do a constant offset on it's going to be the z axis

41
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,440
I believe because it's a texture X some y a left arm.

42
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,990
Why is up so that can be confusing.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,840
Let's just try let's put it on point.

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:16,660
Yes it's gone behind so Z in this case is relative to the object itself the texture itself and because

45
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,950
it's a 2D object.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,640
It has no depth so up is.

47
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,220
And Sideways is Z.

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,850
And this in this case going backwards is Z it's very confusing.

49
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,120
But you'll get used to it.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,900
Don't worry there are a couple of other things that are like that in blender as well.

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,130
So there's count here what I'm expecting is as we go up to eight.

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,790
Now we're starting to see something on the bottom here.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,510
This is called a bit black and 9.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,690
There we go we've got ourselves some horrible blackness.

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:58,610
Now the way to counter that of course is to go into the render tab and increase the number on your transparency's

56
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,620
here and two you don't have it anymore.

57
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,590
In fact notionally you could probably turn up to a hundred for the time being and you would be absolutely

58
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,240
fine.

59
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:17,510
However it does apply to not only this object here and the transparency going through here but anything

60
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,510
else that you're also passing through.

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,100
So if we grabbed another one of these blades of grass and put it in between all of these however many

62
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,930
times we've done it.

63
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,000
We've done it 8 9 4 or we've done it 14 times.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
They'll be 28.

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,500
That it has to pass through and then it will start going black.

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,690
Very confusing.

67
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,060
Essentially you would have to set this higher and higher and higher.

68
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,470
We'll have to watch that if we decide to use a lot of textures for our blades of grass.

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:52,490
So with that in mind get these settings set up get them understand play play around with how many it

70
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,950
takes before it starts going wonky for you.

71
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,790
If you set that down to zero it's no good at all it hardly lets any light through.

72
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,130
It all looks ghastly and of course as this goes up I don't know if this numbers got a top Yes it has

73
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,860
1024.

74
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,870
So in theory with blades of grass would be very easy to hit that number because there are quite a few

75
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,410
blades of grass on the ground.

76
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,360
However we're unlikely to be looking through a thousand twenty four of them and actually see the thousand

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,450
and 24th blade of grass.

78
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,240
There's going to be something blocking that any way so that shouldn't become an issue but it's worthwhile

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,570
knowing there is a maximum to that.

80
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,500
Okay guys it's challenge time.

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,790
And it's a thought exercise on transparency.

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,060
So grab a pen and paper.

83
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,030
If one near you or just think about it lots.

84
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,780
Best if you write it down now.

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,360
So think about how many blades of grass you've seen might have in it.

86
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,580
I'll give you a hint.

87
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,620
Lots.

88
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,940
Now imagine your laying on the grass looking down.

89
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,220
How long do you think it would take before the transparency level itself didn't matter because another

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,610
blade of grass or something solid was blocking it.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,000
Now what would help reduce the number of blades of grass in a straight road.

92
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,290
Other than no grass at all.

93
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,490
And what else could we use to model grass as well.

94
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,860
Think about that.

95
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,140
So pause a video now and write down your answers.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,270
Okay guys.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,040
Welcome back.

98
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,350
Let's have a look at those.

99
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,890
And then I've got another modelling challenge for you afterwards.

100
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,760
So first of all think of how many blades of grass you'll see might have in it.

101
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,870
Hint lots.

102
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,660
It's going to have a couple of thousand at least probably tens of thousands of blades of grass in it.

103
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,310
So it is important that we only put grass where it's needed.

104
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,130
Otherwise we're asking the computer to render things unnecessarily.

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,830
Now imagine your laying on the grass it wouldn't take long for more grass to overlap.

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,930
So I think after about 100 blades of grass or so you're bound to actually pass through any transparency

107
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,700
problems.

108
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,710
But thinking about the different levels is well I'd probably go for around 150 or so because it is going

109
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,730
to be some grass that's taller than others and especially as you get towards the top of the grass you're

110
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,200
going to have some that are taller than others and obviously then they're going to be able to see further

111
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,040
along what would help reduce the number of blades of grass in a straight run.

112
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:32,800
Well what you could do is change the level of the ground and that would also change the view of the

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,050
grass itself which is a great idea for maintaining a bit more interest in the scene.

114
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:45,230
After all we are modelling a rabbit in some grass not a field of corn so it doesn't have to be perfect.

115
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,330
And what else could we use to model grass.

116
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,480
Well the clue is in the question we could actually model grass.

117
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,980
Physically it will take us longer to do.

118
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,340
However we've got to weigh up the length of time it would take to model some blades of grass vs. the

119
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,980
length of time it take to render it using the texture's because it is going to take slightly longer

120
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,920
to do that way.

121
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,660
When we come to rendering So there's there's pros and cons to both and will decide later on after we've

122
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,980
done a few tests.

123
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,600
Which way to go.

124
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:17,760
Okay.

125
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,550
So I said there was going to be another challenge so we're going to hop back over into blender in a

126
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,420
few moments but I would like you to set light parts and create some interesting landscape.

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,220
So say your light path transparency tour around 150 This should be ample for this scene.

128
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,410
If it turns out later it's not then you can just just adjust that figure any way.

129
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,190
So it's not a big deal.

130
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,620
It creates some interesting landscaping.

131
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,830
Nothing massive just some subtle ground level changes using the tools you've learned so far.

132
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,670
So pause the video and give that a go.

133
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,130
Okay guys.

134
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,940
Welcome back.

135
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,230
Let's hop over into blender.

136
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,600
Right so the first things first transparency's right here unkissed going to go straight there and set

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,530
it to 150 right now that that's done.

138
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,720
We're going to have to create some interesting geometry so let's go ahead.

139
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,910
This is grass I'm going to change it to ground.

140
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Play him.

141
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,280
So I know exactly what it is because it's an it's going to be where the grass is coming from but it

142
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,060
needs to be a bit more interesting.

143
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,990
And I think I actually need our rabbit in the scene as well so I composed the scene properly.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,730
Right.

145
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,130
Oh my grass is pretty small that rabbits pretty large at the moment.

146
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,240
We're going to have to do something to change that.

147
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,340
I think we're going to shrink our rabbit down a little.

148
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,930
So let's just go to the rabbit itself.

149
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,550
I am happy with that.

150
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,410
And I'm going to scale that down by point to a fifth for size.

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,380
Who's a little bigger I think points for.

152
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,030
There again I'm happy with the scaling of the Rabbit a bit lower.

153
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,720
Brilliant.

154
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,210
So let's let's think about the ground itself.

155
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,750
In fact why have all this ground in front of our upper Let's move our rabbit locking into the z axis

156
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,860
down here somewhat.

157
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,030
Excellent.

158
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,770
So let's play with our ground itself.

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,100
So hop in solid mode here select this and going to edit mode.

160
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,910
Now there's a couple of ways that I can alter the ground itself.

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,470
Now the moment the ground consists of four edges four vertices so we can't really do much with it.

162
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,590
Well we could go into the sculpts tooled and do some sculpting with it but I don't think they'll give

163
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:55,320
us the desired results and the reason for that is it's going to create lots of patchy bits of geometry.

164
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,400
It'd be best if we uniformly divided this and then moved it about.

165
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,030
So you can just subdivide it.

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,050
And then in the operator panel down here we can just increase the number of cuts here until it makes

167
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,380
sense.

168
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,120
We don't need it over the top.

169
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,590
I think tens as far as you can go and 10 should be absolutely fine if it's not.

170
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,010
We can always subdivide again now that we've actually done that.

171
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,560
We can go in and pick a face any face at all let's pick that one and go to move it.

172
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,660
But moving it with proportional editing turned on.

173
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,310
So once it's turned on we can pick and choose how we want it to lift up and down.

174
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,020
Smooth is absolutely fine.

175
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm going to grab that.

176
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:44,800
In using the mouse will proportional size is currently very small can see at the bottom there is increasing

177
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,940
and in a few moments there we go.

178
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,260
The cat is actually big enough to have an effect now I don't want to make a mountain like that because

179
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,310
it will look ridiculous so let's just bring it back down a little bit.

180
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,680
It's useful being able to pick those bits up.

181
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,150
Now the tree itself I actually want that's up on sort of like a little bit of a plateau perhaps.

182
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,680
Up there like that so got a bit more interest in the geometry itself and would be here with the rabbits.

183
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:20,170
In fact it might even rotate the rabbit round will do the sort of composition bits later on.

184
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,770
We can push this ground down if we like.

185
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,410
I'm liking the look of that so far.

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,170
I just want this top bit a bit more plateaued a bit flatter so let's bring it in.

187
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,440
It all vary.

188
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,590
Go out how's Howzat looking there I could put I could mumble into the microphone for hours on end schriner

189
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,340
Perfecter.

190
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,360
But I'm happy with that so far it's looking pretty good.

191
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,310
Of course all of my cameras now I've moved the rabbit null and void are happy to sort those out at some

192
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,930
point.

193
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,240
Amber I'm like him the look of that landscape.

194
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,130
So how did you guys get on.

195
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:04,730
Please share in the discussions your landscapes that you've come up with and I will see you guys in

196
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,950
the next lecture.
