00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture begins.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.560
Have a look at lighting in specifically the different types of lamp that you can have.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.200
So we'll start off with our default scene here and add in a another mesh and a plane along the scale

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.060
that up to 20 times its original size.

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.830
So now we've got a cube in our scene a little go g z and lift up by one unit and then going to grab

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.170
my cube shift indeed D to duplicate it and move it up on the z axis so it's above our light itself.

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.770
And then we can start looking at things in a rendered form.

8
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.850
Now fortunately our lamps are kind of the same across cycles and evey which is great because we don't

9
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.720
have to worry about setting them up too much individually.

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.530
If you wanted to flip between the two.

11
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.750
One of the things that you will notice is that the lighting is significantly darker on cycles.

12
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.100
So let's go ahead and switch to rendered mode.

13
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.530
This is what this scene looks like with a point light source.

14
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.950
If we change the actual rendering now go into the rendering tab two cycles it would look very much the

15
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.710
same.

16
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.390
However unfortunately it'll be a bit dimmer.

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.770
So you do need to adjust the light.

18
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.410
You cannot just switch it straight out.

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.960
The other thing that you will get when using cycles is realistic shadows straight away whereas evey

20
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.660
you may not get the shadows behaving as you'd expect.

21
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.950
Okay.

22
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.040
So with our top cube and our bottom cube our points light source let's go to the light properties and

23
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.630
start having a look at them.

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.070
So if we go down now we've not got the lamp selected at the moment we're going to go to the object data

25
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.940
properties.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.880
You'll notice that if you go from a mesh object the object theta properties is the upside down or upside

27
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.610
down triangle the mesh symbol.

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.620
If we select the lamp itself we get a light bulb that it's to do with lamps.

29
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.680
So we've got different types we've got a point a sun a spot and an area and you can see they light things

30
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.270
up differently.

31
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.140
So let's start with a point light source it's only directional the light hits it where ever it goes.

32
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.600
Now this is important because this will be lighting up everything no matter where it is in our scene.

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.190
And this is great for interior scenes where you need to light things up candles are omni directional

34
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.830
light bulbs normal light bulbs are omnidirectional there are plenty of omnidirectional light sources.

35
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.530
However sometimes you might not want to do that.

36
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.480
So let's have a look at the sun lamp swish it over and we get some weird stuff going on for a start

37
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.950
the sun lamp typically doesn't matter where you place it in the scene but with the Eevee engine you

38
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.680
want it to the other side of whatever direction it's going for the rest of your models you will notice

39
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.830
that if I select the lamp itself and move it look that top shadow from here has disappeared.

40
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.900
And that's because we're no longer in line with it.

41
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.540
If I was to just move it back slightly the whole shadow of that top cube will appear again.

42
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.320
If we were in the cycle's rendering engine it doesn't matter where this lamp is at hold but it does

43
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.990
matter with Evey.

44
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.470
So that's two distinct differences between those two.

45
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.400
Now the sun lamp is parallel directional lights so all of the shadows will be the same.

46
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.430
Whereas with the other light sources they will be different depending on the distance from the light

47
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.140
source.

48
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.010
So a great way of demonstrating this would be to grab this plane here and duplicate it rotate it on

49
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.110
the y axis by 90 to create a wall and then I'm just going to move it back along here.

50
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.590
So here we go.

51
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.310
I'm going to move it so it's relatively close.

52
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.740
There we go.

53
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.300
That's close enough.

54
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.200
So here the sun lamp itself because directional all of the lights rays are coming down parallel to that

55
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.180
line that we can see that incorporates the Aki a move that's if you wanted to.

56
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.810
That's entirely up to you.

57
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.030
Now if we change the type of lights again back to one of the other non directional types we notice that's

58
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.840
here.

59
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.830
The light is hitting this cube and going all the way over here.

60
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.110
And again here to here.

61
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.490
So that's not parallel light.

62
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.810
That's all emanating from the same spot.

63
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.330
Now thinking about spotlights what happens if we turn on spotlights.

64
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.900
Well as you probably guessed it produces what's known as a spot light which is a single circular directional

65
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.600
light.

66
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.100
It's actually a cone coming out we can turn on the cone.

67
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.720
We scroll down the properties here we can go show cone to give us an idea of what is with in the light

68
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.120
cone itself.

69
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.360
If I turn that off for a moment this blend slider I do like this I prefer often the much softer lights

70
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.660
and you can do that by changing this blend setting then the size will change how wide or focused that

71
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.220
particular spot light is.

72
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.870
But notice the cube at the top here is not receiving any light.

73
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.370
But if we zoom in slightly so we can have a look at the shadow that's being produced.

74
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.810
Notice you can turn the shadows on and off which isn't particularly realistic but you may want to do

75
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.240
that.

76
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.350
We have a look at the shadow here and change the type of lamp from the spotlight to point light source.

77
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.020
The shadow remain the same.

78
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.070
They use the same calculations.

79
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.760
So essentially a spot light is a single cone of light as if it was emanating from a single point light

80
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.440
source.

81
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.940
But it's much more focused and then area lights happens to be exactly the same but it's just a little

82
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.970
bit wider.

83
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.710
So at the moment we've got ourselves a tiny tiny window.

84
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.670
That's what's an area Light is like it's like having a window of lights.

85
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:40.310
So if I set this to be more like 10 meters by 10 meters you'll notice that it is a huge area but it's

86
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.960
also directional.

87
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.570
So if anything went outside of this plane it would disappear.

88
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.790
So if I grab this particular cube go GZ and lift it up you'll see that when it comes in line with our

89
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.550
window coming in we actually lose.

90
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.330
It's being illuminated anymore.

91
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.220
So that's useful to know that that is a directional light much like a window.

92
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.770
If something was not in line with the window you would not see it's assuming no bounce lighting of course

93
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.540
which cycles allows us to do so we turn this back to cycles we get a very similarly yet darker scene.

94
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.360
So if it is dark by the way you play with cycles we'll delve much more into cycles later on.

95
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.800
But under the lamp properties themselves so we need to make sure we got our lamp selected under nodes

96
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.080
click use nodes and then you get the strength which you can turn up.

97
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.270
So if I said that some maybe 500 we get the scene illuminated even so you get that sharp line across

98
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.350
there as well.

99
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.330
And one of the things that you tend to find with the area lamp is you get a much more diffuse shadow.

100
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.800
We have a look down here.

101
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.140
We have a much more diffuse shadow.

102
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.270
So it's all spread out not as tight.

103
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:55.010
But if we change our size of our area lamp here it's backed down to point one and point one you get

104
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.970
a much sharper shadow much more defined than it was before.

105
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.480
So it's got its uses and that's much like a small light source coming through.

106
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.180
And that's the area lamp for you.

107
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.050
And let's switch back to eevee here.

108
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.880
There we go.

109
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.570
And now that we've switched back to even I just want to show you one final setting when it comes to

110
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.110
the shadows.

111
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.570
We've gone over this once before but since we're working evey it's a great time to refresh our memory

112
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.140
on it.

113
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.480
So if you go to your rendering properties itself so we switch the rendering engine back to evey base

114
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.550
year on shaded mode.

115
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.830
And then if we scroll down we've got this option under shadows and we've got cube size and Cascade size.

116
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.750
If we go ahead and hover over cube size we can see size of point and area light shadow maps.

117
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.570
Okay.

118
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.950
And this one's cascade size size of sun light shadow maps.

119
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:53.390
So the cascade size is the quality of the shadow produced by a sun lamp and the cube size is the quality

120
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.960
of the shadow produced by all of the other lamps.

121
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.630
So if we turn this down here to 64 by 64 we see that the shadowing gets really horrible because it's

122
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.570
being calculated on a much larger basis.

123
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:12.140
And then we go to our lamp and switch out to a Sun we actually see it's much much neater and of course

124
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.120
if you do have an outdoor seating you want Christmas shadows when it comes to the sun what's we can

125
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.700
do is go to our render properties and we would have to change this one here the cascade size and bump

126
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.780
it up much higher.

127
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.520
You can see it four thousand pixels we start to get a much sharper edge.

128
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.770
This is not something you need to worry about when it comes to cycles rendering but it is with eevee

129
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.350
because it's an optimization.

130
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:42.050
One thing you will notice is that if your items are very very small this can start to become a problem

131
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.950
when it comes to rendering in evey because if it is tiny you start to get less defined shadow.

132
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:54.290
So if we scale this down and down and down and then have a look at what shadow it produces when we lower

133
00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:02.690
down to the ground well it's nearly non-existent yet when it was much bigger it wasn't a problem.

134
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.390
OK so the last thing I want to talk about real quick is if we scroll down go to our properties I'm going

135
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.570
to change it back to a point light source says hello jacket.

136
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.760
Deal with that a bit.

137
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:18.470
We've got our power settings and obviously if something's further away is gonna be less let than something

138
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.660
that's closer so we've put this at 500 it's obviously going to be a lot brighter over a further distance

139
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.760
than if it's at 10.

140
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.890
So you can change your power output to make it brighter or smaller and the colour.

141
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:36.080
Now this is pretty cool because we can change the colour that we've got in our scene and a classic colour

142
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.070
setting to have is a blue and orange light.

143
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.880
So if you make your light slightly blue duplicate it move it along say over here and make this one slightly

144
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.990
blue you get a pretty cool looking shadow over on your cube itself we could see here looking at it I

145
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:59.060
know it's buried in the ground at the moment but that starts to look much much better and of course

146
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.010
you could go over the top if you want to make this a much deeper colour and then go back to our other

147
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.070
lights and we use the outer line selected.

148
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:12.350
Make this more orange and it can give your scene a particular feel to it so don't be afraid.

149
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.420
Try different color lines and see how your scene works out as you're playing with it.

150
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.280
I'm going to do one final thing here because it's starting to bug me.

151
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.350
We changed this shadow size as pumped that back up to 512.

152
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.820
There we go.

153
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.880
Okay brilliant.

154
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.230
So armed with that knowledge of your different lamps I'd like you to start thinking about how you're

155
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.850
going to light your chess scene.

156
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.520
We'll get to that in the form of a challenge.

157
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.670
And your challenge is to set up some lights in your scene.

158
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.890
Now I'm gonna give you creative freedom here to put as many or as few lights in your scene as possible.

159
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.640
Do you want it to look atmospheric.

160
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.000
Do you want it to just be simple.

161
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.940
It's entirely up to you.

162
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:56.080
What I'm going to go for is to point light sources quite close to the board and I'm going to have them

163
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.160
slightly different colors.

164
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.710
I'm going to go for orange and blue as my primary colors going on that.

165
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.070
Now you'll likely need to look at your lights shadow settings as well.

166
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.760
So when you're in the light properties go down to shadow.

167
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.880
You probably have to move the starting point since the shadow starts out.

168
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.290
Since the board is a lot smaller than it might be expecting you to have.

169
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.620
And finally I'd love to see your lighting setup.

170
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.520
Don't be afraid to share it with everybody.

171
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.520
You may have come up with a brilliant idea.

172
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.680
Pulls video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

173
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.750
Let's go ahead and pull into blender and set up the lights for our scene.

174
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.230
Okay everybody Welcome back.

175
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.110
I'm gonna go ahead now and open up my chest scene.

176
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.130
Okay so this is how the chess scene is coming along at the moment.

177
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.150
I'm really liking it.

178
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.760
But let's see what it looks like when you go ahead and render it.

179
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:47.800
Mm hmm.

180
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.760
Okay.

181
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:55.110
Now chess seems pretty small and I remember telling you guys a moment ago that that may cause us an

182
00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:01.340
issue when it comes to shadowing so we may have to scale this up to get it working how we wanted it

183
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.650
to but let's see what we can do with our lamp.

184
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.630
Let's move it closer so we can play with how it all looks.

185
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.200
We'll have to lift that up slightly.

186
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.330
In fact I'm gonna lift it up to point two.

187
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.750
There we go.

188
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.750
That's the right height.

189
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:21.990
And I'm just gonna move it a bit closer and across now because this is really bright in comparison.

190
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.820
We can go to our light settings.

191
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.470
I'm just gonna just how I can see here and tone that down and let's also it's not so bright perhaps

192
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.670
set it down to five maybe even one.

193
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.050
There we go.

194
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.960
Now the first thing I'm going to have to do here is play with the light shadow settings.

195
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.170
So I'm gonna go to the shadow here and clip starts.

196
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.970
That's a hundred centimeters.

197
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.640
So let's knock that down.

198
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.210
It's a point nought one and we start getting shadows I can see the shadows in here.

199
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.490
That's really good I'm going to turn on contact shadows as well and distance.

200
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.070
Well we don't need them to go that far do we.

201
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.960
Shadows just about right.

202
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:06.500
I'm gonna play with the bias just to blend it in just a little bit better and the softness as well.

203
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:12.080
Again it's entirely up to you how you end up setting the scene up in fact because it's so small.

204
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:18.860
I'm gonna go back to my render settings go to the shadow options and bump up the cube size all the way

205
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.740
to 4 0 9 6 because we have to have those neat shadows I'm also gonna turn on soft shadows.

206
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:31.070
Now that does have a performance impact but it will hopefully make things look a bit better and high

207
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:31.700
bit depth.

208
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.040
Let's see if we can get there.

209
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.810
He's looking much better now.

210
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.450
I think this contact shadow that I've added before is causing us a bit of a headache.

211
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.040
So it's come back in turn off contact shadows.

212
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.630
We still don't have these ones here giving us a shadow on a turn down the softness.

213
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:54.620
See if we can get ourselves a shadow coming in we can definitely get ourselves a decent shadow of the

214
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.580
exponent turned all the way up.

215
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.530
So let's have a look here at the soft shadows.

216
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.660
I think that might be causing us the issue.

217
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.560
Yes it is.

218
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.650
Okay perfect.

219
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.630
Go back to the lamp settings right the exponent is probably a little bit high there.

220
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.380
There we go.

221
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.100
So the lamp is low in our scene.

222
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.790
That's absolutely fine.

223
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.280
I'm going to duplicate that looking from above.

224
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:23.300
And pop another lamp roughly the same distance away but on the other side I'm going to do that classic

225
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.280
trick of setting one to an orange color and another two a blue.

226
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.360
So make your scores are warm and cool vibe to our chessboard nice.

227
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.910
I'm liking the look of that.

228
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.630
I'm gonna select my chessboard and press the number pad.

229
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.550
Full stop.

230
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.270
I'm liking that a lot.

231
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.540
Okay.

232
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.920
It took a lot of tweaking to try and get those shadows working but I think that was worth it.

233
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.540
And they're already starting to look much better.

234
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:57.720
And I've chosen to light the dark side in Orange and the light side in blue deliberately.

235
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.670
I could change those around of course but I've chosen to do it that way round for the my my thing that's

236
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.620
going to give for some much more dramatic look.

237
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.350
Okay well I don't think I need to add much more going on here.

238
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:15.480
I mean you could add a spotlights if you had a dynamic scene you know much like when we had the bowling

239
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.540
scene and we sent the ball into the pins are we're moving the pins.

240
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.940
That's where a spotlight could be really useful so perhaps later on we can add another scene in with

241
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.710
a bit more dramatic lighting.

242
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:32.050
I like this as an overall lighting feel nice warm and cool side to it.

243
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.020
Yeah I like how that works out.

244
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.090
How has yours worked out.

245
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.890
Please share your work over in the discussions light to see what lighting sets up you've gone for and

246
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.020
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
