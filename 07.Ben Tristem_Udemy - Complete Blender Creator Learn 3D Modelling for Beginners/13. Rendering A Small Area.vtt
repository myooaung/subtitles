Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
In this lecture we're going to learn about the render border as you can see here it doesn't matter how

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.220
powerful your system is.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.940
Well let's face it we're focused on the lamp itself would it be better if we just had a small area of

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.220
the scene rendering rather than the whole stuff.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.580
How do we focus on that focal points.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
And what are the pitfalls and other things that you may come across when playing with it.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.490
Let's find out more.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.900
OK.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.990
So this is where we left off before as you can see this whole scene is rendering and it takes a few

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.190
moments to be done.

12
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340
Now it's quite quick for my computer.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.800
So what's I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the viewport settings under the renderer under sampling

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.950
and change that to something a bit higher so we can see the difference that this really makes some of

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.170
the sets it's something really high 300.

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.840
I must remember to set it back and you can see here it's chartering up and the scene should be getting

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.170
better and better and better as it continues to render.

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.010
But the moment you move it it restarts rendering so you may need a high sample count for whatever reason.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.680
There are several that we could use as an example.

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.750
One is just difficulty with volume metrics it need.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.370
They need a lot of samples to look good or it might be that you're focused on detail if you are focused

22
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.080
on detail then why render the whole scene if you just focused on one area.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.340
So it's very very simple to operate control and B will turn on a selection tool in which case we could

24
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.850
draw around our lamp.

25
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.260
Now watch how much quicker it's rendering that significantly faster than the whole scene.

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.960
To turn it off it's just control ult and B and it will set it back again and we can see the speed difference

27
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.190
in real time.

28
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.600
I press the end key to bring up the properties panel.

29
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.500
We have a couple of options here.

30
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.690
And under the view tab if you press control and B and draw around our lamp again we can see that we've

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.640
turned on round the region and if we turn it off again we can do so here.

32
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.610
And if we clear the region with control ultimately it means there is no longer a region to select.

33
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.200
So if you want to toggle it on and off and you're looking from a particular region then you can just

34
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.730
toggle it on and off here.

35
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.500
Now if we look through the angle of the camera you'll notice that it reverts back again.

36
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.920
Okay.

37
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.580
And this border is relative to the viewport.

38
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.400
So if I move elsewhere it won't track our lamp.

39
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.740
It won't track the subject that if we go over to the camera view you can see that the camera renders

40
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.990
everything you can see in the viewport as well.

41
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.160
But what we can do here is go control and be and set it up to match the camera.

42
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.720
Now if we do that is not rendering the rest of the scene and it's saving us a ton of time rendering

43
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.210
but it's also individually separate from the viewport rendering.

44
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.310
That's really really useful it means that you can set this up so that you can just move the camera around

45
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.020
and it's only rendering what's within the camera view now there is a gotcha here.

46
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.810
Sometimes people clear their selection control alt and be all they miss press and perhaps not hold down

47
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.210
the control key or by accident they use the old key when they do in the border select because look I'll

48
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.750
just press Ultima B and I get a similar selection.

49
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.710
Let's just draw around here.

50
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.840
Well what's that done.

51
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.860
That seems to have taken a slice of some.

52
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.130
Oh.

53
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.780
What's going on here.

54
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.840
Well if you go back to the oh my what's this is just slice through.

55
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.550
So this is the clipping border that I see so many people inadvertently turn on when they're think they're

56
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.500
turning around the render border.

57
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.900
This is very easy to turn off if you ever have your seen looking like you've taken a slice through it

58
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.250
from a particular angle which is what we've done here and can be very confusing.

59
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.990
If you're new to blender you can just press Alton B again and it will come back if you press Alton B

60
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.120
it will give you this box that you can draw around which is useful for cussing cross sections in your

61
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.340
models but not so useful if you meant to do the render border so let's go.

62
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:16.130
Alton being clear that down control and B render border and you can see that it will stay in that position

63
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.320
in the viewport and then we can turn on rendering and actually have it match up.

64
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.430
Now this is a cycle specific thing if we turn on eevee then it doesn't really mean that much anyway

65
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.450
so let's turn it back to cycles.

66
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.540
That's our camera in frame.

67
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.790
I'm just going to save the settings and changes I've made there.

68
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.270
We can see that counting up to 300 is done incredibly quickly.

69
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.080
So the final thing here of course is to knock the viewport back down to our low counts and the sets

70
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.000
up as 8 for the moment and you'll see with that renderings done so quickly I don't even have time to

71
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.110
count up.

72
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.240
So this is one of the great things I cannot see it render there.

73
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.840
If I turn the render region off so I'm not clearing it.

74
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.790
Once it's done in about two seconds maybe and it's done in less than a second there.

75
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.560
So there's a great big difference when it comes to rendering your scene where the render border and

76
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.960
those who have a slower computer.

77
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.930
This will be a really really useful tool for you to use to make sure that you're not waiting absolutely

78
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.080
ages for something to render out.

79
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.330
That's it for this lecture.

80
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.410
I hope this helps out everybody.

81
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.080
Not only those with lower powered computers but those with more powerful ones that didn't realize that

82
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.240
this even existed.

83
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.310
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
