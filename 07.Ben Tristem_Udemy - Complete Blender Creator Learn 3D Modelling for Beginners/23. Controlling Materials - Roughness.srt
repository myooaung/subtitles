Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to have a closer look at the roughness
1

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,890
property of the principal shader so you can start adding things like minor reflections you can see the
2

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,930
underside of this pawn here is lit even though it's facing down.
3

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,240
And of course we've got the reflections but only on the black squares.
4

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
Let's find out more okay.
5

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,790
So we will start with a simple scene here.
6

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:38,650
I'm going to lift my cube up slightly sits above the plane and then add in a plane and scale it up to
7

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,740
around 10.
8

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,880
We're going to add a color to the plane straightaway so let's go to our materials settings and add in
9

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,050
a new material.
10

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,300
And I'm going to make this a dark color.
11

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,780
The reason why I'm going to make it a dark color is because reflections show up much better on darker
12

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,530
colors.
13

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,790
So let's work with that.
14

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm going to change my viewports here to shaded mode straight away.
15

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,610
And you'll notice that there are no reflections at all.
16

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,590
There's a shadow but there's no reflection.
17

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:17,020
And if we scroll down a little we get to the area called roughness and we can control that we can lower
18

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,730
it down and we can turn it up again.
19

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,920
However when we lower it down to zero which is 100 percent smooth it's not rough at all.
20

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,910
It means that this surface itself is pretty much a mirror.
21

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,370
Yet we don't see the cube in it at all, interestingly we do see the lights in it and that can be a
22

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,950
problem whilst we can see the lights I just want to show you.
23

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,430
We select the light itself and go to the lamp properties and the adjust the radius.
24

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,260
You will notice that it will get smaller and larger and you can hide it pretty much not completely but
25

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,650
almost completely by setting the radius down to zero.
26

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,420
That will affect the lighting in your scene as well we can see it here as I change the radius as it
27

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,670
gets larger it can dim out.
28

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,980
And that's because it's larger with the same power.
29

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,350
Anyway I'm going to say that down to nought point nought one.
30

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,870
And there we go.
31

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,120
That's pretty much as hidden as it can be.
32

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,690
In fact you can set it to zero.
33

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,780
So that gets that big circle out the way.
34

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,300
But why can we not see any reflections.
35

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,640
Well if we are in cycles we would see reflections.
36

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,440
But with eevee you need to turn them on.
37

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,090
So this is something I'm going to repeat myself lots with as we play with eevee you need to remember
38

39
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,990
to turn things on.
39

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,390
If we switch over to cycles real quick the cube is there.
40

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,900
We don't need to worry about reflections we don't need to worry about shadow quality but with eevee we
41

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,410
do.
42

43
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,920
So let's go down to our screen space reflections a tick in the box and immediately you see there is
43

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,030
something there.
44

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,840
Huh.
45

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,400
There's our cube.
46

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,720
Now we open up the dropdown for screen space reflections we've got a load of other options.
47

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,710
We're not going to delve into masses of details here refraction is to do with whether something is transparent
48

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,540
and its half see through does it refract the light going through.
49

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,500
You've probably seen that example with a straw going into a glass of water some something it seems like
50

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,540
the straw is at a different angle now half res trace is to speed up rendering if we uncheck that you'll
51

52
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:21,330
notice that the reflection itself gets a lot sharper and you'll also notice here as we've come in look
52

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,250
the reflection seems to come and disappear based upon the angle that we're at.
53

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,050
So do bear that in mind whenever you're setting up your scenes you may need to change some of these
54

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,260
other settings to try and get to say is fading off there.
55

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,650
Well we've got edge fading hints that bringing it back.
56

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,470
Well, No, it kind of just makes that bit there really sharp.
57

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,430
So there is a certain angle at which screen space reflections just do not work.
58

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,590
If we switch this over to the cycles rendering engine that wouldn't be an issue at all Let's go back
59

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,420
into the eevee rendering engine.
60

61
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,500
So that's something to watch out for whenever you're playing with that if you want reflections in your
61

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,140
scene turn on screen space reflections.
62

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,010
I'm going to leave my settings at default here and let's go ahead back to our material itself and
63

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,550
play finally with the options so that scroll down to our materials and we've got this roughness slider.
64

65
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,110
Now if you set the roughness to 100 percent as I've done here a value of 1 that means that the surface
65

66
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:25,470
is very very very very rough is going to reflect the light in a way that scatters it everywhere rather
66

67
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,260
than reflecting it back at the camera or the viewer and you can see as you bring this back down and
67

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,720
you decrease the roughness i.e. making it smoother around point three is where you start getting a shape
68

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:45,480
coming back and then we get 100 percent reflection at 0, 0 is very much like a mirrored surface usually
69

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,090
most materials have a little bit of roughness in even if they are highly reflective and it's it's up
70

71
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,490
to you to play with that and see what you get out.
71

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,800
Now later on in the course we'll be using different textures and different ways of controlling this
72

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,290
roughness value but for the moment we can just control it in the materials property window on the right
73

74
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,110
here.
74

75
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,770
Now you may be familiar with the term specular Now we're not using that type of workflow.
75

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,220
So in general we're going to leave the specular at nought point five sometimes specular can mean
76

77
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,950
the amounts of light reflecting from a surface it's specularity  but in this case we can control
77

78
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,710
that using the roughness and the roughness only.
78

79
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,550
Okay.
79

80
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,020
Armed with that knowledge it's time for your challenge, Okay.
80

81
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,020
So your challenge is to change the black square materials properties so that they will reflect the pieces
81

82
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,710
within them make them mirror like and then feel free to experiment with the pieces and perhaps even
82

83
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,500
the white squares as well.
83

84
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,600
Do have fun, pause the video now and give that a go.
84

85
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,010
Okay everybody Welcome back.
85

86
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,360
Let's go hop into blender and make those black squares reflective Okay everybody Welcome back.
86

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,300
Let's go ahead now and open up our chess scene I'm going to switch straight into rendered mode as we are.
87

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,040
And let's have a look at our scene.
88

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,600
So we've got a lovely sunset appearance on here in a blue over here.
89

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,030
The first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and select my chessboard go down to the material properties
90

91
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,470
black squares and I'm going to make the black squares completely reflective initially.
91

92
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,800
Later on of course we can play with that.
92

93
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,090
Okay.
93

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,340
So black squares are reflective and we can see straightaway this light over here is being reflected.
94

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,990
So I'm gonna grab that light and turn the radius down to zero and whilst I'm doing it I'm going to do
95

96
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,420
that to the blue one as well.
96

97
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,690
It changes the lighting ever so slightly and of course you can still see a little bit of reflection
97

98
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,840
there but otherwise I'm happy with that result.
98

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,480
Now we don't see any reflections yet.
99

100
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,620
So let's go ahead to our render properties go down the screen space reflections, I'm going to keep the default
100

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,040
settings apart from the half res trace I'm going to turn off just so i get a higher quality view let's have
101

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,990
a look at that, nice so we can see are different objects being reflected of course if we go to shallow
102

103
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,610
we won't see all of those reflections at certain angles but I think that's starting to come together
103

104
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,980
really well and I like the difference I'm going to play for a moment with the white squares as well.
104

105
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,970
And remember you can set the objects themselves to be reflective in fact with these faceted items.
105

106
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,980
This may be quite fun.
106

107
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,220
I'm going to set the black pieces as well to be highly reflective.
107

108
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,140
This may completely fall flat on its face but I want to give it a go.
108

109
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,400
So the  black pieces.
109

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Excellent roughness okay.
110

111
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:47,610
So we should be able to see other pieces in the reflections of those so they look like a highly polished
111

112
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,080
dark material, Of course you could add color to them.
112

113
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,250
I don't like them like that.
113

114
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,420
I'm going to set the roughness a little bit higher.
114

115
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,390
There we go.
115

116
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,920
To set them to point three.
116

117
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,560
Now the white pieces in the white squares.
117

118
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm going to leave those as they are for the moment.
118

119
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,170
Okay.
119

120
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,070
There we go.
120

121
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,280
How are your boards looking.
121

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,090
Are they coming together really nicely.
122

123
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,050
I think we're going to end up using this board rather than going back to the original one and playing
123

124
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,480
around with that and for that we're gonna need to get rid of all of these other pieces to work on it
124

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,330
and we'll find out more about that in the next lecture.
