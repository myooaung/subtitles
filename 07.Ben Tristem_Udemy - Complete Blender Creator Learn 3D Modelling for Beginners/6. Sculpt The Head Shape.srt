1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,550
In this video we're gonna shape our head just to get the macro structure of it to get it blocked out

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,630
the nose the eyes the mouth the ears and to get the shape looking like our reference images.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,580
I'll start off by showing you some options for tools to use and also the settings that I'm gonna be

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,240
using.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,050
I'll be using the snake hook tool a bunch.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,740
Now you can see the size of my brush.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,900
I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,020
Pull about that size.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,450
The benefit of having about this size is if I've scrolled out then I can grab large areas of my model

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,650
and move them around.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,550
I can also scroll in and then grab more smaller areas and make more of a shot and movement rather than

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,930
having to go in and out of the brush the whole time it's good to use your zoom in and out through that

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,340
having a big brush you can do macro movements at the start and it's really important.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,510
Just focus on those macro movements pushing shaping.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,820
Don't get into the fine detail just yet.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,490
We're going to be doing that after we've got our everything blocked out.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,090
We want it to be the other main tool you could use his grab is very similar to the snake oil tool it's

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,310
going to grab and move things pull them along.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,510
You hold down control then it will push things in.

20
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,870
The main difference let's have a look here if I get my brush reasonable size.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,060
Now I've got the strength of this set point five.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,470
If I grab a side of it with the grab tool grab grab grab grab grab grab.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,650
You can see it keeps going and going and going going going similar.

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,790
If we were to hold down control and push it within the head.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,660
However if I'm using the snake oil tool and do the same thing let me just check my strength Phillips

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,050
1.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,080
I'll put it at point five as well if I grab it grab grab grab grab.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,630
Then after all it stops pulling it it has an elasticity to it where it stops.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,230
After a while.

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,910
So I find it a little bit more forgiving using the snake tool than the grab tools so I tend to use that

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,740
a little bit more.

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,890
And so the challenge I have for you you can do this at the same time.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,940
I'm working through my model or you can wait and see how I do it and then go about it your way is to

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,770
get the overall shape that you want.

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,440
Don't go for the details yet block out the nose block out the eye sockets block out the ears and block

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,820
out the lips and to shape the chin and the jaw line.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,180
Don't add any fine detail just yet.

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,880
And in terms of the chin and jaw line in terms of the neck I will be adding a neck to the model but

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,130
I'll be doing that after I've finished doing the general shape so I'll be doing it off until the bottom

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,290
of the jaw line and then later on we're just gonna yank out a whole bunch of neck from the head it sounds

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,100
really gross isn't it.

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,390
But we will yank neck later on it's going to start by pulling with the snake hook tool.

43
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,770
Make sure I've got my brush reasonably good sized just pulling into the shape of the head.

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,390
Looking at the reference a lot.

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,100
I'll start with a bit of a front view.

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,230
Just get the front view roughly how I want it pull the chin down the chin down.

47
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,910
Oh well I remember I forgot one last tool and that is I'll be using smoothing so you can see if you

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,480
add a little bit detail like I was playing around with the mouth here.

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,710
If I want to flatten that down I can hold down shift shift will allow me to use the smooth tool from

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,000
any of my tools have a hold down shift you can see it's flattening the surface back down now.

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,680
The strength of that is going to depend upon what our smooth tool strength is so if I click on the smooth

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,350
tool and then shift F if I have that it really small say point 1 and then I go to any of my other tools

53
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,240
like snake hook hold down shift.

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,310
It's not really doing very much at all.

55
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,250
If I go to my smooth Tool Shift F put that all the way up to 1 and then go back to my snake Coco grab

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,980
or draw hold down shift and you can see it's doing a lot stronger in terms of the smoothing.

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,170
So I will leave my smooth tool at around about point 5 I think is a good spot.

58
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,810
You don't have it too strong because you can accidentally just blast away things that you've done like

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,450
if you put on drawer and then you hold down shift.

60
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,260
That's not too bad that smoothing it down the right I won't.

61
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,750
But if it's pushing it too fast just remember you can always go and change the smooth brush value.

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,150
Okay.

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,620
I miss my I do it up a little bit here with a few smudgy bits but not to worry I'm going to grab my

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,650
snake hook tool and just go about the process of pushing it into place trying to get the shape of the

65
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,520
head as I want it pulling the top bits up to a pass from the front first of all trying to get the general

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,130
shape and this is why I like to have the grease pencil here so at this very very very start point I

67
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,050
can just get it roughly into the shape that I want now is where we need to start scrolling so we can

68
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,920
see that hasn't gone exactly to plan so I've got a little bit of a lumpy head there not a problem I

69
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,320
do kind of have a little bit of a lumpy head hopefully you've got a great reference you're using something

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,420
that inspires you could be yourself it could be a famous actor or a superhero or a movie star or any

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,420
of those kind of things because a famous actor would be a movie star wouldn't it.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:39,200
OK so is yanking the headline off I want a more sort of solid front forehead type thing the chin is

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,010
goodness.

74
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,420
Why is the chin high back there.

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,030
Let's drag it forward ragged forward ragged forward make sure we're looking front sort of accidentally

76
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,060
lifting a little bit the lips in there but that's fine.

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,960
Drag the chin forward pull down the jaw line so my jaw line goes like that I'm not trying to recreate

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,030
my image perfectly here I'm just using it for reference in the end I don't think it's actually going

79
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,840
to look like me OK I'm not that's not my goal in this exercise I'm just trying to get ahead and I'm

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,820
using this big buffet it over here as an example of how to go about doing that so yank out the chin

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,640
a little bit you can see when was zoomed out and we've got a big brush everything's pretty macro with

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,440
how it moves around a little bit of a mess up here it's going to hit shift to smooth things down liberate

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,400
the top smooth it out a little bit drag in the head dragging the head and get up and get up so I'll

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,290
speed up a little bit of the video as I go if I think I'm just sort of yanking around bits of the sculpture

85
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,120
and I don't have anything new to tell you but each time I've got something that I think is noteworthy

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,280
I'll jump back and pause the video so just getting the shape in here it's flat a bit of a nose start

87
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,220
working on the shape for that so we'll just yank it out where my grease pencil marks are OK so you can

88
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,810
see the brush was either too big or I was too zoomed out Yank Yank yank on the nose yank on the nose

89
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,320
okay.

90
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,430
It's a good starting point a little bit too long my nose is big but not quite that big I know I've got

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,790
a little bit more of an arch going up there push push push push.

92
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,540
That's good.

93
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,110
And then we'll get some nostril action happening just drag to the side drag drag drag drag your drag

94
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,280
down a little bit of pushing up pain so the snake OK tools not just for pulling things out but also

95
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,590
pushing things back in again we can do that now I think with the eye I'm going to push the eyes in a

96
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,230
little bit getting a bit closer for this maybe the brush a little bit smaller push shooting push it

97
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,780
in and push it in nearly at the point where the grease pencil has served its purpose and I want to get

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,160
it out of the way but we'll leave it there just a moment longer push it and push it in I'm actually

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,470
pushing it in yep good starting looks like an alien perfect that's what we're going for so it's all

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,700
good we can fix all this later on if we don't get it exactly right we're just going for shape at the

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,930
moment I can see it's a little bit sharp there which I don't like but like I said before we'll fix that

102
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,250
a little bit later on I just want to get the shape let's have a look how is the general back of the

103
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,580
head

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,430
ok not super happy with the mouth let's see what we can do about that it looks like it's a little bit

105
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,600
too low what I put in there before.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,560
Let's put it a little bit more properly I will turn the power down on this so I can go a bit slower

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,370
on the mouth than I did last time it's generally it hold down control this slurp that pot in a little

108
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:30,950
bit and shifts its smooth roll out a little bit more great and grab the K as the hot key to grab the

109
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,660
snake look to move all of the mouth up a little bit more a little bit more now I can see it's fairly

110
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,300
flat for me in between the lip and the nose and I've got this weird kind of indent so push the whole

111
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,530
mouth in a little bit more I think it's not gonna stick out quite so much.

112
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,090
Well you might want to do while you still are learning and practicing is to do a caricature.

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,290
So what that means is to exaggerate things for example make the nose really big and to make the forehead

114
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,960
for the fore head really pronounced maybe not horns but you get the picture and do something a little

115
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,460
bit more stylized so you're not feeling the frustration of a habit it doesn't look like what I'm trying

116
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,320
to have it look like OK the eyes.

117
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm pretty happy with the spot there I'm not happy with the shape of them but we'll cross that a little

118
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,830
bit more later on it's going to smooth this out and you can see that my eye comes back down.

119
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,110
So at the moment going up to high again snake tongue and to grab all of that all of that and drag it

120
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,970
down drag it down another little technique if you find yourself wanting to grab a large area and drag

121
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,410
it down.

122
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,740
But as a result say you're dragging down this as well which we didn't want to do is remember that you

123
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,240
can go in and mask that so you just use mask paint in this area and so I don't really want to affect

124
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,860
that.

125
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,100
You might want to do it a little bit tighter than what I've done just there.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,230
But you can mask this area out.

127
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,360
So then when you do go and grab K for grab a snake quick tool it's not going to be moving around that

128
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:01,100
particular geometry just below the then under the mask just control and box mask control grab the whole

129
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,750
area blink.

130
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,770
That should undo it all.

131
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,160
Cool.

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,590
Remember to keep rotating around your model very very important.

133
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,110
Keep looking at the shape from all angles look at the lines so at the moment I've got this fully straight

134
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,710
line down the front of my face I'm going to go exactly on the side angle how's my line doing there okay.

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,500
You can see the forehead needs to be pulled out a bunch more so I will K and then pull that forward

136
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,720
forward forward.

137
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,570
Make sure you grab a few sides and I'm going to swing around make sure I can give myself some lumps

138
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,770
yet I'm looking a little bit alien ish that's fine.

139
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,460
So push that you know I do kind of look a little bit alien with my full head as it is smooth it down

140
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,060
a tiny bit.

141
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,080
OK good.

142
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Back on exactly the side few and pull this up a little bit.

143
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,330
And then from the front view I think I need to widen it all okay so the lines at the front you can see

144
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,370
down the right and the left it's fairly straight.

145
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,610
My model at the moment has a little bit more curvature to it than I'd like

146
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,300
and I'd just get rid of my grease pencil.

147
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,210
Now just click on the ice that's not there anymore.

148
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,940
I would do a tiny bit of fine tuning to the nose.

149
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,150
I think the bridge needs to go up a little bit higher it is grabbing and pushing it up and it's a little

150
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,170
bit round and bulbous at the moment.

151
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,550
I'm gonna pull out some nostrils.

152
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,850
Not a lot of detail here.

153
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,660
Just the general shape and a little bit.

154
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,800
Flatter on the tip and pushing the creases next to the nose you can see in here we've got fairly sharp

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,190
creases.

156
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,410
We'll use some tools when we get into the detail to make those creases pronounced but now it just getting

157
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,860
in the shape.

158
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,460
Okay.

159
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,540
The other thing is cheeks so where are my cheeks.

160
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,060
They're kind of opposite the bottom of my nose so I want to pull those out a little bit.

161
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:00,220
I tried different tool here and I try to inflate to to see if I can give a little bit of inflation just

162
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,600
to puff out those cheeks.

163
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,840
Not too much I don't have big O cheekbones Yeah.

164
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,500
That's a bit better.

165
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,140
Okay now let's do one of the tricky parts of the whole exercise which is the is now the ease you can

166
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,880
see here for me a little bit below my eyes or the top of the ear is a round about the eyes my eyes on

167
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,510
huge so you might want to do your eyes a little bit bigger and the bottom of the mouth.

168
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,200
So basically the years go from the eye to the mouth when looking at the side view the way I'm going

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,020
to go about doing this is just using the snake tool and just yank out a blob.

170
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,850
I can get the right angle here a little bit smaller on this tool so it's a little bit more pronounced

171
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,310
yank out a blob you get another another blob below that.

172
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,660
Yeah that's pretty good.

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,940
Now the blob just a little bit in front of it and then yank this out a little bit more my eyes don't

174
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,520
stick out some people's eyes take out a little bit more like a like an elephant's my ear certainly does

175
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,960
not do the elephant type here.

176
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,360
Okay.

177
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,890
Now that we've got this in the macro position let's have a look right from the side view.

178
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,670
I can see that the top of my ear is way above my eyes.

179
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,370
So make my snake or to a little bit bigger.

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,300
And this is where I'm going to mask.

181
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,800
Actually I will grab the mask.

182
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,510
I'm going to mass the area that I want to change around here I want to grab all of this.

183
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,600
Move it down I don't want to be affecting the eyes and the nose just within here I'll hit control eye

184
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,750
to inverse that.

185
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,390
Now K for my snake hook to scroll out nice and big.

186
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,680
Grab the top of the E..

187
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,050
Bottom of the spring the whole thing down and it looks like it needs to go backwards a little bit as

188
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:39,660
well so bring the whole thing backwards backwards backwards great little bit lower scroll around have

189
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,130
a look from front on looks yes looks right.

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,850
Okay cool unmasks sorry.

191
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,690
Box box mask control that will undo everything.

192
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,970
Now back to my k for snake hook tool to the delivered of E poking.

193
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,070
So getting nice enclosures push the era in a little bit up to the outside of the low push it in push

194
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,830
it in and push it down just to get the shape in there will do a lot more crafting of it when we get

195
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,760
to decent detail stage but for now just want to get the side of my head back to where it should be and

196
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:21,220
the ear a little bit sharper we can do just a tiny bit of let's see of pinching at the moment just to

197
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,430
give it that shape a little bit of pinching pinching around the ear not too much.

198
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,140
Don't do a lot of detail just enough so you can say yes that is officially an ear

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,540
okay so that's mostly what I wanted to get to at the end of this video is just blocking it in nose eyes

200
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,870
general mouth position the shape of everything.

201
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,540
So when we start to putting the details we're not worrying about is the year in the right spot we're

202
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,570
saying look at what should the air look like.

203
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,740
Okay so excellent.

204
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,680
Hope you went well with this exercise and in the next video we'll start putting in some more detail

205
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,580
into our head.

206
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,510
See you in the next lecture.
