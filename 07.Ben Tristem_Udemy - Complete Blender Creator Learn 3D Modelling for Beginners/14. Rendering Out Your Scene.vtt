Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.030
In this lecture you're going to learn about rendering now.
2

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.030
Many of you would have already done this gone up to the render menu and gone to render image or hit
3

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.040
F12.
4

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.520
And there we go rendering done.
5

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.620
Yeah well there's a few nuances to it so let's go ahead and find out some more.
6

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.040
Okay everybody welcome back.
7

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.180
So let's go ahead and just set things up.
8

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.970
Ready to render we've got the camera all set up we've got the lights set up we're not rendered mode at
9

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.320
the moment let's go ahead and switch across the rendered mode and by the way you can do that on a pie
10

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.070
menu in Blender as well I very press Z key this pie menu appears where we've got a different selection
11

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.110
of rendering options we do want rendered so I should leave it there.
12

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.740
Okay.
13

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.450
The first tab we're going to go into is the render tab and I'm also gonna make this area a little
14

15
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.200
bit wider so we can have a look.
15

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320
Now the rendering engine that we're currently using is the Eevee engine and we've got two others that
16

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.680
we can pick from cycles will work straight out of the box but you will notice in general that it's slightly
17

18
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.890
unbalanced with the lighting now you may find at this point that your computer gets louder as the fans
18

19
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.630
ramp up cycles is a lot more intensive than eevee because it's a real time ray tracing engine rather
19

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.290
than a guessing engine and a kind of a cheaty engine but eevee is still wonderful for what we can get 
20

21
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.020
done with it.
21

22
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.090
So if we select cycles it's right from the word go it has the right ambient occlusion it has the right
22

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.140
lighting it does reflections properly whereas eevee you have to tell it's all the that but we get a very
23

24
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.450
quick output from the word go.
24

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.020
Now you also have a ton of options with the Eevee engine and you have a ton of different options with
25

26
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.370
the cycles engine.
26

27
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.520
Now at this point you'll be feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer choice on offer here but don't
27

28
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.390
worry we'll cover all of this later in the course.
28

29
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.220
But for now I'm going to leave it with eevee and I'm going to go down to the next tab not going to change
29

30
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.620
any of the other settings.
30

31
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.950
The next tab is about output.
31

32
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.910
Well let us start off with the resolution this is the resolution of the image itself.
32

33
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.990
Now 1920 by 1080.
33

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.330
Great.
34

35
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.040
We can set this as a screensaver if we want to.
35

36
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.510
If you wanted it has a four K image instead of setting the resolution accurately what you can do here
36

37
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.920
is set it 200 percent and that will be the same as rendering out at 4k.
37

38
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.010
So let's go ahead and do that now.
38

39
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.630
Let's go to render, render image and we get our first image out.
39

40
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.610
Oh dear what's going on here why is it so zoomed in.
40

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.050
Well it zoomed in because I'm running at 1080p so i do need to zoom out.
41

42
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.540
There we go.
42

43
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.380
There's the rest of our image.
43

44
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.070
Excellent.
44

45
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.550
I can go ahead here and image save as I'm going to call this.
45

46
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.810
Well I'm in the appropriate folder for me so that's fine save the image.
46

47
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.800
Off we go.
47

48
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.440
Now one of the things you can do whilst we're in this particular view which is if we hover over here
48

49
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.460
the image editor we can go ahead and change the slot number two slot two.
49

50
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.120
And what that enables us to do is render again and then flick between slot 1 in slot 2 or even another
50

51
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.090
slot and look at the differences.
51

52
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.350
So let's do that now and I'm going to do the same thing but this time switch my render engine across
52

53
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.060
to cycles.
53

54
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.710
Now you may be able to set your GPU to helping out your CPU you depends on your system what we can do
54

55
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.150
to check for go to edit preferences Oh and it's opened up a window elsewhere there we go and we have
55

56
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.170
here under the General tab under system we have cycles compute device.
56

57
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.680
Now I'm not going to go into the full details at the moment in the course there's much more to learn
57

58
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.490
later on but you can accelerate your rendering with cycles with CUDA with open C.L. or not all so at
58

59
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.820
the moment not at all would just use your processor in your machine if you've got another option here
59

60
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.160
you may be able to use a graphics card to help accelerate the rendering.
60

61
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.130
I'm not going to include and this is a new feature in 2.8.
61

62
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.880
The graphics card and the CPE working together because that would ruin the screen recording I'm currently
62

63
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.000
doing for you guys some other leave it set to my graphics card that I'm going to click save user preferences
63

64
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.420
and we'll have a much more detailed look at cycles later on in the course when we have a dedicated section
64

65
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.780
where we're going to use it an awful lot.
65

66
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:53.060
OK so that is all sorted that's go down and change the device to GPU you compute for me you might not
66

67
00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.360
have the option or if you get any errors leave it as CPU I'm going to go to render and render image.
67

68
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.370
Now you'll notice that this takes significantly longer than Eevee did.
68

69
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.380
That's not to worry.
69

70
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.130
That's the nature of the beast.
70

71
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.480
Plus this is not set up and optimised for this type of rendering at the moment but we'll let it finish
71

72
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.670
off and we'll then compare the two.
72

73
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.860
OK.
73

74
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.470
So there we go.
74

75
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:27.080
We're just finishing off there and now we can go to the slots and pick slot one and pick slot two now
75

76
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.790
they're both the same model but they're dramatically different if I go over to the image I can just
76

77
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.790
that out and they're both called well I should really gone
77

78
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.720
well cycles and of course the other one will be eevee I'll rename that before I commit this.
78

79
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.390
And there we go.
79

80
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.040
That's looking pretty good.
80

81
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.710
And we can swap it back to eevee which is also looking really good now there are some things that will
81

82
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.010
stand out.
82

83
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.460
Couple of things that stand out straightaway is look at the bottom of the foot here.
83

84
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.050
I change that over to the slot two.
84

85
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.330
We see that we get a proper dark shadow around there.
85

86
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.610
In fact it looks like the whole thing's hovering on this side.
86

87
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.370
Might have to check that just in case I have lifted it up or even push the ground down.
87

88
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.510
That is possible.
88

89
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.240
But look this has far more detail in the shadows at the moment.
89

90
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.220
Whereas the Eevee one does not.
90

91
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.680
Now that is self-explanatory Eevee need setting up cycles will just work but Eevee is a lot quicker and
91

92
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.560
cycles is a lot slower in general there are ups and downs for both of them at this stage.
92

93
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.330
Don't worry.
93

94
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.790
Just go with Eevee so it's nice and quick and then later on.
94

95
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.420
We'll learn the differences that actually do make a difference when you come to rendering out your scene.
95

96
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.510
But there we go.
96

97
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.740
I've got my scene fully rendered and I've got on my hard drive.
97

98
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.310
I've got two pictures you know.
98

99
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.880
That means I can now share them and we'll find out more about sharing in the next lecture.
