00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.360
Welcome to solving camera emotion.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.690
So this is going to be all about setting up camera movement and indeed working out whether the tracking

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
we've just done is any good for our scene.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.870
You'll need the right camera details.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.000
I don't know if I've mentioned that before.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.140
I think I have.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.260
It is important whether you've got the camera details by faffing around for hours to try and get them

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.110
or indeed you know the camera details because you've got the spec it is important to have the right

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.260
camera detail so go ahead make sure that's one of the first things we get sorted.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.460
We're going to check the accuracy of our markers as we go through as well.

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.110
Now I was quite thorough but I might have missed one as I was going through because it may have looked

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.510
on a sort of zoomed out scale like it wasn't jerking about too much.

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.040
But we will go through and check the accuracy of our markers and dump any that are causing us problems.

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.250
Now an average camera solve error of less than one is ideal but that's not always necessary.

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.840
We may have a camera solve error of six and it work out to be absolutely fine.

16
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
We do have to test and assess as we go through.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.380
You may have to refine your markers more.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.550
It may be that one of your markers is causing a big problem see how to get rid of it.

19
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.770
There's lots of options and alley ways we can go down.

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.820
But let's go ahead now and set up the camera movement over in blender.

21
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.380
Okay so I've just re opened my file and the first thing I've noticed is my lovely light blue line where

22
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
it was cash before is no longer cash.

23
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.910
Now that's not surprising because obviously if you shut down blender is going to lose anything that's

24
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.820
temporarily stored so I'm going to go up to the top on my tall shelf and instead of just playing the

25
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.830
clip as we've done before I can go ahead and pre fret fetch and the short cut there is.

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.180
P It will prefetch the frames from the disc for faster playback and tracking and we can see that is

27
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.730
a lot quicker than it was just hitting play.

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.590
And now we should be able to scrub through we can see it's consuming around seven were seven point two

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.610
gigs this time round.

30
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.970
I can hit reload now reload is a bit pointless.

31
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.750
In certain cases it's only if you've edited the file on the disc itself on your computer.

32
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.000
And now I'm going to have the prefetch again anyway.

33
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.890
So we've got that now in our buffer and ready to go and we can just go ahead and go to the next tab

34
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.510
down on the tall shelf which is the sole tab.

35
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.990
Now before we do anything else let's just click solve.

36
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.960
Camera motion and see what happens.

37
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.270
Wow.

38
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.200
Okay.

39
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.010
I was not expecting that.

40
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.030
After all the trials and tribulations are been through trying to actually work out this scene I've got

41
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.180
to solve error and we can see on the head above the clip editor of three point six which is a great

42
00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.720
start.

43
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.350
It turns out I may need do nothing more but will go through and refine it anyway.

44
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.560
Oh and before we do anything else you know what I haven't done.

45
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.590
I said it was the first thing we're going to do I got distracted by this blue bar.

46
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.800
We need to go over to the propertys and go to camera and set it to full frame and scroll down to lens

47
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.800
and set it to 20 because that is what the dji Phantom for's lens configuration is said to be.

48
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.450
Let's go ahead and click solve camera motion and it goes up to six point five.

49
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.840
Okay we can work with that is not great that it's gone up but we can play with the settings now and

50
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.390
work out what we can do.

51
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.690
Now one of the things we can do now we've got a solver error is we can have a look at individual tracking

52
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.240
points and they will all have an average error attributed to them.

53
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.570
So if you've got something that's got a high average error you may find and you say may find because

54
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:09.950
it does vary removing it from the scene can improve your particular odds of getting a good solve.

55
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.530
So after clicking through all of those I can see there that one seven point six before I do anything

56
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.520
else I'm going to save my work extra.

57
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.810
I'm just going to delete this Bush entirely.

58
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.280
So we got a average solara of three point six now before we do anything else.

59
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.790
I do want to just highlight occasionally when you hit solve camera motion again you get a different

60
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.780
result.

61
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.050
So let's go ahead and remove this one that's rated on an average of an average error of seven point

62
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:47.510
six on the propertys panel here we can see if that by removing it we get a better results of three point

63
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.280
six solve.

64
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.490
Camera two point nine two that's much better.

65
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.700
Now I'm going to guess here if I go through and remove the one that's five point six.

66
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.250
All right.

67
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.910
Is there anything else that's above 4 that's going to be my metric here.

68
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.530
And of course I need eight of these.

69
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.500
Ah well that's really low.

70
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.100
So let's see anything here that's above for I think there was.

71
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.660
Ah there's one that's five.

72
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.270
So let's get rid of that.

73
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.740
Now again getting rid of it may not have been the answer we may it may be better to refine it but let's

74
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.850
solve now were on two point nine one point eight.

75
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.290
This is getting better and better.

76
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:35.470
Incidentally you can look at this graph Ed and it gives us an idea of the actual what's going on in

77
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.260
terms of these markers and if they're jerking about too much and if they are jerking about that may

78
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.360
cause us problems there.

79
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.180
I'm really happy that we're down to one point eight.

80
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.140
So I'm not going to do anything else for the moment because I need to check and see what that looks

81
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.820
like being lean about it.

82
00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.020
So I'm going to scroll down on the tool shelf to scene set up and click Set as background which scan.

83
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.270
This particular video has the background on the camera view.

84
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.280
I'm going to set up a tracking scene as well.

85
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.530
I'm now going to go over to the default layouts and from this view I'm going to watch the camera and

86
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.740
make sure it's not doing anything crazy.

87
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.860
If it starts doing crazy things and wobbling about that can cause issues out there are a few jerks at

88
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.020
the beginning and a few around.

89
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.590
Let's just watch here.

90
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.050
Around 180 or so.

91
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.910
Let's look at it from the camera.

92
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.590
And now this will slow down tremendously.

93
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.550
Now the important thing to note here is I'm going to have to hold down Shift to move.

94
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.410
But I want to have a close eye at the cube itself or the ground.

95
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.850
What I want to make sure is as this is playing through the timeline that it's not jerking about horribly

96
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.630
and then it's consistent So if the cubes covering up part of our scene that it remains covering up part

97
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.410
of that scene and not sliding and jerking all over the place.

98
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.090
If it does slide and jerk all over the place it just may look horrible.

99
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.930
In the end now because I'm going for an aircraft flying over the surface I can probably get away with

100
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.850
a bit more jerk than I would do normally.

101
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.050
Now I'm going to pause it there and go back to the beginning.

102
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.800
Now is sluggish doing this.

103
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.530
But I do want to just highlight this beginning bit if we have a look at the scene now.

104
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.190
It jerks all over the place.

105
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.640
You see that twitching it was only for a couple of frames but it's still very noticeable.

106
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.280
Now there's something I can do here.

107
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.650
That's really easy.

108
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.740
I get my starting frame and I set it at 10:00.

109
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.400
I'm not quite sure actually where that wobble occurred but I'm pretty sure as buelow 10 hour the 10th

110
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.430
frame so that's one way of dealing with that just cut it off it was a problem right at the beginning.

111
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.100
Who cares if no one sees the first half a second.

112
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:03.640
However if you do need to make sure that that works we need to investigate why it wobbles and it will

113
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.870
wobble like it does.

114
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.690
There we can see that it's shifting from one place to another.

115
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.520
And we as a whole scene is shifting because of some reason I can't tell you from here.

116
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.720
I need to go back into the motion tracking you.

117
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.980
And let's have a look at the graph editor of this point and see if we can gleam any information as to

118
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.940
what is going on here.

119
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.170
So one of these I can see is jerking and moving in the preview pane here.

120
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.890
In fact the one we've got selected.

121
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.660
So all of a sudden it jerks from one place to another.

122
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.410
So we can literally go in and fix that for this one particular frame that it's wrong on.

123
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.110
And place it.

124
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.860
Not sure where each frame was eeva side.

125
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.140
And that's always a good place to check a case that has fixed that one.

126
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.420
Could it be an Nach just that one was jerking all over the place.

127
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.640
No that also has a big shift to it.

128
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.440
I don't know what was going on at the beginning so I'm just going to move it over here.

129
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.090
So it's literally frame one frame to frame three is fine.

130
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.220
So let's go to the next one and I may have to repeat this several times in order to refine it.

131
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.360
Does this also jump.

132
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.830
It does.

133
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.560
How bizarre that each one happens now because it's every every time.

134
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.640
And rather consistent annoyingly consistent.

135
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.740
I can pretty much go through and fix all of these because it looks like they just need to be moved over

136
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.920
ever so slightly.

137
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.990
Does this one whatever it does does it do the same as some knee jerk.

138
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.570
Yes it does.

139
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.360
So there's something in the footage there that's causing it to jerk about and I don't like it.

140
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.330
I'm going to go away and fix this little issue and I see you guys back in a few moments.

141
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:58.530
In fact it looks like here that the issue stems from the camera not moving for one particular frame

142
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.600
or perhaps are a problem with the video it could be something along those lines.

143
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:11.310
But it looks like all of these frames are just shifted over by a tiny tiny amount.

144
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:18.690
It looks like just placing the marker on top of the previous one is working absolutely fine which seems

145
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.460
a bit of a cop out really out of thoughts.

146
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.970
There was a fundamental reason why it was doing that.

147
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:30.960
But it seems to have affect every one browser is a skip in the video but it doesn't take too long to

148
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.430
go through and just move everyone over everyone else.

149
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.840
So I think that's now sorted.

150
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.690
Now I have done that.

151
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:44.400
I'm going to have to go through and solve the camera motion again way down to one point eighty two as

152
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.300
a couple of other things we can do to make sure things are a bit more steady.

153
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.290
Now we've got a key frame a in a key frame B in this is where your 8 frames have to exist.

154
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:59.400
If I said Keen frame A to 0 and press solve camera motion you'll get the error at least eight common

155
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.730
tracks need to be there for reconstruction.

156
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.520
What do you pick in order to what key frames do you pick.

157
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.960
Well usually you pick the cleanest area of your footage for.

158
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.440
So from 1 to 30 is only that much.

159
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.370
Is that enough.

160
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.910
Well we could pick from 10 too.

161
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.130
Where does this stop moving around 70 let's do tend to 70 and see if we get a better solve error because

162
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.440
of that two point six.

163
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.540
So the answer there is no by picking that one but maybe 70 to a hundred and fifty.

164
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.800
This is one of these ones where you can go through and you can check.

165
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:45.960
So we get about a result one point a to have the whole lot from frame 1 to frame what our 230 solve

166
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.270
caromed motion three point three two.

167
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.550
So there are various ones that are good.

168
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.990
There are various ones that are worse.

169
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.510
One to 20 gives us two point six one to 40 gives us one point eight.

170
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.850
So back to that one point eight.

171
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.890
If that looks like a pretty good setting and then once more hop back to the foreign again if you got

172
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:11.370
a 3D view open you can hop back to us was around for can review and see let's see what happens now over

173
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.590
those first few frames.

174
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.620
It's no longer jerking about.

175
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.000
So now we have a 3-d scene set up being tracked.

176
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.860
That means we can start placing things in this scene and giving them things like shadows.

177
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.260
Oh.

178
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.180
Oh there was a little jerk there.

179
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.430
This is why this playback is very important.

180
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.610
Is that going to make a difference in the playback.

181
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.880
Possibly so.

182
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.240
I'm not sure where that was but I'm going to go and play it back and have another look.

183
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.990
And of course it's time for you guys to have a challenge.

184
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.820
I'd like you to go ahead and get a good camera solve.

185
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.200
So aim for a low error rate.

186
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.760
Now I have been rather fortunate in this particular scene that I've managed to get it so low so quickly.

187
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.230
That doesn't always happen.

188
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.380
And you often do have to refine and that just comes with practice and getting used to how the marker's

189
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.900
act what bounds you set them in.

190
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.370
And sometimes it's just the luck of the footage.

191
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.850
Some footage is a lot harder to track than others.

192
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.060
Remember to check the actual footage speaking about it.

193
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.600
You can actually see little wobbles as it's going through in the preview.

194
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.190
Pain in the properties panel helps with that.

195
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.270
Is it stable enough.

196
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.200
Now this refers specifically to the 3D editor.

197
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:36.100
So when you're looking through the camera with the background turned on are you seeing the cube or the

198
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.860
ground plane that's placed there.

199
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.880
Slide abouts on your scene or do they look like they're part of the scene.

200
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.880
If they look like they're part of the scene that's probably stable enough.

201
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:52.890
I've got a couple of those little jerks I can go through and fix and I would want to fix them for completeness.

202
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.440
However thinking about it at the same time if I've just got a plane flying over a over the surface a

203
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.110
little jerk may not actually be apparent in the video.

204
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.830
So it's worthwhile knowing.

205
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:11.920
Refine your markers add new or even delete more markers if necessary.

206
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.920
If you find that brings the solara down.

207
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.320
Then go ahead and sort that out.

208
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:22.260
Now check the track preview in the properties panel isn't wobbling about too much.

209
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.950
That should look pretty static throughout the entire time line playback.

210
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.450
If it's not then you know there's somewhere else.

211
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:35.620
You can focus your eye a word and it's certainly great as previewing each one of the markers you've

212
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.130
got in that panel and making sure it's not jumping about.

213
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.100
Now I think I've spotted another jump.

214
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.550
I'm going to have to have a closer look at that and I think it's similar to what happened before the

215
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.690
one we fixed.

216
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.890
So go ahead pause a video now and go get yourself a good camera solve.

217
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.450
Okay guys.

218
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.430
Welcome back.

219
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.070
Let's hop back on over in a blender.

220
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.630
Okay so let's go and see if we can refine this even further.

221
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.550
I'm going to go straight back to the motion tracking side of things.

222
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.110
And let's have a look and see what we can do now.

223
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.060
Obviously selected everything there don't want everything selected can be a dangerous thing to do.

224
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:23.130
And I was playing about's and I managed to get an average solver of one for five when I was playing

225
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.780
about.

226
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.280
So just a word of warning.

227
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:33.310
It is quite easy to screw things up and I set my key frames here back to 40 and solve camera motion.

228
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.340
There we go back down to a sensible level down back down to five point six.

229
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:42.450
Now one of the things I did notice and I was doing a bit of reading on camera sensors and really into

230
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:50.730
my photography and I realize that camera sensors when they're doing video often don't use the full sensor

231
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.100
with they are smaller.

232
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.290
They use part of the sensor.

233
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.660
Now that will have the effect of each other.

234
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:03.300
We could either lower the sensor width making it smaller or we can go ahead and change the focal length

235
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.720
because they're interchangeable sort of.

236
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.760
So the smaller the smaller the sensor the larger the larger the apparent focal length.

237
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:17.760
And we can see that these things are linked because as I move one the other moves as well.

238
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:24.390
So it's going to work out to be slightly smaller do we make the sensor smaller all that would make sense.

239
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.360
So let's make the sensor with 35 mil and do solve camera motion.

240
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:36.180
Five point six let's do thirty three point six thirty two five point six.

241
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.580
It looks like we're locked at five point six there.

242
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.430
Does it work.

243
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.490
If we move our way a minute right now is moving that of course it will be locked in and I just told

244
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.270
you guys that it moves about it will move this other one.

245
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.430
So it makes more sense to change the focal length.

246
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:55.740
So now with the focal length it would go the other way it would go up apparent size.

247
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.340
So let's go through 22 has gone to 16 that's go to 24.

248
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.020
And as God to all one point nine now that's starting to look good.

249
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:13.840
So 24 Let's try 23 because these numbers do jump about are point seven nine brillion.

250
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.450
I'm really happy that that's worked out.

251
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.300
So I'm just going to Prescot solve Kara motion again.

252
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.000
My eyes are not deceiving me.

253
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.420
So it does look like with the information we've got here.

254
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:32.530
We can say that the focal length when taking a for a video on this particular device works out to be

255
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.490
roughly twenty three millimetres give or take.

256
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.020
I'm not going to take that as a given for the moment but there we go we've got that sorted.

257
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.610
Let's see how this looks when we go back to our 3-d view.

258
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:52.620
Let's go back to the faults and play that through now we've got the camisoles starting from frame 1.

259
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.170
So still a little bit of a jerk at the beginning that I need to go back and sorts.

260
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.130
And there was another one.

261
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.910
You need to be keen eyed.

262
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.070
There it is.

263
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.060
And that's around frame 45 something like that sir.

264
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.920
I need to have a closer look at those.

265
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.520
I'm going to go do that now and see you guys back in a few moments.

266
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:22.420
Hey so I'm busy going through these particular key frames and taking a close look at them as it as we're

267
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.890
approaching I'm going to jump through with a timeline here.

268
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.900
We reach frame 48 49 50.

269
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.860
It jumps and then at some point it comes back again.

270
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.830
Now what we can see on the graph editor at the top is we can actually see this the Vission this this

271
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.520
jumpier the marker we've got selected and we've got this green party here.

272
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.380
That is what we're looking at.

273
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:53.640
So as we come through we can see that that is where all of a sudden jerks and then jerks back again.

274
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.370
The other way as it corrects itself now in this particular case it does look like hucking.

275
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:05.940
Just go back in time to where the error occurs and just re track forward from that point.

276
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.210
And that does appear to solve the issue.

277
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:15.480
Of course I still need to do that for all of the markers in our scene but that's somewhat better than

278
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.670
having to manually place them all.

279
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.840
So again this seems to go wrong frame 49.

280
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.910
Does this also have a dip on the graph.

281
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.060
Yes it does.

282
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:31.070
So again I'm going to play that forward how we can see it smoothes out those great big dips.

283
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.640
Now we've got another dip here so if I go to frame forty nine.

284
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.430
I'm just literally going to jump there at this point and just play forward from here.

285
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.520
It also jumps there are play that forward and that smoothed out the dip as well.

286
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:49.510
So it looks like during the tracks it has mucked up somewhere.

287
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.450
It's as simple as that does this jerk about around there or not.

288
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.230
Yes something happens a bit around the same area.

289
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.700
In fact now is not as pronounced because the movement isn't as pronounced.

290
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:10.160
It's as simple as that so if I play forward that should have solved that and it should have read tracts.

291
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.430
Yes it has.

292
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.660
And again I have to go through the recipes and sort that out.

293
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.530
I'll be back in a few moments.

294
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.870
And I'm back again.

295
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.450
And I think I've fixed all of my little problems.

296
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.370
I've toyed about with the focal length for twenty two point eight.

297
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:34.820
With all of these fixed all of these markers face I'm getting a Solve error of point 6 three which is

298
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.090
excellent.

299
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:42.140
I can now go to my default view and just play back what I've got.

300
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:48.120
I've also decided just truncates the very beginning at five frame five.

301
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:54.920
And as we go through I can't see any sudden jerks which is exactly what I'm looking for because now

302
00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:02.150
I can go ahead and build up the 3D scene with the plane flying through it's exciting stuff.

303
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.680
How did you guys get on.

304
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.100
I hope you've managed to place your cube and plane your ground plane in this scene so that it looks

305
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.410
as if it's part of it.

306
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:17.610
Obviously it doesn't look like it's at the moment because we've got nothing applied to these models.

307
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.690
However we're well on our way now to making this work.

308
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.670
Shea a work in the discussions perhaps a little animated gif of what's going on.

309
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.830
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
