1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,670
We're starting the process of creating an animal, I have chosen a cat as my animal.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,380
And in this lecture, we'll go about the process of grabbing a couple of reference images so that we

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,060
know what it is we're creating.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,250
Let's get ourselves set up with a new project.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,930
I'm going to start mine and then just a little bit of twiddling with the overlays.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,670
I'm going to turn off the 3D cursor and turn off the floor.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,760
And also, I'm going to hide the camera and light.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,360
It's just so those things don't get in the way of seeing what's going on.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,510
I'm going to right click start a new collection and this collection I will double click and coal lights

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,160
and camera and action, of course, as the saying goes and click and control click.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,150
Drag those into the scene.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,910
The Cube.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm going to click on and delete.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,870
So the wall already with a nice clean scene, ready to go save that into your place of choice.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,880
Save excellently.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,140
Now for those of you feeling advanced, I've got a mega challenge for you.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,070
You don't have to take this on, but this is a good way for you to test out all the things that you've

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,820
learned so far.

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,890
His take on this challenge without following along with me and the challenge is to choose an animal

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,050
could be any animal you want.

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,960
It could be a rabbit.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,770
It could be a cat.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,330
A dog could be a mouse.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,810
Guinea pig.

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,970
A lion, a tiger, whatever your heart desires.

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,500
Obviously, if it's more complicated, it's going to be a bigger, deeper challenge for you.

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,900
Once you've picture animal, find some reference images for it and then to block it out, sculpt it

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,870
and add hair to the animal, adding some color in there as well.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,220
And for bonus points, place the animal in some sort of environment or scene.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,890
So this is the process that I'm going to be going through in the next bunch of videos.

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,360
But if you wanted to test yourself, you could go and build your animal, create your animal, I should

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
say, before I do.

33
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,080
And then maybe compare notes as we go along.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,850
Or if you'd like to follow along with me.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,750
Fantastic.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,640
That's a process that I'm going to go through now.

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,730
And the first step is to find ourselves some reference images.

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Now, I've got a couple of things to recommend to you here.

39
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,990
One is pixels, dot com.

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,630
There's plenty, plenty, plenty, lots and lots of free image stock photography sites.

41
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,610
But this one just at the moment is free and free use and no license issues.

42
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,230
So you can do whatever you want with the images.

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,640
That's why I like it at the moment.

44
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,860
But by the time you're watching this video, hopefully it's still free and still cool.

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,330
If I jump in here and type in CAT, then I get literally a million cats.

46
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,000
It seems people love photographing cats.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
That's part of the reason I've chosen these.

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,040
You can also type in rabbit and make yourself a fluffy bunny if you wanted.

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,240
There's so many cats.

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,240
What I'm looking for when I'm looking for animal images is something that's a nice, clean front on

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,660
shot and also a nice clean side on shot so that I can get those those angles and I can have two images

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,920
that I put into my scene.

53
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,600
What I'm also going to do is grab a neat little app called Pure RF to a pure Radford's at pure RF dot

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,870
com.

55
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,180
This allows us just to lay out our imagery.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,890
This is a tip that I got from Grant Abbott, one of my fellow instructors get pure refs.

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,820
I've already downloaded it.

58
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,160
But if you want to do this, download pure ref and then open it up.

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,360
Go through all the usual instillations steps with pure ref.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,890
Find where that's been installed or just search for it on your machine and pure ref will open it up.

61
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,490
So it's a little bit different to use.

62
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,080
You have to right click to move it around to get it where you want to.

63
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,620
Right click.

64
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,100
Let me just organize my windows here so I can see these side by side.

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,010
This is pure ref on the left and images as I'm searching through.

66
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,180
Okay.

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,540
This is a good front on shot.

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,100
I can just left click and drag straight into pure RFM.

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,450
Look Verity's and I can scroll in and out using my mouse will and left click to move the image.

70
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,190
Let's see what else do I want.

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,630
Looking, looking, looking.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,520
That's another good front on this artist.

73
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,410
Grab that and drag it on in.

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,820
What else have I got?

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,230
So this is a process.

76
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,410
You can go and grab a whole bunch of reference images very quickly.

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,280
I like the colour of this one and have it as a nice little mood board.

78
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,390
What you will need to do for ease if you find the two that you want to have in your scene.

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,370
I'm going to have to in my scene, a front on one and a side on one.

80
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,010
Make sure you save those to your hard drive so you can then add them easily into your scene.

81
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,760
Of course, if you have downloaded something already saved, it's your hard drive.

82
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,740
Then you can just go ahead and drag them in to your heart's desire to set up the images that I've got.

83
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,950
I'm actually just gonna go and grab all of them, drag them all in and see what happens.

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,610
Bom, bom, bom, bom.

85
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,110
Okay.

86
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,910
And it nicely arranges them in a mood board like that.

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,660
That's really handy to be out to do that, just to dump them all in one go, just to have to give you

88
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,710
more depth when you're doing maybe little add details like, oh, that's what I need to look for in

89
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,160
the POI.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,760
You can zoom right in and use use H RF as a tool or you can just do it old school by clicking on a particular

91
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,680
image and just scrolling through and having a look.

92
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,740
So one thing I wanted to point out, this is a kind of scene that I like.

93
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,660
There's lots of foliage and stuff around grass getting in the way of the cat.

94
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,330
So it's not just all that he's a cat sitting on a pedestal.

95
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm putting it into the scene, which means I'll probably take some short cuts down the bottom of the

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,220
animal and not do the feat in superhigh detail just because I don't really need it in my final scene.

97
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,670
Okay.

98
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,900
Back over into Blender.

99
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,000
Just a couple of notes.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,790
Make sure in.

101
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:09,950
Preferences, if we go to add ons that you still have images as planes that is clicked on that superimportant

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,460
cool, because now what we're going to do is I'm just going to drag two images straight.

103
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,300
I'm going to find the two that I like the most.

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,080
OK.

105
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,720
I think I like this stalking image fir from the side.

106
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,900
That's the sort of pose that I want to have in my final image.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,150
And front on I think this gives me all the detail I need, particularly with these front legs.

108
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,260
I think that's what I need for details.

109
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,020
So I got to put those too into my scene.

110
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,770
And I'm just going to find those where I've saved them on my hard drive.

111
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,820
Just drop stalking cat straight in.

112
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,250
And that should go in as a plane.

113
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,690
Let me click on that and just hit and delivery of tidying up on item the rotation, whatever you want

114
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,410
on the X, I'll do 90.

115
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,680
On the X Y.

116
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,510
I'll put zero.

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,090
And on Z I'll do to 90 as.

118
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,140
Click on X.

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,000
Move that into position.

120
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,960
There we go.

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,580
Roundabout there.

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,100
Excellent.

123
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,480
The size and scale.

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,970
I'm not worried about so much at the moment because I'm not putting this into an external scene or a

125
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,720
game engine.

126
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,630
I'm just going to work with what it is at the moment.

127
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,140
So that should be fine.

128
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,470
Probably about one meter for the whole image making the cat.

129
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,470
What would that be?

130
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,120
Maybe about 70, 70 per cent of that.

131
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,750
So, yeah, that's fine.

132
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,060
That's in the right ballpark.

133
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,580
It's not like I'm working it on a scale where it's 100 million or something.

134
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,720
Push that back on the X.

135
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,090
Okay.

136
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,150
My other image.

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,150
What did I say I was going to work with.

138
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,180
This image here.

139
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,530
Drag it on in.

140
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,050
Once again, just get the rotation.

141
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,560
Correct.

142
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,870
This I believe is going to be.

143
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,540
90 on X, zero on Y and zero on Z.

144
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,170
Is that correct?

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,940
I think that is G.

146
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,330
Y.

147
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,290
Move it back.

148
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,540
Blink actually, logically, I think because the head is facing that direction.

149
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,630
I'm going to put my image g y.

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,470
I mean the other side.

151
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,470
Okay.

152
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,720
Yes, that's good.

153
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,920
I think that's how I'd be looking at it.

154
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,750
So the challenge I have for you is to pick your animal, choose the animal you'd like to model, gather
