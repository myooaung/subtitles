00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,970
Welcome to particle editing in this video.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,500
You'll be introduced to the part Cool Edit option.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,070
Learn how to edit the particle's style the hairs to make them flow in a more natural manner and learn

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,660
how to reset the hairs back to their default state.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,750
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:31,180
Okay so we have our fluffy bunny in front of us here with the new materials applied but we want to style

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,020
this hair because at the moment it's just sticking straight out of the mesh underneath.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,570
Pretty much straight upwards like it was a series of normals coming out of our mesh so we need to style

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,570
this and make it flow in the way that it would flow naturally with an animal.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,630
So with the objects selected in this case the rabbits that the particle system is attached to under

11
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,940
where it says object mode here we can change the interaction to particle edit and it's got a picture

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,950
of a comb.

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,880
And if we click that the screen changes ever so slightly and we get this in front of us.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,690
Now I'm going to quickly on the properties window over here.

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,540
Just click on be cool over here and we will see the moment.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,250
Well at the moment it's grey doubts but the moment that we actually do something we can in particle

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,630
edit we cannot actually change anything that's over here anymore so we can't add more hairs.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,350
We can't change the hair length etc. The moment we start doing things at the moment if we hop back into

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,670
object mode I can add more hairs I can remove hairs I can do lots of things still.

20
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,640
However the moment we go to particle it changes to this and we can see we've got a couple of options

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
over on the tool shelf.

22
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:54,940
Here we have a series of brush types similar to how we've had them before with the sculpting that we

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,020
did earlier.

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,590
Now just like before if I there's no brush selected at the moment if I click on comb it has a radius

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,040
and a strength just like it did before.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,690
And he used the same keys the F key to make the brush bigger and smaller.

27
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,510
And you can use the shift in F key to change the strength of that brush.

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,120
Right.

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,060
And there are a series of options down here.

30
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,780
Now when I click wait it will crash my system.

31
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,900
So that's important to know.

32
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,320
Your system may crash if you click on wait so don't click on it.

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,270
If you're in the middle of something important to I believe it's to do with the number of particles

34
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,480
that are currently on the scene itself.

35
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,260
If I reduce the number of particles it doesn't seem to happen.

36
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:47,640
But then of course I don't have a fluffy bunny I've got a very bold Bunny.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,730
So komer does exactly what it sounds like it's going to do something to reduce the radius again.

38
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,300
And if I just left click and drag across our model we can see though I can start combing my model.

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,730
Now the.

40
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,300
Limit selection to visible talk or does work with this.

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,330
So I've actually brushed the hair on the other side as well.

42
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,250
But from this perspective so it's not quite Howard want it to be.

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,810
Of course you can brush that down like this like it would be on a real rabbit.

44
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:25,330
And you can spend a lot of time brushing your virtual rabbit or grooming a virtual rabbit to make it

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,370
look better.

46
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,340
And then of course I'm just going to add a note.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,610
Give it a Mohawk in the middle just there.

48
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,230
There are loads of different options here.

49
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,410
So we've got smooth which will smooth out the differences as you go through.

50
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,390
Now that adds hairs and that's one of the reasons why now we can't add it over here.

51
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,180
We can change the length so we can grow and shrink it.

52
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,370
Very very powerful.

53
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,120
But we going to use a different method of determining length.

54
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,490
But you can certainly make some minor alterations here if you want puff will puff it out and cut will

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,030
remove.

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,100
Now a note about cuts and I'll do it now for you just to show you.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,740
It cuts hairs but it cuts hairs completely off.

58
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,760
Now once you've cut them off Unfortunately there's no way of adding them back to where they were before.

59
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,160
You'd have to add them back with the ADD brush which you can see straight away is going to take a lot

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,200
longer to do then removing them.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,990
So use the cart with caution.

62
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,620
That's why I'd say and I'm not going to click on weight.

63
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,890
As I've said before it crashes blender.

64
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,330
So I'm going to avoid clicking on that so be interesting to know and do Potin discussions if it also

65
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,260
crashes on your system whether it's a little bug that I have or whether it's a general one.

66
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,980
Okay.

67
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,290
And obviously.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,930
And looking at the brush types with Cone there's no difference that's going to undo several times to

69
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,550
see if I can get back to a hairy Bunny.

70
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,640
There we go we have certain brush types like lenk for instance we can grow and shrink.

71
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,670
So if you were thinking about removing some hairs perhaps you'd want to shrink them back and create

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,020
more of a stubble I suppose then actually cutting them off.

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,180
But that would depend on your application.

74
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,150
And we're going to use slightly different methods for controlling our hair growth over our body as well.

75
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,180
So we've got a bit more control than this arbitrary cutting back etc..

76
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,920
And if we look down there's something very interesting here that deflect emitter.

77
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,890
So again I'm just going to undo my length changes that I had there and now that deflects amounts here

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,900
the distance changes so I'm going to send it back to comb up here it changes the skin of our rabbit

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,290
the actual underlying mash deflects.

80
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:53,400
So if I set that to zero there's a good chance there's some point I will push a hair into the model

81
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,540
and essentially create an ingrowing hair.

82
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:03,930
But of course when that happens if we quickly switch to rendered mode I'm going to select this area

83
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,420
here to render.

84
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,730
And if I hop into rended mode here.

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,780
Oh and that's another thing to tell you when you're in particle edit the render mode won't show anything

86
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,060
you have to hop back out of that.

87
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,790
And we see that with that will probably do various assuming it changes.

88
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,640
It's got a bold patches there when we've brushed it.

89
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:33,270
If we go back into particle edits and increase this amount to one point eight which is lots.

90
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:41,160
Now when we brush over our model and we hop back on over into object mode we can see that the hairs

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,730
are much better and you will have to keep going back and forth.

92
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,510
I'm just going to draw a bigger render border here because that's a bit small.

93
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,530
There we go.

94
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,410
And remember this isn't the final render amount that is determined down here with the display number.

95
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,390
So if I increase that's maybe 25 we'll get a better impression of the thickness and we can see it's

96
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:13,200
being Kome go over there and if we hop back on over into particle it and we can't see it when it's like

97
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,780
that so we need to hop into solid mode as well and we can comb about here we can puff the hair out.

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,390
We can even add length to it if we want but we'll be doing a different method of controlling the length

99
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,330
later on.

100
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,330
However for mine the changes at the moment this would be a great way of making those little tweaks.

101
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,300
Now of course when we hop back in surrendered mode and into objects he'll take a few seconds to do.

102
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:46,590
And as you can see there I've actually made the hair quite long and brisley so I don't know what that's

103
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,080
actually going to look like quite strange I should imagine.

104
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,660
Yes very quickly.

105
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,770
Great.

106
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,020
Finally if you've ever done something and it's irreversible like cut all the hair off.

107
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,300
Don't worry about it because in particle editing properties window over here towards the top there's

108
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,170
a button that says Free edit.

109
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,350
Now when you click on that it does say youre going to lose.

110
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,320
The change is done in particle mode and that will reset it back to how it was before you started playing

111
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,450
about and styling the hair.

112
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,600
Okay guys.

113
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,700
Its challenge time.

114
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,070
I'd like you to style the bunny's hair so spend a few minutes trying out the different styling tools.

115
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,690
Create a few styles.

116
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,680
Now don't spend too long in the style at this time.

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,130
For starters it's a prototype.

118
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,080
Were nowhere near the finished model at the moment and also were likely to in a few moments have to

119
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,950
reset it anyway.

120
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,470
Now when you've done this when you've done new styles do share in the discussions I'd love to see the

121
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,200
hairstyles that you've come up with.

122
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,190
Perhaps you've given the rabbit aside partyin.

123
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,150
Who knows.

124
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:59,110
Also please share that in the discussion so pause a video now and go ahead and style the bunny's hair.

125
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,290
Okay guys.

126
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,530
Welcome back.

127
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,160
Let's hop straight back over into blender.

128
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,650
Okay so let's go ahead and style our bunny.

129
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,240
So the first thing I'm going to do is just come out of rendered mode for the moment and hop into solid

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,820
mode and I'm going to just clear that render border so there's less on the screen.

131
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,890
Once I press the right key combination there we go.

132
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,600
So now that we've got this here what I'm going to do is go over into particle edit.

133
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:35,940
Now in general if you look and make sure the comb sighted and in general if you look at an animal most

134
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,860
of the fur falls downwards with gravity so it's worthwhile remembering that.

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,160
And what we can do here is with limited selection to visibility turned off and I can view it from the

136
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,090
side it doesn't matter which side at this point.

137
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,590
Well with the background it does.

138
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,740
Well that can help us.

139
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,940
But I would just turn the A pastie on the background image background image.

140
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,640
Here we go.

141
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll just turn that down a little so I can see more of my model.

142
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,370
Well let's have a look at the proper thing.

143
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,680
So we've got a lot of hair going down here.

144
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,050
When it comes down here and all the hair on their head does go backwards as well towards the ears and

145
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,220
upwards and a little bit downwards here so we can use that.

146
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,970
I'm just going to turn on and off rather than looking at it so we can pull our model down now.

147
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,090
What's deflect deflect to me it is quite high at the moment sundermann Lower that back down to around

148
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,300
point five.

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,660
Otherwise I can't get the hair close to the body.

150
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,410
I'm just going to pull it down now because I've got the limit selection so visibility turned off will

151
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,870
go round the other side.

152
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,770
It's combed it round in a symmetrical way.

153
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,300
Now there is an X mirror here but it doesn't seem to work at this point in time.

154
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,650
So now we've got that there that's do this bottom bit as well.

155
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,320
Now bear in mind the bottom is not going to be seen as hot background to the side view.

156
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,460
The left hand side and I'm going to have a look at the head.

157
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,910
Now of course we want this hair all brushed back.

158
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,460
And if you want to do some detail around the ice you can do.

159
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:20,110
And then pull it down towards the neck just here so you can have a lot of fun playing with the Komen

160
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,190
brushing in fact you probably spend a couple of hours on a more detailed model just getting the hair

161
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,140
looking roughly right now V is for the moment.

162
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,210
Well I don't want hair on the air so I could actually cut it off.

163
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,370
But for humor's sake I'm just going to brush everything up so it's got spiky ears.

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,550
Now of course we need to remember the middle of heads.

165
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,680
It's got a mohawk going on at the back here.

166
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,350
There we go.

167
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,700
All combed back.

168
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,970
We got a few stragglers there.

169
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,090
Let's push those up and push those up as well.

170
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,090
So we we've pretty much combed all of the hair on the bunny.

171
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,430
Now that's part from the few little stragglers but that's absolutely fine.

172
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,670
So let's go and have a look how it actually looks in rendered mode.

173
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,940
Oh yes.

174
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,620
We've got a pink bunny here that's obviously the skin colour at that point was still in particle.

175
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,820
So that's out there and have a look at this model here that just kind of gives us a little inkling of

176
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,680
where the problem areas may end up being.

177
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,820
There's a few tufts coming out in random places.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,250
So let's pull that back fair.

179
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,950
And there was a little bit around here that's brush that down and let's just have another look in object

180
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,580
mode.

181
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,880
Yeah that looks a bit better I don't mind a few tufts coming out.

182
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,660
And let's go and render that now.

183
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,280
Okay lovely.

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,960
So that's got a quite nice shine to it.

185
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,030
By the looks of things so we'll need to work on the materials later on for the hair because obviously

186
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:59,180
that was a well conditioned Bunny by the looks of things and there are a few things here to sort out

187
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,580
like round the eyes etc..

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
But we're going to do that in a slightly different way rather than just trimming the hair back etc.

189
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,450
but that's a that's a pretty good first attempt at just brushing your hair back and seeing how it looks.

190
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,260
Remember to share your bunny in the discussions I'd love to see the styles that you've put out and I

191
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,550
will see you guys in the next lecture.

192
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,420
Take care.
