Hello everybody and welcome to this very quick lecture where I want to guide you through what is about
1

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.940
to happen what you're about to come across as you go through the course because it's going to be slightly
2

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.810
different for the next couple of months as we update the entire course the blender 2.8.
3

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.330
Really exciting there are loads of new features that I want to show you.
4

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.160
Unfortunately I cannot just click my fingers and it change overnight to the new version.
5

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.360
So what is going to happen is that Section 1 2 and 3 will all be replaced one at a time in their entirety.
6

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.220
And what will happen is when Section 1 is complete we'll shift everything across ever so slightly so
7

8
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.570
that if you are in section 1 at the moment you don't get disrupted in your learning journey.
8

9
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.500
And what that will mean is that after about 30 days or so of the new section being there the old section
9

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.240
will be removed.
10

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.250
But don't worry you've still got access to that in the blender two point seven archive course.
11

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
We shall make sure that you know how to get to in a separate lecture.
12

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.240
Now this is going to be a lot of change as I've said and will be expected to take four to six months in total
13

14
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.720
depending on any hiccups we come across and any new features that I want to show you guys as we go through.
14

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.130
So I'm aiming for around one to two sections a month initially and then obviously it will slow down
15

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.330
a little afterwards as we get into some more complex things within blender.
16

17
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.030
So the first section is now being remastered and that is what you're about to enter into after you've
17

18
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.000
completed that though be the old section one and then it'll go into Section Two so you'll have to skip
18

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
over that interim section unless you want to watch the content and reinforce your knowledge.
19

20
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.620
So there are lots of changes inbound and it's all for the better.
20

21
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.750
The learning journey is going to be more streamlined for you.
21

22
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.750
We've got some new projects in there as well.
22

23
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.960
I'm really proud of the work that's coming your way.
23

24
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
Now obviously there's going to be a lot of changes have said so if you could help each other and support
24

25
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.980
each other as you always do during this time of change as we upgrade the entire course the blender 2.8
25

26
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.330
so there's lots of exciting things coming up. 
26

27
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.260
So hop on over to blender 2.8.
