00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,570
In this lecture we're going to have a closer look at rendering out an animation into a video format

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,350
but making sure that when we render out the animation if it gets interrupted we're safe a blender crashes

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,500
or something is just not quite right for parts of your animation you don't have to re render absolutely

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,460
everything.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,920
Now with the advent of eevee some might say that's was not important it only takes a couple of minutes

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,570
to render out.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,970
Well even with eevee it can still take tens of minutes once you start upping the detail the quality

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,060
that's there and when you're using cycles for instance you can easily get into the tens of minutes for

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,300
each individual frame of an animation let alone the whole animation itself.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,700
So how do we go ahead and safeguard ourselves.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,040
Let's have a closer look at the rendering settings themselves.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,530
So just like before we're going to have a look in the properties panel here at the outputs I'm happy

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,840
with how everything set up.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,220
At the moment I'm going to go to my output tab.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,600
Happy with all of this.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm also happy with my sample rate and everything else.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,460
What I want to do is output it in a safe way so if blender crashes if I get a power cuts this will also

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,780
lead on to being able to render across multiple instances of Blender.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,940
But first of all let's go down.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,070
We've got our outputs.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,220
I'm going to change that to test two so we can see what's going on.

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,780
Now instead of outputting a file format as a video what's we're going to do is output as a series of

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,660
images and then combine all of those images into a video later on.

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,450
So it's a multi-step process but it's often much much better.

26
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,390
So let's switch this out instead of being an F F MPEG video.

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm going to go back to PMG.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,340
They're compressed but they're lossless which is great color depth and compression.

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,090
RG B and Alpha in terms of all of these three.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,420
I would typically just leave them as they are.

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,010
There's no real reason at the moment to change any of that out and we don't need to do anything else

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,480
but what we will do is have a look at this folder in a few moments.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,840
And for the sake of brevity what's I'm going to do is actually lower this back down to maybe 33 percent

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
or something along those lines.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,380
So it's nice and quick as it comes out.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,490
I'm just going to go ahead now and make sure I've got this area loaded up.

37
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,270
There we go.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,350
That's perfect.

39
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,620
Now what happens when we go ahead and render render our animation.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,510
So it should be a lot quicker than it was before.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,740
And when we go ahead of head here and have a look.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,710
Oh did I really want to do that.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,480
That will do for the moment but next time let's actually make a folder rather than just give it a new

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,040
name.

45
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,900
Whoops I forgot the backslash there but we'll let it run and then we'll move it in a moment.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,000
And as you can see here what it's doing is it's outputting each individual frame as an image.

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,770
And this is great because what we can do in the moment I will put them all into one folder but we can

48
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:15,330
go and grab all of those images put them into the built in video editor with In blender and once that's

49
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,580
done we're laughing because we can just render out but there are a couple of gotchas.

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,900
And of course we'll cover that as we get to that point.

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,890
So you've probably only got a few minutes left.

52
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,720
Let's have a look.

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,980
Scroll down we're on 97 98.

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,240
So we're about halfway there at the moment.

55
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,270
I'll be back in a few moments.

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,570
OK.

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,040
Brilliant.

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,350
That's the last frame rendered out.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,270
Now as I mentioned before there are a couple of other things I might want to fix on these and this is

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,540
the great thing if I decide that bounce at the end let's just load one of these up quickly and move

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,080
it into the right place so you guys can see it's what we will see here is the lamp itself is in the

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,190
floor.

63
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,400
Now the great thing about this is I don't need to re render the rest of my video I can just find a frame

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:11,180
before we go to the floor so probably one of one of the ones around here around lamp 1 6 4.

65
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah.

66
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,680
One of these ones around 150.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,980
Yeah it looks like around here where it hits the ground.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:25,060
So around 150 if we rendered from there onwards with the new positions it should be pretty good.

69
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,950
Of course we need to make sure that everything before that doesn't get altered.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,110
But that's just one example how rendering out in these individual frames you're able to make edits as

71
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,430
well.

72
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,420
In the future anyway.

73
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,040
Let's go back from here we've finished rendering that out.

74
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,300
That's all well and good.

75
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,870
What we now need to do is switch our view.

76
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,840
We're going to go over to the plus at the very end.

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,240
Click the plus button here.

78
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,990
Go down to the video editing workspaces and go to video editing.

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,990
It will change the view ever so slightly.

80
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,530
Completely new to you.

81
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,720
So this is gonna be a bit of monkey see monkey do to make sure that you can follow along with what's

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,540
going on.

83
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,010
So we need to add into our new timeline into our sequencer at the bottom.

84
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,830
We need to add in our pictures essentially.

85
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,410
So I'm going to make sure that I go back to the first frame because this will have the same number of

86
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:26,140
frames as our animation did 200 and then I'm going to go ahead and add we're going to add an image slash

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,280
sequence.

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,170
That's the important thing because it's a sequence of images.

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,280
At this point we need to find where it is.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,590
So in this particular case I'm going to have to go up a couple of times and then back down into videos.

91
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,040
Excellent.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,350
So here are all of the frames.

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,060
Now I did say I was gonna put it in one folder that would be helpful here if there were other things.

94
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,860
But fortunately for us in this particular instance all of these images are the only things in this folder

95
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,650
that is a video.

96
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,930
The previous video we did but we're currently looking specifically at images and nothing else.

97
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:09,580
Now this file browser that's built into blender is not your typical file browser you can't just hold

98
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,820
down shift and select the first and last one.

99
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,700
But in this particular case what I can do is press a to select everything that's there and then just

100
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,950
add the image strip.

101
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,560
So in general I would make sure that you output into an individual folder so that isn't an issue in

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,920
this case it was absolutely fine anyway.

103
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,620
And there we go.

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,460
That's the main thing we need to have done that.

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Now that we have this loaded and ready to go what we can now do is go to render this out again.

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,180
And of course we need to change our render settings is gonna be a bit tight at the top here but the

107
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,960
output will scroll down a little bit further.

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,300
We've got our test to output here.

109
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,960
This is where we can switch it back to the FFR MPEG video.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,830
It's not remembered our previous settings so we can come here empty for and we're not going to fiddle

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,390
with the video settings itself.

112
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,700
Okay so now that we've got everything here it's not going to work straight away and there's a couple

113
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,000
of reasons for that but if we go off to render and render animation we're gonna get a couple of issues.

114
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,730
The first one here is the border rendering is not supported by sequence it's just hidden at the very

115
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,600
bottom here.

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,100
If I shift this up to see the error properly.

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,770
Nope it's just gone as I went to show a border rendering is not supported by the sequencer.

118
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:35,560
Now if we go to our properties panel over here what that simply means is we've got render region ticked.

119
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:41,040
So I'm going to unpick that and when we go back to render again and when we render animation we get

120
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,340
another era which is not divisible by two.

121
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,070
So we cannot just output the video like this.

122
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,800
I know it sounds really weird that we can't do this when we could before but that's simply because of

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,880
the settings we've got here.

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,090
So I'm going to set that 50 percent of 10 ATP and go ahead and render the animation.

125
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,750
And now because we're reading from those images look how much quicker that happens to be always simply

126
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,160
doing at this moment in time is putting all of those images into video format and that's essentially

127
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,290
all a video is anyway so let's go and have a look about output render Okay so we're in the right folder

128
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,750
at the moment.

129
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,350
Here's our lamp 180 test to see the one we've just made.

130
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,960
As you can see here is rented out incredibly quickly and by some rough and ready.

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,290
So that's the way of making sure that when you render out your lamps that you're able to do it just

132
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,290
by images.

133
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,490
It's far better doing it this way especially when your render times are long but in general this those

134
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,640
few extra steps of combining it together is well worth just going ahead and doing it this way from the

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,710
very beginning.

136
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,590
That's my general tip there.

137
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,540
Now personally what I will do is I tend to render out directly to a video when it's something really

138
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,610
quick and short.

139
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,370
So we're even able to pretty much output it in real time.

140
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,440
That's fine.

141
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,730
Anything longer than that it's worth the effort.

142
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,930
Just outputting to images and certainly for me because I often take the employment of another computer

143
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,480
or two in the house in order to render them out because they often take quite a few minutes per frame

144
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,140
and that is the topic of the next lecture.

145
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,050
So if you've got more than one computer there's some top tips coming up.

146
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,060
And one thing before I go because I didn't want to miss this out.

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,900
If you happen to have something loaded into your timeline and then you're going back to layout and you

148
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,910
go to render render animation you'll have it rendering out the timeline.

149
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,210
It's something that catches a load of people out.

150
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,940
So the easiest thing of course to leap delete those images from the sequencer view.

151
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,190
So if we go back to video editing we can just delete this clip and then we'll go back to rendering out

152
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,280
the animation.

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,740
That's absolutely fine.

154
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,580
They'll certainly catch you out at some point if you haven't seen it before.

155
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,260
OK.

156
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,020
So that's pretty much everything I wanted to cover in this particular lecture.

157
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,940
In general what I would do is if it's a small render that your output is something like Facebook and

158
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,460
it is pretty much real time to render out then just go ahead output it directly to video for anything

159
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,570
more intensive especially those that are taking a minute or two per frame which does sound like a lot.

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,940
But if you want a really crisp image you often do have to render for multiple minutes especially with

161
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,880
cycles on a dark scene like we've got in front of us.

162
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:50,400
Now this is also going to pave the way for using multiple computers because that's what I would do is

163
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,220
I would employ the other computers in my household in order to do some rendering and we'll talk all

164
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,610
about that in the next lecture.

165
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,250
See you there.
