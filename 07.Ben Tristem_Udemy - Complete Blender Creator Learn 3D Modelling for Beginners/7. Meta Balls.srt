00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,170
Welcome to balls in this video you'll learn how to add a metal ball.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,040
Use them quickly to build up a base framework.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,040
See that they're great for modelling organic objects and understand they need converting afterwards

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,050
to a mesh so we can add further detail so that hop straight on over into blender.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,300
Right so back over in blender.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,960
Let's go and play with metal balls.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,770
So first of all make sure your file is saved and then go ahead and open a new file.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,000
Right so we've got the default keep on going to get rid of that and we're going to add a metal ball

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,370
so you can go through the ADD menu here.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,890
And we see if we go up we have met a ball and we've got five different types of metal ball and a great

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,140
thing is we can switch between those at a later point as well so they're not solidified at this point

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,190
in time.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,810
You can also use the shortcut menu with shift in A and select the one you want.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,000
So I'm going to add a ball to our scene.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,480
Now if you glance over at the right hand side are just expand mine out a little.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,580
We've got a metal ball type object.

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,350
And notice this symbol here the same symbol has now appeared in the Properties window just here out

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,850
in edit mode.

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:26,300
If we go into that now you'll see that we've got a few more options under active elements.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,450
We'll deal with the top part of this in the moments just hide that away under active element.

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,750
It gives you a chance to change the type so we can set to cube we can go down to plain captial ball

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,960
etc. so you can switch between them.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,030
Now let's add a nother met a ball to our scene.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,900
So I'm just going to duplicate the capsule that we've got here and I'm just going to lift it up and

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,770
I'm going to change it.

26
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,920
Type in edit mode to a ball.

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,230
Now we can see what it's done here and it's really cool.

28
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,190
As we move it closer and closer as the boundary's come together.

29
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,960
They start to join one end of her which as you can imagine is incredibly powerful when it comes to modelling.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,110
I'm going to add another one to our sea and pop it underneath and scale it up so you can do all the

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,950
usual things you would do scaling rotating obviously a metal ball if it's just a ball shape it's just

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,730
gonna well remain a ball shape if you rotate it.

33
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:37,770
But if we go ahead and select this middle one here which is our first starting one and rotate it we

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,280
can of course twist our model around.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,670
Brilliant.

36
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,830
So the resolution let's have a look at these settings here the view is what we're going to see now and

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,300
the render is what's going to happen if we render it out.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,840
And it's counterintuitive initially but the higher the resolution setting the lower resolution the model

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,440
will be.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,030
So if we increase this number here you can see it's getting more and more blocky as we go.

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,180
Until eventually it just disappears.

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,470
If we lower that number there is a finite resolution it will go to but it ends up much smoother.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,270
But it will slow down the actual view ports a little so when you're rotating You may depending on the

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,170
speed of your computer get a little bit of judder which is why they've got these two options here.

45
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,260
So you can have the view resolution higher than that of the render and the render.

46
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,300
As you can see there goes much further down.

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,410
Now in order to do anything with the curves themselves not curve sorry the metal balls they're kind

48
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,930
of three dimensional curves.

49
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,200
But to do anything with these metal supply we'd need to solidify them in from a metter ball to a mesh

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:54,930
and we can do that as we've done before I can use the shortcut keys out and see and we get the convert

51
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,350
to.

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,240
We've got mesh here and.

53
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,960
Mesh From met her.

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
That's the one there are lots see.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,380
You can also do it under the object menu.

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,250
Right at the top they're under convert.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,440
So it's hidden under there as well.

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,780
Now before we do any converting and seeing how that comes out the final thing I want to show you is

59
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,610
quite cool.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,590
While I think it's cool.

61
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,730
Anyway so if we hop over into edit mode we've got a few other options here.

62
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,260
So we're working on this middle one at the moment I don't want to do if I want to work on this top one.

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,050
Let's do that and let's hop into edit mode again because come out now we've got a couple of options

64
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,640
down here under active elements.

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:44,770
Not only can we change what type it is but we can also set its stiffness and that determines the inner

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,650
area of that circle.

67
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:54,460
So if we set that quite small we can get a quite stretched out version of it going on there and then

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,970
set them back to to where it was before and lower it back down a little.

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,270
The next one negative is quite cool as we take that.

70
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,150
It now subtracts from the other metal balls it comes into contact with rather then adds to them which

71
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,630
is a great way of putting a dent in that and of course if it was smaller we could even put a hole in

72
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,000
the object just like that.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
Brilliant.

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,160
So let's convert the shape we've got here to a mesh.

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,410
So in object mode with all of the metal balls selected staff selected them in the outline and just a

76
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,350
quick note and make sure you are happy with the resolution you've got set.

77
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:43,150
Now when we do make this net and mesh object in a few moments it's going to use the view resolution

78
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,480
that we had set over on the met ball on the right hand side a moment ago and then oltz and see.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,550
And that will then give us the convert menu and we can select mesh from curve.

80
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,600
Okay.

81
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,890
Now we can start editing it we can do lots of things.

82
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,030
So let's have a look at what it's generated when we hop into edit mode.

83
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,350
Wow.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,770
There's lots of detail going on there.

85
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,290
And it kind of looks nice but it's also quite messy in places as well.

86
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,500
Blender does its best to keep things organized but that is a bit of a mess you'd never build a mesh

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,670
looking like that.

88
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,580
But it's a good starting point.

89
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,530
Now there's a thing called reid's apology which were not going to do at the moment since our bunnies

90
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,280
are going to be covered up with fur so we can leave this as our base mesh and then build upon it.

91
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,580
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

92
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,480
I'd like you to make a basic rabbits.

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,590
So create the head and body leaving the ears for the moment.

94
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,050
You need at least two metal balls keep the metal ball resolution around Oak Point too so it's not too

95
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,020
high.

96
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,520
Use reference material for an accurate shape.

97
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,940
Now if you don't have any reference material at the moment there some provided in the asset packs so

98
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,180
go ahead and download that.

99
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,580
Now if you haven't done already.

100
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,280
Remember you can scale and rotate the metal balls.

101
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,290
Then finally once you're happy with the shape convert it into a mesh object.

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,580
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go.

103
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,310
You guys welcome back.

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,510
Let's go ahead and make a basic rabbit over in blender.

105
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,930
All right so we're back over in blender and I've opened up my fluffy bunny file.

106
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,760
So I want to go to layer one which is the rabbit layer and at the moment it's just got a cube on it.

107
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,000
So the first thing I'm going to do is flip around to the left hand side.

108
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,840
And yes that's with the y direction facing to the left so you can see there with the Arab I'm going

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,230
to delete that cube and I'm going to bring in some reference material.

110
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,960
So I've opened up the 3D propertys.

111
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,020
Let's term background images on.

112
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,270
Let's open and go fine.

113
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,950
So here we go.

114
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,430
Your section assets.

115
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,190
I could actually use my bunny sketch we did earlier on but I think I use a real rabbit as reference

116
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,860
material.

117
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,280
So I've got three rabbits here to choose from I can pick any of them.

118
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,530
I'm going to probably pick this one here is more upright than the others is showing more yes more side

119
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,980
on.

120
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,540
So that's perfect start point.

121
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,380
I want to lift that up a little so let's do that now.

122
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,900
Or.

123
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,140
Yeah opacity per 50 percent want in front of whatever I'm working on maybe a little lower on opacity

124
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,650
there.

125
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,390
Let's lift it up.

126
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,950
If ATLAS I'm going to make it a bit bigger to work on so I know we're not working with anything too

127
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,450
small.

128
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,860
And then let's lift it up scale in this instance.

129
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,210
I'm not too bothered about because.

130
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,140
We can always alter the rabbit's scale at any point as one solid objects.

131
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:57,040
I don't want to flip it does me why but I want the rabbit's head on the left hand side rather than right.

132
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,010
Flip that round.

133
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:04,760
So I'm going to the 3D cursor smack bang in the middle of the head and add ourselves a metal ball which

134
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,690
is roughly the right size which is kind of cool.

135
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:16,430
So I want to scale that so I will squish it in both x and z but not white scale shift and why.

136
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,360
And that should bring it down a little Ragna rotate around the x axis which we can't see at the moment

137
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,080
and then just move it up slightly.

138
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,470
That has worked out really well actually and then we've got a body here so let's go ahead masood we

139
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,340
can get away with only to plop back roughly in the middle of duplicated that I'm going to rotate it

140
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,040
round the x axis.

141
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,720
And under this you just can scale that up and need to move it a little more down.

142
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,350
Pace that's a good starting shape going on there.

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,280
In fact let's just hop around to see what it's looking like.

144
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
AB That's a pretty good start point actually doesn't look too rough around the neck and places like

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,170
that as hop over into the metal ball options view resolution is relatively low at the moment.

146
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,820
So let's up that resolution a little.

147
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,110
Case to point not point to five not point two yet.

148
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,810
That's looking pretty good there.

149
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,310
Okay so let's hop back in to the left hand view here and just see if there's any other tweaking we can

150
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,620
do at this front bit of the rabbit.

151
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,900
Here's pretty much all fluff and no good at puffing their chests out there.

152
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,410
Nick comes in a little here but we can deal with that later on.

153
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,310
But it does come up a little here some schooling too.

154
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,660
I don't know if this is going to work.

155
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,970
So bear with me.

156
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,370
Trying out a few different things here.

157
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,870
And I'm going to give that a new one.

158
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,320
Yes there is a new one as we can see there.

159
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,640
That's not what a rabbit looks like.

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,170
I'm just going to scale that right down.

161
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,160
And then move it back towards here.

162
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,770
Produce that extra bump and see how that looks.

163
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,240
Looks like there's like a bit of a lump on the back.

164
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,740
But let's ascared it out in the x-axis Whilst looking around here.

165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,390
A scale in the x axis is bringing it out.

166
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,780
I'm not sure whether I like that or not.

167
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,090
Push in a little to blend out and then scale it up again.

168
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,250
That's a that is much better in terms of underly Remember that are it's going to be covered in fluff

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,080
as well.

170
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Then no one telling you that I should remember that.

171
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,430
And that's a much better shape now as well.

172
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,310
I'm just going to duplicate that and add a bit more of a bump.

173
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,770
Down at the bottom here.

174
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm going to rotate round to make sure it's absolutely fine for one to push that into the body.

175
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,140
Just a little bit more.

176
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,450
Pull it back using the transform will just.

177
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,580
Excellent.

178
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,170
I'm quite happy with that.

179
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,310
I'd love to see how yours came out before I actually finished this lecture.

180
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,280
Of course I haven't converted it to a mesh.

181
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:14,260
Tut tut tut nociolo it's all of our curves and not cursory metal balls the 3D curves and I'm going to

182
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:22,510
go Olsen see and convert that to a mesh which is right and I'm just going to quickly investigate what

183
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,840
that mesh looks like.

184
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,660
That doesn't look like it's too over the top is very very bitty.

185
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,370
But again we are.

186
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,930
We could go round this and trace it called a with a method called reet apology which will visit later

187
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,400
Ron in the course.

188
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,210
But for the moment because were covered up with fur I'm quite happy with that not happening.

189
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,860
Okay.

190
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,330
So there's our base rabbit shape I'd love to see what you guys come up perhaps you've got your rabbit

191
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,440
in a slightly different pose perhaps you've added more detail or less detail.

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,130
It's entirely up to you how you make your rabbits of course.

193
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,890
So please share what you've come up with in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
