00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.800
Hello everybody and welcome to this video where we're going to have lots of fun making a dynamic material

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
not only just the materials going to change over time but we're also going to deform the mesh as well

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.030
using a very similar technique.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.840
So as you can see with this video that I've got up on the screen at the moment we're going to start

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.600
with a nice glossy finish.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.710
We're going to decay that we're going to make it rust away and then we'll get actually deform the mesh

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.780
based upon that.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.810
Now we are going to use a few of the features a blender two point seven nine.

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.370
So if you've not Paul VI installed on your computer we're going to have to do that.

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.110
So two point seventy nine is the starting point you will need for this video.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
Namely we're going to use the principle shader and some of the experimental features will be a bit more

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.980
stable as we use them into Point 7 9.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.430
Now if we have a look at the screen over here we have also a few things to do to set up.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.260
So let's go ahead and do that now.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.610
So I'm going to click away to dismiss the splash screen.

16
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.060
And we got the default cube.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.890
Now you may have other add ons installed.

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.920
This is a pretty stock version of blender.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.590
But we're going to have to make sure we got a couple of things installed.

20
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.460
First of all so you guys can follow along without any issues.

21
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.380
The first one that I want to show you is when we're going to be rendering we need to make sure that

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.530
we're in cycle so we go to the very top on the info head a bar and switch that from Blender render to

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
cycles render because we're going to use the cycles rendering engine the next thing that we're going

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.750
to need to do is go down to the render properties and make sure that the feature set is set from supported

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.730
to experimental.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.800
Now here comes our first warning when it comes to using the experimental features.

27
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.510
It is incredibly important that you get into the habit of saving and saving regularly because as we

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.770
go through this you will find that occasionally blender will crash.

29
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.720
Not only are we using an experimental feature sets but we are also going to be rendering a lot will

30
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.000
have to come in and out of rendering to show what is actually going on on the screen.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.620
We won't see some of the output until we do that.

32
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.460
The next thing I'm going to do is go to my add on and go to the File menu come down to the user preferences

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.110
and from there we can go to add ons.

34
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.470
And I'm going to enable node Wrangler I don't think I'm going to be using anything out soon the search

35
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.870
box I've typed in notes or I don't have to go searching.

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.000
And then finally we've got node Wrangler.

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.650
Make sure there's a tick in that box.

38
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.760
Now in general that's a good one to have on any way at the moment.

39
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
It will just apply to this current blender file we're working on.

40
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.900
But if you want it to apply to every blender file you can go ahead and save your user settings.

41
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.810
Once we've gone ahead and done that I'm going to close down the user preferences and save my files so

42
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.900
we get going and I'm going to save this as Rusty.

43
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.400
Pipe.

44
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.850
Okay so let's crack on now and start generating our object.

45
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.030
Now in this particular case I decided to create my object in a slightly different way.

46
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.120
So even though it might look like I've extruded a cylinder or something like that in this case that's

47
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.060
not what I've done something to clear down wanted to go into edit mode actually on this Q and just delete

48
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.330
the top vertices.

49
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.820
And I'm in virtex mode at the moment so I'm just going to quickly select holding the Shift key right

50
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.410
click for those top few.

51
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.810
I'm going to press the x key to delete and I'm going to select vertices.

52
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.350
This will leave us with something we can work on now that ideally should be in a better position than

53
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.800
down there but we can sort that out in a moment.

54
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.970
The next day I'm going to do is delete the face.

55
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.030
So let's go ahead and delete that face.

56
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.280
But I'm not going to just do faces and do only faces and that will leave the surrounding edge so this

57
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.310
will be the base for our pipe that we're working on our rusty pipe.

58
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.490
But the next thing we need to do here is actually add something else to give it a bit more interest.

59
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.750
That's really all this is about.

60
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.530
I mean you can you can create your own shape as you go.

61
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.780
If you wanted to select everything here and move it up on the z axis by one so it's in the middle of

62
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.500
our scene.

63
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.640
Now I'm going to move across.

64
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.650
It doesn't matter whether it's in the positive or negative direction here but I'm going to move it in

65
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.380
the x direction so g x and then buy one.

66
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.830
So we've got our our bass coming together here.

67
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.640
Now the final thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go back a virtex Select and create a triangle going

68
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.980
up here so I'm going to extrude.

69
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.300
So E for extrude.

70
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.160
So we've got this now floating virtex connected with an edge and a groove Z by two.

71
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.140
And then I'm going to move that across in the y direction by once a G.

72
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.420
Why one.

73
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.970
And then I can extrude down to this vertex down here now in order to make sure I'm not faffing around

74
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.330
trying to join these two things together in a bit.

75
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.740
By removing doubles.

76
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.330
What I can go ahead and do is when I extruding I can snap to virtex and merge vertices automatically.

77
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.980
So we go along to the aethereally head a bar here and we turn on snapping which is this little magnet.

78
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.930
Now if you can't see everything if you've not got a high enough resolution display you can use the mouse

79
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.310
wheel to scroll backwards and forwards on any of these header bars where you can't see anything.

80
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.480
I'll just demonstrate that if I pull this across so we cannot see that magnet.

81
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.060
We can use the scroll wheel to pull it across and then we can see it.

82
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.550
This just make that a decent size again.

83
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.910
Okay the next thing is what are we going to snap to Will increment might be fine but I'm not going to

84
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.440
risk that.

85
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.630
I'm going to actually try and snap to the vertex and this means we can pick this individual point here.

86
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.160
Now we go ahead and extrude and puts a vertex on top of here will actually end up with two vertices

87
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.010
in one place occupying the same space.

88
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.180
So in order to make sure that doesn't happen I'm going to go along a little further and there's an ought

89
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.650
there's two arrows butting heads together and that is automatically merge vertices moved to the same

90
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.590
location and because with snapping it will be the same location.

91
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.440
So with all those three things sets I compress each to extrude again and this time I just move my cursor

92
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.270
over that Vertex.

93
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.700
There we go and it snaps in place and it's merged and if we print G we can see that that is moving all

94
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.260
together.

95
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.190
It's not moving individually so perfect that's that's actually everything we need done in order to set

96
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.680
up our basic shape.

97
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.720
Okay so it didn't quite look like that it looked like it was there was two of them and that's what we

98
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.360
need to do so I'm going to go ahead to the modifiers tab and come out of edit mode into object mode

99
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.300
and then from here I'm going to go and go to the modifiers tab in the Properties window.

100
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.330
And I'm going to add our first modifier Now there are going to be all three or four modifiers as we

101
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.990
go through this.

102
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.840
But let's go ahead and add our first one our first one is going to be a mirror modifier So we're generating

103
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.200
new mesh data so we go to the generate column.

104
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.400
If we go down there it is mirror.

105
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.540
Now fortunately I've made it along the x axis so when I reflect it among the x axis it does actually

106
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.610
just put it there which is absolutely fine.

107
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.680
I'm also going to turn on clipping if I accidentally go ahead and move any of this geometry What I don't

108
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.890
want to happen is for it to end up with intersecting geometry turning on clipping will help prevent

109
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.390
that.

110
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.210
Okay so that's the first modifier set up.

111
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.390
Now if we go ahead and add in a nother modifier this time a skin modifier.

112
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.130
Now this modifies actually go it's another generate generating mesh.

113
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.170
We go to the skin.

114
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.320
We can see that it puts around our sort of been that we had created.

115
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.640
Now this isn't ideal at the moment we can see blatantly here that this is well not to be there at the

116
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.060
moment.

117
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.020
It's very rigid.

118
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.870
Now this might be a look that you're going for that's absolutely fine.

119
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.290
But that's not the look for I want to go for.

120
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.870
So in this particular case I'm going to hide away the skin and hide away the mirror.

121
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.560
Just dropping those down.

122
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:50.290
Now let's just see here if a if a modifier the subdivision surface modifiers to solve our issue.

123
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:56.760
So we scroll down again this is generated because we generate in new geometry subdivisions surface and

124
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.400
that's looking pretty good.

125
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.790
Now let's knock up the levels of subdivision surficial is a little bit more.

126
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.580
Yeah that's a that's so quite a good start.

127
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.790
Now in this particular case there are a couple of other things that we need to turn on.

128
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.800
Now I am going to turn on adaptive and I'm going to leave everything how it currently is.

129
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.860
We may have to work with that later.

130
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.880
Now adaptive is something that will subdivide more.

131
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:29.250
The close service object is to the camera when it comes to rendering and subdivide less further away

132
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.910
so that basically means that the further you get away from the camera the less room work has to be done

133
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.230
calculations have to be done.

134
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.730
So ultimately you will end up with a faster roundup.

135
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:45.120
However to counter that the closer something is to the camera the more it might be chopped up and therefore

136
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.040
have a more work that needs to be done.

137
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.440
So if you got a lot of your object really close to the camera you may find that this will slow down

138
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.620
your rendering slightly.

139
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.010
But if you've got a scene like this Let's say we set up the camera along these lines where a lot of

140
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.280
the geometries far back and there's only really this front bit.

141
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.990
That's next.

142
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.800
The camera.

143
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.770
Find that it looks much better when it comes to chopping up the geometry.

144
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.470
When we start deforming this meshes it rusts away in a bit.

145
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.900
Okay so we've got the base mesh all lined up here.

146
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.740
There are a couple of other things that are all one.

147
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.700
To do at this point in time.

148
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.850
First of all I'm going to turn on smooth shade and so in object mode I'm going to make sure that smooth

149
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.420
shading is turned on.

150
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.310
And then I'm going to rename my cue book show rename it let's call it rust the pipe.

151
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.740
Might as well get our naming right from the very beginning.

152
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.170
I'm not sure it took smooth shading it doesn't look particularly smooth flat smooth.

153
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.610
Interesting.

154
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.170
There might.

155
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.270
And let's go ahead now and add a bit of colour to this.

156
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.810
So let's go to the materials tab.

157
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.930
An add in a bass material.

158
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.860
Now this is going to actually be a dynamic material that will end up modifying over time.

159
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.290
But I'm just going to name it pipe for the moment and I'm going to click he use notes.

160
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.670
Let's go ahead and use that new principal shader.

161
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.630
It's basically a load of shaders all pumped together and that actually makes the node set up just that

162
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.300
little bit easier and less involved in some cases.

163
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.960
He also does some calculations in the background as well some highly metal shelfs there and I'm going

164
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.930
to go into the node editor and start editing.

165
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.870
Now before we start going through and adding a ton of stuff here let's just keep it simple so get rid

166
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:32.920
of our diffuse be STF shader and press X to get rid of that or make sure you've only got that one selected.

167
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.880
Otherwise that can cause you a few headaches.

168
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.400
There we go.

169
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:44.910
Information is only that selected delete that and I'm going to add in and a shader of type print support.

170
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.210
B s the f.

171
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.900
Now at this point I tend to use the search feature so I will type in P R Ah.

172
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.610
There we go it's there straight away.

173
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.510
That's the general thing that I will do when I'm looking for something.

174
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.810
And here we have the b s t f we can plug that into the surface.

175
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.720
Now will also be using the displacement part of this in a moment.

176
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.000
So there's going to be sort of two halves two on Node structure.

177
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:14.080
We'll sort out roughly how it looks to begin with and then we'll talk about its defamations So talk

178
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.710
about its colours and sort of building up the model and adding material.

179
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.570
Now we're talking about animating and deforming it over time.

180
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.870
So there will be another modifier will add on in a few minutes.

181
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.520
So our base colour Now I picked green before I'm going to pick red this time.

182
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.310
Now before we do anything else I'm going to save my work.

183
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.170
Okay so there are a couple of other things I just want to finish off here to set the scene and make

184
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.450
sure that it's not so jerky as we start being a bit more advanced with our rendering stuff.

185
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.660
Now I am recording at the moment.

186
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.650
Obviously you are witnessing that.

187
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.910
So I'm going to change my device from my s.p. which is being used for the recording to GP you.

188
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.850
Now you may not have the option in general GP use are going to be there.

189
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.740
This type of workflow especially when it comes to rendering which were going to be doing hopping in

190
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.350
and out.

191
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.640
But if you're working on the s.p. you that's absolutely fine.

192
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.880
This will also work on s.p. Use and you won't have the bottleneck that I have with recording anyway

193
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.130
so GP use turned up just going to save that as we're going through and just test the rendering that

194
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.290
is working Excellent.

195
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.690
Now a couple of other things or look that's a lot smoother as well.

196
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.360
Wish I'd done that earlier.

197
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:32.010
Let's go ahead and add in a mesh and this time it's going to be a plane and the scale up by a.

198
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.010
A silly amount.

199
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.950
Probably scale by 20.

200
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.010
Excellent so that's all scaled up.

201
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.400
I'm going to rename that ground because that's essentially what it's going to be.

202
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.420
Now what happens if we render this scene now.

203
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.940
Okay it's looking good.

204
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.900
We need a bit more light in the scene now we could go about making a more complex light set up.

205
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:57.580
I'm simply going to go to my lamp and change its type to a sunlamp and when to use nodes and increase

206
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.240
the strength to maybe 3.

207
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.000
Yep that looks pretty good.

208
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.920
Now looking at this.

209
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.640
This doesn't look like a metallic your a painted pipe at all.

210
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.820
This looks like a lump of plastic at the moment so let's rectify that straightaway.

211
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.620
Let's go to our principal shader and change the roughness.

212
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.960
Drop it down to point one.

213
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.940
Maybe a little higher actually or a little lower in this case so point nought five.

214
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.510
Yes I'm happy with that as a starting value now as it starts getting rusty what we can do is make it

215
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:38.690
rougher in places and we can change that and guide that based upon some textures in a few moments.

216
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:44.120
But at this moment in time we're getting everything ready getting a rough approximation of what we're

217
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.750
going to be going for.

218
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:52.250
Also we can see here that our our object is embedded in the ground so I'm going to grab the ground move

219
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:57.970
it down on the z axis and by only a little bit because I don't want it to disappear and I think I've

220
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.600
still got snapping turned on if I have that's going to cause me an issue because it will be snapping

221
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.480
to things when I don't want to.

222
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.890
Yes I still have that being turned on.

223
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.190
So let's turn that off.

224
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.680
Grab the floor g z.

225
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.180
There we go it's lowering down and I will not make it levitate about there.

226
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.860
That looks absolutely fine to me.

227
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.690
Just by I it doesn't matter at this point in time.

228
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:26.430
So we've got a nice shiny metal bar or a painted metal bar that we can start making Rusty.

229
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.720
Now I do want to show you I'm going to save my work do save regularly because we're going to be rendering

230
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.050
lots and it will crash it will tell you it will crash at some point.

231
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.330
We want to avoid that.

232
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.320
But what I want to do here is just show you what sort of notes set up we're going to be approaching

233
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.240
for with the material on here just to give you an overview of where we're going before we actually go

234
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.720
there.

235
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.550
So I'll save that I'm going to open up my rusti demonstration and let's get rid of everything else.

236
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.350
But the note sets up Okay so here we go.

237
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:02.290
Now don't be afraid when you have a look at this it is a lot going on here but we're going to build

238
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.570
this up slowly as we go through and I'm going to explain what each bit is actually doing.

239
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.370
In fact it does look like there's something that's there that's redundant as well.

240
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.270
By the looks of it this little noise texture at the top here is its outputs aren't actually plugged

241
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.200
into anywhere.

242
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.970
But let's zoom in just for a moment to the principal shade because that's all we really have at the

243
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.630
moment.

244
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.270
And let's just have a look at the few changes that have happened here.

245
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.420
Now the moment we've got the principal shedded coming out and going into the output what the material

246
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.790
looks like what the surface of that material renders like.

247
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.520
Now notice that the first thing that's been changed is the base colour.

248
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.860
And obviously as something goes Rusty it's going to change from its its painted colour to perhaps an

249
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:50.210
orange colour because it's rusting and because of that we need to control that over time.

250
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.050
And that's why we've got series of notes will look at those in a few moments plugged into the base colour.

251
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.700
The other things that are changing are it's metallic now.

252
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.040
And it's roughness.

253
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:07.240
Now when you start you will get some metal coming through before it starts going rusty so I'm going

254
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:14.920
to change the metallic appearance of the surface and also the roughness itself as something goes Rusty.

255
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.430
It's going to be smooth painted to begin with but as it starts to go rusty Well it's going to get rougher

256
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.950
as well it's not going to be as shiny as it once was.

257
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.200
Simple as that really.

258
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.550
So that it is quite complex as you go back here and we can see there's a bit of crossover.

259
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.120
This bottom part is all about displacement in reality.

260
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.140
And this top half is all about how the colours are changing.

261
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.730
However as you can see these nodes are connected in such a way a bit messy.

262
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:47.710
This is an experimental project after all but these are there's a great deal of crossover because as

263
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.840
you can expect as something starts to rust away you're also going to end up with it changing colour

264
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:58.780
and the parameters how it is rusting away will also dictate how the colours change as well and that's

265
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.550
why there is this crossover.

266
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:05.280
So what you do now is hop back into our project and start building this up.

267
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.790
Okay so we're back over in our projects here we've done the modelling aspect and we've got a base material

268
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.320
on here that's the modelling part pretty much done.

269
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.790
As far as this go so we've got all the geometry out of the way the next thing we need to work on is

270
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:26.190
how this is actually looking in terms of how it's going to act as it rusts away.

271
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.800
That's quite important because it's very easy to basically get the wrong parameters or do things in

272
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.070
a funny order and then you end up having to backtrack.

273
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.680
So let's just make sure we're doing this in a in a more logical way.

274
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:46.020
Now the first thing we need to do is add in a mix shader Now then switch rended mode on hopefully won't

275
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.400
cause any crashes we do have to obviously be careful of that if it does crash.

276
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.570
I may have to go back a little bit hopefully because I save Reguly that won't be an issue.

277
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.120
OK.

278
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.690
So we have a base colour here we need to go between one set up and another.

279
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.970
And what we need to do in order to do that and there's there are many ways you could go about this by

280
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.160
the way but we're going to try and keep it simple.

281
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:15.330
And so we're going to have to r.g. BE nodes which are basically the colour red green blue.

282
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.820
So let's go ahead and add in another node and call it what is R G B.

283
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.300
Here we go.

284
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.710
So we've got a lot of options in here but in this case we just want r.g. be and this is basically a

285
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.970
colour selector.

286
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:32.490
So I'm going to go shifta and duplicate that so we've got two colour selectors we'll have our original

287
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.650
colour up here which is going to be red and we're have a rusty colour for the moment an orange.

288
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.550
That's absolutely fine.

289
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.340
We don't need to do anything else.

290
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:46.740
The next thing we need to do is mix these two together so we can go from one colour to the other.

291
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.890
Now of course you can do this in multiple ways and in fact you can do it in a gradual way and have multiple

292
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.940
layers of mix which is essentially what I did in that more advanced one.

293
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.210
But you can go ahead and build that up yourself for the moment.

294
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.030
Let's go ahead and mix these two together.

295
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.690
So.

296
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:09.030
Good to add we shift in a and I'm going to type in mix in this case.

297
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.960
We're not mixing shaders we're mixing are.

298
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.660
If you go ahead and pop that in.

299
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.000
And then we've got colour one attach colour to.

300
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.930
And then we can go in and apply a base colour.

301
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:26.480
Now at the moment as we slide the factor backwards and forwards you can see we can go from our red to

302
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.540
our orange.

303
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.480
Pretty neat.

304
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.750
Hey there we go.

305
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.400
Job done.

306
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:36.680
Well unfortunately things don't rust like that do very rust in a more random pattern so we're going

307
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.350
to have to have something there that's controlling that control in this colour.

308
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.140
But based upon it changing kind of randomly rather than just the whole thing at once.

309
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.310
So I'm going to change this factor.

310
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:54.110
And for that we're going to use a texture now I'm going to make this RG be just a little smaller for

311
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.890
the moment.

312
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.660
Now we're going to control this factor we need to control it with something.

313
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.500
What shall we use to control it with.

314
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.040
Well let's go ahead and add in a texture.

315
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.140
So we're going to go down to texture and there are lots of different textures you can use.

316
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:14.900
But after playing with it for a bit it's even noise or former Roy is going to be quite good.

317
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.240
I'm going to use noise initially.

318
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.090
Now I am going to have a quick look at my settings that I had before so we can speed things along as

319
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.710
it were.

320
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:32.120
But in this case I found a scale of 10 that works really well and I'm going to plug for the factor not

321
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.670
the colour but the factor itself into the factor up here.

322
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.500
What we should end up with and we do now run out of zoom over on this window on the right hand side

323
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.180
so I'm going to go to the view and view selected.

324
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.660
If you've got a number pad and you run out of zoom by are using your scroll wheel and doesn't seem to

325
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.810
be doing anything.

326
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.590
No pad.

327
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.300
Full stop.

328
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.110
There you go.

329
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.760
There in we zoom in here we can see that we've got blotchy patches here.

330
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.780
That's pretty good.

331
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.010
That's a good start.

332
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.980
However what I feel is kind of happening here is we're not really getting.

333
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.250
A great deal of one or the other.

334
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:13.150
And eventually we do want it to migrate over to being completely rusty and we can't do that by just

335
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.140
plugging it in like this.

336
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.270
So we're going to need something in between.

337
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.090
This is entirely up to you how you do this.

338
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.970
I'm going to use a colour ramp.

339
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.300
Now I've also got because I've got no Wrangler turned on.

340
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.620
I've also got the ability to hold down control and shift and click on any of these nodes to see what

341
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.270
it looks like at any point.

342
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.100
Now the first control shift then left click is going to select the top outputs.

343
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.870
In this case the colour and then if I click again it alternate to the factor.

344
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.880
And because it's the factor that we use here we can see on our model now how it's being applied now

345
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.610
because there's no true white or there might be on there or there may even be a true black on there.

346
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:57.040
But because it's not completely polarized to black and white we don't actually have ourselves any means

347
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.540
of seeing the full rust colour or the full paint colour.

348
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.470
So what we can do here is go ahead and add in a colour ramp.

349
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.580
That's one way of which we can control this.

350
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.640
We can also control it with a with brightness and contrast node that would also work.

351
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.750
But in this case I'm going to use a colour a can have a little bit more control over it and I'm going

352
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:23.040
to go shift in a kind of a search for my colour ramp and there it is colour ramp.

353
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.520
So go ahead and you can see if you drop the node over it will connect in place.

354
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.650
Now what I can do is I can go to my mics again to see what it's looking like.

355
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.380
This is a raw version before it's all rendered up.

356
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.180
But I can adjust where the black point is essentially making everything painted or I can just wear the

357
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.600
white.

358
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.400
Point is essentially making everything rusty so that we can actually animate that if we want to.

359
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.590
So that would be one way of making it.

360
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:54.580
The rust the year or certainly start making sure we start with full paint and then work our way to being

361
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.430
rusty.

362
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.380
The other way.

363
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.160
So there's lots of options we can do in terms of animating that.

364
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.070
But let's get the basic things set up first.

365
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:08.820
So that is all of the basic material set up there and let's go ahead here.

366
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.510
Just bring that down a little bit more and bring this one up.

367
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:18.900
So we see we get a much bigger contrast between where rust spots are and where paint is going to be.

368
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.690
If I then go to my principal shader and shift control click VAT's we can see that we end up with well

369
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.140
we've not got anything affecting its roughness yet so it's still shiny where it's orange.

370
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.670
How can we do that well because the paint is linked to this colour ramp.

371
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.980
Let's try and use that so let's come out from the colour here and plug that into the roughness.

372
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:50.930
Now hopefully what this will now do is where it is shiny but it's still got paint on it will be shiny

373
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.510
and where it is not i.e. this orange.

374
00:23:53.510 --> 00:24:00.020
It will be quite rough and I think we can see that if I turn that off by moving it out and let's find

375
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:07.120
somewhere that is in fact shiny on oh there we go over here on the end we can see that it is shiny and

376
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:12.590
it this highlights if I angle this right should go across both.

377
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.040
There we go.

378
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.980
We got it on the orange.

379
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.980
That's exactly what I want to demonstrate this.

380
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.600
Now if I go ahead and plug in the colour into the roughness we should find.

381
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.250
There we go.

382
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.240
It is shiny where it's red and where it was orange.

383
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.030
It's no longer shiny so rough in those places.

384
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.770
Excellent.

385
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.320
So we can see how we can start to build up quite a dynamic texture.

386
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.970
By doing it this way a quite dynamic surfaces where this is completely procedural.

387
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.550
At the moment we're not using a fixed texture to generate any of this.

388
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.290
So there we go.

389
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.920
Now controlled both where it's rough and where it's smooth and where the colour changes as well.

390
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.850
Fortunately they're over the same things.

391
00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:02.120
The next thing we need to do is test out how we want this to look when it starts to get really rusty

392
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:08.090
and the other thing I want to do as well was then here is start to control how these noise textures

393
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.190
are placed now because we got the node Wrangler add on turned on.

394
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:18.260
What I can do at this point is select that and go control in T and that will add in a mapping and a

395
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.090
texture call warden node.

396
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.310
It may even add in an image as well which we can delete so control and say Here we go.

397
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.780
It's added in a mapping and a texture coordinate.

398
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:34.970
The reason why I've added these in is to give us a bit more control over our model and its textures

399
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:43.010
and also be explicit about how we want this texture this noise texture applied to that model because

400
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.070
we could go about and apply it in such certainly in different ways.

401
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:52.250
Now we're doing generated coordinates here so blender is handling all of that for us and that's probably

402
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.340
a good thing with the way that we've constructed our Rusty pipe.

403
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.740
It doesn't really have any mesh data at the moment.

404
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.210
It's purely generated from those individual edges.

405
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.110
We drew at the very beginning Okay.

406
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.450
So we've got that coming through.

407
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.770
Now one of the things I do want to change is the scale on here.

408
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.560
This gives us an extra layer of tweaking I quite like how it looks.

409
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:21.710
But what happens if we say set this to 10 10 and 10 how we get a much more bity a rusty pattern so we

410
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.710
can go back and we can change it on one particular direction if we want.

411
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.440
But in general I'd recommend matching these up.

412
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:33.230
So I'm trying to pick something that looks in between it being totally Rusty.

413
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.000
However the where it actually starts flaking off and we can add in other control points as well.

414
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.210
If we want to.

415
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.620
So we have here something that looks pretty good so far.

416
00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:51.120
In terms of everything that we've got but now we need to control how this is going about its hole or

417
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.990
disintegration and it's actually displacement.

418
00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.350
There are a couple of things that we can do first and that's just to make sure that the experimental

419
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.880
features that we've turned on are actually going to work now in order to do that we're going to have

420
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.180
to turn them on.

421
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.830
Now that is under the material properties itself and click on material unger's Scroll down a little

422
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.170
so as we come down here there's an option for displacement.

423
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.240
That's fine we believe as it is under the settings.

424
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.140
If you scroll down a little further we've got an option of displacement at the moment just as bump.

425
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.540
We don't want bump.

426
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360
We want both.

427
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.720
We can do true but both really accentuates it so we're going to use both.

428
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.610
Now you won't notice anything change at the moment because nothing is plugged into the displacement

429
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.960
material output.

430
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.950
I'm going to lower this down ever so slightly and I'm going to plug in our colour ramp that we had earlier

431
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.270
so let's go ahead and plug in that colour ramp into the displacement.

432
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.780
Now all that's actually updated.

433
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.000
Occasionally it won't.

434
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.410
Do we go ahead and go shift Z.

435
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.770
And then shift Z again.

436
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.750
There we go.

437
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.070
You will have to do that occasionally.

438
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.830
It's worked first time this time and really impressed with that.

439
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:10.290
But occasionally you'll make a change and it won't be reflected over in the viewport and TV turned rendering

440
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.830
off and back on again.

441
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.910
Now to keep this rendering nice and quick.

442
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:19.800
I'm going to go to my render settings scroll down and go to sampling.

443
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:25.050
Now I'm not I don't really care and it of it looking that pretty somewhere turned the preview down to

444
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.080
maybe 5.

445
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.770
I'm not going to leave it at one.

446
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.600
It would be ridiculous.

447
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.470
But if it's five I know it's going to get to a decent place quite quickly and we can see there that

448
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.050
that that's pretty cool.

449
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.610
But it's a bit on the strong side so we're going to have to add in probably another colour ramp or something

450
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.460
else just to control how that's behaving.

451
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.170
We certainly don't want it looking quite like that towards the end.

452
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.370
We need to control that displacement insane in in some form or another.

453
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.660
And on top of that the displacement itself is not going to be totally smooth it's going to have a bit

454
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:04.270
more of a bump to it as it starts sort of bubbling away and we can add that in in a few moments as well.

455
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:09.990
If I'm going to start by building that up as we go so we've got a noise texture here I'm going to grab

456
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:15.030
that and duplicate it and I'm going to grab our colour ramp and also duplicate that.

457
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:20.160
Now we need to control how this is looking at but I want something else there as well.

458
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.150
I need to mix two things together.

459
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:28.320
So when I go ahead and add in a mix RG be note and plump that in the middle and that means I can start

460
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.930
adding in something else.

461
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:35.820
Now I need something after that to control how it comes across.

462
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.340
So then I can spread this out a little further and make it a little less bumpy in this case.

463
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:46.410
Now I'm going to go control shift and click on this to see what it looks like and I was going to go

464
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.680
shift Z in the viewport and out again.

465
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400
So not really changed how that looks.

466
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.040
For the moment if I bring that down so it's not fully affected and come back again.

467
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.730
There we go this time it's much smoother and where it's rusty it's gone in.

468
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.960
By the looks of it let's go back to my final material output and to see how that's looking.

469
00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.830
Okay that's the wrong way round.

470
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.290
Okay so we've got it rust still on the surface and then inside it's red.

471
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.730
So there are a couple of things that we could do here.

472
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.550
We can switch round these two colours at the top but since that's all set up and that could be quite

473
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:24.850
a complex material set up we're now dealing with how it's displacing we can come down to the colour

474
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.230
ramp and just switch those around.

475
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.940
We're going to flip the colour ramp so now where it's rusty envelops.

476
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:36.360
Starting to look better already now where it's Rusty is where it's going to be going in rather than

477
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.160
the other way round.

478
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.560
And we can see here after turning that on and off again that's working.

479
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.780
However you can see where it is Rusty in places.

480
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:50.640
It is quite deep still sahaba I need to bring this black value up slightly.

481
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.570
Come back shift Z shift Z and see how it's looking.

482
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.710
This is something you're going to have to go backwards and forwards with so that look that looks good

483
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.780
in terms of where the drop off is with V.

484
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:08.070
Well with the red and orange border by I think I need to elongate this now so we've got a bit more of

485
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.890
a gradient between the two is too sharp.

486
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.760
Yes that's starting to look pretty good now.

487
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.110
In this particular case I think we need to do a few other things.

488
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.330
I'm going to add in some extra noise we got some noise down here.

489
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:28.530
I'm going to use the factor into colour to a shift click just to see what it looks like and I'm going

490
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.620
to turn this off and on again.

491
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.570
Now were talking about the factor signee Togo controls shift and click once more.

492
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.770
Once we've done that I can go ahead and adjust the scale now.

493
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.240
In this case I want a really bumpy surface is going to be really high on the scale even though maybe

494
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.010
even more than that.

495
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.940
There's got 220 has done to look good detail.

496
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.760
Interesting how do we do the detail in this case.

497
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.450
Let's go to the mics and see what that's looking like when it's mixed together.

498
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.870
Interest.

499
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.860
Of course we've got a factor here.

500
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:08.460
So what we want to control that factor is where is rusty and where isn't rusty so we want this to also

501
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.290
be controlled.

502
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:17.850
Fancy that by the same thing that's controlling how the paint where it is and isn't rusty so we can

503
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.510
use the colour out of here's also the factor.

504
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:27.330
So where it is Rusty is and you can see this here where is Rusty it's whiter and wear or white or close

505
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:32.450
to white and where it's not rusty it's still black and if we go and render that.

506
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.380
We can see we've got there a much better surface.

507
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:44.110
So it's not going to have any of our new noise texture unless it goes all the way down.

508
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.390
Now that's still a bit strong there we need to start bringing those two things together and I don't

509
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.710
think the colour ramp is actually going to be suitable for doing this.

510
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.090
Let's just bring the black point up slightly and re render.

511
00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:03.120
Yes I think at this point we can see here this is what's going on I need this almost grey in places.

512
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:08.020
Let's see what it's doing now because this is effectively control and the displacement of the displacements

513
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.760
quite strong at the moment.

514
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.070
So I may need to add in yet another colour just to weaken that out.

515
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.700
Let's rerun that and see what happens.

516
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.680
Ah that looks a bit better.

517
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.910
That squash this up even more it needs to be really subtle at this point.

518
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.730
And let's come back and you can see there's a lot of iteration that you can go through.

519
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.990
Tennis starting to look there.

520
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.800
Let's bring this back down ever so slightly and re render and start getting used to doing this coming

521
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.320
in shift said shift said okay that's looking fine for the moment.

522
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:46.060
Now at this point in time as you're bringing in all of this together I would also save my work and look

523
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:52.630
at doing a full render what were seeing in the viewport at the moment is a rough approximation of a

524
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.560
render.

525
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.610
So in order to do I know change my view to the camera.

526
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.510
So a view will get the menu right in the moment view camera nump had zero if you've got a number pad

527
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.690
and that's what it looks like from the camera view.

528
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:10.570
I'm going to move the camera now by going shift and F to go into first person mode and just move this

529
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.500
closer.

530
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.180
Now you may find it's easier to do this when you're not in rendered mode.

531
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:19.910
I'm I'm almost happy with that.

532
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:28.280
I'm going to shift it down a little now use W H S and D to move around Q and E to go up and down and

533
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:28.950
there we go.

534
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.140
I'm happy with that lay out and I'm going to press F twelth to do a rendering.

535
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.800
I'm also I also got the opportunity to save it as well.

536
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.500
Now at this point in time you will see that with everything we've got going it may take a while to render

537
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.160
around.

538
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:51.930
Now these cells themselves that are rendering look too small for me for GP rendering and one to let

539
00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:57.810
it render out at the moment but I'm also going to in my render properties come down go to my performance

540
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:04.560
area and change it yes these tiles are pretty much set up at 64 by 64 which is not really good for anything.

541
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.930
It's kind of a halfway house if you're rendering with your s.p. you you want those quite low maybe eight

542
00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:17.550
and eight or 16 then 16 depending on the sea Pip and the fur rendering on a GP you probably want a higher

543
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.860
value like two five six.

544
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.780
Now I'm not going to worry about the actual rendering here but let's just have a look at how it's coming

545
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.910
along we can zoom in and I quite like how that's looking at the moment.

546
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:37.310
Now we probably do want it to go totally rusty at some point but that's not a big issue for the moment.

547
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.850
We can always tweak these things later on when it comes to animating.

548
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.780
Okay so the next thing to do is actually talking about the displacement itself.

549
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.510
Now this is where we don't use the nodes Unfortunately there's no direct link between the two.

550
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:56.070
But if we go back in to while I am going to go into the nerida again but this time I'm going to open

551
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:03.190
up the 3D viewport as my main area and then we can focus on working there.

552
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:10.820
K so we've got our 3D view port open and this time we're going to have to change how this thing is looking.

553
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.460
But this time using a displacement modifier.

554
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.760
So to go ahead and add in another modifying and to call it displacement.

555
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:25.650
And again this is a modify this is deforming our mesh screen he defined it here it is displace.

556
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.970
So this is going to add an extra level of bloatedness.

557
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.190
But the looks of things that's pretty cool.

558
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.820
And the reason why it's doing this is it's it that it's all in the wrong order with displacing it.

559
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:43.200
After we've done everything else now we think logically the modifiers themselves do apply themselves

560
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.860
in order so we start with the mirror modifier.

561
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.970
And let me just hide the node editor and bring this across so we start with the mirror modify which

562
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.830
is fine.

563
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:59.710
Then we skin everything that we mirrored and then we want displace before we do the subsurface modifier.

564
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.880
So let's bring that up now.

565
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:06.770
It still will be a bit bloated for the moment because we're not controlling the displacement with anything.

566
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:13.560
So if we open this up we really want some think to control the displacement rather than just doing what

567
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.850
it wants to do.

568
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.830
So in this case I'm going to go to my text settings and just click on the which add in the texture.

569
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.980
Well hey that's gone all funny.

570
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:31.770
What we can now do is nain that texture where or something along those lines as in it's wearing away

571
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.960
and then go to the textured tab so long the properties panel.

572
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:41.250
If we go to the texture properties we will see that it says noise texture which is all very well but

573
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.880
that's not the one we want.

574
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.770
We click on where it says noise texture we need to find the one that's under the modifiers is not at

575
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.540
justing a material texture.

576
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.450
We're not adjusting a brush texture we're adjusting the modifier texture.

577
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.300
Here we go.

578
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.600
So currently there's not anything applied to this.

579
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.050
It's just got a black image applied to it.

580
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.940
I'm going to scroll down and where it is the type of texture image or movie I'm going to change that

581
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:12.270
to an actual generated texture and I'm going to use noise in this case naver starting to look a bit

582
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.930
funky.

583
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:18.310
And we can start playing around with the settings in here to make it look just that little bit better.

584
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:25.710
So in my case I'm going to go and reach for the settings that I had previously when it came to my displacement

585
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.640
and I'm having a look at what I got set there before.

586
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.590
Oh no before I did not choose noise I chose wood.

587
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.250
And obviously this is through a lot of iterations and playing around.

588
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:42.810
I chose wood as my example that looks like it's melted into a blob.

589
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:43.940
This is fantastic.

590
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.050
And this is what I mean at the very beginning when I was saying about playing with stuff.

591
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:53.580
I did not realize quite how well some of this would turn out until I.

592
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.930
Well I went to would obviously I would not have thought about that before.

593
00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:02.810
And looking at my settings down here I've left this top area as fine I've come down and I've changed

594
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.520
this to a saw pattern.

595
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.670
So it's more yes and no.

596
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:14.060
Rather than nice and smooth changes which I think's much better if we have a look here we get a straight

597
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.340
transition between the black and the whites which is fine that Gibbs.

598
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.460
In this case a very sharp cut off between the two.

599
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:27.610
I changed it to band noise if we have a scroll back up we can see that it's a little bit more we believe

600
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:32.810
wobbly at this point and there are a few other things that I've gone through and I've changed so if

601
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:39.290
we scroll back down again the final things that I have changed here is the type of noise I've switched

602
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:45.400
from soft to hard which gives it a much harder edge between the two.

603
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.440
Now as you can see here this doesn't look like anything like what we would want it to look at the moment.

604
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:55.820
This is just a starting place what we now need to do is go back to our displacement modify and make

605
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.970
sure we've got the right level of displacement applied.

606
00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:05.570
And what I have done as we've gone through is this strength about you ought to set it to zero and see

607
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.910
what it looks like.

608
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.390
There you go it looks like that and as we increase this to one it's going to morph into this.

609
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:13.400
Is that what we want.

610
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.870
Probably not.

611
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.830
It looks like we're going to have to play around a little more now the texture coordinates.

612
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.800
I'm going to use the object itself.

613
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:28.270
That means that the object determines how is that almost the same as using generated previously.

614
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.700
So the object is going to determine how this texture is applied to itself.

615
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:38.400
So once again um goods come in and go in and out.

616
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.950
No change there that's changed the middle level up to one.

617
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.150
There we go.

618
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.990
That's the sort of rusting away effect that I'd probably want to go for here.

619
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.680
And now let's change the strength back to zero.

620
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.440
So it's nothing and then we can do a step up.

621
00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.500
Now we don't need to see these deep find a detailed rust here some bigger shift Z and just have a look

622
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.990
at the underlying mesh and how it's distorting so we can see it's wasting away here.

623
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:09.980
And by the time we get to a point six you can see it's actually pushing it through itself so we don't

624
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.470
need to go that far.

625
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:17.360
In this case we're going to use the strength and probably end up going to maybe this level here point

626
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.680
five.

627
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.650
Let's think about now animating that so we've got a start and an end point for a lot of our of our items

628
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:25.970
here this is going to be the end point.

629
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.280
This is going to be the start point.

630
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.980
We might as well have a mate between those two points.

631
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:36.350
Now I'm going to do this simply on the time line and of course all of this can be refined and refined

632
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:37.210
and refined.

633
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.530
In fact the one you saw at the very beginning did take several hours of tweaking.

634
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.850
Admittedly I was having a lot of fun at the time and it takes several hours tweaking to really get it

635
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.910
exactly how I wanted it to.

636
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.430
And of course trying to recreate that.

637
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.690
Well it will just be a different rusty pipe this time.

638
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.130
So let's pick our.

639
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.800
I've got two timelines here now that's good going.

640
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.070
So let's pick our start point.

641
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:08.120
In this case frame 1 and I'm going to key in the strength for the zero and I'm going to just hover over

642
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.170
strength and press the key that is now keyed in.

643
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.370
This is the great thing you can annamay anything in blender.

644
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:20.330
And then finally we need to decide how many frames this is going to last over I'm going to go to a hundred

645
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:26.640
and twenty in total so I'm going to go to frame 120 and then key in the final frame.

646
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.370
The strength here is going to be at one note.

647
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.260
No what did we say.

648
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:38.510
Point five is key in point five and press the Iki and now what we can see is as we start and play through

649
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.420
we can see it's wasting away.

650
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.880
How cool is that.

651
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.250
And now we can do the same thing.

652
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:52.100
But in the Knode Ed. Now this is where I'm going to have to be careful and have the beginning and end

653
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.380
in mind.

654
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.140
So the beginning I don't want it looking rusty in the beginning at all.

655
00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.600
So we need to find the right node settings that it looks like it clean.

656
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.960
Well just read essentially something go to my node editor.

657
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.380
And at this point I think the only thing that's controlling this is the factor between these two.

658
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:19.550
So in this case we need to decide how we're branching out these two here how we're changing between

659
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.430
these two cultures.

660
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:26.420
So going to be changing something here and there are several ways we can go ahead and do this we could

661
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.860
we could animate the position of these items here so we could push.

662
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.470
I think it's the black all the way through.

663
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.250
How does this need to look.

664
00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.130
Oh that's oh I like that.

665
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.110
So yes we can move these things about.

666
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.340
So at the moment it looks like we need 100 percent black in order for it to work as we would expect

667
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.190
it to.

668
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.640
And that's come out and back in again.

669
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.290
And we still got a little bit displacement coming in here that we don't want So we need to think about

670
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.660
think about more than one thing at this point in time.

671
00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:04.350
So when you think about this one and this one down here so let's make sure that there is no defamation

672
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.860
at all and it's totally smooth.

673
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.840
It looks totally smooth but it looks like we've got these in the wrong way.

674
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:16.220
Looks like I need it to be 100 percent black in this case.

675
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:21.360
Almost there let's just say for arguments sake and there we go we've got that so I'm going to set that

676
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.140
position of a key that in.

677
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.960
Whilst I'm on frame one make sure you are in frame when we decide to keep things.

678
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:34.460
So I've keyed in the position of both of those elements now as this changes as it gets rusty towards

679
00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.660
the end.

680
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.680
And looks horrible like this.

681
00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:43.880
What we can then do is say well we also want it looking really rusty.

682
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:51.920
So we've moved two things here we've moved the position of zero and the position of one now it is important

683
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:57.590
that you keep in the starting position of both of the things you're about to change.

684
00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:03.500
So we've keyed in the position of number one this black marker but we've not keyed in the position of

685
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:03.890
zero.

686
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.920
So let's make sure we keep that in as well.

687
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:12.380
Now we can go ahead to the end of our animation's say well by the end of the animation it's going to

688
00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.450
be completely rusty so both of these will have moved across.

689
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.660
And of course this is controlling more than just.

690
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:28.270
The colour is changing how rough things are and it's feeding in to how the actual material itself is

691
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.570
getting rusty and it's defamation.

692
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:37.060
So there we go we've shifted that across women a key that in so I think both one and two are keyed in.

693
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.610
There we go.

694
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.020
One two is zero and one in this case.

695
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.890
The next thing we need to do is think about this next colour ramp down here so we have it starting position

696
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.540
of number zero.

697
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.930
Let's go to one and key that in.

698
00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:53.590
Let's go to the end and then we think about how we want that to look.

699
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.270
So if we go ahead and all that say shift this down to there.

700
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.790
What do we have.

701
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.590
It looks pretty rusty.

702
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.430
Let's shift all having issues clicking it all.

703
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.410
I think that's the key.

704
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.580
Pretty good.

705
00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.360
Let's just go shift and Z over in the 3D viewport.

706
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.970
There we go.

707
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:12.090
See how that change.

708
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.530
That's why it's important to come over and shift click.

709
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.410
A new shift in Z to get it working so we need it more this way.

710
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.860
That's quite bumpy.

711
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.020
In fact we could we could probably leave it like that but let's just see if we can get it looking that

712
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.980
little bit better.

713
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.560
It looks quite spiky at the moment.

714
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.190
Now this is a great way of just testing us.

715
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.120
I'm going to go and save my work first.

716
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.050
Now I'm going to render it out again.

717
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.380
I wouldn't recommend over being a bit overzealous when it comes to rendering.

718
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:51.720
But what we do need to make sure is anything that we think is going to happen actually happens when

719
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.830
we go ahead and render.

720
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.750
So something is not happening here.

721
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.030
Why is this still totally smooth yet in the viewport.

722
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.960
It looks or bumpy like this are problem.

723
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.050
To be honest I don't know.

724
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.500
I've probably missed something as we've gone along so we've got a displacement of both over the material

725
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.410
settings of that that feels fine there.

726
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.220
It could be the fact that we've not keyed that in yet.

727
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.960
So let's go in and go to the node editor and key in that position.

728
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.740
That is a bit extreme and they both at one they do look like they're both one.

729
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.560
Let's just keep that in because I think that probably is what's going on there.

730
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:38.330
And it's just round of that out again we can see is much quicker to render in with.

731
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:44.560
We see that's much quicker to render when we've got the GP rendering.

732
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.920
Okay.

733
00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.490
So you've got material here if we got the right material I think we have.

734
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.260
Yes.

735
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.580
And the displacement isn't rendering.

736
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.880
So in the render settings do we have experimental rendering turned on.

737
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.480
We have excellent.

738
00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:05.120
Now I'm going to change this to see you for a moment just to see if there's an issue with how it's set

739
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:05.450
up.

740
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.880
I do love problem solving on a live video.

741
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.410
It's always great.

742
00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.740
Let's just see what happens at this point.

743
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.800
Now notice it's also changed over here as well in the viewport.

744
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:23.540
So just come back and re-enable GP you there is something funny going on and we will get to the bottom

745
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.180
of it.

746
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.810
So has decided to render smoothly again.

747
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.260
Let's go to our node editor and see what's going on here.

748
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.630
So we've got everything set up here.

749
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.410
We've got well let's see what it looks like.

750
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.560
When we just look at this colour ramp here.

751
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.650
Let's make sure we are in rended mode.

752
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:51.830
So this colour appears all black and white which basically means no displacement.

753
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:53.820
That's not what we want of this black.

754
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.620
Value has been brought up far too far.

755
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.560
Let's come back in and go through.

756
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.680
That looks much better so we just moved that black value far too far.

757
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.570
They're made sure on the end and key that in.

758
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.410
And the annoying thing there was the viewport wasn't actually updating and showing us what the actual

759
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:12.940
issue was.

760
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.550
And that in itself is painful.

761
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.910
It really is.

762
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:22.100
So now hopefully when we go ahead and render what we should see we're still rendering with the s.p.

763
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.940
who didn't want that to happen.

764
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:30.430
Now when we go ahead and render all being well we should end up with it being bumpy which it is.

765
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.370
That's great.

766
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:36.690
And now we need to go back to our node Ed and just make sure everything is back in place.

767
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.270
So I'm going to shift.

768
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.470
Control shifts select my principal shader that looks fine there.

769
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.660
Excellent.

770
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.780
Finally we just need the test the beginning and end.

771
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.270
And make sure they're working fine.

772
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.080
So I'm going to save my work.

773
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.600
I'm going to go and open up the UV image editor and I'm going to make sure that we're on slots one on

774
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.610
the head a bar for the U.S. image editor.

775
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:06.970
Make sure your in slot one and go ahead to the beginning of your scene and press F 12 to render it or

776
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.640
even go to the menu here render image.

777
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.440
This will give us some idea of what it looks like at the very beginning.

778
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.110
Excellent so we've got how it's going to look at the beginning and that's lovely and shiny.

779
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:22.860
Now the reason why we're doing it like this is simply because rendering an animation is going to take

780
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.560
a long time to do.

781
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:31.140
So I'm going to go to frain 60 here and I'll go to slot two and then I'm going to go render my image

782
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.600
and this will give me an idea of what it's going to look like half way through.

783
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:42.630
Now hopefully I have it does look a bit odd It looks a bit spiky So there may be more refinements though

784
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.370
and but I'm happy with how it's turning out so far.

785
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:51.750
Just as an experimentation if nothing else and again you can iterate this and go No no I don't want

786
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:52.490
it to act like that.

787
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.030
I wanted to act like this.

788
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.000
So here we go it's starting to deform.

789
00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.020
They might want to leave the defamations till after it's gone completely rusty That's what I did in

790
00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.410
my original psyche in all of the defamation.

791
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.490
How it was changing how that texture.

792
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:12.750
The strength in the displacement modifier when we're animating this I did not change that until after

793
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.930
it started going completely rusty.

794
00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.610
I might do that in a moment on this one as well.

795
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:24.060
Finally I'm going to go to my final frame go to slot three and just render that out as well.

796
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.710
And a good thing about doing this is you've got a good idea of it start middle and end position.

797
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:37.020
Now you may in fact want to just use a different texture when it comes to showing blender how you want

798
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.290
it to deform.

799
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:42.260
Now this is a totally different look as before it looks like something is growing on it.

800
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:47.500
Tempted to change that to go green as if it's some sort of alien fungus or just fungus.

801
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.230
Who knows.

802
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.970
Anyway so that looks pretty good.

803
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.180
That looks like a good starting and end position.

804
00:51:54.180 --> 00:52:00.510
Now one of the things that I would really recommend when you're working with this type of project where

805
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:07.350
you know that rendering is going to take at least 30 seconds of frain 120 frames you know that's a long

806
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:08.650
time to wait.

807
00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.920
Well that's going to be there's going to be an hour isn't it.

808
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:16.620
So I want to wait for an hour but I do want to have an idea of how this is going to animate through.

809
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.770
Now I can switch between slot 1 slot 2 and slot three go.

810
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.200
Okay that looks pretty cool.

811
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.660
But how does it look when it's animated.

812
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:29.010
So the final thing here is about outputting.

813
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.440
Now there are seven schools several schools of thought when it comes to animating output in general

814
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.240
as I'm just producing something really quick to have a look at.

815
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:45.330
I will go to my render propertys and scroll down and my output folder I'm going to set that is something

816
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:52.220
I can actually reach like the desk top and then I'm going to change the height file type to it.

817
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:59.010
F F MPEG video going down to the encoding I'm going to set it so it's presets here I'm going to use

818
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:02.050
eight to 6 4 in MP 4.

819
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.280
She's absolutely fine.

820
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:07.280
Leave everything else as default because this is just a test run.

821
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:13.080
I don't really care if it's blocky or not as perfect as it could be or even in this case if it's going

822
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.290
to crash midway through the render because I can always click and render again.

823
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:22.560
However what I will do at this point is just have a look at the resolution I want.

824
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:29.090
A rough idea of how this is going to look not a detailed look a detailed look I've done with these renders

825
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:34.740
if I'm happy with this bit if I'm happy with the others then I'm happy and good to go but what I don't

826
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.580
want is to wait.

827
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:39.250
Even so I'm going to knock this down to 25 percent of 10 8.

828
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:45.030
Now this is going to look really ropey in terms of a quality perspective but it's good to be quicker

829
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.850
to render.

830
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.970
So I'm going to go ahead now.

831
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:53.460
I'm going to save my work before I go ahead and render what I need to do is render my animation.

832
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.420
Now to make things just a little bit more interesting and do what I said earlier and am going to clear

833
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:05.910
my key frames for the the actual displacement are going to start at frain 60 where it starts displacing

834
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.680
and then go all the way to point five so it changes.

835
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:16.660
A bit more naturally because that there shouldn't be deforming till it's quite rusty and I'm going to

836
00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.880
make sure I key in a strength of 0.

837
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.000
At that point.

838
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.150
And then we've also got strength of zero here so it's going to stay at zero until it comes out.

839
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:32.170
That's easier than removing all the key frames and re adding them afterwards and it may show once again

840
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:33.580
save my work.

841
00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.300
Now I'm not going to render it on this computer.

842
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:41.290
It's going to take an E on I'm going to go renderer on my desktop which has a bit of a faster GP in

843
00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:41.620
it.

844
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.200
And I'll be back in a few minutes.

845
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.570
And here we go.

846
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.720
I've slowed this down so we can really explore what's happening.

847
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:55.030
It's not particularly high res but we've got a glossy start and then we can see it slowly rusts away

848
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.420
now.

849
00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:00.580
We put in that key halfway through so it didn't start deforming until then and we could see it's just

850
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.690
rusting away and bubbling and actually in many ways.

851
00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.170
I like this one because had a bit more thought to it.

852
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.620
Then our original one.

853
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.360
And of course here it is now at full speed.

854
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.970
Boom done and there we go.

855
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.480
Thank you for staying with me throughout this tour.

856
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:17.580
I really hope you've learned lots now.

857
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.330
Fortunately we can't always cover everything that we want to cover in a tutorial like this.

858
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:28.050
This is essentially glossing over our material set up our modelling and everything else.

859
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:33.670
If you do want to learn much more about Splenda Please do join me over on my udemy Course where you

860
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:38.830
can learn far far more than what I can possibly put in a short tutorial like this.

861
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.640
Take care and I will see you over there.
