Welcome to g.p you rendering in this section.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,660
So in this video you'll understand that even with a dedicated GP you may end up with an out of memory

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,330
issue.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,520
If your car doesn't have enough RAM and also that some a n d cars do not render hairs correctly.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,620
So if you are experiencing these problems you will have one of two options.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,790
Will even have to optimize the scene so it fits into your available RAM and that usually just means

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,460
less particles so bear that in mind.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:42,130
And then if that's still not working or you have an m.d. card and it's not actually working then you

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,980
will have to switch over to see p u rendering.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,260
I know some of the modern cards will work apps that you find but some of the older ones may not.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,250
So now we've got that out of the way.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,440
Let's continue on and move on to the next lecture.
