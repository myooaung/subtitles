Hello everybody and welcome back. 
1

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.100
In this lecture we're going to focus on the materials of our pin and start having a look at the various
2

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.730
material properties so we can get it looking a bit more glossy let's hop in and find out more.
3

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.950
OK so this is where we left ourselves off before.
4

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.670
Let's go in and start playing with our materials.
5

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.200
I'm going to just hide my properties panel and tool shelf so there out of the way.
6

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.600
Right.
7

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.490
So first of all we need to go to our materials themselves so making sure the bowling pin is selected
8

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.510
we're going to scroll down and find the materials tab.
9

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
We see that there is no material on our pin yet.
10

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.880
So I'm going to create new material and call it pin.
11

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.950
Now it's called pin.
12

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.960
I want to switch over to lookdev mode and remember you can use the Z key as well to do that.
13

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
And then the number two or move your mouse to the appropriate location.
14

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.360
And why we're using that rather than render is we don't really have an environment set up at the moment.
15

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.730
So even if we were working in rendered mode it wouldn't really show it off, what lookdev does do.
16

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.920
So we have a look into the shading tab.
17

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.200
It gives us a world that's going to light up our scene as if this pin was actually within that world
18

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.860
itself.
19

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.480
And if we click on that we've got several other options and you will see that if we select that's the
20

21
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.470
lighting that's on our pin changes dramatically.
21

22
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.570
And that will be even more so when we have a look at the material and start playing around with the
22

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.320
properties.
23

24
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620
When it comes to rendered mode it's just going to look a bit dull at the moment.
24

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.110
It literally is living in a big gray void.
25

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.810
So let's not focus on the rendered mode just at the moment and that's true whether you're using eevee
26

27
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.190
or cycles at the moment, So I'm going to switch back to lookdev and I'm going to change my shading environments
27

28
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.310
just a light environment and then we can play around and see how it would look like in other environments
28

29
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.180
as well.
29

30
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.410
Now with the new pin material selected I'm going to scroll down and you've got a plethora of things
30

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.250
you can change with your material.
31

32
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.980
Now the one I want to focus on is a nice straightforward and simple one.
32

33
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.770
We've got our base color which we played with before and if we scroll down a little further we have
33

34
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.930
something called roughness.
34

35
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.610
So the less rough something is the more reflective it is.
35

36
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.670
If it has a roughness of zero that means it's fully reflective which means it's going to reflect things
36

37
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.230
in its environment we can see here.
37

38
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.230
This pin itself is reflecting whatever's in this environment here and we can see it looks like this
38

39
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.030
is a living room.
39

40
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.170
If we set it to this street view at some point you'd see the house there is there in our environment.
40

41
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.690
That's pretty cool and gives us a good idea of the overall form and shape and how reflections will look
41

42
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.850
on our pin itself.
42

43
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.640
Now of course it's not going to have quite this mirror finish but if we turn that all the way up to
43

44
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.030
one that means that this is now a hundred percent diffuse, light will hit this objects or anything with
44

45
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.070
this material on it and get completely diffused, it will have no reflections to it.
45

46
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.780
So it's so I'm going to set that back down to maybe point one for the moment so still reflective but
46

47
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.980
not not quite a mirrored surface.
47

48
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.120
Of course you can turn that up or down depending on how you're feeling about it.
48

49
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.200
Now what I have found is that the roughness is very sensitive low down by the time you've reached so
49

50
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.170
point three point four you've lost all sense of what is being reflected and in what you're left with
50

51
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.160
is the light itself.
51

52
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.400
So it's worthwhile knowing that of the first third is really where you need to be when you're talking
52

53
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.110
about reflections.
53

54
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
Now I'm going to turn that back down as I say to about Point 1 for the moment.
54

55
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.320
Now I want to make sure I've got my stripes on here as well so there were a couple of things that we
55

56
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.850
can do in order to make sure that it inherits the current settings of this material because I don't
56

57
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.100
want to have to go in and then scroll down and adjust the roughness, as far as I'm concerned those two
57

58
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.610
stripes are going to be the same reflectiveness or the same roughness as our base here in order to
58

59
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.970
do that.
59

60
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.580
I'm going to scroll back up and add in a new material slot.
60

61
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.660
So as we've experienced before any object can have more than one material slot.
61

62
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.040
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to browse my materials rather than creating a new one I'm going
62

63
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.510
to browse for the pin.
63

64
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.990
So now we have two identical materials.
64

65
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.600
If I was to change one it would change the other.
65

66
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.600
I'm going to click the number two that has appeared the number of users that use this data.
66

67
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.610
And by doing that it would create one called pin 0 0 1 with all of the previous setup down here which
67

68
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.720
is really useful and I can call that pin stripes.
68

69
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.090
Now this is where I got pinstripes from wasn't it thinking about is the stripes that are on the
69

70
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.350
pin OK.
70

71
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.410
Now I need to go through and change the base color and it's not going to be white anymore so it's going
71

72
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.660
to be probably red.
72

73
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.160
Okay.
73

74
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.580
Let's put it to red.
74

75
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.260
And of course there's nothing there yet.
75

76
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.010
We need to go into edit mode on our pin and pick with face select a couple of areas that we want it
76

77
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.700
to be on and then assign that's let's go and tab out back into object mode.
77

78
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.660
And there we go.
78

79
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.820
We've pretty much got everything sorted but not quite.
79

80
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.770
If we have a look at the pin reference itself we see that.
80

81
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.660
Oh I'm hideously off at the moment when it comes to those actual stripes and I'm pretty sure that the
81

82
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.230
geometry won't allow us to line those up perfectly.
82

83
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.440
Of course that will be your challenge.
83

84
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.780
Okay.
84

85
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.950
And your challenge is to give your pin two material slots one for the pin and one for the stripe.
85

86
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.380
Then we'll need to edit some of the geometry because what I'd like to do is align your geometry
86

87
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.220
with your reference material so that you can assign the stripe material to the right place on your object
87

88
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.460
and then set your roughness values between nought point one and nought point two.
88

89
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.040
That's roughly the right ballpark we're looking at.
89

90
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.420
Of course you can pick your own stripe color etc..
90

91
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.420
That's entirely up to you.
91

92
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.480
I'm probably going to stick with red as I go forward.
92

93
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.720
Okay.
93

94
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.690
Pause the video now and give that a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back.
94

95
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.230
Let's go ahead now and sort out our pin and actually bring it to life and make it look more like the reference
95

96
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.680
material. OK so we're over in our pin right.
96

97
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.790
I think I'm going to set a base material for this first and then come back for the stripes later.
97

98
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.370
So let's go for a material create it.
98

99
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.960
Call it a pin.
99

100
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.980
I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to be literal here and we set the roughness to nought points
100

101
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.750
1 5.
101

102
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.260
That's smack bang in the middle of the suggested fingers and the surface color not the subsurface the
102

103
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.070
base color.
103

104
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.030
Here we go.
104

105
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.040
I'm going to leave it says this brighter white color.
105

106
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.690
I think that's a good starting point to be in.
106

107
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.780
Okay.
107

108
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.010
So that's all that set up.
108

109
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.930
Now I'm gonna faff around the geometry itself and make sure of it's lined up and I say faff about because
109

110
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.040
it can quite easily turn into a bit of a faff.
110

111
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.370
Let's see what it looks like.
111

112
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.910
Ah the bottom ones almost perfect we just need to shift this section of geometry.
112

113
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.650
This bit here down and we're sorted.
113

114
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.080
Let's have a look up, Let's pan ourselves up.
114

115
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.670
No that's.
115

116
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.310
That won't do.
116

117
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.860
So we need to do a bit of fiddling around here to make that work.
117

118
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.440
Let's go down to this one here.
118

119
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.400
Some use border select a box select select everything.
119

120
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.710
there but of course it won't have selected things on the other side.
120

121
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.410
So that's something to watch out for when you're doing that.
121

122
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:02.630
I'm going to press Z and go into a wireframe then when I do do that we can see that it's got everything
122

123
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.810
selected and I'm going to zoom out show nothing else selected there.
123

124
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:13.010
OK so what I can do there is not only just press the G key and move down but i can press the G key twice.
124

125
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.070
And what that will do is that it will slide.
125

126
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.470
So we've used slide before we talked about it in the previous section.
126

127
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.930
And that is one of the great uses for it because as you can see it keeps the overall shape that we had
127

128
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.530
before rather than just moving the geometry up and down.
128

129
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.670
Now this one here is a little bit more complex because I want to make sure my geometry is also evened
129

130
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.240
out as well.
130

131
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.300
So there's a couple of options that we've got here.
131

132
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:47.110
In fact I think what we could probably get away with is a dissolve as well.
132

133
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.360
So I'm going to try but I'm going to select this middle edge loop here by holding down alt and selecting,
133

134
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.720
even though it's on vertex select it knows what I want, I'm going to press X and dissolve edges and then going to
134

135
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:07.070
grab this top edge loop press the G key twice and bring it down and then I'm going to do the same on
135

136
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.780
the bottom edge loop and bring it up.
136

137
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.420
This is why edge loops and face loops are phenomenal.
137

138
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.730
It's enabled us to edit this model effortlessly and bring the geometry back to where we want it to be.
138

139
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.980
And that cannot be understated the amount of time that will save you.
139

140
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.940
And that's that's fundamentally why edge loops and face loops are really really important.
140

141
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.600
Now I don't have a new material to assign to these new faces yet so I'm going to go ahead and create
141

142
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.240
that and I'm going to create it by first creating the material slots selecting the original material
142

143
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.760
and it's greyed out.
143

144
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.740
Why is it greyed out.

145
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.990
Well you may have remembered we've come across this before.
145

146
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.550
If we tab out we'll be able to make it a single user.
146

147
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.960
And then I'm going to call it a pin stripe.
147

148
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.500
Okay perfect.
148

149
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.340
I'm going to set that to an orangey red around.
149

150
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.820
They're looking good now I can go back into edit mode and we face select and get a hold down alt again
150

151
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.860
and select this face loop here.
151

152
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.950
I'm going to hold down shift and select the next face loop as well once that's done making sure that
152

153
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:23.240
pinstripe is the material slot that selected I should be able to assign and then all being well I can
153

154
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:30.590
come out and have a look at this and lookdev mode because I've been in wireframe up until that point
154

155
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.570
I'm going to hit pin reference I almost forgot I was actually in wireframe because the pin reference
155

156
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.720
was there in the background and look at that, perfect this is coming along really really well I hope
156

157
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.270
yours are as well.
157

158
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.300
Really looking forward to seeing how you've gone about creating your pin.
158

159
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.490
What materials you have applied to it.
159

160
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.400
Have you gone for a simple stripe like this or perhaps you put a chequered pattern along the bottom
160

161
00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:00.410
you can assign the manually you can do stripes like I'm doing it's entirely up to you I really do encourage
161

162
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.110
you to make this project your own and not just follow along with me but really take the lessons that
162

163
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:12.230
you've learned and create your own bowling pin maybe even something unique itself looking forward seeing
163

164
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.370
work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
