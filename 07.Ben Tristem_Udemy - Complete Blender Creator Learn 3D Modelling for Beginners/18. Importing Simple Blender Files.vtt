Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.930
In this lecture we're going to combine two separate blender files in this case our bowling ball and
2

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.750
bowling pin together into one blend file.
3

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.050
Let's find out more.
4

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.060
Okay so we've got our default cube in the scene at the moment.
5

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.760
Let's go ahead and bring in a different object from a different blend file.
6

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.030
So first of all we'd go to the File menu when we've done that.
7

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.350
You think we'd go to import and you would be right if it was anything else other than a blend file.
8

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.450
When it comes to blend files you have two options.
9

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.560
You can link or you can append.
10

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.420
In this case we're going to append rather than link we'll cover linking later on in the course.
11

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.820
So let's go to append and we get a couple of options.
12

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.380
As you can see I've been browsing here at the moment.
13

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.760
So let's come out all the way to our blend level.
14

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.640
So here we go we've got a bowling ball and a bowling pin.
15

16
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.180
I'm going to go grab the ball.
16

17
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
So I go ahead and click on that and it suddenly becomes apparent.
17

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.810
That's the blend file is more complicated than it first seems.
18

19
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.840
You can see here we can start importing or in this case appending lots of different things.
19

20
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.290
In this case if we'd use brushes the camera collections freestyle lines etc. etc..
20

21
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.030
So this is incredibly versatile.
21

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.010
This means we can pick up perhaps materials from another file in fact if we have a look.
22

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.390
The bowling ball I know I haven't applied a material to.
23

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.820
So looking down this list there aren't any materials in it.
24

25
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.780
If I was to come out and go to my bowling pin notice that it's got materials it's got an extra data
25

26
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.390
block that we can dive into and there we go.
26

27
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.440
We've got our pin and our pin striped material pretty cool how we can import those.
27

28
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.390
OK.
28

29
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.800
So what do we need to do here.
29

30
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.140
Well let's go up a level and go back to our bowling ball because that's what we are working on for the
30

31
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.610
moment because we're importing simple objects.
31

32
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.830
We'll need to have a look at our objects.
32

33
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.630
So let's click on objects and we can see this is exactly the same as what we would see in the top right
33

34
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.620
in the outliner.
34

35
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.350
The bowling ball the camera and the light.
35

36
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.340
And if we were to go and have a look at the pin we see that it has more.
36

37
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.340
It would have the pin reference, the pin, curve, et cetera.
37

38
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.130
So let's go ahead and select our bowling ball and append from library.
38

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.410
If I just move it around we can see that it is quite small I can focus on it with the number pad but
39

40
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.480
it's here and it's ready to go.
40

41
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180
How cool is that.
41

42
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.380
So let's go ahead and go file append come out twice to go up.
42

43
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.320
There we go bowling pin.
43

44
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.620
Oh we've got a few more here.
44

45
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.380
As we've explored before we've got a curve as well.
45

46
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.480
That's the additional one that's in there.
46

47
00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.910
And we've got these materials as we've discussed this go to the object and let's go to the bowling pin.
47

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.360
That's the only one we need to import, append from library.
48

49
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.260
I can't see the bowling pin I'm going to select it and press the number pad full stop.
49

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.640
It's inside our cube.
50

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.830
Let's get rid of the cube, bye bye cube.
51

52
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.580
OK.
52

53
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.340
So let's go to lookdev mode.
53

54
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.140
So when we import an object if it has materials assigned to it those materials also come across.
54

55
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.250
That's a useful thing to know.
55

56
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.300
And when we have a look at our bowling ball which has been shelved over here it doesn't have any material.
56

57
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.680
So objects will bring their materials with them.
57

58
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.100
That's important to know.
58

59
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.830
And there we go.
59

60
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.460
That's the basics that you need to know when it comes to importing different objects from different
60

61
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.520
blend files into the one you're working on.
61

62
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.640
And now it's time for your challenge.
62

63
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.680
Okay so your challenge.
63

64
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.400
If your ball like mine doesn't have a material yet, go ahead and add one. Then import the pin and ball
64

65
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.290
into a new blend file, set up a little scene with ten pins in it and then render the scene and share.
65

66
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.850
Now I'll be a bit more adventurous than you might do normally.
66

67
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.060
You could set up a simple scene with the ten pins in it or you could have the ball in the scene just
67

68
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.780
smashing through the first pin.
68

69
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.590
It's entirely up to you how you decide to set that up.
69

70
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.880
Pause a video now and give that a go, OK everybody welcome back.
70

71
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.470
Let's go ahead and set up a little scene with 10 pins and the ball in it. OK.
71

72
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.730
Well I could continue from here but I'm not I'm going to go and look up a new blend file and now I'm
72

73
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.140
going to append into it our bowling pin.
73

74
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.770
Well it's already there and might as well and I'm going to append up and up the bowling ball object.
74

75
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.870
Oh no I haven't append.
75

76
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.350
I haven't done the material on the ball yet.
76

77
00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.880
So when I go to my bowling ball and let's add a material to it I'm going to call it ball and I'm going
77

78
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.540
to colour it slightly differently I'm going to make it a blue ball a dark, a darker blue ball that is once
78

79
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.250
again quite shiny look in that mirror finished.
79

80
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.720
Not quite as back off just a little perhaps around there, looks pretty sweet to me I'm going to save that.
80

81
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.430
OK now I've I've done that now I can go new general OK that's deletes the cube append in the bowling
81

82
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.120
pin and then append in the bowling ball object bowling ball OK.
82

83
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.910
Now before I do anything else in file save and save it as bowling.
83

84
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.930
That's always a good way to start right.
84

85
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.140
The ball itself.
85

86
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.120
I'm going to go G Y and just move it along here so it's out of shot and I'm going to use this pin as
86

87
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.170
the first one of many.
87

88
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.050
Now I think it goes one two.
88

89
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.480
I'm not sure.
89

90
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.120
One two three four five six seven.
90

91
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.300
Yeah.
91

92
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.760
OK so I've got one duplication to do but I'm going to use the increments here to space them out now
92

93
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.160
won't be accurate spacing.
93

94
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.500
If you've done that yourself bravo.
94

95
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.320
That's brilliant.
95

96
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.820
Going really use an absolute grid snap here so I'm going to duplicate this and it's not snapping to
96

97
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.460
grid I'm gonna turn it on.
97

98
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.050
There we go.
98

99
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.110
So I'm going to set that up there and there, I'm going to duplicate again.
99

100
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.310
Oh shift and D, There,
100

101
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:36.510
And then I can get, grab these two shift and D again and one final one that looks a bit squashed actually
101

102
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.710
doing it like that.
102

103
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.290
Let's move those up and then here move that back again.
103

104
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.890
Yes.
104

105
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.390
I'm going to select all of these.
105

106
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.260
Move them all one back.
106

107
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.590
Okay.
107

108
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.160
That looks much better.
108

109
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.780
So the final thing we need to do here is this one should be roughly there.
109

110
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.680
And again here to there.
110

111
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.560
Boom.
111

112
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.870
Okay.
112

113
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.110
That looks great.
113

114
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.450
Let's add in a mesh a nice plane and I'm going to scale it along the Y axis by maybe five.
114

115
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.070
The ball has been chopped in half.
115

116
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.790
Let's go.
116

117
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:18.110
G Y and move that back a little and I'm happy with it looking like that's in fact I'm going to go
117

118
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:26.360
G Y move it here, I'm gonna make the runway ,the bowling alley itself runway why am I thinking. I'm gonna
118

119
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.270
make give it a material it's also gonna be shiny but I'm gonna give it kind of a yellow color I think.
119

120
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:39.560
I'm going to switch onto lookdev so I can just see how things are looking that's looking pretty sweet so i'm going to
120

121
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:46.620
lift my ball up now I can't remember what diameter it was now so I'm just going to eyeball it it doesn't
121

122
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.500
really matter if it's not perfect.
122

123
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.110
There we go.
123

124
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.650
Let's have a look back round.
124

125
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.750
And yes that's looking awesome.
125

126
00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:02.360
So the next thing for me to do here is make sure that the ball and camera and everything else is aligned.
126

127
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.530
That will be a really boring render.
127

128
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:10.490
Let's come in a little bit closer so shift and the grave key holding down shift again just to move a
128

129
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.680
little bit quicker I'm not going to speed it up because I often get things horribly wrong when I do
129

130
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.600
do that.
130

131
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.000
How about that.
131

132
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.440
OK.
132

133
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.070
So I think the camera's all set up.
133

134
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.050
Let's go ahead and render it out.
134

135
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.470
Excellent.
135

136
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.780
That's coming along really nicely.
136

137
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.880
Now there are a couple of things that we can sort out here we can play with the lighting we can tweak
137

138
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.150
the shadows.
138

139
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.240
We could play with the ball a little bit more.
139

140
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.820
So there's lots that we could do and we will get to that very soon when we start tweaking our rendering
140

141
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.540
settings.
141

142
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.780
But that's a pretty good end product.
142

143
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:47.720
I'm going to go to image and save image so I can render that out and share it with you guys as well.
143

144
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.240
So there we go that saved and ready to share.
144

145
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.260
How did you guys get on.
145

146
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.800
I'm looking forward to seeing what scenes you've created.
146

147
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.790
Please share them in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
