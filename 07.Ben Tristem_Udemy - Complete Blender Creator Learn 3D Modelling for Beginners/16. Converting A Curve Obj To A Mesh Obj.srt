00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,730
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:13,620
By the end of this lecture we'll be able to solidify our curve object as an actual mesh object.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,230
And what that will mean is that we can go into it grab a face loop for instance and extrude it up if

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,180
we wanted to.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,270
Gives us lots of opportunity to edit this and of course clean this up as well.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,420
We have a look now at the middle here.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,970
We have less geometry there it's just not necessary.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,850
And if we have a look at the bottom yes we've got a base to our object as well.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,060
Let's go find out more.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,490
Okay.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,110
So we have our lamp base in front of us here.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:47,400
It is just a curve object so we cannot just go in and edit things we've literally just got the curves.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,450
Edit So how do we convert it.

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,640
Well it's very very straightforward.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,300
We can right click and there we go converts a mesh so end of lecture right.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,440
Not quite.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,320
This has always been a bit quirky even in two point seven.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,820
They've literally just fixed the bug where this didn't happen.

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:13,840
Told it wasn't even working but if we press tab we can go in and we can immediately as you've seen before.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,920
Go install extrusion things and moving them about.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,970
So that's a great start but we've lost our original lamp data that may not be a problem or it may be

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,650
a big problem because you may want to fall back on that and generate some new shapes.

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,690
So how do we go about preserving it.

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,130
Well I'm going to go to file and revert.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,090
So we go back to how it was when I started.

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,580
Because when you right click with the object selected and convert to mesh you have this little area

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,720
down on the left the operator panel that gives us an option to keep the original.

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,050
However currently when we keep the original the bug that did exist still exists.

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,980
What ends up happening is the original circle gets converted into mesh data so you end up with just

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,240
an edge.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,260
But we don't have the rest of the data there.

32
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,970
This is problematic.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,770
Again file reverse will take us back to the file as it was before.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,580
How do we get around this.

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,370
Well we have to do a little bit of a manual jump through a bit of hoops to jump through until the blender

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,230
devs get to fix that.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,460
Now what we can do here is simply duplicate this shift indeed to duplicate press escaped to release

38
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,890
it and then go ahead and rename it.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,830
So we've got lamp base path and now I'm going to call this original her.

40
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,070
So there we go.

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,460
And now I can go to my lamp base path I've selected it in the outline as I can right click and convert

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,540
to mash it will convert it to a mesh we can confirm it's converted it to a mesh by doing something along

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,280
those lines brilliant.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,380
And there we go.

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,160
All done and dusted.

46
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:04,120
Now comes your challenge Okay so your challenge is to create a mesh object from the curb objects.

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,840
If you've been following along exactly already you've done it.

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,410
If not you need to go ahead and do that.

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,180
Now keep the curve objects.

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,410
Now if by the time you're doing this lecture the operator panel still does it work.

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,060
If you take keep original thing you're going to have to duplicate it.

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,070
So do duplicates.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,610
If that toggle fails.

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,930
And then finally turn off the curve object from rendering you may even want to hide it in the viewport

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,620
as well.

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,750
But I do want you to turn it off from rendering.

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,410
Now remember there are now filter options.

58
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,210
So if you don't see the rendering icon the little picture of a camera it's hidden away so you'll need

59
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,050
to turn it on in the filtering options at the top of the outline.

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,480
I would also like you to make sure that the lamp is solid.

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,050
Give it's a base not only on the bottom but on the little bit that goes down.

62
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:03,970
And in that also needs a base to it gets rid of unnecessary geometry so inside the bit where we're going

63
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:10,870
to connect the rest of the lamp where the neck of the lamp is so to speak that is going to have far

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,910
too much geometry in them at the moment.

65
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,830
So go in and dissolve any unnecessary geometry in there.

66
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,010
And then finally think about applying the subdivision surface modifier to the mesh object instead of

67
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,230
it being applied to the curve object.

68
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,480
So I'd recommend removing it before solidifying it as a mesh object.

69
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,070
Pause the video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,360
Let's hop on over into blender and solidify and create our lamp base.

71
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,760
Okay.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,790
So we've been through a couple of examples here.

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,780
This is far too high poly.

74
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,640
So what's I'm going to do once again is revert back.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,690
Now I've got the luxury of I had saved of having my files kept in what's called a repository it's a

76
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,470
get repo.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,140
I can just revert back to how it was at the end of every lecture.

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,720
But if you don't have that just bear in mind you can you save as to keep versions you can go into your

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,140
preferences to your save and load and actually give yourself some save versions.

80
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,550
As I said right at the very beginning of the course I do not need those they clutter up my file system.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,340
But by all means give yourself those if you feel that you're going to be saving often and wants to go

82
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,880
backwards and forwards or I should developing.

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,930
Remember you can go file and save as.

84
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,360
Okay.

85
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,180
So the first thing I'm going to do here is go and remove my subdivision surface modifier from it.

86
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,510
So it's nice and clean.

87
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,960
And then going to duplicate it which is good.

88
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,620
And I'm going to call this one the lamp base original and I'm going to hide it.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,780
I'm not going to hide it from my senior because I want you to see what happens if you don't do that.

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
And also from the rendered scene as well.

91
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,680
So the first thing I'm going to do is go back to my lamp profile sorry not profile the lamp path.

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,040
That's the one here and I'm going to go ahead right click and convert.

93
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,170
It's a mesh all being well we should now be able to go into edit mode grab parts of it and adjust accordingly.

94
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes brilliant.

95
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,010
Let's undo those changes.

96
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:26,470
So I definitely know it's now a mesh object and look at that definitely as we've got far more options

97
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,400
when it comes to adding modifiers.

98
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,030
And in this case I want at the subdivision surface modifying cranked up to two and we should end up

99
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,360
with something that looks pretty close to how we had before.

100
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,370
But this is a great example now of some of the issues you might face.

101
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,070
We've got crossing over geometry it looks horrible.

102
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,110
And if we look at it in rendered mode for example it looks even worse.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,450
So this is rendered mode but it's still the viewport.

104
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,030
So if we turn it off and the lamp base original we just hide it out of the way.

105
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,670
You would think that that's done and dusted.

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:10,210
However if we have a look through the camera itself and let's move the camera a bit closer loop to close

107
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,410
okay.

108
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,620
And what I could do here to help us is of course by a board around than it would have rendered much

109
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,450
quicker as I was moving around.

110
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,880
Okay.

111
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,810
So we have what looks good there.

112
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,750
And if we go ahead and go render render image it will take a while to go through and sort out.

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,930
But you will also see that there's lots of extra stuff there.

114
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,000
Even though it's hidden in the scene.

115
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,990
So here we can see that we've still got all lamp are mockup that we made and we've got the other stuff

116
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,800
also intersecting as well.

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,680
How do we make sure that that's not there.

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,740
Well we just need to toggle it off of that camera icon.

119
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,240
So I'm just going to close that down for the moment and I'm going to go at the top here to my filter

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,160
options and we can see that the camera icon is still turned off.

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:05,120
So I'm going to turn that's on and then we can come through and hide it here hide it here.

122
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,280
The profile Well we don't want by appearing any way in any shape or form.

123
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,930
And with the camera turned off it means that we can go ahead now and when we render even those to take

124
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,210
a few moments to do it will be a nice clean render.

125
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,200
So we've got that part of it's sorted out but we still need to sort out the rest of the geometry here.

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,050
Let's close that down.

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,990
Okay.

128
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,210
Let's go into edit mode on here.

129
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,760
Now we've got quite a low amounts of geometry so we won't have too much to clean up.

130
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:42,210
But the first thing I am going to do is come out of random mode so we can move around a bit quicker.

131
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,870
Well and let's go down here now.

132
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,590
It still looks a bit dodgy at the moment doesn't it.

133
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,740
Well what we can do is on the subdivisions surface modifier This is upside down triangle.

134
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,140
So we can adjust the edit cage the original geometry to match the modified results and they will look

135
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,150
much better by doing that.

136
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,770
And it also gives us a better feel of the form.

137
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,180
Now as you saw me playing earlier I don't have quite as much geometry to play with when we're using

138
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,700
the subdivision surface modifier.

139
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,350
But let's go ahead and just sort out the major issues here.

140
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,240
Let's isolate this festival.

141
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm going to go shift and H to hide everything else in my scene.

142
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,090
So we've got these couple of areas we need to sort out.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,310
I'm going to use edge select select this edge on the bottom here was holding down oats.

144
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,780
There we go.

145
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,560
And with that we can go g z and just lift it up and out of the way.

146
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,420
Excellent.

147
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,090
I'm also whilst I'm here going to grab this edge and go X and dissolve is unnecessary geometry I'm then

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,490
going to grab this once more and fill it in.

149
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,520
I could have done it at the same time.

150
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,030
And I'm going to do the same.

151
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,420
All there's a good point with the subdivision surface godfather extra bits of geometry might have been

152
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,080
helpful.

153
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,450
Okay.

154
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,080
And back it comes.

155
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,560
There we go.

156
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,530
Looking good.

157
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,700
The other thing of course we could have done here instead is inset the bottom.

158
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,140
Yes.

159
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,990
That's much better.

160
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,630
I'm going to inset sets are there a similar thing for the actual base itself.

161
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,910
We will fill it in.

162
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:25,440
It will make the base quite curved but then we can inset that base to give it a bit more control and

163
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,740
also define the edge much better running around here.

164
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,610
Okay.

165
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,890
That starts to look really really nice.

166
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:39,030
So what I can do here is I'm going to knock the viewport settings down ever so slightly and apply it.

167
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,890
We can't do that in edit Moses come out apply and have a look at my model.

168
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,440
Okay.

169
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,530
That's about the level of geometry that I want to work with.

170
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,710
So that's really good.

171
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,170
The next thing I need to do here is a font few final bits and tweaks we're going to add another subdivision

172
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,870
surface.

173
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,310
But now we only need it at one level because we've already done it once.

174
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm going to turn the cage back concert follows round and then it's just a matter of picking and choosing

175
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,870
the bits of geometry we want to remove.

176
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,630
So I think I can remove those three X dissolve edges looks pretty good to me and I'm going to grab this

177
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:23,010
edge here and scale it in to make this a bit more of a vertical tube and I can double check that by

178
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,340
looking at it in wireframe mode.

179
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,930
Does that go straight down.

180
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,850
No it curves in ever so slightly select scale that back out just a little.

181
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,510
Okay.

182
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,190
That's looking really good.

183
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,960
Z solid.

184
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,820
Kate.

185
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,810
Now what else can we do here.

186
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,560
Well we could do some of the things that I was alluding to before giving this a bit of extra geometry

187
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,160
grabbing different areas perhaps scaling this bits in giving it's a bit more prominence that's looking

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,230
pretty sharp.

189
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,400
And then finally perhaps this edge on the bottom here we can scale that out and make it a bit more rounded.

190
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:01,950
Okay.

191
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,930
Nice.

192
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,150
Okay.

193
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,050
That's looking really really good.

194
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,250
I'm pleased with how it's working out.

195
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,080
Did you make any further modifications to your base.

196
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,720
Really looking forward to seeing how they're coming along.

197
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,370
Almost at the point now where we can start adding some more parts to our mesh.

198
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,210
Yes.

199
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,670
And in this case it's going to be the neck coming out so we can put our first arm on and then we will

200
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,560
have this bit coming out this bit coming up and our lamp on top.

201
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,140
So we're coming together really really nicely.

202
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
And just can hide that out the way for the moment.

203
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,440
Save my work and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
