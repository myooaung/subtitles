Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture now.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,440
This is the end of the 2.8 remaster as it is at the moment.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,260
I am busy in the background just prototyping the next couple of sections making sure they're working

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,150
properly in Blender 2.8 and I'm going back to some of the early elections as well because some of the

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,890
terminology is you guys have thankfully pointed out has changed.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,330
I'm going to go rectify that.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,110
Now I've got a few other notes here so I just want to make sure I don't miss anything.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,010
The next lecture to this one is going to give you access to the old course.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,610
Now that's important because if for some reason you can't run blender 2.8 or just want access to the

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,620
archive information before we remove it from this course you'll be able to do so following the link

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,830
in that lecture.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,740
So that's important.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,220
If you need access to the old 2.0 seven x that's by 7 7 8 and 9 content.

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,160
Not much has changed during that side but when we got to blender 2.8 a lot changed in fact a lot more

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,010
than I thought had to change which is why some of the earlier lectures now are somewhat different from

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,400
what when they were before.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,170
But it's so much better now playing with eevee as well.

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,900
We get much much better results right from the word go rather than using the old blender render which

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,880
is much more involved to set up now.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,530
Feel free to join in with the old content if you need to but do bear in mind the old content since it's

21
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,270
been deprecated is no longer being supported by us.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,310
And if it's still in this course at the moment of course we'll be supported.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,400
And as we roll forward we'll start removing some of the other lectures out to the old content as we

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,290
go so so far the first second third and fourth sections will be removed over the next week or so so

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,710
that's all the way up to the old chess sets.

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,720
But of course all the new content is right there waiting for you as well.

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,620
If you've got any questions of course fire away be happy to help and more content will be coming soon

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,630
well we'd be hopping back on over into blender 2.8 take our.
