00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,210
Welcome to repetitive tasks in blender.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,700
In this video you will learn how to manage repetitive tasks.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,930
There are lots we do over and over again and sometimes we just want to repeat the same action we've

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,770
just done.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,120
But in a different location now we're going to also understand good uses for appending a blend file

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,550
into our scene.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,780
So let's go hop straight on over into a blender.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,970
Okay so we're back over in blender.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,330
The first thing I'm going to do is just remove everything in the scene to keep it nice and straight

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,260
forward.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,050
Now when you're spending far into a scene you want to do that whenever you basically want to completely

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,510
forget all the history of that and use it as a base to generate something new from it.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,150
And so in order to do this we're going to go and use one of the basic objects that we've got so we're

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,550
going to go and spend we can see a short cut there is shift in EF 1.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:03,710
I'm going to go to my assets and in meshes and I'm going to use the square the two by two by pointing

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,480
five.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,610
Now we need to go to the object I want to bring the whole object in in all of its properties and just

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,640
pick up the square.

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,310
And that's a pen that in.

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,630
So there we go we have our new object in the scene and it's not linked at all.

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,500
So I'm now going to first of all change the name before we do anything else.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,200
And I'm going to call this square the tail.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,380
I think that would be appropriate if I could spell detail of course.

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,220
There we go.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,310
Square the tail.

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,080
And I'm going to copy that.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,320
Go to save make sure I'm in the ascites folder and paste that in.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,420
So we're working on a brandy blender far based upon the other ones who've appended it in.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,630
Any changes we make here or to the other blend file.

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,210
I'm not going to impact the that's more important.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,830
Any changes we've made to the other blend file.

32
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,140
So with this we can now go ahead and create some detail I'm going to make some very basic detail here.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm going to take this top face and subdivide it.

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,630
So let's go into edit mode and then select face.

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,070
It's going to subdivide that.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,880
Now lemme have this face here and inset it's by I don't know.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,740
Point two.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,440
There we go.

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,490
So that looks good.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,040
Now I want to do that to the rest of these faces and of course this isn't that trivial doing it to a

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,800
few of these faces here.

42
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,740
However I can quite easily end up having a very repetitive task going on and the easy way to do that

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,990
is shift and ah.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,790
So if I select this next phase and go shift and ah it just repeats exactly the task I did moments ago

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,700
and that is incredibly powerful.

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,430
If I can just keep doing it and doing it because it will invert.

47
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,540
In this case I don't want to go quite that far.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,450
Of course then I can decide right.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,730
I've repeated that along there.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,130
And I want to extrude ever so slightly by point one that's to say.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,630
And again I can select that one shift shift shift.

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,750
And there we go we've got a a wall with a panelled wall if you will.

53
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,480
Very very powerful feature.

54
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,410
Be able to repeat things over and over again.

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,650
Of course I can go ahead and save that file an I've got that ready to use in this scene later Ron.

56
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,930
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,210
I'd like you to add some detail.

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:30,100
So spend a few of the existing modules into new blender files create some geometric patterns on them

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,440
or add a bit more detail.

60
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,260
Save them as new individual blend files.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,820
And of course make a commit.

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,900
So balls are video now and give that a go.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,190
Okay guys welcome back.

64
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,570
Let's go hop straight on over in a blender.

65
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,060
OK so back over in blender.

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,910
I've done my square the tell.

67
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,620
Let's go ahead and.

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,880
Start a brandley blend far.

69
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,160
And again I'm going to remove everything from the scene.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,440
I am tempted to set up my basic scene without anything in it at this point.

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,050
Let's go.

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,800
Pen.

73
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,240
An I'm going to work on the door.

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,810
I think that I've made early I'm not sure actually at the moment let's go see what I've got as I've

75
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,740
done my door with Herbert the one with the window on it underneath.

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,960
Add some detail to that.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,450
So we've got this window in the wall here let's go ahead and edit it.

78
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,020
Focus on it as well so you can see what's going on.

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,750
And I think it would look quite nice with a couple of detailed edges to it so I'm going to this time

80
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,720
use a couple of loop cuts to help frame the wall a little.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,830
Would it help if I knew where that was.

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,150
No I'm going to do that by I.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,540
I'm going to put a loop cut round the top here.

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,610
GROSS I could be more precise if I wanted to as well but if that looks right by I that's all good for

85
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,990
me and I'm going to go ahead here and win this case.

86
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm going to select them all individually and move up rather than repeating.

87
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,490
Although arguably I think it would be just as quick to do both of those.

88
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,770
And I'm going to pull that out ever so slightly.

89
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,460
Or are there by how much.

90
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm looking down there.

91
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,370
Not by much hyped or by about point nor five I think to add a bit more detail around there.

92
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,840
So that's a new level of detail I suppose with our window that's useful to know.

93
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,570
And whilst I'm here adding detail that now looks like I can pull this up ever so slightly.

94
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,480
Not by much just a little bit again by about porton point not 5.

95
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,840
And pull it out and that will start to give us a bit of a window ledge which is quite nice.

96
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,570
Again I'm going to extrude that out by about point 1 and I'm going to do it on the other side as well.

97
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,330
It's always very useful so extrude by about point 1.

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,710
So then I can have an inside of the wall and then outside.

99
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,380
Really good.

100
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
So I'm going to now save this.

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,550
I'm going to make sure it's named appropriately so.

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,000
Wall window

103
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,730
underscore the tell.

104
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,280
Copy that so it's exactly the same over here and save as.

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,290
Place that in and save.

106
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,730
Okay so the final thing to do is hop over to our repository.

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,780
So just opened up where we are and I've got uncommitted changes going on from our first commit.

108
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,260
So this allows me of course if I make a complete Booboo and change things up I can always hop back in

109
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,740
time.

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,740
So I want to make this commit now that I've added two new models I could have done just at every stage

111
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,640
but I haven't changed any of the other models at the moment.

112
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,650
So you can consider when you actually change something from how it was previously That would be a good

113
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,310
time to make.

114
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,270
Commit Sonor click click here on uncommitted changes.

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm going to have a look down here at my unstaged files.

116
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,760
Now I'm just going to try to find the little widget to pull this window up.

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,580
Okay so now I've done that.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,390
I've got two files here ready for staging which of the two that I've done I'm going to put a tick in

119
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,990
the box there which I'm happy with and I'm going to commit those and I'm going to put here.

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:24,550
I've added detail to window and wall.

121
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,780
And press commit now I've not got any particular.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,840
Text File going on in here but of course before doing that comic you could have appended your text file

123
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,220
as well.

124
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,660
How did you guys get on.

125
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,730
What detail did you add to your models.

126
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,870
Please share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
