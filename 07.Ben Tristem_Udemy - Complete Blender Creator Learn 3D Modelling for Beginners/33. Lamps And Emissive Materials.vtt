00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.400
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on the lamps vs. a missive materials especially when using

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.310
cycles.

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.030
So in front of us here we've got a light being cast onto a plane on the floor.

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.650
Now this light is contained within a square lamp holding which you can see with the outline of the light

5
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.580
hitting there.

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170
Now this is quite noisy.

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.440
This one has been generated by an immersive surface essentially like the light bulb that we currently

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440
have.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.900
And notice at the top we've got the render time was 57 seconds.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.850
Here we have a look at this one here that looks significantly different took slightly less time.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.920
Well I'd say significantly less time since we're talking about animations around 9 to 10 seconds less

12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.200
time and looks a lot cleaner.

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.820
It's not as messy.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.180
This was by using a spotlight contained within that square lamp.

15
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.120
And then finally we've got another light source here.

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.370
This is a point light source.

17
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.220
So rather than the lamp type being a spotlight it is a point light source as you can see that's noisy

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.820
again.

19
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.580
And if we compare these together this one is probably the noisiest but it's not too far away from this

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.580
one here.

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.340
And the quickest one was the spotlight.

22
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.690
However there are some drawbacks from doing this as well.

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.090
And it will really be up to you and what you're working on with your project which one of these is worth

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.820
going for.

25
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.940
And certainly if you've got a much noisier scene you're going to have to do some sorts of post-processing

26
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.660
or render it for longer in order to get a cleaner image let's hop on over into blender and find out

27
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.630
more.

28
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.920
OK.

29
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.460
So this is where we're up to so far we've got an immersive surface inside of our lamp itself.

30
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.690
And then we've got the world which is something we need to talk about and also those two aerial lamps

31
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.720
as well.

32
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.230
I'm going to go back to previous here and look at this from the layout and turn rendering back on.

33
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.640
Now the first thing I want to do is over in your render properties go down to where you've got sampling.

34
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.810
Make sure this is open and currently set the viewport to 1.

35
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.410
Now nothing will happen initially but what will happen the next time we move.

36
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.370
This is the image will look incredibly grainy.

37
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.480
Now this is what I want to focus on for a few moments.

38
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.490
I've played with this a lot and it's going to take about 2000 samples to get this area particularly

39
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.360
clean without using any of the deep noise feature that will cover later on.

40
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.460
So in front of us we've got our scene we've got a lamp inside and we've got art to at the top area lamps

41
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.320
for the moment.

42
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.620
I'm going to hide those so they're no longer in our scene.

43
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.680
Now the world is contributing a lot of lights as well.

44
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.490
And what we can see very clearly is any areas that are in shadow are currently more noisier than areas

45
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.240
that are not especially these top surface which is facing the rest of the world.

46
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.570
And the reason for that is the way the blenders working is from our viewpoint here.

47
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.390
The rays of light are being cast out or not rays of light sorry just rays are being cast out and they're

48
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.890
bouncing off the surfaces.

49
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.400
And if they come in contact with light then we see the colour that's produced.

50
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.830
Now some of these don't hear anything which is why they end up black and that is what your lights paths

51
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.490
are all about.

52
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.280
So if we have a look down at the light path options we can see there are a total of maximum that total

53
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:45.020
of 12 bounces we can increase the bounce amounts to increase quality however with that we also increase

54
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.920
render times.

55
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.220
So if I said that to 36 you may not get any difference initially because the amount of times things

56
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.760
have to bounce if they're already black they're probably not hitting a light source anytime soon.

57
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.100
Angola lower that back down to 12 and you can adjust the amount of bounces that happen depending on

58
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.240
what's going on.

59
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.820
So here we've got the total that's the total maximum number of bounces but lower down we've got different

60
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.540
options.

61
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.440
So if I was to turn all of these up it's 12 we may get a slightly better cleaner render but we still

62
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.260
only got one sample.

63
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.860
So it's just sent out one set of rays to see what the scene looks like.

64
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.630
I'm going to turn that back down to four and four before I forget.

65
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.310
Okay so let's just focus on sampling for the moment.

66
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.600
So we've got all viewport here set up one if I go ahead and up that's it.

67
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.210
So it immediately gets a lot better.

68
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.670
And in fact by the time we reach something like 64 which won't take too long we see that the only thing

69
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.460
that's left that's pretty horrible is this area in front of us.

70
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.260
Now before we look at that in much more detail let's turn the world lights so we go down to the world

71
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.370
properties where it says colour.

72
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.110
I'm going to change that and says it's a black look at that.

73
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.100
So the only light in our world now is coming from our lamp itself.

74
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.600
And this is great because it's highlighting a couple of problems that we've got in our scene.

75
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.310
We have all of these speckled red areas.

76
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.970
And from my experience it's going to take a lot of samples to get it all the way there.

77
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:28.850
In fact if we go ahead back to our samples and set this to around 2000 which I would not recommend by

78
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.030
the way and we leave this to count up as I'm about to here we will see that that surface itself starts

79
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.060
to look pretty clean.

80
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.490
Now as this is coming together here you will also notice that we've seemed to have just a blue surface

81
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.250
underneath our lamp which is what we'd expect the light inside is just emitting a white light.

82
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.860
However this is all pink.

83
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.000
Why is it all pink.

84
00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.380
Well it simply puts is the light is bouncing off the inside of our lampshade and then it's coming out

85
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.790
pink and that's why there's all of these speckles of pink as well.

86
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:12.140
It's all from the light from inside they're bouncing off the surface of our lamp and as we can see here

87
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.230
we're part I'm not going to go any further with this.

88
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.410
We're coming up to 1100 and it's starting to look much much cleaner in order to have a clean speckled

89
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.380
free image.

90
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.400
Yes increasing your samples will get you there.

91
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.410
I would not recommend unless you're right at the very end of this section even going close to 2000.

92
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.200
I'd recommend in general stopping around 200 maximum if you're having to go beyond that.

93
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.750
It's for a very good reason.

94
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.080
And by that point you're you're certain as to what that reason is one of the ways of making sure that

95
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.410
your scene isn't too noisy is to just make sure there's a bit of extra lights in it that will help the

96
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.580
scene sets allowance.

97
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.640
But what it's not helping here is this speckled.

98
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.560
So we've got the lights underneath.

99
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.640
That seems fine.

100
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.320
And we've got this red area.

101
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.070
Now what we can do instead is turn off our bulb let's turn off the bulb.

102
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.360
Suddenly it looks a lot lot cleaner.

103
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.140
But of course it doesn't really give the effect that we want it doesn't have the light coming out.

104
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.240
And I'm going to turn that back down to maybe 16 for the moment so I'm not wearing my computer out or

105
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.100
just wasting the planet's resources rendering something that's useless.

106
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.120
So let's go ahead here.

107
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.880
I'm under my bulb itself I seem to remember would have a point light source.

108
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.380
So let's go and turn that's on.

109
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.940
Now with a point light source as you can see we still get the speckled effect.

110
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.550
What happens if we grab that point light source and change it for a spot light.

111
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.440
Now we're going to have to be a bit more careful because the spotlight has direction as you can see

112
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.530
it's not still bouncing off the inside of our lamp.

113
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:54.610
So if we look at this from the side and this won't be spot on at the moment because our armature is

114
00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:02.110
still at a funny angle so let's go ahead find our armature go to the pose itself and set it to rest

115
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.930
position.

116
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.970
There we go.

117
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:11.500
Now we can go back to our where we ads are pointing lamp here which is no longer pointing it's a spot

118
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.410
lamp.

119
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.400
There we go.

120
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:21.890
And now we can rotate it round so at least it's looking the right way that's rotates on the x axis There

121
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.060
we go probably by 90.

122
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.300
In minus 90.

123
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.080
There we go.

124
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.010
So now at least it's coming out and looking at the right direction.

125
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.200
And we can see we've got a spot light appearing here and we don't need to do anything else at the moment

126
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.950
because the spot lamp is already pear parents head to the bulb.

127
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.450
So where we go ahead and impose mode.

128
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.510
Start moving the head whilst we impose mode.

129
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.350
There we go.

130
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.970
Our spotlight will follow suit.

131
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.890
And as we can see here it's illuminating the ground exactly how you'd expect it to.

132
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.840
So the other thing we can now do.

133
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.720
I'm going to go back to wrest position for a moment so we can look at it from the side is with our spotlights

134
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.430
selected.

135
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.110
Make sure it is actually selected.

136
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.550
So we need to come out oppose mode into object mode as we can start playing with perhaps its power we

137
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.870
can put it up to 150 watts.

138
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.140
So we've got it illuminating more of our scene.

139
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:25.290
But this is the more important bit the spot shape should really align with how big our lamp actually

140
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.430
is and we can eyeball that that looks about right there.

141
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.590
And then of course we can show the current if we want and that looks a bit silly like that doesn't it.

142
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.120
Because that's not what we actually want it to look like.

143
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.980
But when we come back here we can see it does look a bit better.

144
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:50.010
Now this is a very very wide spot light but that is accurately representing how the light might come

145
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.240
out of here.

146
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.810
And then if we go ahead selects our arm it should go back into pose mode and move this and come out

147
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.450
of there we go rest position and then we should be able to if we point it all the way down which is

148
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.550
a bit unrealistic.

149
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.870
This is the area that it's covering.

150
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.750
So at this point this is where you start trying to make your decisions because we know that this is

151
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.100
going to produce a much cleaner light.

152
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.680
However it's not going to be as realistic.

153
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:24.030
It will still get these reflections and speckles in the scene there's very little we can do to prevent

154
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.520
that from happening fully.

155
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.410
But what it will do is it will give us a nice clean light without all the red speckles therefore not

156
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.620
being completely realistic.

157
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:40.530
The downside of that as well is now when we look inside the lamp let's hide our armature so it's completely

158
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.500
out of the way.

159
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.200
When we look inside of our lamp there's no bulb anymore.

160
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.390
So if we got any shots where we want the lamp looking towards us there isn't anything actually lighting

161
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.660
up the inside.

162
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.310
There are a couple of ways around that we can put something there but then it might block the light

163
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.340
or perhaps we can have a bulb in there.

164
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:05.370
But with this bulb and its material perhaps we turn down its strength to only 10 so it doesn't contribute

165
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.750
much to the rest of the scene especially in terms of noise or even down to one.

166
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.840
Perhaps one is a bit too low.

167
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.640
Looks like we're going to have to have it around at least 10 to give us the effect of the bulb that

168
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.710
will introduce a bit more noise to the scene but nowhere near as much of having all of the lights coming

169
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.120
from that one object and there we go.

170
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.400
That's pretty much the different types of lights emission.

171
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.920
In a nutshell.

172
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.820
And of course you can see it makes a dramatic effect as to what you're going to do.

173
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.260
Now your challenged for this lecture I'm not going to put up a challenge slide for it.

174
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.590
You've seen the different options here.

175
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.940
Which one are you going to go for.

176
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.350
Do you want the more realistic looking one which is incredibly important.

177
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.700
If you are doing a photo realistic scene or are you going for a middle ground.

178
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.580
How are you going to have your animation look at the camera.

179
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.030
If so you're going to need something inside to represent a bulb.

180
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.170
So give that some thought pause the video experiments in your scene and see how it looks you'd by no

181
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.260
means do you have to have a completely pitch black scene.

182
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.470
Or we can go ahead and really exaggerate this.

183
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.740
I've turned off these lights before to see how noisy it's going to be.

184
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.010
I'm going to need some lights on the scene.

185
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.020
Otherwise it's just not going to look any good.

186
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.420
I'm not going for a film noir effect here.

187
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.550
I still want to see my subjects.

188
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.050
And without those aerial lights and it's not going to give me the right effect.

189
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.550
Now the rest of the world itself I think I'm happy with it being pretty dark.

190
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.900
I may raise the color just a little sore on the world's settings.

191
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.960
I can go to the color itself and increase the value essentially.

192
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.620
So it's not quite as dark.

193
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.780
And that gives us a bit more scope and freedom for the depth of the scene.

194
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.670
Bearing in mind the camera's probably never going to look down this way or this way.

195
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.940
And if it does we might have to do something else with our backdrop but that's it for this lecture.

196
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.250
Let me know what you chose and why you chose it in the discussions and make sure you show your work

197
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.840
as well.

198
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.370
And I'll see you all over in the next lecture.
