00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome to animating render layers.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,820
So this is all about swapping out models and taking control over what is appearing in our scene at any

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,400
one time.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,930
Now this is critical when you don't want to see the breaks before an object actually breaks.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,260
Very important when it comes to things like glass and ceramics where you can really see the cracks in

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,490
a surface.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,350
Now we can get away with it on some objects like our brick work.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,130
Now of course this doesn't have to just be used when you're fracturing objects you can swap models out

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,070
if you're about to do something that's need in need of a different model.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,900
So you may already have a model that's what happens when something breaks apart.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,020
You may have modelled in detail exactly how you want that broken apart.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,660
Again this is referring back to breaks admittedly but you could swap out one model for another if you

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,660
just wanted to make things literally appear and then go pop and change to something else.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,750
Now glass objects would look absolutely awful if you just had the brakes being rendered so this is one

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,820
of the main reasons why you'd want to swap out models is simply because it would it wouldn't look right.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,860
No other difference than that now swapping out the model at the moment the braking will solve that issue.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,280
So this is mainly to do with rendering an animation more than anything else but it can also be useful

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,630
when trying out different models as where you can flick between them.

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,700
Great if you're showcasing your work as well.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,870
So let's go play with this now and hop on over in the blender.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,420
Okay so I'm in a brand new blender file at this point.

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,370
And what we need to do is first learn where underlayers are and what they are.

23
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,140
So you'll render layers are quite simply the layers that you've got active at any one time and you can

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,210
control those as well and have different settings for the slenderer render layers.

25
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,850
So where are they.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,000
Well if we go over to the Properties window and click on the second tab and if we hover over that we

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,030
can see it's called render layers.

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,370
So go over there now.

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,390
Now you can have several render layers already set up if you want to we're just going to deal with one

30
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,070
at the moment to keep things straight forward.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,710
Now the ones that were going to be interested in at the moment of a scene layer and the exclude layer.

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,550
Now you cannot annamay the scene layer.

33
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,780
So we try and go over the top of any of those and press I it just says layers property can not be animated

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,470
we can see the error in the top up there on the info head.

35
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,600
So what can we animate.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,210
Well we can animate the exclude now it is important that we realize that the exclude itself the whole

37
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,940
thing is animated not the individual layers that confuse me something rotten.

38
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,670
When I first started using blender as I y car and I was as basically turning one thing off on one thing

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,320
and getting myself in a complete muddle.

40
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,520
So we'll go through animating and making sure it works.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,410
Now one of the very important things at this point before you even start playing with the render layers

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,060
and excluding them is realising what is on what layer.

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,060
So first of all I'm just going to turn on my I'm not sure if I got it turned on.

44
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,590
So I'm going to go to my add ons and go to layers.

45
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,930
Now I haven't got layer management turned on one of those other ones I forgot.

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,680
And when to save me use a setting so with the layer management on I can go to the layer tab in the tool

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,700
shelf and start thinking consciously about what my layers are called.

48
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,920
So it's at this point you want to realize that some of your stuff you want to make sure is never excluded.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,770
Like your lighting for instance unless you wanted your scene to go completely dark.

50
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,060
So with that we can call layer one.

51
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,910
Well I wouldn't call layer one lighting.

52
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,390
I think that would be silly since everything starts on layer 1 less you started playing really a lot

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,860
with your start-up file.

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,850
So we can call this one let's say basic And what's this layer down here.

55
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,620
Now we don't know that that's layer 11 so you can see the little eyeball when I've clicked down here

56
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,980
on the 3d header to header and switched to a different layer.

57
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,970
We've got layer 11 turned on and lera leavens got nothing on it.

58
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm going to call that lighting.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,970
Yeah.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,550
Lighting and lighting and camera.

61
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm going to put the two on the same layer.

62
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,420
Okay so now we have lighting and cameras set up we better move the lighting and camera to that less.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,770
I'm going to go back to layer 1 and move those two objects with the M key o m and then this layer down

64
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,750
here and then hopefully they will be on the right layer.

65
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,740
Now just to make sure things are working as we'd expect them to I'm going to press front.

66
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,870
Oh I'm going to press F 12 here and there we go it's going to render out and we can see here we've got

67
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,680
light in our scene.

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:56,090
That's because if we look over here on the render layers we've got layer 1 and layer 11 both active.

69
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:04,150
If we had forgotten and only had lael one active then of course when we go ahead and render it is no

70
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,790
lighting.

71
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,180
Apart from the ambient lighting that's in the environment so it is important you realise whatever ones

72
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,390
of these are turned on are going to be included when you actually hit the render whether that's an animation

73
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,990
or whether a still render like this.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,550
Now if you wanted more than one of these active then you could quite easily hold down the shift button

75
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,450
and click the ones you wanted or even just click and drag over the top in you see them turn on.

76
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,140
And if they're in the state of turning them on they don't turn others off.

77
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,440
And if they're in the state of turning things off like they are at the moment they will turn everything

78
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,390
off that you move the mouse over.

79
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,030
So now we got an idea of how we can turn them on and off.

80
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,810
The next thing we need to do is work out how to animate that so we can switch things in and out whether

81
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,820
that be a fractured object so they don't start fracture.

82
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,590
Very important if it's something like glass you could quite easily imagine if it was a glass cube that

83
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,990
we were dingly with and we'd fractured it would look horrible it before it was supposed to be broken.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,330
So in order to emulate this properly what we can do here is are not going to fracture this particular

85
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,270
object this time.

86
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,740
I've got my basic object on Layer 1 on layer 2.

87
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,710
I'm going to go ahead and add myself something completely different a cone and I'm also going to move

88
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,540
up one blender units as well.

89
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,690
So is occupying the same space.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Now this is on layer 2.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,910
We can check that by just isolating layer 2 we can do it down here or in the render layers tab.

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,820
So you can move individually around.

93
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,550
Now remember we will always need this bottom one on layer 11.

94
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,150
Otherwise will have no light in our scene.

95
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,010
So we've got these two things on different layers Now ordinarily because you cannot annamay the layers

96
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,640
themselves.

97
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,580
We have to have all of them turned on.

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,970
Now that they're all turned on we have the annamay.

99
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,610
When we exclude certain layers and it's the state of the entire block that is animated.

100
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:15,270
So if we start off with excluding layer 2 and we keep that in by pressing I and then go to lay that

101
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,800
frame let's say 25 or thereabouts this is 29 some really off of manski Use the Selecter 24.

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,540
There we go one second later.

103
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,620
I'm going to key in a new set up.

104
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,410
So this time Layer one is excluded.

105
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,520
And that will be everything there is on Layer 1.

106
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,770
So this is where you have to really be organized about your layers.

107
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,270
So now as we go through we should see that it starts off with layer 2 being excluded and then layer

108
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,570
one becomes the excluded one.

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,660
Okay.

110
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,830
So how does that look.

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,840
Well let's go ahead and and make between frame 1 and 50.

112
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm going to check my settings for rendering.

113
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,260
I've recently installed an external graphics card for my Mac.

114
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,080
So some of these settings do need changing is going to save this.

115
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,430
This scene that we're working on here.

116
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,940
So I'm just going to call this a render layers and a Save that there and I'm literally going to render

117
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,370
an animation so I got up to the render tab and hit render animation and we can see it's just going to

118
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,490
go through here and render or it's not going to be particularly exciting but we should see now as it's

119
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,450
rendering because it's rendering it one frame every one and a half seconds not particularly stellar.

120
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,020
Now we should see and in fact if it's going mislav could have condense that example.

121
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:44,260
But once it reaches an enormous there have a look once that reaches frame 24 hour Q will spontaneously

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,300
become a cone.

123
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,880
How awesome is that.

124
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,410
And you can use this to control your renders very very accurately.

125
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,350
And it's a great way of making sure let's say if something started as a solid and then it was breaking

126
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,610
up that you didn't have an issue when it came to actually rendering it in the first place because the

127
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,990
last thing you want is a piece of glass or something that's breaking apart.

128
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,270
Now we could get away with it on the wall remember because of the the kind of wall texture and walls

129
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,090
tend to have cracks and bumps in them so that's not a problem.

130
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,610
But if it was glass and we can we can accentuate that now we can actually see what would happen.

131
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,780
So we've got these two objects here and I'm not going to make one of them.

132
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,720
Well we could actually make one of them the broken Square we can go back and do this.

133
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,590
And so the easiest way of doing that would be to go back to the 3D view fracture of this well let's

134
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,950
go to the second layer first and delete that cube.

135
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,090
Go back to the first.

136
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,090
The Cube layer here and then let's fracture it so let's go and sell fracture.

137
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,870
And I am not too fussed of how it ends up fractured.

138
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,960
So we've got all the broken layer on layer 2 and let's give these guys a material that is glass.

139
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,740
I'm going to use nodes and when I go to a glass B s the F and let's just render that out and see what

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,870
it looks like.

141
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,500
So that's what it looks like we have.

142
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,450
That is the fractured one I was with it both turned on.

143
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,140
So the but the way of just checking this and in fact that would change is were looking around.

144
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,680
Perfect.

145
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,090
Okay.

146
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm going to add a floor plain and scale that up.

147
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,610
I'm going to put give that new material in just a diffuse material that's fine.

148
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,800
Of course we've got the lighting turned off at the moment as well.

149
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,180
There we go.

150
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:38,790
So our glass is sitting on a table or whatever and I'm just going to give the lamp a bit more brightness

151
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,190
as we are going to make it sunlamp to start with not a brightness of 100 maybe even a brightness of

152
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,520
two.

153
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:44,940
There we go.

154
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,610
So that's not too bright there.

155
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,250
And that's what it looks like.

156
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,050
And of course when we break it apart and let's just swap these layers over.

157
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,150
Oh.

158
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,820
Here we go.

159
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
I've got my ground on layer 1.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,080
See how easy it is to forget.

161
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,200
So let's move the ground to layer three.

162
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,210
Then I can have layer three and one turned on or what whatever combination I want I just gotta remember

163
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,370
to turn them on so we see here.

164
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,370
This one's fractured and it looks significantly different too.

165
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,420
This one here and we can even render that out just to make sure it makes sense.

166
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm going to play and then actually render that out now and instead of you guys watching I'm going to

167
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,120
wait until we can actually play it back sensibly Okay so what's going on here the floors not for not

168
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
being shown.

169
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,260
Why is this happening.

170
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,680
It's because I've actually turned off and this is a good idea to watch your renders he can see the problems

171
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,450
live here.

172
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,820
The scene only has layer one turned on and I want at least these four layers turned on.

173
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,060
In fact everything wouldn't be a bad idea unless I had things hidden of course.

174
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,000
So let's go ahead once more and this time ungless Swap the mauvais just so it's nice and quick.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm going to have a friend 20 frame animation I will swap them over at Frane.

176
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:06,240
HENN a case of frame 10 would get a key in they exclude it should still starts excellence.

177
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,020
The VAT's goes all the way to here.

178
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,660
Okay so initially we want to exclude the broken one which is on layer 2 which is fine.

179
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,300
And then we want to exclude Layer 1 that's key that in some two and then one perfect.

180
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,380
So now when we go ahead and I render the animation everything should be there.

181
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,990
Course this is taking a lot longer to surrender now because we've got a glass shader in there rather

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,250
than diffuse.

183
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,920
So I'm glad I did cut the frames down even though now it's going to take a bit longer but we'll see

184
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,450
when we play the animation back in a few moments.

185
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,460
The difference it makes.

186
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,400
Okay so here we go we're just finishing off the final frame.

187
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,060
It's only 20 frames in total and I can go to render and playback the rendered animation just to see

188
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,890
what it looks like and we can see there it's flicking between the two quite rapidly because there's

189
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,200
less than the second between them.

190
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,690
But we get to see the difference.

191
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:09,480
Now one this nice clean one at the very beginning is how it would look if you were trying to have just

192
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,020
as a basic glass cube and then we've got this horrible artefacts one where it's actually broken.

193
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:22,590
So you can see the difference there that it would make if you were rendering an object in such a way

194
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,390
whether it's cracked or.

195
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,820
Well mainly if it's cracked and this is also a great example if you just need to swap something out.

196
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,490
So say you're going to transmute between two things instantly lap top away you go.

197
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,440
Well you can do that using this technique as well.

198
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,650
Just remember you've only got so many layers to work with.

199
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,650
So use them sparingly but use them intelligently as well.

200
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,390
And remember you can always set up scenes if you were doing a full blown animation even if it was just

201
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,650
a short time.

202
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,610
Each scene would be seconds long.

203
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:02,380
You would not try and cram everything into one scene you'd generate a new scene to do that.

204
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,110
Okay.

205
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,590
Brilliant.

206
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,980
How are you guys getting on.

207
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,320
Can you think of some other uses for this.

208
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,730
I'd love to hear your ideas.

209
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,100
Over on the forum.

210
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,280
So join us for an end of TV and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
