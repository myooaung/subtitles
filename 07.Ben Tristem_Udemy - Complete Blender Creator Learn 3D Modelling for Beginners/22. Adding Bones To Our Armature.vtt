00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.830
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we're going to add a second bone and we're going to

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.830
discover some of the pitfalls that you may run across when you try and do some parenting because ultimately

3
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.300
we need to tell blender that this part of our lower arm is being controlled by this top bone and the

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.090
stem is going to be controlled by the lower bone.

5
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.430
However when we parent them together you'll see some odd things happen and also how to avoid them OK.

6
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.500
So the first thing I want to cover is adding multiple bones to one armature.

7
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.230
So that's the first thing to note here that we are only going to have one armature.

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.270
So let's go ahead and just create the armature that we'd have normally just one bone there.

9
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.990
Now if we go and add another armature that's completely separate and we don't want to do that.

10
00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.680
What we want to do is have one armature per thing that we're moving around as if it had its own skeleton.

11
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.610
If we go into edit mode we then get the option to add additional bones and there's two major ways of

12
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.240
doing this.

13
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.800
We can extend what's already here or we can add a brand new bone in this particular section there's

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.280
gonna be no need to add an individual bone but you can go up to add and you can see a shift and a will

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.350
actually add that single bone.

16
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.140
So shift them A and you've got an additional bone.

17
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.380
The question is Where is it.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.900
Where's it gone.

19
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.420
Well we select this one just move it out the way there it is it has it in a way.

20
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.320
So what we can do.

21
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.400
I'm going to look around to an awful graphic perspective it gives us a much better control about laying

22
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.150
out a certain skeleton.

23
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.380
We can either press the E key which essentially extrude a new bone which is pretty awesome.

24
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.630
We can also extrude bones further back along a chain.

25
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.900
And that's important.

26
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.320
If you're making an animal or something along those lines of course the leg.

27
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.970
Like your arms are connected to the shoulders which is connected to your chest or torso and all joins

28
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.420
together in one place.

29
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.780
So this is like two little arms dangling out there.

30
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.040
And if I were to grab this one and extrude backwards we appear to have legs going the other way.

31
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.420
So one of the important things to remember is that you must have a decent flow along your model and

32
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.300
it usually in the case of a human or an animal go down to the hips or somewhere like that for our lamp

33
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.410
though it's going to start from the base.

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.230
So I'm going to select this individual bone smack bang in the middle press El to select all of the ones

35
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.030
are linked.

36
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.990
Notice that it doesn't automatically select the other two in t press El.

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.220
A couple more times.

38
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.460
So it selected one of the chains of bones first and then the next one and then the one afterwards.

39
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.990
I want to get rid of that.

40
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.050
So the other way that you can extend the bone is whilst you've got it selected is press control and

41
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.040
right click.

42
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.070
Now if you just keep right clicking You can add more and more bones.

43
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830
So that's a very quick way of adding a skeleton as well.

44
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.760
You may have noticed at the very bottom of the screen when I press control the shortcuts all changed.

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.800
So at the moment while my while my mouse cursor is over the 3D view we've got select box select rotate

46
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.900
view and arm which context menu.

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.540
However if I go ahead and press the control key we can see that right click it becomes a click extrude

48
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.510
which is really really useful.

49
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.160
Occasionally you may have to press control again.

50
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.110
I did have a little issue earlier where for some reason just holding down control didn't work I had

51
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.260
to repress control as I went.

52
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.810
Now one thing to bear in mind here is as you're creating these bones they are just being assigned different

53
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.620
names.

54
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.940
Now the bones name is separate to the armature name so we've got the armature here.

55
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.170
But if we scroll down and we go to the green bone as it were at the bottom here we get bone 10 and this

56
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.690
one here be eleven 12 etc. and this one is probably bone 0 0 1.

57
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.990
So that's something to watch out for that you can create a ton of bones and not really know what they

58
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.550
linked to.

59
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.980
And it's important to give them a name.

60
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.230
And what I would advise is that if we had let's say a series of objects here let's let's do that.

61
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.810
Let's go ahead and add in a cube just here scaled it down slightly and I'm just going to duplicate this

62
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.400
for several points.

63
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.940
Now if I were making bones to match here I would make sure that this bone the first bone there.

64
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.400
Let's go into edit mode because we all need to do that.

65
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.830
This bone here had the same name as the object it was going to control.

66
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.760
So in this case this would be cube.

67
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.630
And that gives us a great insight in how the skeleton affects the mesh that it's controlling.

68
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.760
If you didn't do that and just named it something random it can be incredibly hard later on to control

69
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.520
and there's something that we'll look at later on called The armature modifier which is reliant on the

70
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.070
names matching and if we get that right from the word go then we're not going to be trying to correct

71
00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:03.530
things later on okay so your challenge at another bone to a lamp and then name the bones you may or

72
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.970
may not have already done this.

73
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.430
If you have great I sometimes gallop ahead and completely forget to do things I've told you guys to

74
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.610
do.

75
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.060
If you do ever catch me doing that slap on my wrists but I usually do spot it eventually.

76
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.490
Now position the bones tail in line with the top of the lower arms as you're adding them in.

77
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.690
You may even have to adjust the original stem bone from where we placed it previously when we started

78
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.410
adding more to the bottom of the lamp.

79
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.460
And finally I'd like to parent the bones to the stem and the lower arm.

80
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.350
Now you may discover an issue when you start doing this parenting you may end up with your mesh object

81
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.700
or mesh objects coming off in different directions.

82
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.920
If that does happen.

83
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.650
See if you can figure out what's going on.

84
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.050
And would dive into a bit more details in the following upcoming lecture pause video now and give that

85
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.320
a go

86
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.390
okay.

87
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.450
Everybody welcome back.

88
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.380
Let's go ahead now and hop on over in splendour adult bone and parents everything together OK.

89
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.690
So let's get rid of our funky snake there.

90
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.900
Now I I want a safer.

91
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.290
So this is where we left off before lamps looking pretty good.

92
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.350
I'm going to turn my overlays back on I can see straight away that this bone at the bottom is not going

93
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.120
to be tall enough.

94
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.700
So that's the first thing I'm going to do I'm gonna whiz round to the side view the rights or the graphic.

95
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.920
Once I'm there let's go ahead.

96
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.720
See if I can select my bone go into edit mode.

97
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.090
Grab this top bit g z.

98
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.210
Now the first set is the wrong one that's preset again.

99
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.220
Lift it up and I don't have to be terribly precise at this point.

100
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.610
I'm going to press the E key to just extrude my hands although already over that part of the keyboard

101
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.850
and put it roughly in the right place.

102
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.680
The next thing I'm going to go through is I'm going to go to the boat menu.

103
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.570
This is called Bones 001 I'm going to make sure the whole thing's selected and I'm going to call this

104
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.590
pool.

105
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.070
Let's make sure it matches exactly what we've got up here.

106
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.900
So we've got the lower arm mirror.

107
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.520
That's that's okay.

108
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.730
Where have I hidden my mesh objects.

109
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.490
Right let's go ahead and select it.

110
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:12.280
I've called it lower arm and it's hidden under this lamp stem lower the parenting we were doing before.

111
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.850
So this is called lower arm.

112
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.040
I'm going to go ahead and copy that dive back to this balloon and call it lower arm.

113
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.870
Brilliant.

114
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.650
Let's see the same with this one it's just called bone.

115
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.040
This is gonna be lump stem so hopefully I'll be able to copy yes and paste it straight in.

116
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.160
So that's a great way of moving from one area to the other.

117
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.350
So these are definitely named how we want them to.

118
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.870
Let's go ahead now and go back to object mode so we can select individual objects and give the cell

119
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.510
at the upper arm this top bone.

120
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:49.760
Now this is how it can be quite confusing because when you do this the whole armature highlights but

121
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:56.090
because we selected this bone when we go ahead go control and P to parents to the bone that's important

122
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.150
not just to the objects to the bone it will go to place.

123
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.500
Okay.

124
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.460
Let's go ahead.

125
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.770
Select this one hold down shift select the bone underneath.

126
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.220
Always good so far.

127
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.030
Go control and pay.

128
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.420
Yeah.

129
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.810
And bone eek.

130
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.260
What's happened there.

131
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.960
Mm hmm.

132
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:20.040
Well if anything like this happens that means that transforms have switched around.

133
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.780
Now if you remember we constructed the lamp over here or suddenly I did.

134
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.790
And you may find that if you are following along exactly you may have this problem and this has to do

135
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.400
with transforms if I undo that last parenting and go to the sidebar property is going to click on the

136
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.640
item tab and select that lowest them.

137
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.790
Now it's got a load a real world location of 2 6 1.

138
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.420
Okay.

139
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.710
Well why is it in the center of the scene.

140
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:52.660
Well the lamp stem is parents of the lamp so there's a couple of things we can do here we can uncouple

141
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.990
that parenting which would solve this particular issue.

142
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.410
So I'm going to select that go Old Tom pay.

143
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.680
And when I clear the parents.

144
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.440
So it used to have a parent were going to clear it.

145
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.340
We're going to clear and keep the transformation.

146
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.950
If I didn't clear the transformation it would pop over to here it would be a similar problem as we had

147
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.500
before.

148
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.680
But of course then you could go up to the top here and type in 0 and it would come back clear and a

149
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.870
transformation just does that for us.

150
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.700
Okay.

151
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.010
So that is something to watch out for.

152
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.790
Now when I go ahead and select that followed by the bone underneath go control them pay parents it to

153
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.410
the bone.

154
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.490
We don't have it hopping around everywhere and I can also do the same to this base I'm going to select

155
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.630
the base and this bone and parents to the bone as well.

156
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.970
That's important because as we're moving things later on and we can check that.

157
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:43.980
Okay.

158
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.790
Let's go ahead and move this around.

159
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.270
Excellent.

160
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.690
Everything's moving as we'd expect so apart from that empty.

161
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.380
So we need apparently empty to something for the moment.

162
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.970
I'm going to parent it to this bottom bone as well but we may find later on when we're moving things

163
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.150
around that we may need to dig it and point it somewhere else.

164
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.450
Now the whole lamp moves and rotates as it should do and everything.

165
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:11.220
Now parents are the armature rather than to each other and that's the really important thing here.

166
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:17.080
If you've got the armature controlling movement that's the skeleton you want everything all of the parts

167
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.650
of your model to hang from that skeleton not have things hanging off of each other and then hoping that

168
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.690
nothing crazy happens when you animate later on.

169
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.300
Okay.

170
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.210
So there we go.

171
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.810
That's it for this lecture.

172
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.430
Did you come across any particular issues when it came to bits starting everywhere.

173
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.390
If he did let us know in the discussions.

174
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.810
Share your work over in the discussions including how you solved it.

175
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:46.680
If you happen to have done that yet and we'll talk more about these transforms in the next lecture.
