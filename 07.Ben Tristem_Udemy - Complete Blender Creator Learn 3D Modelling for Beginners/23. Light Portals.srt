00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:08,700
Welcome to light portals in this video you will learn how to use light portals understand the limitations

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,720
of their use see that they can dramatically increase quality.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,240
Given a fixed number of samples and see they're especially useful for indoor environments little by

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,220
environmental lighting.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,590
So to talk about portals we need to talk first about cycles and how the lighting works.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,960
Light rays are fired out from the camera.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,640
The active camera until they hit a light source.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,240
Now this sounds a bit counterintuitive in to you imagine well that light source could be projecting

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,630
light in any direction and to make sure we don't waste time.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,020
The Rays are fired from the camera so that we are capturing the light that only the camera can see.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,720
With the lamp blender knows where the light sources so only fires rays that will eventually hit the

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,550
light source.

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,570
And this often ends up with a nice clean image.

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:15,350
Now with a missive materials blender doesn't know where the light sources so when the camera fires those

15
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,560
rays some of them never reach a light source.

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,460
And this introduces more noise.

17
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:30,020
With environmental lighting when you've got a sky map in the scene or an HDR high dynamic range environmental

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:38,120
or lighting in an interior with only windows letting light in the Rays bounce around a lot and only

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,420
a few actually manage to go out the window and reach the light source.

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,710
This introduces a lot of noise in the final image.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,150
Given a certain number of samples.

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,040
So how do portal's help.

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,800
Well portal's helped by telling Glendale where to aim those rays.

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,690
This produces much less noise in the final image.

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,870
However they do have some limitations.

26
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:12,460
Poor tools are a cycle's lighting feature which means that they won't work externally to blend and they

27
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,230
won't work with the blender internal rendering engine.

28
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,650
They increase light calculation time.

29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,520
However that's offset by the fact you don't have to render as quickly so they produce much less noisy

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,770
environments.

31
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,560
Poor tools only work with environmental lights using them otherwise can reduce quality.

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,850
And they have little impact.

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,270
If you put something in the way so that's going to have a look at couple of examples before we hop into

34
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,040
a blender.

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,840
So this is in a missive plane that's placed outside that hole in the in this box and there is no portal.

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,790
If we put a portal in the way when it actually looks worse and noisier.

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,680
So that's an example of it not working.

38
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,490
And in fact making things worse with a missive plane that's outside.

39
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,290
So what happens if we bring the missing plane.

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,400
So it's faking being the window.

41
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,060
Well this is with no port that's a relatively clean image.

42
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,960
In the missive plane acting as the window and a portal there to guide it.

43
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,940
Well you see it actually makes it worse again.

44
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,470
Now let's have a look at an environmental light.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,160
So at this point the environment is just white.

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:38,250
To be consistent and there is no portal you can see that that image is very hard to even work out what

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,820
that is.

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,100
Is it a cube or is it just a bunch of noise.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,250
Well with a poor tool it makes a phenomenal amount of difference.

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,310
And just for example.

51
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:57,680
This is a sunlamp placed outside with a thousand samples and you can see yes the lighting slightly differently

52
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,000
because it's not an environmental light.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,520
It's a point light source in the sky being a sunlamp it's still noisier than the previous one.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,210
So some examples of when you stick something in the way are we're going to see some familiar faces here.

55
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,820
A There's some bunnies lamps and bowling pins and a chess set.

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,220
So we have four different scenes here that we're going to run through and show you the difference.

57
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,120
The top two are with and without a portal and so are the bottom two.

58
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,760
However the bottom two have a glass window in the way so let's go have a look at these in a bit more

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,570
detail.

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,940
So this is the scene rendered with a portal.

61
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,150
So you can see it's only 30 samples in this case so there is still noise in the scene.

62
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,200
It took about 30 odd minutes to do this particular scene render on a g.t. X 980 just to give you an

63
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,160
idea of times taken even that 30 samples because there's there's a lot of complexity in this particular

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,980
scene.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,900
Now if we see it without support or you can see that it's much more noisy especially in the darker areas

66
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,610
of the scene.

67
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,950
Now it changes slightly when you go and put a window in.

68
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,730
So at the moment that's just a hole in the wall.

69
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,180
Go and put a window in.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,970
Well much less light actually enters the room because it's bouncing in and out of that glass.

71
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,920
So less light comes in.

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,610
So one of these has a portal and this next one does not.

73
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,380
What did you see the difference there.

74
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,520
This is before.

75
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,580
And this is after.

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,660
Well I struggle to see the difference there.

77
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,290
And that just goes to show that if you stick something in the way like glass that you think well actually

78
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,330
if it's an environmental light in the air yet of the glass it will help guide the Rays.

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,310
No one fortunately certainly at the moment that doesn't help at all.

80
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,500
In fact in this case it seems to make no difference whatsoever.

81
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,290
So let's now hop on over into blender and play with some light portal's.

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,300
So let's start off with a basic cube in our scene so I've opened up a brand new blender file and will

83
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,080
take it from there.

84
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,740
The first thing this I'm going to do is remove the lamp from this basic scene because it's no longer

85
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,100
required.

86
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,880
And we're going to add a different light source.

87
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,590
So we're going to go to the world propertys.

88
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,930
We're going to change the colour of the world to a white and just go ahead hit render and see how that

89
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,750
comes out.

90
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,680
That's exactly what I'll be expecting for it to happen.

91
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,220
This cube is uniformly lit from the outside so we can't see any details because it's white all around.

92
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,110
Perfect.

93
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,150
So let's hop back into the 3-d view and let's make this cube much much much bigger.

94
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,700
So hop into edit mode and scale it up.

95
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,320
By let's make it 10 times bigger.

96
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,410
And then we can exist in it.

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,980
And I'm going to lift it up by 10 on the z axis 2 and that should place on the ground.

98
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,550
Excellent so we can easily be inside here and have a switch to the camera mode.

99
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm inside it so you've created a fake building very quickly.

100
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,130
The next thing I'm going to do is subdivide.

101
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,440
This keeps on going to come out of a camera mode.

102
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm going to subdivide this cube a couple of times so I'm gonna use the tool shelf here.

103
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,820
I want it so I can just remove some of these faces.

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:41,070
So I'm going to go ahead here and remove a zigzag pattern going down.

105
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,110
And for those too there why not.

106
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,670
In fact let's just remove those.

107
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,170
They're perfect.

108
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,940
So let's delete.

109
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,860
I want the faces gone sir.

110
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,020
There we go.

111
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,390
There we go.

112
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,840
There is our funky window in the wall.

113
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:01,090
And the final thing we're going to do before we actually start playing inside is to add a modifier which

114
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,640
is a solidify which will make the walls for us and that's under generate solidify.

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,650
And I'm going to increase the thickness to point one.

116
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,670
Now one of the things you have to watch out here for is if you look through that there's a bit of a

117
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,050
curve going on.

118
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:24,460
And if we have a look in fact this is a very thick cube some was going to make it maybe point four so

119
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,900
we can see more what's happening now as it's moving around the edge.

120
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,790
Can we see an wireframe mode.

121
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,370
More detail.

122
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,350
It's not exaggerating it that much.

123
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,740
But basically if you take even thickness It'll make sure that the thickness is applied evenly throughout

124
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,480
the model.

125
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,730
So let's hop inside and I'm going to move my camera about so I can see more.

126
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,190
I'm going to use the walkaround feature.

127
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,620
So we've got our window there.

128
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,270
This is quite a large room.

129
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,150
And I think I've just gone through so I'm just going to come out of wireframe and do that again.

130
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,210
So I know when I pass there and I might want a wide angle lens in fact I think I do in this case.

131
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:15,130
So I'm going to go ahead and change the camera properties so it has a wider focal length.

132
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm going to go for 80.

133
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,740
There we go see much more.

134
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,850
So let's see how this looks at the moment.

135
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,060
There we go.

136
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,740
We have quite a noisy scene now on the render results.

137
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,660
Down at the bottom.

138
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:34,870
I'm going to change your it's slot one to slot two so we can compare in a few moments and I'm just going

139
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,720
to make this a bit larger so we can compare them much more closely.

140
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
So let's now hop to the 3-d view.

141
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:51,580
Now in order to add a now in order to go ahead and add in a portable is actually a type of lamp some

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,290
going to add the portal here and I'm going to cover all four windows with it if they're close together

143
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,210
you can cover them all together.

144
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,310
Obviously the number of portals if you have too many of them may add up and cost you more in calculation

145
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,790
time.

146
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,950
But in this case we can just cover this middle square because it doesn't really matter compared to the

147
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,310
other ones around it.

148
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,670
We could of course add four portals.

149
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:23,620
So let's go in add a lamp of type area and in the properties for the lamp we can change it so says portal.

150
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,350
That's all we need to do in terms of setting that up.

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,880
Apart from we need to rotate it round so I'm going to rotate it's on the y axes and ungless looking

152
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,030
down there so it's going to be why by 90.

153
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,350
You see that dotted line that white dotted line now orange coming out of it.

154
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,070
That's the direction it wants to face.

155
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,710
The light is going that way.

156
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,630
So the final thing here is to do the size.

157
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,370
Now there's an option over in the properties to have it square or rectangular.

158
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,610
So you can have it different proportions under the leave it set square since it's there.

159
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,980
And I'm going to just go up and up and up.

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,030
I think this is end up going to be 10 No 12.

161
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,470
There we go.

162
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,980
So 12 covers the entire thing I'm going to add a little extra.

163
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,160
And now when we go back inside the building and hit render we should end up with a much less noisy image.

164
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,030
Now I've got the default settings here so that's 10 samples.

165
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,580
And the difference between that and.

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,020
Okay that was a great example I didn't switch to slot before hitting render cilice just render it without.

167
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,480
So there we go.

168
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,980
This one is much noise zarine slot to them with out.

169
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:45,720
Now one thing that should be noted at this point is that the rough render did take just over three seconds

170
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,530
and the other one was I think it was five and a bit seconds.

171
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,350
Well we can quickly go and check it would go to slot 1.

172
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm going to turn my area lamp back on and then render again.

173
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,120
Now this isn't these aren't optimal squares for this particular render they need to be made a bit smaller.

174
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,620
So there you go.

175
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,830
Five point six so it's taking a bit longer.

176
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,740
But let's see if doubling the sample counts on slot three makes a difference because.

177
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,580
I don't think it.

178
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:22,420
Well I think that's the one at stenn samples with a portal is going to be much cleaner than 20 samples

179
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,070
with out a portal.

180
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,660
So it should take at least twice as long to do this is the one with the portal that 20 samples.

181
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,290
And let's go to slot four and do the one with out the portal just to demonstrate that it's still going

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,680
to be noisy.

183
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,080
And we can see straightaway it's going to be much more noisy.

184
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,040
So let's just have a look through these then so we've got slot 1 which was 10 samples with a portal

185
00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:00,030
slot who is 10 samples without a portal slot three is 20 samples with a portal and slot four is 20 samples

186
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,230
without a portal.

187
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,290
So we compare the one that's taken nearly the same time as the first one with a portal.

188
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,840
You can see it's still much much cleaner.

189
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,440
So now we understand about portals and how to put them into a scene.

190
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I've got a small challenge for you.

191
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,290
I would like you to add some portals to your interior.

192
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,450
So add in environment texture or indeed just adjust the world surface like I did in the example hide

193
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,340
or remove any other light sources.

194
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,170
So it's a fair comparison.

195
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,830
Render your interior at about 20 sample.

196
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:48,570
Render your teria about 20 samples first for a baseline ad like poor tools to those windows and then

197
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,450
render the scene and share in the discussions the difference it's made.

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,730
Pause video now and give that a go.

199
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,350
Okay guys welcome back.

200
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,500
Let's go add some portal's to our interior.

201
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,450
So I've made sure my camera is in roughly the right position.

202
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,150
I managed to make it a little bit wonky and the first thing that I'm going to do is do the render.

203
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,290
But make sure the render settings are fair.

204
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,960
So let's just check the number of samples.

205
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,850
The number of samples is 50.

206
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,280
Let's drop it down to 20.

207
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,340
Go ahead and hit render the moment that's done.

208
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,400
Oh I haven't added my environmental lighting yet or remove the other lights from the scene.

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,410
I'll be back in a few moments.

210
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,220
There we go.

211
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,830
I've added an environmental light.

212
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,680
It's just going to be a white one for the moment and now I've added that I just can see how that renders

213
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,780
out looking pretty noisy at the moment.

214
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,500
Be interesting to see whether it makes a difference.

215
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,830
Once we add light portals and the reason why I say that is great cause there's a lot of gaps in the

216
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,050
in the in the building at the moment which may cause or may not cause some problems.

217
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,830
But there we go that's gives us a nice base level.

218
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,220
Now I'm going to go ahead and add portals to the rest of these.

219
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,770
Now I've got two choices.

220
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:13,260
In this particular case I could go in and light portals to the original mesh and then re append them

221
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,620
into the scene.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,940
Or I could stretch one along this entire wall for instance and then the rest groups too.

223
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:28,800
In this case I am going to do that rather than modelling modifying the original having to reimport and

224
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,780
change over these bits.

225
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,360
Not going to do that at the moment.

226
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,100
And there we go so I've added several portals into my scene.

227
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,630
I think that's for future iterations I probably will make the poor tour with in the models themselves

228
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:53,740
so that I never have to redo this but for the sake of this particular model I've gone ahead and done

229
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,180
it anyway and I'm just going to go ahead and render the image so I've overwritten my original.

230
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,400
Which is pretty silly.

231
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,450
Okay so straightaway I can see that this particular render I inadvertently overwrote my first one for

232
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,440
comparison.

233
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,900
This one's taking as significantly less time.

234
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,600
I can see straight away it's quick of the rendering with the light portal took one minute twenty four.

235
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,120
And this was already on 24 seconds because it's counting up and it's an I don't know about the quality

236
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,330
though.

237
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,930
This is this is going to be one of these things where I am not sure whether the big holes in here are

238
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,410
letting enough light in any way that we won't see much of a difference.

239
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,470
But now it's rendered.

240
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,200
Let's go and have a look.

241
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,050
I'm going to make this as big as I possibly can for comparison so I look through the doorway here.

242
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,530
And this is with portals without.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,100
With Okay I think in this particular instance portals aren't going to help us until I've got this roof

244
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,830
sealed in.

245
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,330
I can do a few checks to see whether that is the case but otherwise I think that's just not letting

246
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,910
or is letting enough light in already.

247
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:12,270
The camera is finding a light source and that's especially true at the moment because the camera is

248
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,730
facing these big gaps.

249
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,700
There is a lot of light that will naturally just bounce off of these floor bits etc and automatically

250
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,620
end up hitting this sky box in the background.

251
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,440
That's something to bear in mind the areas perhaps where that's not the case where it doesn't have a

252
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,750
great big hole in the wall may be slightly different so I'm going to move the camera down and just check

253
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,780
that hypothesis as well.

254
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:44,350
So I'm just rendering here with out at the light portals and then I'll enable them and compare.

255
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,070
And here's the final render with those light portals turned and was is finished.

256
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,620
I'll compare the two and see if my hypothesis that facing a giant light source any weighed with the

257
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,460
camera is going to mitigate most of the benefits of a light portal.

258
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:09,250
Okay so looking at the two I can quite comfortably say at this point I think enough light is entering

259
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,680
our scene that we don't particularly have a problem lighting it.

260
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,560
So with that in mind I'm glad any more light portals at the moment.

261
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,060
In my particular scene I think if I didn't have quite so many windows we might be able to see more of

262
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:32,350
an affect of this whole building didn't have this great big open archway at the top as well.

263
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,290
So I will keep the portals in mind for my particular model if it starts to get noisy I can start adding

264
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,500
them in later and I will start adding them into the actual pieces themselves.

265
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,470
So when I link for more highly detailed models in it will bring across the portal information as well.

266
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,300
I'd love to see your models did using light portals of make your scene less noisy.

267
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,600
Did it make no difference at all like it has done mine here.

268
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,850
Please post in discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
