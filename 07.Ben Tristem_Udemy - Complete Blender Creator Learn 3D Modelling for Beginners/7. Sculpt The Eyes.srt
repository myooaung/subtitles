1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,230
In this video we're gonna be adding some eyes and sculpting the area around the eyes.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,230
I'm gonna break down in a fit of sobbing every now and again realizing how old and how good I look.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,480
But for now let's jump in and talk about modeling the eye area.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
Okay back to my starting point just a quick note I've renamed a couple of things in my same collection

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,390
removed the camera and removed the light.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,940
I just tidied it up a little bit and just done a little bit of tweaking off camera to the bridge of

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,030
my nose.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,730
Right now we want to add some eyes.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,880
First thing we want to do is jump over into object mode.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,230
I'm going to shift a to add a mesh which I will make a u v sphere on a side view move it forward a bit

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,460
so we can see what's going on.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,320
I'm going to rotate this eyeballs so I think it's X 90 we'll see how that looks.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,550
My goal here is to have the sickly Iris bit in the middle that looks like job done.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,390
I will get straight on front view s to scale.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,460
Let's scale it down down down down okay about yay big hoping a wireframe mode here so I can see exactly

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,330
what's going on.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,650
Now one of the things you want to look for is that you can make five eyeballs from left side to right

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,030
side so the moment we're getting 1 2 3 which indicates that it's too big so far but generally in the

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,660
middle.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,010
Hit scale again scale it down.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,240
Let's see if we reckon this is going to be and 2 that's getting in this the right ish kind of ballpark

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,610
is going to duplicate do this little test and test again.

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,970
There we go.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,320
It looks like we've got five eyeballs.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,490
Now obviously I'd put the other one two over there.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,140
When I delete these ones that I just made that was just for illustrative purposes out of wireframe mode.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
Onto the side bring it forward so I can see how it's looking.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,510
Where we're going sphere.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,560
Let's rename it AI ball while we're here.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,940
I call Rick learn how to type.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,340
Which I bowl forward.

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,360
I want to bring it back.

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,640
So a little bit of his poking through this is wrong in a scrolling in a whole bunch.

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,490
On my side image.

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,950
Let's have a look to see what we want to hear.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,030
There's just a little bit of the eyeball poking through look at those luscious eyelashes and let's see

37
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,410
in our eyelids.

38
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,980
We're gonna push this back a little bit.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,170
Don't need to finesse it too much just yet because what we will be doing is pushing and prodding the

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,150
geometry around our eyeballs.

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,990
I found in the past that I put the eyeballs a little bit too far out so I'll move it in a little bit.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,740
Don't look too beady eyed doing now.

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,640
We want to have a look like this and good lord look at all those wrinkles.

44
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,110
Okay.

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,730
We have very harsh sun in Australia.

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,450
So not looking too bad for a 25 year old.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,490
But you know the sun puts a little bit of damage and gives a little bit wrinkles but deliberately chosen

48
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,830
this so that we can work with our crease tool.

49
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,580
What a joy that's gonna be to make all Rick's wrinkles.

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,690
Got one eyeball let's go to our modifiers add modifier we will do what we will mirror this exactly.

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm going to find the object to click on so here mirror object when I click on the eyedropper.

52
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,540
Click on the head.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,870
Now the head is being used as our way that we're mirroring.

54
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,950
Let's click on one of the eyeballs or the eyeball.

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,170
I guess it is do you do.

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,060
Yep looks good it is being successfully mirrored.

57
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm looking at the middle of the eyeball here not the outline because the outline is going to be a little

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,630
bit misleading Oh look at that it's Gandhi.

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,530
These little Gandhi eye glasses.

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,050
Awesome.

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,460
Okay.

62
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,430
Now let's jump onto click back on head into sculpt mode.

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,320
We'll get rid of a little bit of this geometry and here and we're using the draw tool quite a lot so

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,590
let's use the draw tool now just to can control and to eat away some of this geometry Well we're actually

65
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,940
pushing it back when I'm eating it a while we push back push it back push it back.

66
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,380
The idea is to get enough of the eyeballs so that in a moment we're going to paint over the top of the

67
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,200
eyeball and then we're going to carve out an eyelid.

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,510
I know that all sounds a little bit weird and gross.

69
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,660
Now at this point I'm going to give you a challenge so you know what on earth is supposed to be doing

70
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,650
you've probably figured out X I know you're a smart individual that way sculpting the eyes.

71
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,670
I would like you to add a sphere as I just did rotate it so that we had the Irish Sea looking thing

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,000
at this at the front position and mirror it scope over the eyeballs then remove a strip to create the

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,340
eyelids.

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,750
I'll do that in just a moment so you can follow along with me or you can wait until I'm done and then

75
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,030
go through at your own pace and we're going to add creases more creases if you're an old look and do

76
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,000
like me to get your medium level of detail so I don't want you to get to the pristine done completely

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,410
done finished done just get it's a pretty good detail so that's that's your challenge and that's what

78
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm going to be going through for the remainder of this video.

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:32,370
Next step is for us to as I say before is to say draw over the eyeballs completely so with your draw

80
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,040
tool just draw over the draw.

81
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,970
There we go trying to get it fairly uniform.

82
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,070
Now I'm going to hold down control probably make my brush Lou what's wrong brush but make my brush a

83
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,250
little bit smaller and holding down control.

84
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm going to dig out the eyeball.

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,450
Okay.

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,980
Our goal is to create the eyelids.

87
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
Let's even get both eyelids in shot at once.

88
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,050
I'm just gonna hop back into object mode.

89
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,160
Change around the positioning of my images a little bit.

90
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,650
So the two eyes are a bit closer together because we're focusing just on the eyes and as we go you can

91
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,120
do a little bit tightening up to the nose area the eyebrows area that's important it's all part of the

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,930
island with the cheekbones but resist the temptation to go through the mouth and the nose and the ease

93
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,640
with focusing just on the eyes at the moment.

94
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,180
So I've dug out a little bit of my eye now you can see we've got more of a almond shape it pinches down

95
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,670
to the end so I want to try to recreate that effect first of all I need to get some more detail so I'm

96
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:41,290
going to fall back into sculpt mode while clicking on the head sculpt mode now top Tab I'm going to

97
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:48,260
click on dyeing Topo the detail I have in here as before I'm going to make this constant detail and

98
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,370
increase it for now run about twenty five so getting a lot of detail is tons detail around the eyes

99
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,460
so you want to keep adjusting that as works for you.

100
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,880
So I'm going to be just digging in through here.

101
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:05,120
As I said before I'm mostly using the draw tool and then I'll be using the crease quite a bit and feel

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,910
free to skip ahead or fast forward the video or go at whatever pace is appropriate for you.

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,180
I'm going to be talking through my movements here and going at a reasonably slow pace I tend to do this

104
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,680
the eyes pretty slowly partially because I'm a bit slow partially because this is the tough bit.

105
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,850
If you want to watch them follow along as I'm chatting gathering them please do.

106
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,890
Otherwise feel free to skip this bit and just work on yours at your own leisure.

107
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,020
So my goal here is to flatten out the eyelids.

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,240
Don't worry about the kind of the weird geometry will smooth that out later on we'll get some more detail

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,490
in there later on what is getting the shape as we've done before pushing and pulling and getting enough

110
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,340
kind of padding in there for now for the eyelids.

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,960
The other is a little bit fatter than you think.

112
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,290
A lot of people forget to put a nice big chunky eyelids because they're so focused on the eyebrows perhaps

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,300
but for me look at those bags under the eyes.

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,730
Good lord that's what happens when you have children my friends

115
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,250
okay.

116
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,690
Detail detail looks like whatever's going on here is not too bad of a little bit of a bump.

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,830
That's what happens when you play football as a child and you get you know smacked a few too many times.

118
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,570
I'm just gonna add a little bit more football smack around onto the nose there.

119
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,290
There we go.

120
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,570
Lovely handsome.

121
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,540
I'm just using shift every now and again just to smooth things out.

122
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,410
Being careful that I'm not overly smoothing as I've done previously.

123
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,110
Make sure that our smooth level is.

124
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,130
Yeah that's not too bad.

125
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,960
Point three.

126
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,350
I don't like when I smooth in it it's too aggressive with the smoothing and get a little bit of crease

127
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,620
to the head start.

128
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh goodness me this is going to be painful.

129
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,640
If you hear me sobbing as I'm using the crease tool then they worry everything's okay.

130
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,050
It's all a natural part of ageing okay.

131
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,850
A little bit of Crow's feet in there.

132
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,790
Let's just focus on this right eye for now right.

133
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,360
Okay.

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,120
Oh that's my left eye I should say are in the right side of my screen.

135
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,540
There's little not just there.

136
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,520
That's what happens when you pierce your eyebrow.

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,870
Kids don't do that.

138
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,750
That's not the wisest of things to do.

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,710
It's kind of cool for about five minutes but then afterwards you think why did I do that.

140
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,040
I did that so that in some years time I can be doing a blender video and have a little bit of detail

141
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:22,810
on the eyebrow to sculpt an eyebrow ring piercing to remind me of my good choices in my youth.

142
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,140
Okay so I'm putting creases under the eyes and give you a little bit of an ask for random commentary

143
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,570
as well as we go.

144
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,430
Okay.

145
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,740
Looking a little bit more wrinkly now as I said before I really it bugs me a lot that the geometry in

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,800
here isn't quite all that smooth looking yet but that's fine.

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,170
We got to resist the temptation in at the moment we're putting in these macro details.

148
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,210
Let's get a little bit more of the detail in.

149
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,970
You can see there's a you can kind of see a little bit more of the eyeball peeking down into there.

150
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,300
I've got that happening I think.

151
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,970
Not too bad with this crease.

152
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,250
And then we and offer him whatever that thing he's cold down there.

153
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,800
The tea Doctor maybe use that as well once you have kids as well.

154
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Tears of joy.

155
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,700
It is it's turning into Rick's comedy hour isn't it.

156
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,890
OK let's get some more of these crises definition pushing up into the dark rings around the lines.

157
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,030
Yet looking pretty sadly accurate now.

158
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,120
Let's have a look.

159
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,110
This is the photo is not too bad he because you can see the iris the middle the dark part of my eye

160
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,870
I think is roughly the same size as the initial ring around my sphere.

161
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,220
But it's not quite right.

162
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,960
I need to pull my top eyelid down a little bit so I'm gonna grab that we'll see if the grab tools what

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,720
I want here grab tool or this snake hook tool or there is I think is gonna be okay.

164
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,520
Just pull the eyelid down a little bit a little bit.

165
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Now for your image your reference image you're using you might have a totally different look.

166
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,370
You might have the eyes open more or close more or any sort of different way of doing it.

167
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm going to talk you through what I'm seeing in mine but obviously Please follow along with what you

168
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,850
see in yours.

169
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,480
Get the angles right.

170
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,540
So it's important to get the idea going up and then down.

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,700
I've accidentally gone and put in some of the bumps and details that I actually do have in there.

172
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,400
Okay.

173
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,080
As always zoom out check how things are guys progressing pretty quickly actually it's easy to model

174
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,210
a wrinkly old man.

175
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,080
I think he is doing something that's looking a bit smoother.

176
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,800
Well these imperfections is adding to the character the charisma of old Rick Cam going to fit out the

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,710
eyelid a little bit more.

178
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,700
So we have to put in whatever that sort of creases in there.

179
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,260
That's an old man increase as well

180
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,390
okay.

181
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,080
It's mostly going to be me just pushing and pulling things around at the moment if you want to stay

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,910
and hang out together listen to my witty commentary.

183
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,750
Then please do otherwise feel free to fast forward skip the video.

184
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,690
Jump forward to see if you can find a bit that's relevant to the bit you're working on at the moment

185
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,840
while I do my old man crow's feet around the edges here.

186
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,350
Pretty more of this detail starting to look where I want it to be more like at some point you might

187
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:10,450
want to increase your resolution as well say up to 30 or 35 if you're starting to get into these into

188
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,900
the minutiae of these details as I said in my challenge.

189
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,180
We're aiming for medium level of detail not super slickly finished.

190
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,830
We want to get it pretty good.

191
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,760
I want to try to get that extra crease in there I think I will move it skeptical that I can pull it

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,800
off because it's kind of running out of detail a little bit in here but let's give it a shot.

193
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:36,850
So getting that extra eyebrow crease thing now look at the side haven't looked at the side for a little

194
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:36,970
bit.

195
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,520
Make sure that matches

196
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,100
I need to put back this way a little bit more.

197
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,690
That's good snake hook tool just put back a little bit back a little bit.

198
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,100
Okay.

199
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,650
And then back to what I was saying before about those extra creases around the eyelids.

200
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,380
Just still loop still a little bit of smoothing in here.

201
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,040
So we're ready for that detail.

202
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,120
I've got my higher resolution going on back onto crease.

203
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,260
I just increase the power a little bit on crease okay.

204
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,280
I think for me to pull this off I don't have to put in a lot more because it nearly goes up to my eyebrow

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,640
doesn't it.

206
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,390
It's kind of weird double crease action sir.

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,240
I know this is a little bit maybe a little bit more detail a little bit more intimate of Rick's face

208
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,910
than we wanted to go for but let's let's get this.

209
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,110
It's gonna plague me if I don't get this working the way I want it so I'm just gonna add a little bit

210
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,690
more fatness in here.

211
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,930
One thing we could do instead of all this drawing is I could add some clay strips or I could add some

212
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,750
clay which is more of a popping things on top I think that's what I do like I'm going to turn the strength

213
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:58,220
of that bunch down but that has given me a little bit more to play with.

214
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,270
Now we'll see as we crease this we'll see if it gives us the desired effect

215
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,990
read the crease first and then we'll maybe pull some of that geometry from the top to cover the geometry

216
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,650
at the bottom

217
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,050
OK.

218
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,990
How we look and said that's how we're looking in the right ballpark.

219
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,060
Harry Stannard looks down and looks like a wrinkly old man.

220
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,800
Her so I won't spend forever on this.

221
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,960
Honestly a little bit of a not a perfectionist.

222
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,120
That's not the right word I think.

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,780
Perfectionist has a little bit of a negative connotation it says that you you can't leave something

224
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,920
when it's good enough.

225
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,060
That's not what it is I'm more of a an enthusiast.

226
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,810
I'm excited to get it looking like.

227
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,300
Can I can I represent this how I want it to be represented so I tend to continue maybe a little bit

228
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,400
longer than I should on some of these details but that's all part of the fun it's all part of getting

229
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,170
better learning what we're doing here.

230
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,630
But generally my goal is to make it look all kind of wrinkly and a little bit haggard and I think that's

231
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,200
working out as intended so I just do a little bit of a final crease through all this stuff might put

232
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,520
my detail up just a tiny bit more for what we're doing here

233
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,560
because you see we've got that sharp line at the front of the eyelid and then there's a little bit of

234
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,660
a little bit of a landing a little bit of a platform to jump on underneath the eyes.

235
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,410
They're as a game developer joke

236
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,880
maybe open up the eyes a little bit to make me look a little bit more awake and alert while keeping

237
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,390
the general shape of it.

238
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay.

239
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,950
I have one more shot at getting these double eyelids looking like I want them to literally smoothing

240
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,000
just up above their

241
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,740
crease too I think I need to pinch some of this out because I've pushed it all back too far the crease

242
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:22,820
tool is gonna do a good job of retreating the those faces and vertices there but I want to also make

243
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,810
it nice and pronounce

244
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,370
Okay so there's some I'm pretty happy with mine.

245
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,270
Hopefully yours went well.

246
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,230
That looks awkward having high detail in the rest of it's not but in next video we'll put some more

247
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,980
detail into another part of our human head.

248
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,850
So I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
