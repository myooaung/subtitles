00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome to a better camera control in this video.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.140
You use a different way of moving the camera.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.800
See this gives you better control over what the camera is pointing at combined with fly mode for good

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.770
control and learn how to track a target.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.460
So let's go play with the camera and hop on over into a blender.

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.060
So back over in blender here just a quick fly around my model real really quick just to let you know

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.720
I've sorted out these ceiling pieces or at least solidify them for the moment.

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.050
I work on them more later.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.660
I sorted out a whopping great big hole that was in this tower.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.060
And I did I don't think I actually move this place down here because it doesn't look like it's actually

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.270
out of alignment.

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.770
So I think that I've already moved and corrected that.

13
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.350
The only place that I haven't sorted out yet is this hole over here because I'm going to make a specific

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360
roof to cover this area.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.780
I might try and make it out of those primitives that we've already made up and see how that works.

16
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.600
But now more on about Cameron draw in fact what we're about to do not only applies to cameras but you

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.770
can also use it to move other objects with other objects so it's universal in many ways.

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.370
So first of all let's have a look at combining it with fly mode.

19
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.300
So this is very straightforward.

20
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.850
And of course very powerful.

21
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.520
So we've already seen that we can get a particular view very quickly if this is the view that we have

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.410
what we actually want.

23
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.720
We can actually move the camera to that view points straight away without having to that going go and

24
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.120
grab the camera and move it to the appropriate location.

25
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.180
So we're all aware of going to the camera itself go into the properties and locking the camera to the

26
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.590
view and then being able to move it around but we do have to be looking through the camera to do that.

27
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.390
So we press 0 now we're now looking through it and we can reposition the camera like that.

28
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.670
That's absolutely fine.

29
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.030
We can move it in and out.

30
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.620
But as you can see it's quite granular it skips quickly.

31
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.950
So yes you can fiddle about with that for a while moving it here rotating it coming in etc. But eventually

32
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.140
that's going to become quite tiresome.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.920
However if we combine this with the Flymo route we can move to a position that we want just simply by

34
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.650
hitting shift and f.

35
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140
Now we can fly around and go to the new viewpoint that we want.

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.600
We can look in through this window.

37
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.780
Hello everybody.

38
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.400
Where is the manequin areas.

39
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.790
Okay so that's one way we can do it but we've already got a view set up over here so let's just hop

40
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.200
out of there.

41
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.460
Looks like I have moved my view unfortunately.

42
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.150
So let's just sort this out hop back into flying mode real quick zoom back to where we were before to

43
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.370
say we wanted this particular view and we didn't want to faff about with trying to get the camera into

44
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.320
the right position.

45
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.190
We can actually go to the View menu and go to a line view and there's got a series of options here so

46
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.680
we can align view to active so we can look down up left right et cetera.

47
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.980
But one of the very powerful ones in this are let go of control there a line active camera to the view.

48
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.800
So we've got an active camera which is the main one and the one whose viewpoint we will see if we hit

49
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.930
render But we can assign that or line the active camera to the view and we see let's control Oulton

50
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.910
no pants zero if we want to do that and when we click that there we go.

51
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.870
The camera automatically moves to this position.

52
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.200
Now is a course useful to have multiple cameras in the scene.

53
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.350
So you don't have to keep moving one but we'll leave that for a bit.

54
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.750
Now another way that we can actually track something in the scene is either placing an empty or in this

55
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.210
case I'm going to use my mannequin as an example.

56
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.200
I can track that object through the scene and this is very very powerful and very useful.

57
00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.620
Now what we going to be doing is constraining the Cambers movement based upon certain parameters.

58
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.310
So in this case we go to the constrained tab on the properties window and we're going to add an object

59
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.750
constraint.

60
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.130
And there are lots of constraints that we can do and we want under tracking.

61
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.880
We want it to track to a particular object.

62
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.360
And I'm going to select my mannequin here.

63
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.420
0 0 I WANT THAT one.

64
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.720
That's the one that's in the scene.

65
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.540
Now this may look a bit odd at the moment and it.

66
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.380
Well it will look a bit odd because we've not set up the tracking constraints properly.

67
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.530
But typically if you want it to rotate around you're going to want these particular settings you're

68
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.790
going to want it the miner said and why and then where ever we move.

69
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.790
So that's two minors said and the UP IS WHY can be a bit confusing and we'll go through that in more

70
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.050
detail in a moment.

71
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.000
But basically now when we move our mannequin about the camera or automatically tracks.

72
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.430
So if I lock him to the y axis the cameras stay still and tracks in moving down the church.

73
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.550
In fact if I turn off snapping it would be a lot smoother.

74
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.420
There we go.

75
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.390
So there he goes down there and the camera is tracking him.

76
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.770
That's very powerful.

77
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.090
The other thing we can do here is move the camera itself.

78
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.280
So if I go and pick up the camera and move the camera.

79
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.640
So let's go to the camera.

80
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.430
Here it is.

81
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.120
And go ahead and move that.

82
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.460
It's also constrained and looking at the object again whether that's the focal point that you want to

83
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.640
use or anything else so I can pop the camera over here.

84
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.700
And then if I go and grab this mannequin and move it outside there we go.

85
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.700
Still following.

86
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.480
No matter where we decide to put a mannequin.

87
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.100
Very very powerful.

88
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.520
Now let's have a look at the constraints themselves because we can get the viewpoint to follow in many

89
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.080
different ways.

90
00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.540
And the easiest way of visualizing this is to actually track the object when it's in line with it.

91
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.890
And then we can see what's going on.

92
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.350
So I'm going to move the camera itself to my now are not on there.

93
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.640
I'm going to move the camera to zero and zero which is by the entrance way for church.

94
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.500
There we go we're looking at that and I'm just going to move the camera forward a little so it's a little

95
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.460
bit closer.

96
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.860
And then finally I'm also going to move the mannequin So the mannequin airs at X equals zero as well.

97
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.390
So they're in line.

98
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.330
Now let's move out of this view point itself.

99
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.960
Lock camera two of you turn it off so we can ways around and see what's happening from above.

100
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.700
There we go.

101
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.040
So at the moment if we go to the camera itself and look at the constraints if we look into the X axis

102
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.750
we see that it's now looking along the x axis and of course minus X axis looks the other way.

103
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:54.120
So if we go and z looks backwards so that's good if you've got a an object moving forward and you want

104
00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.080
to track it from the other side rather So looking sort of a selfie if you will rather than a tracking

105
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.570
camera following behind.

106
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:10.680
So X looks along the x axis and that's very powerful if you imagine too if one viewpoint was being followed

107
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.900
and perhaps tracking and trying to search for something here in my head an aircraft in flight if you

108
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.990
were flying in formation and you wanted the other plane to control where the camera was going but keep

109
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.150
them relatively close to one another you can do that and of course you can turn down the influence a

110
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:35.020
little here to actually control that with a little more finesse So it's not so spot on.

111
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.700
Now obviously when you move an object too far if the influence isn't one eventually it all disappear

112
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.870
out of frame.

113
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:50.910
So we can set here the up direction of the camera now it's quite confusing that up is why if we pick

114
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:56.520
said we see it looks down which is the default position a camera would be if you imported it in to the

115
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.420
scene.

116
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:05.550
So because it's been rotated 90 degrees to look forward in this case we see.

117
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:11.130
Whereas Z used to be up and down it's now in a completely different orientation in fact.

118
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.720
Now why is up and down.

119
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.250
Now we can experience with it locked to the two on x.

120
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.230
If I go ahead and move this mannequin now.

121
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:28.220
It will track it is if it was very much next to it so very useful in certain circumstances.

122
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.180
Perhaps if you were controlling a different object rather than a camera it's quite important that the

123
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.780
camera is actually focussed at the object we want.

124
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.590
So in that case let's go to the camera again minor said and then no matter where these two are positioned

125
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:50.280
whether the mannequins over here in the sky and the camera's over here it automatically tracks object

126
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.540
which is incredibly powerful.

127
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.610
And of course I've got a challenge for you guys.

128
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:02.550
Now I would like you to set up some cameras set up multiple cameras so we don't have to keep moving

129
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:09.330
just one introduce a place holder or an empty for a tracking camera much like I have got my mannequin

130
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.870
and then render your building from a couple of different camera views and share.

131
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.440
Remember we're mainly focussing on the interior.

132
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.640
But if you've got a call exterior please share that as well.

133
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.830
Now do remember that you need to set a particular camera as active in order to render from it.

134
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.690
Suppose a video now and give that a go.

135
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.530
Okay guys.

136
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.190
Welcome back.

137
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.670
I'm going to go and set up my cameras now so we don't have to keep moving them about all the time.

138
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.580
Right some back over in blender.

139
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.550
And the first thing I'm going to do.

140
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.220
Well I don't need to do the tracking camera already set that one up and he's tracking the mannequin.

141
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.470
I don't mind where that's positioned for the moment.

142
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.210
Well I might actually move them into a bit more of an interesting position so let's look from the viewpoint.

143
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.430
That's no good.

144
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.990
This is perhaps it's an angel floating through the church.

145
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.700
Who knows.

146
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.580
Well let's try one.

147
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.640
Looks a bit better.

148
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.960
Looks like we're not set here his origin at his feet which is caused me a few problems.

149
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.670
This is one of the reasons why you want to make sure that you have the origin in a logical place for

150
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.620
using your model.

151
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.120
So there's my mannequin Let's see what the view looks like at the moment.

152
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.350
That isn't very interesting.

153
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to move him around but lock him so down and go off the floor.

154
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.870
And where shall I pop him.

155
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.480
That might be an interesting render.

156
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.940
I will set that I'll just get my camera and move it around just a little so I can see more of those

157
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.450
rooms.

158
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.300
I'd love to see how they're rendering out.

159
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.710
Okay so that's one camera all sorted.

160
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:54.310
I'm going to go ahead and just duplicate this particular camera and hop out of its view.

161
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.950
And duplicate it of course it's already going to have some constraints on it.

162
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.740
So I'm going to call this exterior.

163
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.920
So I do want to just have a quick peek at my exterior as I'm working.

164
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.750
I don't want it tracking to anything so I can remove that.

165
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.790
I'm also going to create an empty at this point that's going to control all of four cameras or just

166
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.100
store them in the hierarchy so plain axis.

167
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.850
Do I care where it's placed.

168
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.500
Not particularly at this point.

169
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.720
I've opened up that's the empty here and of the call that cameras.

170
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.210
It looks like I've managed to open up my entire hierarchy which may be a bit problematic but I'll just

171
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.050
shut it back down.

172
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.500
So I've got a camera here and let's call this one tracking camera.

173
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.400
It's important I know what they are so that's lift that up and put that on the camera exterior.

174
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.290
Let's put that on the camera and I want a another one and I'm going to just duplicate the exterior.

175
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.970
Then where it is at the moment ungathered called it interior.

176
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.120
And I'm going to leave it there with three separate cameras so let's make this the active camera.

177
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.500
And of course what we can do here is go to the camera propertys.

178
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:19.040
Here cameras active camera is numbered zero and then set the objects as the camera is control number

179
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.780
had zero.

180
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.540
So there we go.

181
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.270
This is now v active camera.

182
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.550
I'm going to set the interior one right back towards the entrance way and let's look at the view.

183
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.120
I'm going to switch on what camera to view.

184
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.630
That's looking pretty good in fact before I do that I'm just going to zoom in a little so I'm seeing

185
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.780
what the cameras are seeing rather than a slightly zoomed out version.

186
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.780
Let's lift the camera up ever so slightly.

187
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.200
Let's make it look epic.

188
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:52.510
By placing the camera a little bit lower and it's being framed by the door or the walls there so that's

189
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.760
absolutely fine.

190
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.050
So that's that camera set up the exterior one well it's not exterior at the moment.

191
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:04.300
So again I'm going to use short Cahir controller nump had zero to switch around to it and I'm going

192
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.100
to fly that one out.

193
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.700
Now what I could do here for the exterior is certainly have a ground plane as well.

194
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.390
So I'm going to add that in a few moments in fact I'm going to add it in now before I do anything else

195
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:23.290
with this camera because if I start doing other things with the camera I might actually push it below

196
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.140
this plane and that wouldn't be very good.

197
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.670
So I'm just going to scale that up massively and then move it's like the in the wide net.

198
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.280
That just gives me a bit of a ground play and I'm going to set it slightly below the surface as well.

199
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.750
It turns out that that is roughly 100 by 100 something the type that in and it looks like I'm going

200
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.510
to have to look down a little.

201
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.080
Yes I'm going to have to move it slightly below the surface.

202
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.510
Let's go up to the actual position that always helps of minus point one.

203
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.910
Okay so that's in the right place there so let's go back to this exterior camera.

204
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:05.730
In fact we can just look from its viewpoint and lock the camera at a view of as she fills up the.

205
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.060
The lens quite nicely.

206
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:14.090
But I want to look down on ever so slightly don't need to be back here a little wider angle.

207
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.610
I want to have a slightly wider angle someone to go to the camera properties and change the focal length

208
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:25.720
here down to let's say 24 then I should be able to fit more of the ground and more of the church.

209
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.130
I'm going to go slightly wider again.

210
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.330
Going to go for 18.

211
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.840
Of course you do risk stretching and distorting the image.

212
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.550
But if you want to fit the whole thing in that might be what we need to do.

213
00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.130
Of course now I'm going to render these out and see what they're looking like.

214
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.360
Hope yours are looking pretty good.

215
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.010
Here are mine on the screen right now.

216
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.440
I hope you've shared your work in the discussions.

217
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.830
And of course I will see you guys in the next lecture.
