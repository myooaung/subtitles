Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture.
1

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.800
Where we are going to learn about converting objects data types.
2

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.900
So at the moment we have our curve that goes around our pin that we've got.
3

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.020
If you turn off the pin reference I'm just going to hide it by clicking on the eye.
4

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.590
We see that we've got our outline.
5

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.540
But if you were very carefully looking at the outliner over here on the right you'll see that not only
6

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.850
do we have a pin profile there is a curve, We also have a mesh pin profile.
7

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.210
And if I toggle those on and off you see if I just d select everything there that they are both one
8

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.400
and the same which is really useful.
9

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.990
We've now got two types of data that are identical to one another.
10

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.960
And the important thing is there we can do different types of operations depending on what the data
11

12
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.700
type originally was.
12

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.280
So let's go find out some more.
13

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.180
OK so let's start off here by selecting our pin profile I'm going to hide my pin reference for the moment
14

15
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.550
and oh as I'm zooming in here you can see I've run out of Zoom I'm actually trying to zoom in and zoom
15

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.110
in and zoom in.
16

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.940
I just can't zoom in any further.
17

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.950
So I'm going to select my objects and then go to view and frame selected.
18

19
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.790
Now that's number pad full stop.
19

20
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.400
Probably mentioned this in the past.
20

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.770
It's so useful I did want to mention it again.
21

22
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.140
And when you do that it basically centers the view around whatever objects you have selected and then
22

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
the zoom will works so much better than it did before.
23

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.980
Okay.
24

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.610
So now that we have this object selected it's a curve object.
25

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
We do need to be an object mode we're not editing it but what we do need to do is go to the objects
26

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.350
menu and go down to where it says convert.
27

28
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.140
Now I believe this used to have a really convoluted.
28

29
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.110
I think it was control shift alt and C to convert but that doesn't exist at the moment and we've got
29

30
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.200
two options here.
30

31
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.710
We convert to a curve from a mesh or a text object or we can convert to a mesh from a curve, a meta,
31

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.800
surface or a text object.
32

33
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.010
And this is really useful it shows here that you can convert more when we go into a mesh objects then
33

34
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.290
you can go into a curve.
34

35
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.930
And since we're going to be going from a curve to a mesh object that also means potentially we can convert
35

36
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.150
it back later on but I'll show you a way that we can mitigate that just in case you lose some of the
36

37
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.150
information.
37

38
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.350
So we want to convert to a mesh so we go ahead and click that.
38

39
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.420
Now before we do anything else we don't want to lose the operator panel because I want to show you a
39

40
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.490
couple of things.
40

41
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.260
So let's open up the operator panel and it doesn't have much on here of course it's got two options
41

42
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.870
that we have previously but this one here keep original.
42

43
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.550
Now the moment is taken that curve objects and converted it to a mesh object essentially deleting the
43

44
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.640
curve object from existence.
44

45
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.250
However this keep original if I put a tick in it we can see in the outline.
45

46
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.190
It will keep an original copy of the curve that was there.
46

47
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.560
That's really important because the curve may contain information that we don't want to lose.
47

48
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.360
And you don't have to do that it's just recommended at this point what you're learning.
48

49
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.300
Hold on to the original curve data unless you're absolutely sure.
49

50
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.560
Right.
50

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.430
I'm done with that.
51

52
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.500
That's bin it.
52

53
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.590
I'm going to keep it there so I can refer to it later that's going to be really really useful.
53

54
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.820
Now I'm gonna hide that out of the way I'm not interested in seeing the curve data anymore.
54

55
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.920
I just want my mesh objects and now I can confirm it's a mesh object because when I go into edit mode
55

56
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.090
we have our standard editing tools for a mesh object so we can select everything here and we can extrude
56

57
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120
out or do other things with it.
57

58
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.510
So that's one way of profile modelling a surface something like an architrave or a skirting board along
58

59
00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.130
the floor you could do it in this very way if you wanted to especially those really ornate ones.
59

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.960
Okay.
60

61
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.970
So now we covered converting it's time for your challenge.
61

62
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.480
Okay.
62

63
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.060
So a nice and straightforward challenge for you convert your pin profile to a mesh object.
63

64
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.890
And please remember to keep the original curve object as well in this case pause the video now and give
64

65
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.180
that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.
65

66
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.330
Let's go ahead and convert our pin curve to a mesh object.
66

67
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.540
OK everybody welcome back.
67

68
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.720
So I'm going to hide everything from my scene that I need just to keep things lovely and clean, I'm going
68

69
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.860
to select my pin profile I'm going to use the outline to select things and then I'm going to go to object
69

70
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.820
and convert it to a mesh.
70

71
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.940
I'm going to remember to come in here and keep the original.
71

72
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.600
Now what the original means if we're keeping it let's say we wanted to create a couple of different
72

73
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.320
pins while having the original there to refer back to is much much better than having to modify mesh
73

74
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.590
data.
74

75
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.290
You've seen how easy it is to tweak the shape just, by just pulling those handles about and that gives
75

76
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.460
us the option to do that.
76

77
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.640
However I don't want to see it.
77

78
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.380
I just want it out of the way.
78

79
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.100
Now I'm going to open up the object data properties we've got pin profile and pin profiles 0 0 1.
79

80
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.180
I want to call this pin profile curve.
80

81
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.270
I want to be explicit as to what it is.
81

82
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.230
Obviously we can see it there so perhaps curve isn't the right one perhaps original would be a better
82

83
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.800
name.
83

84
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.960
Now it is absolutely fine if you go through and you find yourself renaming things as you progress
84

85
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.990
through the course.
85

86
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.230
That's fine it gets it neat and in your head as to what is going on.
86

87
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.900
So this is the original this is the derived one the mesh data that we've got from it.
87

88
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.840
I want that one selected and I only want that in my viewport so it's nice and simple, brilliant.
88

89
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.670
Excellent.
89

90
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.350
So that's all done and ready to go.
90

91
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.070
It won't be long now before we start actually seeing our pin coming to life.
91

92
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.440
And that will be over in the next lecture.
92

93
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.900
See you there!
