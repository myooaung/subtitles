00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.860
Welcome to Smart's Yuri Projekt in this video you'll understand some more about unwrapping by the end

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.030
you'll be able to unwrap more complex models and realize that this is a great starting point for a lot

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.920
of meshes and see that it gives a basic unwrap that we can work with straight away.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And that is really important at this point in our modelling we don't want to spend ages doing any modelling

5
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.550
until we know what we're going to end up with at the end.

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.390
And we also don't spend ages unwrapping things because the moment we change our mesh we'll need to re

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.960
unwrap and optimize anyway.

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.670
So just a few points on why we need to unwrap.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.810
So a reminder here that a UV map is a projection of the 3D mesh to a 2D space so that often accompanies

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.720
with a lot of distortion as well especially with all gammick models.

11
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.850
And we'll work on optimizing those maps later on.

12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.210
Now whilst unwrapping is actually necessary in order to project an image onto a three dimensional surface

13
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.940
we can let blend guess how to unwrap our model.

14
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.210
Now unwrapping gives us control over how your model is mapped in to these space and obviously letting

15
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.360
blender guess how that works can end up horribly horribly wrong or it might just be the perfect unwrap.

16
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.150
Following on from that it is essential when using assets outside of blender.

17
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.130
If you haven't performed any unwraps then someone outside of Blender's not going to be able to reconstruct

18
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.180
your model.

19
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.480
It's also essential in blender when using textures so that blender knows where to apply them properly.

20
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.290
It is necessary if you want full control over how something is looking and just a quick example before

21
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.910
we hop into a blender.

22
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:04.190
This is one way in order to unwrap a cube so we can see their 3D object is becoming two dimensional

23
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.650
it's becoming flat.

24
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.480
Now that is just one way to unwrap a cube.

25
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:17.100
So long as the faces of the 3D object now lie on a 2D plane it doesn't matter how it's unwrapped.

26
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.890
Apart from the point that it unrra if it's unwrapped in an in an awkward way it will be awkward and

27
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.010
a nightmare to work with later but will go into more about optimizing the maps and how to actually unwrap

28
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.310
later on.

29
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.960
So let's go hop over into blender and play with the Smart you reproject.

30
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.580
Okay so we're over in a default scene in blender.

31
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.240
I'm just going to change my propertys panel here to a U.S. image editor so I can see the u v as it's

32
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.500
produced.

33
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.070
Now let's just recap if we hop into edit mode and unwrap our model by pressing you.

34
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.510
We can just click unwrap.

35
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.800
And that applies each face in its entirety to our entire image it lies underneath.

36
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.450
And that in most cases is going to be unsuitable.

37
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.290
There are occasions when that might be suitable and that's if we've got a repeating texture here that

38
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.210
repeats all over our particular model.

39
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.340
Perhaps it's a bump map to make it look slightly bumpy in which case that might be an appropriate way

40
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.680
of getting it there providing it doesn't cause any graphical artefacts that might be one thing you could

41
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.860
do very quick to a map like that.

42
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.660
So some one way of unwrapping a cubic can be unwrapped into that sort of cross shape.

43
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.950
But if we unwrap a new smart e.v. Project which is the second option down there it gives us a series

44
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.550
of options.

45
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.560
ANGLE limit Island marking an area weights and a tick in the correct box.

46
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.360
Now for the moment we're going to forget that it has those options there and literally go ahead and

47
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.880
click okay.

48
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.880
Now we can see in the movie image editor here that the unwrap is not quite like you would expect it

49
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.560
to be because you can't fold the shape back up into that cube.

50
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.240
Now if we go in to face select and go start you know start polling these these actual faces and seeing

51
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.290
where they exist.

52
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.000
We can see those two faces there like next to one another.

53
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.280
But this one here is diagonally opposite.

54
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.700
So that would cause some problems if we had a line running over the top of this cube from minus X.

55
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.080
Positive x as it goes over the top there.

56
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.990
You'd have a problem because the u v image here would be very difficult to make it start in one place

57
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.380
and then continue over here imagining there's an image underneath and that will be very confusing to

58
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.270
work with.

59
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.910
So that wouldn't be a great.

60
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.250
You ve unwrap for this particular cube.

61
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.540
Something like the cross we saw earlier would be better.

62
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.880
So let's go try this now.

63
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:59.820
Over on our door some going to go ahead and open up the door that we've been working on and now hop.

64
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.670
The 3D view so I can see what's going on.

65
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.040
Now I can see here that we haven't quite nailed down every other bits yet have made our fall elodie

66
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.740
level be.

67
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.010
But let's leave that for the moment and hide everything else.

68
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.730
But the A.

69
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.920
Let's work on a more complex shape than our wall but nothing too complex at the moment.

70
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.300
Somewhere to hide everything else from the scene.

71
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.970
I could have also selected it and press shift H.

72
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.150
I'll just do that now to make sure everything else is hidden and I'm going to open up a UV image editor

73
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.010
as well so we can see what's going on.

74
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.510
Now once that's open let's first of all just try what we've done before which is selecting everything

75
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.180
in edit mode and then just unwrapping.

76
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.540
Then we need something here it's currently stuck on render results.

77
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.860
So let's close the render result down and we've got this.

78
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.130
Now I have no idea how our brick text is going to map to that.

79
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:05.180
So let's go ahead and open up the brick texture that we've used before the cinderblock and apply material

80
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.840
to our object.

81
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.390
Gone are anteriorly in our scene at the moment and I'm gonna call this wall door and the colour of that

82
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.570
is going to be the image texture and because it's loaded into memory we can click on it from the drop

83
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.070
up.

84
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.720
There is not a drop down.

85
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.090
So now we've got vats in the scene.

86
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.980
What we should be able to do is hop over to rendered mode to turn my son back on so I can at least see

87
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.620
it properly.

88
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.800
Oh well well well that's not that's not looking too good is it.

89
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.950
Dunno if you are going for that effect yet.

90
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.610
It might be perfect for you but here looks an absolute mess.

91
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.540
That's not how we want it laid out at all.

92
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.640
However smart you project might be able to get us part of the way there or even all of the way there.

93
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.000
So I'm going to select all of my model make in edit mode and unwrap that to reset the unwrap and then

94
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.550
I'm going to use smart CV projects.

95
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.330
I'm going to leave the default settings and click okay okay but starting to look better.

96
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.550
But I can see straightaway that if a whole face is only mapped to around a quarter of this image the

97
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.840
bricks are probably going to be quite large.

98
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.350
So let's go ahead and go to rended married or indeed we can go to textured mode as well.

99
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:26.700
Down here we can go to the material mode and well that is it's getting there isn't it.

100
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.260
The U.S. smart project has helped quite a lot here.

101
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.760
So we need to select everything again and see if we can scale this up so it fits properly.

102
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.100
Now at the moment if we go and scale it scaling around an arbitrary point and that is going to make

103
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.370
it very difficult to actually work out how big it's supposed to be unless we've got some sort of guidance

104
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.090
on the model itself.

105
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.010
So in this case what we can do instead is use some of the very similar methods we've used in the 3D

106
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.690
editor.

107
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.140
But this time in the U.S. image editor.

108
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.520
So we've got a series of selection methods on along the header bar at the bottom and you can also gain

109
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.130
access to them with control and Tab much like you can over on the 3d editing where you can select the

110
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.500
edge vertices and faces.

111
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.940
So over here we've got a fourth option we got virtex Edge and face in Island.

112
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.900
Now I don't think we've got any islands in here.

113
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.150
Oh yes we do it has separated them out into individual islands.

114
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:30.040
So what we can do here just to demonstrate whilst we're here is we can scale something under a scale

115
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.300
and by something I can scale it back up by some scaled it by half.

116
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.040
That must be the other side of the wall.

117
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.410
And look we've got even bigger textures there.

118
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:43.860
So that demonstrates how you can use different parts of your model slightly differently and map them

119
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.660
onto an image completely differently even though you're not changing any of the model itself you're

120
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.150
just changing the mapping of the model.

121
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.050
I'm going to undo that rather than scaling it back up to this time select everything.

122
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.830
Now I want to scale it but I want to really scale it around a point in the corner.

123
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.630
So I got a bit of guidance over the size that I'm making this huge.

124
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.670
Unwrap I'm going to select.

125
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.260
Oh I don't want the island selects how one vertex going to select this of a takes in the corner.

126
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.140
Now just to let you know I am fully aware that the 2D cursor that we're about to move is already in

127
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:25.470
a corner and we could utilize that Botswana to show you guys how to move that to the cursor and how

128
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.230
similar it is to when working in 3-d.

129
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.550
Ed I'm now going to you shift an S to move the cursor to selected so much light we can move the 3-d

130
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.050
cursor we can also move the 2d cursor.

131
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.430
Finally if we set the pivot points when we've got everything selected ours the pivot point down here

132
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.610
next to a view to the 2d cursor.

133
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:53.790
Now when we scale we will be scaling up from that 2D cursor which made it a lot easier to fill the image

134
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.350
up.

135
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.980
Now that is looking pretty good.

136
00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.270
Apart from.

137
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.920
No no.

138
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.320
That is I'm not sure they're all there.

139
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.470
I'm going to leave it there for the moment Michael's make minor adjustments later.

140
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.900
Now some of you will be aware that this is obviously upside down.

141
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.920
Does that matter.

142
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.930
Probably not with this brick texture.

143
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:20.740
It may matter when we start tesselated it with other wall pieces but also at the same time the scaling

144
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.450
might be slightly off as well so that something would have to standardize and check against the other

145
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.340
models as well.

146
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:34.300
So there we have this now unwrapped starting from a smart you reproject we've got ourselves almost there

147
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.870
then we've scaled it up so it fits properly.

148
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.980
And if we have a quick look around our model Now lets us have a look of as anything else we need to

149
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.420
do.

150
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.680
So the sides line up reasonably well.

151
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.020
How about the arch way.

152
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.650
Can we get a look inside the arch.

153
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.630
Well yes that's also lined up reasonably well.

154
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:59.350
I'm quite impressed how quickly and easily this smart uni project has actually worked without causing

155
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.650
some major problems which sometimes it can when your model gets more and more complex.

156
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:12.100
Okay so now we've gone over the Smarts you've reproject feature I'd like you to try out this challenge.

157
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.880
I would like you to go ahead and use smart TV projects.

158
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:26.790
So try it out on your window model and map a texture to your window show your work in the discussions

159
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.680
pause video now and give that a go.

160
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.120
Okay guys.

161
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.060
Welcome back.

162
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:39.710
Let's go you smart Eevee projects to project our blockwork texture onto our window.

163
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.140
Okay so let's go and try out the same thing on our window.

164
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.490
Is it in my quick select.

165
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.100
No it's not so let's go ahead and open it up window.

166
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.920
There we go.

167
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.110
So this is going to be very similar to the door apart from it's not a a join at the bottom so I'm going

168
00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:03.570
to select everything and let's have the U.S. image editor already open so I can monitor how things are

169
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.170
going.

170
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.620
Yuri image editor.

171
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.810
Okay so I'm going to selects everything in edit mode and use smart use projecting click.

172
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:20.100
Our Alice stuck Orenda results I'm just going to undo that and similar to that arch.

173
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.480
It looks like we've got a pretty good unwrapped to start with.

174
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:33.180
Now I'm going to straightaway highlight all of this and rotate it by one a T on the y axis.

175
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.420
No it's not rotated around quite.

176
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.680
Howard expect it to.

177
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.630
So let's rotate.

178
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.580
It's rotating fine.

179
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.340
Now Mary get.

180
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.550
So that's now rotated round and it needs scaling up.

181
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:54.390
Now I'm going to first add the picture to what we're or the texture to what we're doing here.

182
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.640
So the cinder block.

183
00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:02.710
Now that won't show up in here just yet until we are applied a material and I'm going to in fact these

184
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:08.170
materials should really be called something like window cinderblock so I know what it is but I'm going

185
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.510
to call it window wall again since they're all matching at the moment.

186
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.300
Again sometimes you have to accept that you may have to go ahead and rename something.

187
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.710
So that's now map then just like before.

188
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.180
Let's go and turn the sun on so I can see where is the sun in my scene.

189
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.610
Okay.

190
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.160
This isn't really lighting up missing quite as I'd expect it to.

191
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.650
But let's go scale this up.

192
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:38.460
I can still see as much as I want to or need to if I can turn some material and just see how that's

193
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.250
being mapped.

194
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:46.180
Anyway I suspect that sun is on a layer that I currently don't have enabled so I can scale this up now

195
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.220
and again I'm going to set my 3-d cursor.

196
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:55.780
So let's do everything here and it's already in the corner but I really want it in this corner.

197
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.940
So I'm going to move my three cursor to the corner.

198
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.120
Oh move.

199
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.370
Carl kasell Selected.

200
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.180
Not selected to cursor.

201
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.650
I misread that.

202
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:17.300
So cursor to selected select all and make sure the pivot point is set to the 2d cursor and scale up.

203
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:25.180
Now I'm fully aware here that it is likely that I need to also shift it slightly this way as well of

204
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.010
a whole dot shift for a bit more granularity and it's more likely to be like that.

205
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.620
I think where the whole face is covered up then we've got these extra bits either side.

206
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.450
I think that's much better that way.

207
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.920
So let's go and check around the model that things are lining up as we expect them to go.

208
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.960
So I'm going to hop out of edit most of my got lines everywhere.

209
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.540
So this one is a little more problematic.

210
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:53.420
Doesn't look that great around the window itself and that might be because there's not enough detail

211
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.750
there but also you very rarely make a window out of a block in that manner.

212
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.660
So a couple of ways that we can sort this out is number one move the mesh make it slightly wider so

213
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.890
it fits in the brick work itself.

214
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:13.490
So this this point in the archway seems to line up pretty well if this morter line at the top.

215
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.940
However this bit down here so that's where you would start making your geometry match or textures which

216
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.660
is a slightly different workflow.

217
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.170
But if we're working with textures that we haven't created we may have to do that a bit of artistic

218
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:31.450
licence if you will in order to make sure that the texture maps well to our model.

219
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.270
In fact then we're making our model map well to the texture as well so it's awesome biotic relationship

220
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.870
now we have a look on the inside.

221
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.550
It's not as neat as before either.

222
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.970
So that's something we can work on again not at the moment because yes it's a bit unsightly but that's

223
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.410
the detail we don't know what this window is going to end up looking like.

224
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:58.260
We may end up covering up those details with other bits of geometry.

225
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.030
So at the moment they they really are superfluous.

226
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.920
They do not matter at all.

227
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.930
Now looking around the other side of the texture it does appear like this is much much better matched

228
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.860
up to the image itself.

229
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:18.520
So this is another example of well let's give it a go now this is lying over here and I'm presuming

230
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.760
if we select one of these faces that's Go to face selects and select here.

231
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.560
Yes this is the one that we've actually lined up properly over the top.

232
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.640
So we go to Ireland select on our model and select this island.

233
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.400
We should be able to move it so it's almost.

234
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.120
Right on top of the other one.

235
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.020
If I turn off snapping that's going to give me much or rather turn on snapping.

236
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:50.620
But we want it locked to a vertex and now we can overlap these perfectly.

237
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.640
And then when we spin around our model the other side looks exactly the same.

238
00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.250
And doesn't that look much better now that it's mapped with the block.

239
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:00.810
Why is that.

240
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.090
That's not planned by the way that looks near enough perfect.

241
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.780
In fact we can get the geometry slightly wider all the mappings slightly wider so we can go in here.

242
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:15.280
And of course all to these mapping points so that the texture is mapped slightly differently across

243
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.110
these faces.

244
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.980
I'm not going to muck around with that at the moment because that's too much detail as I've mentioned

245
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.150
at this point in time.

246
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.370
But that small alignment there has made all the difference and I feel much better already about the

247
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.370
texture fitting the model.

248
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.760
How did you guys get on.

249
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.260
I'd love to see your progress.

250
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.920
Please share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
