Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're gonna have a look at snapping.
1

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.830
Now as you can see here we've got two sets of cubes one on the right is perfectly snapped together the
2

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.040
one on the left is a bit wonky to be quite honest now both of these took the same amount of time to
3

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.180
do so if you need to align things together snapping is your tool but how do we use it.
4

5
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.660
Let's find out more and hop on over in blender.
5

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.390
Okay everybody Welcome back well the snapping tool is a very simple one to use but it's got many many
6

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.710
options and some of them can be a bit confusing at the very top of the 3D view.
7

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.590
We've got this magnet tool we click on that.
8

9
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.790
We've turned snapping on.
9

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.270
Okay.
10

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.110
What does that mean.
11

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
Well it means if we go ahead and move our cube Now you'll notice that it moves in whole increments.
12

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.210
In fact it's moving one blender unit or one meter at a time as we go if we go into our orthographic
13

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.060
mode either top front left right back.
14

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.670
Whatever you've picked you can see that it now snaps to the grid and because zoomed in just enough
15

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.790
to see the smaller squares it's moving by point one of a unit as well.
16

17
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.130
And we can confirm that by having a look over at the transform of the cube, The cube object is selected
17

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.440
and the same information is available in the transform options in the properties window.
18

19
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.350
If you pop that out.
19

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.330
Now notice that the coordinate here the Z coordinate of one meter refers to whether orange dots.
20

21
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.110
So if I press G again to move it we can see that it is moving by point 1.
21

22
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.040
If I zoom out a little further until you can't see those thin lines.
22

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.710
Now when I try to move it it will move by whole units at a time.
23

24
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.340
Now if you're trying to snap something you don't want it snapping.
24

25
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.930
Now if any point you don't want snapping turned on and you want to totally off quickly you can just
25

26
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.220
hold down control whilst it's turned on and then it will turn off it will toggle off.
26

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380
If I let go of control then it snaps back on again.
27

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.350
If you need to toggle it on and off you will notice that the toggle key is now gone but you can use
28

29
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.160
the shortcut key shift in tab to toggle it on and shift in tap to toggle it off again.
29

30
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.830
Now what you won't notice by just doing that straight away have a look at the location.
30

31
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560
Currently it's going up by whole numbers.
31

32
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.010
If I go shift and tab and turn it off we see that it's now going up by whatever it is available to it.
32

33
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.960
If I go ahead and click and place the cube and then go shift and tab turning snapping back on.
33

34
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.850
We notice when we go to move it.
34

35
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes it's doing whole numbers again but is not whole numbers as it was before is whole numbers from its
35

36
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.520
new position which can be a little bit confusing if you are trying to snap something to the grid underneath
36

37
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060
if that's what you are trying to do.
37

38
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.320
What you can do is next to the magnet icon.
38

39
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.550
There's a dropdown and you want absolute grid snap.
39

40
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.170
Now it won't matter.
40

41
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.050
It will snap to the grid perfectly.
41

42
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.510
Whether you're at this scale or a smaller scale as well.
42

43
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.170
Now what are the other options that are there.
43

44
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.910
Well a vertex will snap to vertices edges to edges faces to faces and volume to volume.
44

45
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.740
All of them are pretty self-explanatory.
45

46
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.050
Now the one that I find the most use while we're in object mode and we're not really editing anything
46

47
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.940
is the vertex snapping.
47

48
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.820
I'm going to click vertex snapping now and I'm not gonna adjust any of the other settings for the moment.
48

49
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.680
I'm going to rotate the view around slightly so we can see what's going on.
49

50
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.900
And I'm going to duplicate this cube snapping is turned on so it wasn't jerking all over the place.
50

51
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.500
But what I can do now is press the G key and if I move my cursor over one of the four top corners you can
51

52
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.290
see that the cube is snapping to it but it looks the same on the back two and the front two so what's
52

53
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.490
going on there.
53

54
00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.120
Well if you recall on these options the target was the closest now I'm leaving is as that at the moment
54

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.540
because that's the way that I like working out there like fiddling around with those options unnecessarily.
55

56
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.840
But it also means that sometimes aligning can be a bit of a pain.
56

57
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.080
So if I move this cube over this side and I wanted to make kind of a step staircase going up I could
57

58
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.820
go G.
58

59
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.030
And it was snap to this.
59

60
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.770
The closest one however if i wanted the staircase going the other way up.
60

61
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.070
I would have to first move the cube over here click to set its new position and then go G and move it
61

62
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.660
again back to here.
62

63
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.510
If I tried it the other way first it would've just stacked it on top. 
63

64
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.790
But you can see when we start doing things like this it becomes very quick to start building up a particular
64

65
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.520
shape without it having to match the grid so if i was to scale that cube slightly.
65

66
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.350
Now I can start stacking things in a different way completely.
66

67
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.810
And of course I need to move the cursor around occasionally to get things lined up as I would expect
67

68
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.080
them.
68

69
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.910
So there we go we've got a new shape coming together really well.
69

70
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.190
And if you're building something up out of cubes kind of like how you would do in a game like Minecraft
70

71
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.090
the snapping tool is a godsend because it really does help you build your models really really quickly.
71

72
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.080
Whether or not you're using increments or the vertex snapping option they're both really handy.
72

73
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.900
And there we go that concludes our introduction to the snapping tool we'll use it much more later on.
73

74
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.680
And it's certainly something that you're going to be able to practice as we get towards the end of section
74

75
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.540
challenge.
75

76
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.340
But for now I'll see you in the next lecture.
