00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,350
Hello everybody and welcome back in this light.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,400
So we're going to go over data blocks and we'll also reinforce this knowledge over the next four or

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,970
five theory and slash practical lectures on data blocks and how we can move them about different blend

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,290
files.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,360
So we're going to learn about data blocks what they are and how we can use them.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,500
Now we've actually come into contact with data blocks lots.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,690
But let's now go and explore them directly.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:37,320
Now there are things like mesh data textures objects lights all of these things a type of data blocks

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,980
that we can move around in our scene.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,050
Now this is very useful if you're making parts separately or bringing in other assets you've already

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,350
made.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,290
So it's incredibly useful.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,850
Also when you're working in a team being able to understand which data blocks are where and how you

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,250
access them.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,970
So data blocks characteristics what are they how do we know what they are.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,190
So they must have unique names per type.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,020
That's really important.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,860
If you have something with exactly the same name it just won't like it.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,050
So if you've seen that's if you try it will append it was 0 0 1 0 0 2 etc. They can link to each other

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,260
which is really useful they can link across the blend files which is also incredibly useful and we'll

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,530
talk later on about some dos and don'ts about linking across blend files unused data blocks are eventually

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,260
removed.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,880
So we've come across this in the past with data blocks.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,460
This is where we've used fake users.

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,730
So that little f simple fare to preserve that particular data block is if we don't when we go ahead

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,540
and shut down the blend file and come back again it will go.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,410
The common thing that I've seen that happen with is materials you set up a material where you remove

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,090
it from an object you save you file you go off you come back the materials gone.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,880
Now for our basic materials that we generally work with not a problem at all for more advanced materials

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
that might take hours to set up.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,370
That's quite a big problem sharing data block.

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,390
So here's a quick example then we dive over into the gives the same texture on many materials the same

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,240
material on many measures we've already played with that one quite a bit the same particle system and

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
so on so on.

35
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,930
So you're getting the gist here that we can have the same theta block on multiple objects for instance.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,760
That's incredibly useful sharing data means we don't have to repeat ourselves.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,520
Now an example here is we often end up sharing and then making the data block unique.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,300
That's a that's a given if you've got a material that's almost there but it's the wrong color but you

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
don't want to override the original material.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,040
You can have another instance of that data block and then make it unique and then adjust the color to

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,430
what you want says to have a look at an example of this over in Blender Okay so now that we're over

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,920
in Blender let's go ahead and first of all just tweak a few things I've already turned on once I don't

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
want to keep having to turn it on.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,250
So I'm just gonna make this area here wider so I can see everything along the header bar for the outline

45
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,780
helps you guys out most are going to go to the filters tab and turn back on these to be disabled and

46
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,080
viewport and the render icon and then I'm going to go across the file defaults and save startup file

47
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,140
and I don't have to do that ever again which is really useful if I might pull up the time line ever

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,920
so slightly.

49
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,290
It's very tempting to get rid of the timeline but every time I end up cleaning it away I often end up

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,460
needing it.

51
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,530
Okay so that's down there.

52
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm happy with the setup here.

53
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,920
Let's have a look at our data blocks.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,380
The first thing we can do actually to reveal all of the data blocks that are currently in this file

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,020
is to go to the display mode of the outlier and select blender file.

56
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,020
We have a look at this area helps us make it larger.

57
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,920
We can see all of the current data blocks that are within this file and you can see that there are quite

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,660
a few.

59
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,400
And of course many of these we can link into other blend files and we'll do that in the next lecture.

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,610
But let's have a closer look at how blender manages these and let's go to one of the ones we deal with

61
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,270
day in day out so we don't have to think too much about the details of it.

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,100
Let's have a look at objects type of objects in our scene.

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,150
Let's go to a cube a cube has a mesh data.

64
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,410
So this is the data data block and then we have our material data block.

65
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,330
Pretty awesome.

66
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,890
Hey you'll notice that it kind of coincides with our options that we have down here.

67
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,490
We have our object properties.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,070
We have our modifier properties particle properties etc. as we go down and then we have our object data

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,920
properties of the data data properties and then our material properties as well.

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,690
So let's have a look at some of the things that we discussed in the slides just beforehand.

71
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,260
Let's go ahead and duplicate our cube.

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,880
Now the moment we duplicate it we can show it anywhere in the scene.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,020
It doesn't matter.

74
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,860
We can now see in this hierarchy we have cube 0 0 1 and cube.

75
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:14,060
Now when we created that new cube it also had a material on it because it was a duplicate of the original.

76
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,850
So all of this is duplicate data.

77
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,370
However it is not necessarily shared data at this point in time.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,320
We go back to the original one and go old The instead which is a linked duplicate we've not used in

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:36,490
a while but now if we look at cube 0 0 2 and open that up we can see that it shares cube and material.

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,740
So looking at these and following the rules that we've already learned that any particular type of data

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:50,660
blocks name has to be unique we can say for certain that these three cubes share the same material.

82
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,300
If you modify that material it will affect all three of them.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,600
We can prove that simply by going into the viewport shading tab going to our material it doesn't matter

84
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,180
which cube we're on.

85
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:08,330
Let's just change it to green they all change because they all have the same material and if we go to

86
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,090
one of these materials and rename it let's say green.

87
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,730
It also renames all of the others because it's the same data block.

88
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,890
It's not unique.

89
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,400
Now let's have a look at the names here.

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,710
I'm going to get rid of one of my cubes here I want to get rid of cube 0 0 2 just to make things a little

91
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,330
simpler.

92
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,840
Okay so we have cube and cube 0 0 1.

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,480
Now if we would go ahead to cube 0 0 1 and try and call it cube your left kind of scratching your head

94
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,940
they're going well did they just change positions.

95
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,270
But now we can have a look here.

96
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,340
Cube 0 0 1 has been successfully renamed cube

97
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,390
but the original Q because two data blocks cannot have the same name has been renamed cube 0 0 1.

98
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,470
So if we do the same thing again you will see they switched back and the only way we can really tell

99
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,190
is because of the different match data names underneath.

100
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,360
So they those can be named independently which is awesome.

101
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,840
One thing to bear in mind is case sensitivity comes in.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,740
So Cube all in capitals or all lower case is a different name they are literally different.

103
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,240
So that's one thing to bear in mind that case does matter.

104
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,160
Now what we can do with data blocks for instance let's make both of us share the same data.

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,890
So I'm going to go back to calling this one cube.

106
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,740
So we've got our cube 0 0 1.

107
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,580
Ah no look they're out of sync.

108
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,750
How do we go ahead and solve that.

109
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,820
Well I'm just going to go up to this top one and call it cube and it will flip background.

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,790
Okay to cube 001 and cube.

111
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,980
Now if I want these to have the same mesh data which is useful which means like if I go ahead and grab

112
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,420
this vertex here and just move it somewhere random just so we know it's different we can see that this

113
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,060
one here cube 001 has not inherited that.

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,380
However if we go to our match data properties we can change the match data for the cube the one that

115
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,620
we currently have selected.

116
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,990
Cube 0 0 1 2 the cube.

117
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,290
And there we go.

118
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,900
It now has the same mesh data and we can see that as well in the hierarchy because they both have the

119
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,610
same name.

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,090
And now we can see all of this data in front of us.

121
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:35,270
It starts to become clear what this number 2 is next to our mesh data name it means there are two uses

122
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,810
of that data block if we click on that two or any other number it makes the match data unique again

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,240
which means we can move it around and it won't affect the other one.

124
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,300
Pretty awesome.

125
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,580
Of course we can come back in at any point and set it back to the cube can't do it whilst we're still

126
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,690
editing of course.

127
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,470
But now I conflict between those two states.

128
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,630
However look here we've got a zero next to cube and cube 0 0 2.

129
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,790
These are two match data blocks that currently have no assignment.

130
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,110
There are no objects in our scene that are using that data.

131
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:20,110
Now what this means is that if we go ahead and save our scene and let's call this data blocks just for

132
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,700
short and let's correct the capital either we go ahead and save that and then revert the file.

133
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,960
Right.

134
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,660
Let's have a look.

135
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:37,990
We've got two unused data blocks we go file and reverts which is the same as opening up again those

136
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,450
unused data blocks have gone.

137
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,180
Now that's not usually an issue but where I have seen an issue several times is when you're playing

138
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
about with materials.

139
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:58,890
So we go ahead we can see here that green material is on both of these objects and let's go ahead and

140
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,770
open up our mesh you Oh no.

141
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,010
Objects again.

142
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,420
Remember there's a hierarchy.

143
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,620
Here we go.

144
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,260
And coincidentally you'll see that when we move an object in its mesh data in any attached materials

145
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,650
will also come across because they are further down the hierarchy.

146
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,740
Now let's have a look at our material itself on the green material here we also have a dropdown This

147
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,820
is similar to the mesh dropdown and we don't have any other materials in our scene at the moment.

148
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,490
We've got the name of it that's fine.

149
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,580
We've got the shield.

150
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,550
I like calling this protect which is probably why it's got that shield there.

151
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,390
It saves the data block even if it has no users which is incredibly useful.

152
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,660
It means that if I turn that's off let's say creating new material new material said this one as red

153
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,130
and then say well actually I don't want the green material on this object anymore.

154
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,780
Both of these will turn red.

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,310
We look at our selection of materials now instead of having the zero next to it that it would have had

156
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,510
if we haven't enabled the fake user option.

157
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,850
This will preserve it during saving.

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,020
So this is an incredibly useful tool to be aware of.

159
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
It's mainly materials that I've seen people have problems with.

160
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,460
OK so what you can do as well as if the red material itself has all of the properties and everything

161
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,130
else sets up and you want to take a copy of that material but make it unique but inherit all of the

162
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,550
properties the previous material had the next icon there as you can see two pages together new material

163
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,300
and new material is going to base it upon the original materials.

164
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,110
Now we've got material 001 but the original material now has no uses associated with it.

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,350
Something to bear in mind and of course you can click the X and unlinked the data block shifting click

166
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,840
to set the users to zero.

167
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,180
Well that's a good way of cleaning if you don't want a material in the scene anymore.

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,960
So I went ahead and did that.

169
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,000
We can see on the materials list both of these are now 0 and to really drive home the point.

170
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:11,850
If I go ahead and save and revert those materials and now gone eek.

171
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,060
Well happens that material took you a few minutes or maybe even an hour to set up.

172
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,050
When we get into materials you can see they can get very very complex.

173
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,630
I'm going to set that it's green for the moment just so they have a material applied to them.

174
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,720
And that's about wraps up I'll look at data blocks.

175
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,220
Be aware that there are many in the scene.

176
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:41,790
These are the things that you can link between many scenes and you have a lot of control each object

177
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,230
has to have each day to block type has to have a unique name.

178
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:56,680
So whereas we can't have to match objects called cube we can have shared data called cube which is useful.

179
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,630
However if we were to make that unique by clicking the two there.

180
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,050
So we now have cube 0 0 1 having unique mesh data cube 0 0 1.

181
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:14,650
We tried to cool that cube just like with the mesh object it will just rename this one down here to

182
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:21,970
cube 0 0 1 because you could not have 2 data blocks with the same name when at the same time.

183
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,170
Okay.

184
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,130
That's it for this lecture.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,290
That was a bit of a deep dive into data blocks.

186
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,200
Now will start to become more and more clear as you start to use data blocks more and more and this

187
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,960
will be especially true the more advanced projects you work on.

188
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,710
And if you have any tips on how you've managed data blocks in the past.

189
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,480
Remember to share them with everybody as well over in discussions.

190
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,420
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
