Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture we're going to have some fun and actually create our pin
1

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.820
that you can see in front of us here is very straightforward to do so let's dive in and find out more.
2

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.010
Hello everybody and welcome.
3

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.600
So the first thing we need to do here is go into edit mode on our newly formed mesh object.
4

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.100
I'm going to tab over into edit mode.
5

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.630
Now that I've done that I'm going to select everything because I'm going to do this operation on everything.
6

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.290
Couple of common sense checks here that we need to make sure first of all we need to just check that
7

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.010
this is in fact where X equals zero which it is.
8

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.500
And this one down at the bottom this vertex down at the bottom is also where X equals zero.
9

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.850
Brilliant.
10

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.750
That is important because what we're about to do is we're about to use a function called spin.
11

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.880
And it does matter where your object is in relation to the objects origin.
12

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.350
So if we just tab out back into object mode here we see that the origin is currently smack bang down
13

14
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.940
at the center.
14

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.850
That's this orange dot.
15

16
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.820
If we go and go tab back into edit mode and do our spin operation but for some reason you've managed
16

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.480
to make let's say the pin over here you weren't quite sure where you were you'd be moving things around.
17

18
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.030
If you do the spin from here it will look odd and I'll show you what I mean right away.
18

19
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.320
So let's scroll down and get to our spin.
19

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.680
If I go ahead and click that we get these two blue pluses on the screen.
20

21
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.420
If I start doing that you will notice that look at that doesn't look like a pin at all and you'll be asking
21

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.870
over in the Q and A's Mike mine doesn't look like a pin what's gone on.
22

23
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.730
The reason why it doesn't look like a pin is because we're rotating, our rotational symmetry is based
23

24
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.520
around the objects origin and the way that we're rotating it round on the Z axis here.
24

25
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.350
So that's very important.
25

26
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.600
And the same if it was off at some funny angle you'd end up with some awesome looking shapes but it might
26

27
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.190
not be the one that you wanted it to be.
27

28
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.640
So what do we do if that is the case.
28

29
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.700
Well hopefully it isn't but if it is what you can do is look at it from the side and we can do a best
29

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.120
guess.
30

31
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.530
So in this case the I just need to undo the mess that I've caused there.
31

32
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.200
Look at this from the front again and you'd select everything you'd find your origin and you just move
32

33
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.690
as close as you can.
33

34
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.000
And then once you've done that once you can do is manually adjust this vertex at the bottom here so
34

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.450
I can go and find oh I didn't want to do that.
35

36
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.390
I'm just going to turn off spin and do the select mode again some actually selecting say here's
36

37
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.240
my vertex here I can go in and manually adjust it.
37

38
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.890
So it's where X equals zero.
38

39
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And here at the top as well so this is going to be slightly wider than it was before.
39

40
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.470
But you know what I don't mind.
40

41
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.600
We can always patch these things later as well if necessary.
41

42
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.680
Now what I am going to do at this point is I do want mine to be pretty spot on. 
42

43
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.720
I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I'm just going to open up where I left off before and just go back into
43

44
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.250
edit mode.
44

45
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.940
I know everything's set up because I have kind of prepared for this as you probably guessed.
45

46
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.710
So let's go back in and have a look at the spin mode itself.
46

47
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.570
I'm just going to do something we shall bring up the operator panel and I'll show you our options.
47

48
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.840
So we've got our angle.
48

49
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.880
If I increase the angle we start to get it coming around so here for instance if I type in 180 we should
49

50
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.620
get half a pin and we do pretty awesome.
50

51
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.400
Now we've got this option here called auto merge.
51

52
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.240
So if we went all the way around to 360 degrees what we should find is that these vertices that are
52

53
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.650
now overlapping because of course there was that there were some there before.
53

54
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.240
Unfortunately that's not the case at the moment.
54

55
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.090
I found the auto merge doesn't actually merge these vertices.
55

56
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.800
It just simply puts them in the same place and ensures that they're in the same place.
56

57
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.190
I found that I still need to go back afterwards select everything in my model and remove doubles.
57

58
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.150
Now steps what does that do.
58

59
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.230
Well steps is like the resolution of our spin that we've done.
59

60
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.010
See if you set that too high if I go all I might have just crashed blender.
60

61
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.820
I hope I haven't.
61

62
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.200
So be careful if you click and drag that's because you may find that oh there you go.
62

63
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.680
We've caught up to a thousand that's far far far too much geometry.
63

64
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.550
Oh wow I can't even see the faces that's created.
64

65
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.280
So don't go that high.
65

66
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.560
That's far too much.
66

67
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.340
And of course if you had four that would it.
67

68
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.840
Well it looks kind of cool but that's not the shape that we go for either.
68

69
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.540
There's always a fine balance in making sure that your geometry has the right level of detail and there'll
69

70
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.050
be loads of things pulling you and pushing you towards being really realistic or perhaps you're making
70

71
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.650
a model for a bowling game and if you're doing that you may have restrictions on how much geometry you
71

72
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.840
have.
72

73
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.050
I've been playing about with this lots and I think 16 is a good number as low as eight and as high as
73

74
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.720
32 may be somewhere in between.
74

75
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:21.430
But I do like my multiples of eight so I might even go for 24 and they're not 243 24 is kind of a halfway
75

76
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.890
house.
76

77
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.990
I'm not sure I like playing with these things and seeing what the output is.
77

78
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.550
That's the crucial thing.
78

79
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.160
And of course it's no longer a pin profile.
79

80
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.150
It's also a pin.
80

81
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.230
So we've got a bit of renaming to do.
81

82
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.170
Now one of the things that you will notice is no matter what you do let's say we set this quite low.
82

83
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.610
That's a six steps and we come out of it.
83

84
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.300
And so we've now got our pin it looks really good.
84

85
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.840
What we can also do is right click on it and go to shade smooth.
85

86
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.360
So this opens up our context menu gives us a load of shortcuts common ones for what we're currently
86

87
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.770
in which is object mode.
87

88
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.770
And one of the options is shade smooth and now I'll take that faceted look and make it look smooth.
88

89
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.750
Now one of the things you'll notice is that if you look at it from certain angles you can see that it's
89

90
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.260
a hexagon especially from the top.
90

91
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.420
This is what's called occlusion it's the outline of our shape from certain angles.
91

92
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.120
So from this angle it looks pretty fine until you get one of those top views either slightly looking
92

93
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.480
down we start to get this really horrible edge to it and that's where coming in and tweaking the amount
93

94
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.270
of geometry that's on our pin comes into effect.
94

95
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.220
So six is obviously too low can we see if there's eight.
95

96
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.980
Can we see that.
96

97
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.290
If there's 16.
97

98
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.760
At what point does it really not matter anymore.
98

99
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.190
The other thing to bear in mind is if you're looking at your pin from this distance well that's completely
99

100
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.170
different than if you're this close to your pin says loads of things that play into this.
100

101
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.690
And with that knowledge it's time for your challenge.
101

102
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.970
Okay.
102

103
00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:01.510
So your challenge is to use the spin tool to create your pin. Set your pin to have between 8 and 32 steps.
103

104
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.580
Don't worry if you have to go back and just try out and different numbers of steps depending on how
104

105
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:14.290
it looks and remember to check for duplicates and remove doubles if you do have them, turn on smooth
105

106
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.480
shading and sit back and admire your pin.
106

107
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.430
And once you've done that go and show it off over in the discussions pause the video now and give that
107

108
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.820
a go.
108

109
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.710
Okay everybody welcome back.
109

110
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:36.630
Let's go ahead and create our pin. Okay everybody so let's start by first of all going into edit mode
110

111
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.850
selecting all.
111

112
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.370
I'm gonna go down to spin straight away I want to start the spin I think I'm gonna go for sixteen in
112

113
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:51.150
total in in total number of steps they're nice halfway house and we're gonna have 360 I'm gonna have
113

114
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.610
auto merge on and we'll hope that it works it might it might not.
114

115
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:02.340
I'm just going to click away and I'm gonna press W to go back to selection mode now with everything
115

116
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.460
all sorted I'm gonna press the A key which is going to select all of my mesh data and I'm going to
116

117
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:15.120
go to the F3 to search and then we go remove doubles was one of the last things I did I can just type
117

118
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:23.250
in doubles as nice quick way of getting that up and yes removed 30 vertices and its probably 30 from
118

119
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:30.090
the top to the bottom so there we go that's all sorted there let's come out into object mode right click
119

120
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.840
and shades smooth OK.
120

121
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.750
Let's look at this from the top.
121

122
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.380
I need to just focus back in again and save my work as well.
122

123
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.660
OK.
123

124
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.670
So from this range you can see that it's a little bit jagged around the top at 16.
124

125
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.880
But to be quite honest I don't think I need any extra detailing in there.
125

126
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.690
I think that's enough.
126

127
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:58.980
I think any more assets would be a waste when I could use something called a subsurface division modifier
127

128
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.560
to do that for me.
128

129
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.430
In fact at the moment this might be a little too high poly depending on what we wanted to do with it.
129

130
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.490
Anyway it's good for the moment.
130

131
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.340
Stick with it.
131

132
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.640
Let's rename it is no longer a pin profile is it.
132

133
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.280
It's a bowling pin.
133

134
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.820
I'm gonna rename it appropriately.
134

135
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.220
There we go bowling pin.
135

136
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.690
They'll also shift it out of the way of these ones that we just called pin before.
136

137
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.060
So now I have my bowling pin objects.
137

138
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.740
Well I'll have a look at it in lookdev, look at that nice and shiny.
138

139
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.430
Well it's not shiny yet.
139

140
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.860
It's kind of a bit meh to be honest.
140

141
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.340
And that's because it's got it's default material on it.
141

142
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.320
So there were a couple of things that I think we're going to do in the next couple of lectures.
142

143
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.460
Well I know we're going to do them the pin stripes.
143

144
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.190
No they're not called pin stripes, the stripes that go across the top there.
144

145
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.500
pin stripes would be vertical would look pretty awesome.
145

146
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.710
So we've got the stripes to go across and perhaps make it a lot shinier.
146

147
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.570
I know looking at bowling pins they often have you know when they're worn they have scuffs and things
147

148
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.950
on.
148

149
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.320
But when there new they're pretty shiny.
149

150
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.390
So we need to sort that out as well.
150

151
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.430
That'll be being one of the future lectures so I'm happy with that.
151

152
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.910
I hope you're really happy with yours.
152

153
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.760
I hope it's coming together really well.
153

154
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.470
And please do share your work over in the discussions we've got something we can show off now to go
154

155
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.770
and show itself and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
