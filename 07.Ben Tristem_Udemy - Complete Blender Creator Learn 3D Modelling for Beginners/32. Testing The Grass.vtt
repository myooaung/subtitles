00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.360
Welcome to testing the grass in this video.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.190
You will name your new texture layer.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.930
You'll turn back on the camera and lighting and the grass layer as well.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.400
Right so the first thing I'm going to do is actually get rid of the node editor for the moment because

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.420
it's taking up a vast proportion of my screen.

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.140
So Scott the 3D view on here and I'm on Lay 5 at the moment looking down here on the head a bar and

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.410
I want to bring back my tall shelf I'm going to hide my propertys panel and then go to my layer's tab

8
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.000
which we added on earlier and let's have a look at what we need.

9
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.940
So I'm going to name this texture's or even more precise the grass textures.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
And it's on its gogreen tick next to it.

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.830
Brilliant.

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.960
Let's do the.

13
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.590
Cameron lighting.

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.110
Turn that on.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.860
And the grass as well.

16
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.810
Brilliant.

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.120
So now we've got all of those things on.

18
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.830
You never guess what.

19
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.900
OKAY GUYS IT'S challenge time.

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.270
I'd like you to test render the grass so rotate your grass around its origins how it's pointing towards

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.880
the sky the way the grass naturally grows and group the blades close together.

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.110
At the moment they're quite spread out and spread them out a little on the x and y axis to give them

23
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.570
some depth.

24
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.600
Then finally do a test render and see how it looks.

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.080
It won't be amazing at this stage.

26
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.490
Oh and remember to set up a camera as well.

27
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.350
Suppose a video now and give that a go.

28
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.830
Okay guys welcome back.

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.280
Let's go and render out this grass and see how it's looking.

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.960
Okay guys welcome back into blender.

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.340
What we need to do first of all is grab some of these blades of grass and make sure I'm moved one about

32
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.110
earlier I think it was this one.

33
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.840
If you've done that as well you will want to make sure to get rid of the tool shelf that the Z coordinate

34
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.860
is zero because we moved our regions earlier but didn't do I mean that one about anyway so I'm going

35
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.010
to rotate it around.

36
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.810
At the moment the best way to rotate it round is on the x axis.

37
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.780
So I'm simply in the tall shelf here going to go x 90 and I'm going to do that to everything else as

38
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.890
well so x.

39
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.620
They're 90.

40
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.820
Oh I selected the plane itself.

41
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.060
Let's just try selecting the right thing.

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.990
Ninety.

43
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.930
Okay.

44
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.840
That's all a I've picked the wrong thing.

45
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.050
And that one's not.

46
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.550
I've not moved the origin for that one yet so we'll go back and do that one last.

47
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.930
Let's change this one X 90 and the final one in the distance.

48
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.110
I nailed it.

49
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.630
They're brilliant.

50
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.860
So those are all there.

51
00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.730
Let's go into this image here and move the origin so I'm going to pull it out of the ground initially

52
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.320
so can see what's going on.

53
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.650
That's There is the bottom.

54
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.060
That's just make sure it's right at the bottom on the tall shelf.

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.070
I'm going to go tools set origin to the 3-d cursor brilliance that's now done.

56
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.210
I'm going to get rid of the tool shelf.

57
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.750
I'm going to lower the origin.

58
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640
Essentially that's what were moving here.

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.840
Down to zero.

60
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.540
And rotate it's on the x axis by all not moving they're rotated by 90.

61
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.460
Okay so we've got our blades of grass here and I want to render them out.

62
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.600
So the first thing I'm going to do is put them a bit closer to one another.

63
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.470
And I'm going to be a bit adventurous and scale this one up.

64
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.460
This one up even more.

65
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.790
And that one can stay the same size as well.

66
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.880
But I'm going to put them on a scale up just a little.

67
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.270
And Gollum put them rather close to one another so we can see how they're going to render.

68
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.390
In fact I'm going to give them a bit of depth both ways as well just to make it a little bit more exciting

69
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.260
although it's not going to be a great render anyway at this stage.

70
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.930
Now I'm going to have to set up a camera.

71
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.300
I'm pretty sure that none of them at the moment are looking at what's I want to look at.

72
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.020
So I'm going to grab the camera I set up earlier to do exactly that.

73
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.470
We shall see.

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.890
I can.

75
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.420
It is the current camera I believe.

76
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.870
But if not we'll just make sure it is a science a good asset the active object as the camera.

77
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.480
And on the propertys mania another lock the camera to view.

78
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.400
So I can move it about now.

79
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.810
This is looking like it's a silly amounts of zoom on it.

80
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.910
I'm not sure.

81
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.790
No it's because I'm zoomed all the way out here.

82
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.170
Now if I lock should be a bit easier to control I'm going to make my view bigger as normal.

83
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.310
You probably won't have to do this.

84
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.140
I'm just doing it because I can't see what's going on otherwise.

85
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.030
And let's zoom in here.

86
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.510
It's position the camera come back out again.

87
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.720
See how it looks when we got rendered mode on and we can see some shadows coming off there.

88
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.610
Now something is incredibly bright in our scene and it's probably one of the lights.

89
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.020
So let's go and see how that's turning out really really bright.

90
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.300
I've got my lamp here my sunlamp set up to an intensity of 11.

91
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.970
Let's lower that down.

92
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.380
That's much better and we can move around now obviously because they're a flat image of we go side on.

93
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.110
That's not going to be a very exciting render.

94
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.240
But let's go to about there.

95
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.150
Try and get everything in shots.

96
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.190
Excellent.

97
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.410
I'm going to go to my render tab here and just make sure my settings are set up.

98
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.880
I'm happy with 50 percent of 10 80 P on the dimensions.

99
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.170
Scroll down and look at the samples.

100
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.830
Now my render is set at 100 that's going to be a bit too high for a test render.

101
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.310
So I'm going to lower it down to 25.

102
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.620
In fact that might be too high later on when our scene gets more complicated.

103
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.650
And let's scroll down a little further.

104
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.680
And yet I've got my tile size optimal because I'm using my s.p. you.

105
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:22.480
Let's just make sure that the world for some reason I have lost Yes I've lost my Sky box that we created

106
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.800
ervice.

107
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.920
I'm just going to add that in really quick so environment texture there a lovely pink environment at

108
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.760
the moment.

109
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.630
I'm going to use a Mirrorball and I'm going to go ahead and open up it's one of these angular maps that

110
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.970
I was using previously.

111
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.300
I think it was the one of the sun angular mapped well.

112
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.860
Open that image.

113
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.020
That looks much better.

114
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.900
In fact we can then have some sky and it is well perfect.

115
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.310
How did you guys get on.

116
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.290
I'm going to render my image out now and I'm going to post mine in discussions because that looks like

117
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.100
some pretty good grass in a wasteland of white.

118
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.680
We'll need to sort that out.

119
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.990
Post your grass in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
