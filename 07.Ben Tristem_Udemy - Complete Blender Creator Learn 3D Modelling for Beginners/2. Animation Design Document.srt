00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,630
In this lecture we're going to focus on actually getting our animation design document nailed down.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,180
It's important that we don't have scope slip and end up doing things and going off on a tangent.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,310
Now much like every other project that we've done so far we need to have a design document so that we

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,990
can stick to it and know that we've succeeded.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,160
And these are recommendations when I say 10 seconds or 30 frames per second later on.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,190
These are examples probably close to what I'm going to stick to as I go through.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,700
You can feel free to modify these and we'll go through the impact that might have in this lecture.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,170
So first of all the length the longer the animation is the longer it's going to take to make.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,270
Ten seconds is a nice sweet spot.

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,740
Five is probably a little on the short side and 30 is probably the absolute limit.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,940
We want to do here.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,630
Unless you've done animation before and you really want to stretch your legs the frame rate itself 30

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,500
frames per second is a relatively good frame rate for what we're going to be working on it's going to

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,810
show smooth animation it's not going to be jerky but also it's not going to take too long to render

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,890
out our animation.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,830
The higher that frame rates coupled with the longer the animation will be the longer your render times

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,390
will be regardless of using eval cycles.

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,710
Something to bear in mind also frame rate may be dictated outside of blender so you were making assets

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,780
that you wanted to use in a game engine you would need to make sure that all of your assets had similar

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,240
frames per second because it's really really a pain in the backside if you're importing assets into

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,700
a game engine and they've all got different frame rates that can really slow down workflow when it comes

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
to exporting and importing assets.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,600
So for this project we're going to find and set a certain frame rate.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
And again it's up to you what you set.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,260
I'm probably going to go with 30 frames per second because that's a nice intermediate frame rate.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,160
It's not gonna be too jerky was that the same time.

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,280
Not taking too longer to render the number of cameras.

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,270
Now you could have multiple cameras in a scene it's only 10 seconds long or roughly around there.

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,040
So I'm going to focus on just having one camera we're also going to animate the camera and move it through

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,820
the scene itself.

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,260
So we don't want too much confusion there.

33
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,230
The number of characters so in this scene we have our animated lamp.

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,140
That's the main character again introducing more is just going to make it more complex and we want to

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,310
focus is the first time we've done animation on one individual character and just get them right now

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,330
the number of props I can imagine the scene at the moment where the animated lamp jumps onto something

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,750
perhaps knocks another thing off and then jumps off again.

38
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,660
So that to me means there's going to be one or two props.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,940
Again we want to keep the scene as simple as possible rather than complexity at this very early stage.

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,670
Finally we need to set up blender with these settings in mind so we don't forget to do that.

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,390
If you don't have these settings done right at the very beginning it can be a real pain to try and correct

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,750
them later on because your animation will be locked to certain frames with in blender.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,450
So we changed the frame rate it will look too fast or too slow so let's hop on over into a blender and

44
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,030
actually have a look at where these settings would be Hello everybody and welcome back over into blender.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,420
First of all a few things have changed with the blender interface recently we've got a couple of extra

46
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,810
icons at the top here and I will go back and amend the early videos to reflect what those are but also

47
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,000
there's a bit of extra color and I really find this sort of thing useful as when they were all gray

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,700
it was quite difficult to differentiate all of these different icons but now they're color coded as

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,870
well which draws your eye to the appropriate one.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,180
Okay.

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,470
So first of all let's have a look at the number of frames within the scene and the frame rates.

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,430
Those are the two that are going to make up the length of the scene.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,970
Now never we go over to our output tab click on that in the properties and I'm just going to open this

54
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,950
up just a little there we go and scroll down.

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,940
We get this frame starts frame and the number of steps now that can be useful as I was saying earlier

56
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,740
you can change the apparent frame rate especially when rendering something early on because we don't

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,580
need all the information and the frame rate is just here.

58
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,600
So for instance if we wanted to set up 30 frames per second and it last 10 seconds.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,420
So we changed the frame rate here and we can select 30 frames per second but that won't last for 10

60
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,050
seconds.

61
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,730
What we need to do is set the total number of frames here starting at 1.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,520
The end would be 300.

63
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,110
That is a total including one and 300 of 10 seconds worth because we simply divide the number of frames

64
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,280
we have by the frame rate.

65
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,770
And that gives us how many seconds it's going to last.

66
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,980
So this is how I'd have it set up if I wanted a 10 second clip running at 30 frames per second.

67
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:01,360
If you wanted a twenty four frames per second and it lasted 10 seconds this would be 240 and if we have

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,300
a look down at the very bottom here and bring this area up we see that we have a start and end here.

69
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,580
And when we've been changing this area here whether we've got the start and end frames you notice that

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,940
this area here was also changing.

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,510
So you can change things as usual in multiple places in blender.

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,940
So now what I've shown you those two places it's time for your challenge.

73
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,220
Okay.

74
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,620
So your challenge Write down your animation specification now and you're going to stick to it for the

75
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,220
remainder of this section.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,900
So think about the length the frame rate the number of cameras.

77
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,680
Characters number of props that you're going to have in your scene.

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,380
And then once you've decided on those factors what you will need to do is set up blender accordingly.

79
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,790
Even the default settings won't match up unless you specifically pick 25 frames per second.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,620
That of course because you don't want to lose those settings.

81
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,010
Save the blender file as whatever you like I'm gonna call mine animated lamp.

82
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,950
So go ahead pause a video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

83
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,860
Let's go ahead now.

84
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,390
Hop on over into blender and set everything up.

85
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,660
So it's right for my specification of course if you're following along exactly you can follow along

86
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,500
here as well.

87
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,620
OK so this is where we left over in Blender.

88
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,080
Now I'm going to have a length of 10 seconds and a frame rate of 30 frames per second so I'm going to

89
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
set this to 300.

90
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,200
And so we've got a start and end frame yet that's fine and set the frame rate to 30 frames per second.

91
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:31,460
OK.

92
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,710
So let's have a look at the rest of our scene we've got one camera one keep one light.

93
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,200
Now the light itself.

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,820
I'm gonna get rid of that at this moments in time.

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,050
We can set up our own lights later on we may even only use the lights within the lamp itself that could

96
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,160
be quite interesting see how that works out.

97
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,290
The camera I'm going to leave one camera in there and I'm gonna get rid of the default cube whilst it

98
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,230
could act as maybe a prop within our scene the place hold a prop I'm gonna add in things specifically

99
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,810
ASM when I need them.

100
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,980
So there we go my basic scene is all set up.

101
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,070
I'm going to leave this area at the bottom called the time line down at the bottom as well.

102
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,330
If you don't have that remember any point you can click towards the very top of any of these blender

103
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,410
windows and drag down to create a new area and we can change the edit to type by clicking in the top

104
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,260
left and then we can change that to timeline itself if yours doesn't have that there you can see there's

105
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,000
this bit that you can pull out as well which should give us a summary of what we're changing but we'll

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,020
get to that soon.

107
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,500
Okay.

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,410
Everything there sets up apart from I've got multiple ones of these.

109
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,330
There we go.

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,350
That looks good to me.

111
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,730
I'm going to save my file into the animated lamp now whilst I'm in here I'm going to click the plus

112
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,390
key next to favorites.

113
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,030
So adds it to my favorites list if that area isn't there remember you've got this little hidden area

114
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,090
here that often likes hiding important places.

115
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,480
We got animated lamp in there and I'm going to call this animated LAMP AND THERE WE GO WE'RE ALL SET

116
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,570
UP AND READY TO START WORK IF YOU'VE GONE FOR SOME DIFFERENT SETTINGS I'd love to know why perhaps you

117
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,930
are planning on exporting to a game engine or you're using the footage with in something else that requires

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,970
the frame rate to be set that way please do share how you've set up your file over in the discussions

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,250
and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
