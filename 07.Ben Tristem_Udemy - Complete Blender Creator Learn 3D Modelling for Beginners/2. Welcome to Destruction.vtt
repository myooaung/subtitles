Hey so welcome to this section on destruction.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.670
So we're going to be focussing purely on destruction so there's lots of extra things that you could

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.730
probably include as we're going along to make it prettier or whatever you want to do with it.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
We're going to take a look at destroying meshes in a couple of ways.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.540
First by fracturing the mesh itself.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.610
And of course physical destruction.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.660
Now this is great for hard objects that snap or crumble et cetera et cetera.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.670
So let's go have a look at what can be accomplished.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.510
Boom.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270
Tank bursting through the wall.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.360
Now I have not gone about in place.

12
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.110
There's a bit vigil bricks itself the tank going through the wall has actually done that for us and

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.920
a bit of extra.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.020
From what's called a forcefield which you'll learn about shortly.

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.180
But what does this look like in action.

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.800
Well it looks like this and as we can see the wall blows apart and the tank busts through.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.790
Now this animation is not going to win any particular awards but it is a great basis on how to get started.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.270
So welcome to the section.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.040
Let's go ahead and start destroying things over in blender.
