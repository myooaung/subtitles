1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,350
In this video where vertex painting our head and adding a layer of detailing these layers so to show

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,900
you how to blend the various layers so that you can tweak and shoot in a non-destructive fashion when

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,030
it comes to painting your models.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,560
Okay let's get started.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,850
We're back into our head sculpt file I'm going to start you off with a challenge to get everything set

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,750
up for painting vertex painting our head so get the point where you're ready add some lights I'm gonna

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,860
add three point light to my scene make sure you have a material there might be a material at the moment

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,180
but make sure you do have one rename your vertex color layer to base or something similar main that's

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:46,390
it's gonna be the main color of of your model and then setup your shader Ed so you can see the base

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:52,060
layer in render view remember how we did that in the previous video how we can see it by plugging in

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,500
that base layer so that we can see what's going on there when we're in our render view and then to create

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,720
a palette and to select main skin color to so find a color that you think represents what you're going

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,030
for in your painting so there's you challenge posed a video take that on and then I will jump in when

14
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,790
you come back right I'll start off with setting up some lines I'm going to object mode I'll do this

15
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,560
very quickly just a three point lighting we've done this before so I'll do it super quick sticks for

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,120
you shift a at a light g to move it out I think I need to have it more powerful I've got it currently

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,480
at 10 let's make this rule go 200 nice and big point.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,300
There we go.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,210
And then shift to move over to the right shift team move to the back on just a little bit of finessing

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,630
of this

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,890
I'm going to change my view so in viewpoint shading click on the little selector instead of having the

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,760
mo cap lighting I'm going to click on just the first one basic lighting so that we're not looking at

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,900
clay and then when I go into my render view let's move the lights around a little bit to get what we're

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,950
looking for we'll have this be our main light pump up the power on that little bit more

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:14,190
Okay next up click back on head and jump in a vertex paint Moz I'm good and ready over there let's find

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,480
whether we have a material at the moment I do have a material if you didn't then just click plus and

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,060
add in a material rename this make this head material so it's nice and clear.

28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,760
Excellent.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,390
What's up next on our list of tattoos rename our last so click down on our object data properties open

30
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,400
up vertex colors I'm gonna rename this to base it's all about the bass no treble.

31
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:41,970
Next we're looking at our shader editor so up in the very top left in our second window I'm going to

32
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,980
select shader ED From here you can see because we have a material set up we're ready to go I'm going

33
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,020
to shift a inputs vertex colors base let's hook the base into the base color it's not going to do much

34
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,360
over here and then the final step on our list was to select a color that we're gonna have as our main

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,430
color back up to our active tools scroll up scroll up we're going to scroll around there and say oh

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,290
yeah near enough is good enough for that color but I to get a little bit more precise so I've searched

37
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,830
for skin color hex values in the Google and I Okay this is roughly the color I'm looking for f f DFC

38
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,420
for it see if I can remember that and I will click on my color select.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,160
So underneath the color wheel I'll click on the color we currently have selected and or created I guess

40
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:37,840
click on hex and it was f f d something's up or something f before for FC 4.

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,270
Okay so make yours whatever color you think is relevant.

42
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm going to shift.

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,000
K Well master over it.

44
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,420
There we go.

45
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:50,020
That's kind of a general Clay look and color specific kind of whitish yellowish pinkish it's near enough

46
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,230
is good enough I think for the moment because we're gonna be doing a little bit of painting and then

47
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,400
as I said a new color palette and we'll add this to our color palette so we don't lose it.

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,690
Okay.

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,660
Great we're ready to go.

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,350
So on the base layer we're going to add a little bit of detail.

51
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,370
I've gone in swapped out my reference so every now and again I guess we'll go have a look at our reference

52
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,160
the lighting in my image is pretty crummy.

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,930
Not very good at all it's very blown out very very overly exposed I think.

54
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,460
So I can do a little bit of poetic license when it comes to painting my character.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
But you can see there's a pink color around the mouth.

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,930
It's a little bit darker on the nose in between the with a mono brow would be in between the eyeballs

57
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,620
and I've got a little bit of stubble action going on there.

58
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,660
So bearing that in mind I'm going to change the color a little bit more over to the right side to get

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,570
a bit more pink going on in what we're doing.

60
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:46,180
Decrease the strength six point six ish decrease my brush size just a little bit of painting over areas

61
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,200
where we want the color to be a little bit different little bit Pinker a little bit more blood vessels

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,970
going on if you will around the mouth definitely my computer starting to hemorrhage a little bit so

63
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,890
my apologies if the recording goes a little bit wonky or a little bit fuzzy it's saying to me Rick it's

64
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:06,800
time to get a new computer because Blender is a greedy beast okay paint is a little bit with this pink

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,670
color just putting in some accents are going to increase the brush size and just a little bit of splurging

66
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,840
around on the head so it's not one big old solid color.

67
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,320
I think skin it's good to get in some.

68
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,600
I was gonna say texture it's not really texture per say it's just some difference some some variations

69
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,330
so it doesn't look quite so flat.

70
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,900
And then I'm going to get these the Blur tool and just do a little bit of blur.

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,250
Make sure it's not there's no harsh lines were saying you won't have it so it looks like it's a little

72
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,850
bit more blended a little bit more natural.

73
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,730
We didn't talk about this much in the last video but there's a little bit of a question why on earth

74
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,930
would we vertex paint why wouldn't we do texture painting texture painting we can get a lot more detail

75
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,580
we can putting all the freckles and moles and dots is a lot more power is going on we're not constrained

76
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,470
just by how many vertices we've got nous in our scene or on our model it's because of the speed we don't

77
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,160
have to do the UVA unwrapping we don't have to read apologize we can just paint straight on our models

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
so if we do have a lot of vertices then it helps from that perspective so that's why we're doing this

79
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:12,830
it's probably not as good in terms of final quality as if we unwrap and paint right onto our texture.

80
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,680
But from a speed point of view we can get lots of really great results without having to go through

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,620
that step.

82
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,290
Our base not too bad and I just realized why my computer is struggling it's because I'm painting in

83
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,920
render view I'm going gonna go back into my solid view now everything's gonna go much much more quickly

84
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,750
it's not going to hopefully anyway.

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,040
One thing you might consider doing that I often forget to do is you can click on symmetry so that we

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,670
can just be painting one side and have it mirrored at this point.

87
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,950
I often like to get a little bit of variation so it doesn't look exactly symmetrical symmetry saves

88
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,310
a lot of time but faces aren't symmetrical so I think it's good to sometimes have symmetry turned off

89
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,440
if you're not doing a lot of work I'm gonna jump back into my shader editor view because what we'd like

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,610
to do here is add a second layer scroll back down to our object data properties open that up you can

91
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:10,000
see on a vertex colors I'm going to click on plus add a new layer here this layer is going to be called

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,070
see dark because I'm gonna be adding the dark patches under the eyes and so that we can visualize it

93
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,720
over in our shade.

94
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,050
Ed I'm going to shift input vertex colors and dark now dark.

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,220
I'll connect that color up to the base color so that should be what we're looking at in the range of

96
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,960
you click on the render view now it's going to show what we previously had which is nice of it which

97
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,410
is cool.

98
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,550
Okay now I want to start from a blank canvas the way I'll do that is to jump into selecting White and

99
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,350
the quick way to do that is click on RG B and make sure the values are set to 1 someone white here shift

100
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:52,030
K so now we have no color information at all on our sculpture I'm going to choose a bluey kind of color

101
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,470
add that to the palettes not super dark I'm going to turn the strength down down down down although

102
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,300
it doesn't matter so much if you have the strength a little bit higher because we are going to blend

103
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:09,400
these two together we'll go put the splotches under the eyes here if you keep your mouse held down then

104
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,860
it's not going to build up the color on top of each other so you can get into the spots that you want

105
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,960
if I let go and then hold down again it's gonna be adding more dark on top of dark so just bear that

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,170
in mind as you putting things down and I could have added symmetry and this would have made things a

107
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:29,650
little bit easier but as I said before I'd like to get some variation so that it's not exactly symmetrical

108
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,480
so long as it doesn't take too much time so I get these dark colors in here we're gonna blend it so

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,550
that we get the right amount of darkness not too much it's currently looking like a raccoon superhero

110
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,110
axe I'm going to jump back over into my solid shading just in case that's going to speed things up a

111
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,720
little bit so we're not sitting there rendering back over to our shader Ed we're going to shift a and

112
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,020
search for mics are G.B. that will mix our RG base on mix our colors drop that down that'll speech things

113
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,970
around a bit color is automatically hooked to base color the color of the actually read here instead

114
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,550
of hooking into color one just to make things easy I'm going to have that hook to color too and our

115
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,310
base hooked to color one just so the lines aren't overlapping not that it matters just I feel it's a

116
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,400
little bit tidier and now we look at and say Oh that really didn't really do much.

117
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,820
That's because I'm not in my render view so jumped out a round of you prematurely.

118
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,330
Now that will blend the two together and you can see very subtle dark underneath the eyes here if I

119
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:31,990
drag to the right it will make it dark it basically say bring more of the color information from the

120
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,290
dark attribute if I drag to the left as I bring more of the color from the base however you can see

121
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,250
that as we move to the right our whole guide becomes like a ghost that's not what we once I'm going

122
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,300
to change the blending properties from mix to color and drag it back down again get it to the point

123
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,080
where it's subtle you can see there's a little bit of yucky artifact thing going on there if you're

124
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,560
getting that pronounced on yours you can always go back to your light reconnect color to base color

125
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,620
form so that's what we're visualizing in here and then jump back up to you tools have a little paint

126
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,700
round in here see if it needs more detail more down the bottom see if it needs to be blurred.

127
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,310
See if that's because you don't have enough vertices in there perhaps or it could be that our base is

128
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,900
white and it would be better for us to have our base as more of a pink color so we can experiment with

129
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,610
that just giving you a couple of solutions in case things have gone astray when you you're merging so

130
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,060
if we do.

131
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,550
Back to this that will wipe all the information we had Poppy now blue again and it is symmetry this

132
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,600
time just to speed it up

133
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,360
OK.

134
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:43,670
Now let's plug the colors back color to color so color of our mixed into color and that'll show us what

135
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,370
the mix looks like okay that's fixed a little bit of that problem it's made our character more on the

136
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,250
kind of base color than we might want so it's a process a process of experimenting how much you want

137
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,950
it makes how much you want to blend if we move all to the right then we've got these kind of very pronounced

138
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,400
underneath if we drag more to the left then they go away and our base comes through sir.

139
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,800
And about there I think just have a little bit of that subtle blueness in there.

140
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,470
But the cool thing is we can easily jump back in and dock in that up in our actual painting on our layer

141
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,720
which if I paint now that's what's happening where painting the darkness and it's being blended as we

142
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
want it to.

143
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,930
And you know I think on this layer on this dark layer I'm also gonna do some detail for the lips.

144
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,590
I think that is a good place to do it.

145
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,720
So let's find a color that looks a little bit more lippy and darken it and see if that is giving us

146
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,710
the result we want again.

147
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,440
Make sure we're on the correct layer.

148
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,840
Make sure that our layering is coming through just dark and out the left I might make them a bit more

149
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,560
purples dark okay.

150
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,240
Because we have that underlying tone to it and then I'm going to give it a little bit of pink color.

151
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,100
Now you could do these as two different layers the eyes and the lips that's a totally perfectly cool

152
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,760
way of doing it.

153
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,830
I'm going to do them on the same just to speed things up a little bit but feel free to have as many

154
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,790
layers as you want.

155
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,860
You can blend them all together a little with this pink little bit apprehensive when I'm creating my

156
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,980
own mouth my own lips.

157
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,910
Because when you put a whole bunch of pink on your lips it makes you look a little bit more feminine.

158
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,740
I find some guys apprehensive about making my lips look too pink they probably needs to be a little

159
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,720
bit darker in the pink area.

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,170
I think

161
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,970
remember that we've got our blending going on here so I've got it at point eight strength but it's also

162
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,670
being blended at point four.

163
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,730
So it's not coming through super super strongly.

164
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm going to add this color to the palette just one of the colors I've been using because I realize

165
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,610
I've gone and painted lipstick all over the side of my face.

166
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,730
Let's go and recalibrate away.

167
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,520
Not too bad not perfect you get the point I'm showing you the technique here even if I'm not showing

168
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,500
you the best artistry on how to create these things but as we get to the end of the process things are

169
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,750
going to merge together a lot more cleanly so keep them reasonably contrasting at the moment so you

170
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,550
can see them in a pronounced way.

171
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,890
The thing I'm not digging is that I've lost a lot of my bass pink coloring so again while I found this

172
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,140
good blend between the two I'm going to go back to my first base level.

173
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,950
This is what we can do.

174
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,270
Jump between the layers it's totally okay to do this.

175
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,170
Jump back to base click on my tool just find the pink color and just get some of that pink back in the

176
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,230
nose and go to this other view so it's nice and easy and you can see here I'm looking at just the layer

177
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,510
that I've selected on when I do this and I'm gonna have to make this a little bit stronger for it to

178
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,880
show through that's what's what it's telling me here when I go to this base layer caucus when I go to

179
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,040
the rendered view you can see that's the amount of color that's coming through so it's great to jump

180
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,790
between these views if you want to paint okay now I'm painting just on the layer getting more of that

181
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,220
kind of redness around the mouth around the nose on the ears and then jump back into the range of you

182
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,510
to see how it looks after we've blended them together you can see a little bit of that's coming through

183
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,230
probably a little bit more up on the for head up here and then as I did before just a little bit of

184
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,740
coloration it sneaks through on the rest of the head.

185
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,830
Okay.

186
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,180
And then the last layer I'll do the super quickly.

187
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,920
I think you get the point by now as I'm gonna put a little bit of kind of dark a bead mark here I might

188
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,120
put some hair on that at some point but while we're just focusing on painting my goal here is just to

189
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
get a little bit of darkness for the beard.

190
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,540
So let's jump down to our object outer properties click a another layer we'll call this I'll call this

191
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,410
hair.

192
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,100
I think I might do hair on the top of the head as well we'll see how it goes up to you for how you want

193
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,840
to do yours if you're doing a lady you might not need to do these steps and over on the left let's open

194
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,000
up our Shada editor again shift a input vertex colors and hair.

195
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,090
I just made a little bit of mistakes I've undone a few things and edited that part of the video because

196
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,810
I accidentally put in another layer of dark and it looked really weird.

197
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,690
OK let's plug.

198
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,190
Actually no.

199
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:20,540
I'm gonna mix all these together and do this on the fly rather than just doing the hair the facial hair

200
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,030
and then merging them later let's do this all the same time to do that I'm going to shift a search for

201
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,960
mics are G.B. we'll plug this into base color then we'll plug the previous color that we'd mixed together

202
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,650
into color one and we'll head into color two instead of being mixed I'm going to changes to multiply

203
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,790
let's just do a quick experience ceremony to make sure we're doing what we think we're doing will do

204
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:50,480
a big dark patch in here paint that on on multiply if we turn that to the right it gets dark it's in

205
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,590
that to the left it gets lighter Yeah that's pretty much what we want to do now if I change out how

206
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,510
much we're multiplying here we're getting a pretty extreme effect on the rest of the body at the arrest

207
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,130
the head not just on the bit that we've painted down so let's undo that painting hook things back up

208
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,560
of gangs we did our undo.

209
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,170
We'll see if we can look at just that one layer so I'm going to drag hair into our base color of our

210
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:21,860
principal be SDF and this is what we're seeing we've got all of this information for that's been brought

211
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,680
in from our other layers it's copied it onto this layer the pinks and the the yellows as well as this

212
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,020
we'd kind of facial hair that we've painted down so I got to choose my white color now if I shift K

213
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,540
they'll make everything white I'll go back and grab my color plug it into my mixture where I'm multiplying

214
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:48,110
and then color from my multiply mix into base color so our first colors are going to multiply we're

215
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,390
multiplying this factor if I change it up and down we're not seeing a different look.

216
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:58,610
So that's why it's often good to recalibrate typically the color when you go to a new layer to make

217
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,390
it all white or to make it something that's relevant to the sort of mixture you're doing so make it

218
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,220
all white.

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,200
Now if we paint on hair make sure we're painting on hair we'll go and find a bluey kind of color tend

220
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,870
this strength down a little bit we should see the result of painting this and then if we think it's

221
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,680
not strong enough we can increase or decrease it

222
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,770
okay if I look at that light on that to be a little bit darker then we can just drag it up and we make

223
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,760
that facial hair kind of look a bit darker you know as a last step I will paint some hair this is gonna

224
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,010
be really different if you're working with a reference it does have hair there's different techniques

225
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,260
for us to do that you could have sculpted out the hair and then color the hair or we could add use hand

226
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,220
modifies will play around with later on but for now I'm just gonna paint a little bit of hair over the

227
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,410
top of my character just so it makes sense

228
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,600
one final thing I'll show you here just to illustrate the point of how cool this is using this system

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,340
is I've looked here it looks like my hair goes down too far and like I don't like that if I get back

230
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,060
into my solid view and click on object data properties then select hair you can see it just shows me

231
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,800
there's hair layer layer I can see where I've painted I know that it's this kind of bluish smudge I've

232
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,030
put around I've missed a couple of bits here that's good to see that I can for example go in and blur

233
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,080
that and smooth it down.

234
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,210
Good to know but also there's this bit here on like oh how did I do that.

235
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,970
Don't like that at all because I've got this white under color here if I go and grab White from my color

236
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:37,940
palette I can paint up very cleanly very accurately to remove that and get the precision that I want

237
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:44,330
for that particular part of my coloring and then when I click on my shade of view you can see that it

238
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,210
has nicely merged them together.

239
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,840
That's a good way of working just on a layer and to see the impact.

240
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,320
I like to work in a way or I can see what the final result is going to be but it's also really nice

241
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,610
to be out to see what the raw layout just on its own is doing okay.

242
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,290
So that's all I wanted to cover in this video.

243
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,970
Great stuff.

244
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,450
I look forward to seeing what you've come up with please do post in the discussions if you've got something

245
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,400
you would like to share and I'll see you in the next lecture.
