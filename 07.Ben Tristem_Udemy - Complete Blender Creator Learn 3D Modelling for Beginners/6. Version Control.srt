Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,190
In this lecture I'd like to talk to you about version control.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:17,540
Now there are various forms of this but I'm talking specifically about proper version control software

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,750
rather than just keeping backups.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:28,220
We are embarking on a rather large project where if you make a mistake midway through it could haunt

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,660
you.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,940
And this is the sort of work that can take hours of your time to do so it's great if you could just

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,810
step back a little so version control is kind of like zipping up your projects and giving it a specific

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,200
name only because we're working with models and textures and things like that.

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:54,620
It just tracks the changes it's exactly how I keep track of how my lectures are progressing.

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,990
And so if I make a mistake when recording I can just revert everything back to the end of the previous

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,560
lecture.

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,050
So version control is incredibly useful and when now at the point in the course where it's going to

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,020
really help a lot of you out now it's not mandatory but it's highly highly recommended.

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,530
And if you who have done coding would have had version control at some point in your teaching.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,790
So what are the benefits.

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,510
Well it makes rolling back to a previous state incredibly easy.

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:32,800
It allows you to test and practice and just try things out without the worry of breaking your projects.

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:40,520
Now this is incredibly important to do because I've seen people inadvertently run out of un dos on blender

20
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,250
and I've done it myself where I've made the load of minor changes didn't like it and it turned out there

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,420
were two options I could ever work with what I've got or start from the previous save which might have

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,050
been a few minutes ago to have 30 minutes ago if you're really focused on something but what you can

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,050
do is you can commit your changes when it comes to source control and then you can just move on from

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,860
there.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,810
Now you can share your repositories where your information is stored online.

26
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,110
So it's great for having a project if you are working on multiple computers.

27
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,750
That's how I'm able to work on all of my various computers.

28
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,720
I make sure that any of my information that I want to share is available and not only that it means

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,250
that the history is available on every machine so it's not just like sharing a blend file on Dropbox

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,570
it's much more detailed.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,650
It's like showing the blend file on dropbox with every single change that you've ever done.

32
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,990
Now Dropbox has its own versioning.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,830
If you ever did need to recover something you'd have to do it blindly.

34
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,440
Now this would be a great time to make sure we do actually have a course dedicated to version control.

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,120
It can become quite an involved process with lots of different options but the very basics of it means

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,300
that you can just roll back to a previous version.

37
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,940
Now software front ends I'd recommend source try and get crackin as those front ends.

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,680
Personally I use get crackin.

39
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:20,030
I really like the way that it works and I'm able to just commit any of my changes save those with a

40
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,740
name which I know I can go back to and then I can just continue working and it does mean that I'm able

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,620
to go back to previous versions of my work if I've made a mistake.

42
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,890
So that's my brief going over of version control and I wholeheartedly recommend it to people is the

43
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,140
next step home from backup.

44
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,740
It allows you to try out new things without the repercussions of getting something wrong because you've

45
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,770
always got the option to go back to a named version in history.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,930
So if you're interested do check out our course on it to learn much more.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,550
Otherwise check it out and see how you get on with it and I'll see you will in the next lecture.
