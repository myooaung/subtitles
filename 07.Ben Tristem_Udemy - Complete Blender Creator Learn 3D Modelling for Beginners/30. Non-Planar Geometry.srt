Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.
1

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:12,010
We're gonna have a look at Non planar geometry is not something that you're going to come across that
2

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,570
often but when you do it can be a real pain to try and sort it out.
3

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,080
If you didn't realize what was going on and to really accentuate what's going on in solid shaded mode
4

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm going to use the drop down on the right hand side and turn on cavity.
5

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:36,490
What this will do is it will add a ridge and a valley to some parts of our model really emphasising its
6

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,600
shape.
7

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm going to delete the cube and since we're talking about planes let's just add in a single mesh object
8

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,550
that's a plane and scale it up.
9

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,140
So we shouldn't see any shadows or anything special to do with a plane.
10

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,270
So what does non plane the geometry actually mean.
11

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,800
Well at the moment all of these four vertices that make up this single plane pass through this same
12

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,230
plane which means that we get a nice flat shaded quad.
13

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:17,560
Now if we wanted that to be a slightly different shape I could go into edit mode grab of one individual
14

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,910
vertex and start moving it.
15

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,960
So if I go G, Z the moment that I move it it is now non plainer.
16

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,190
So the quad exists but how does this shape come about.
17

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,280
So I'm really emphasizing it at this point and we can see we've got this diagonal line going across
18

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,670
it now and it's it's kind of guess that that's kind of the shape that it's going to have interesting
19

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,600
what happens if I grab this one and lift it up even higher.
20

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,180
We can see that it's created a valley between the two so it's decided blender has decided that that's
21

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,770
where it will bend it will fold it will cut and you will get that horrible line going down it.
22

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,820
Now it may be a line that you want.
23

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,120
However I've seen scenes or so especially in a game engine where this has happened where you've got
24

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,360
non planet geometry and it's supposed to be a flat surface and you end up with this horrible Triangle.
25

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
This shading artifact running across the surface of your model.
26

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,590
Now obviously I've lifted this up quite an extreme amount.
27

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,390
However if it was lower down you can see also has that issue and that's something that is important
28

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,370
to be aware of when you're making anything that's flat shaded.
29

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,620
Now one way around this is to use the edge split modifier but something that I found a lot easier to
30

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,250
manage is to actually have all of your models smooth shaded.
31

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,930
So if I come out into object mode and shade smooth this line will still be here for the moment because
32

33
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,110
we're deliberately emphasizing the cavities.
33

34
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,910
So we'll turn that off if we go into rendered mode.
34

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,060
It does look like it's shaded smooth but let's zoom out a little bit further.
35

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,390
Let's not have a single plane but a real object.
36

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,720
So we have a cube in our scene now.
37

38
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,650
Let's go into edit mode and grab this top page and just lift it up ever so slightly.
38

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,320
Now if we turn on smooth shading we get a horrible looking cube because we're trying to smooth shade
39

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,780
something that isn't smooth.
40

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,970
It's got these sharp angular edges.
41

42
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,690
If you do have something like this what you can do is go down to your mesh data properties go down to
42

43
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,950
the normals dropdown and turn on the auto smooth feature.
43

44
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,070
This will solve not only that horrible shading artifact that we have when we're doing this low poly
44

45
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,200
modelling but also this will help cover up any non plainer geometry.
45

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,490
And since all of our models are made up of quads like the top of the queen's crown we want to make sure
46

47
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,810
that any triangles that do appear are deliberate ones not ones that actually spoil the look of our model
47

48
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,440
completely and that's it for this quick tip on non planet geometry.
48

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,570
If you do end up having triangles appearing on your quads shading your object's smooth and then going
49

50
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,810
to the mesh data properties and setting your normals to auto smooth and you may have to adjust the angle
50

51
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,990
the special on some of the pieces but that should solve any extra artifact that you do not want in your
51

52
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,870
final model.
52

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,180
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
