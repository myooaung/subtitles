00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,080
Welcome to texture's with transparency in this video you will learn how to use cycles nodes to apply

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,610
transparency to your image and use groups for nodes for simplicity and then use those node groups again

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,500
on other materials.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,150
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,280
So this is where we left off before and of course I'm now going to guide you through.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,910
First of all the solution to the last challenge and I'll talk through the workings as I go.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,190
So I'm going to make this a lot larger here.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,410
All I need to see is a thin sliver of the material at the top.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,570
So I'm going to get rid of this tangent nodes that I've added and I'm going to add in now the first

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,880
thing we need to interact with light how light is interacting with a surface that's going to be a shader.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,340
So I'm going to add a shade darker shade a shade.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,110
There we go.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,280
And it's how it's going to be transparence.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,520
Along here we've got a transparent B sdf.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,950
Now some of you might want to know what B S D F stands for.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,390
Well it stands for bi directional scattering distribution function.

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,780
And if we have a look at the wikipedia article for it we can see it's a series of Count relations of

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,300
how light interacts with surfaces where it hits them.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,100
And there's loads of other types of interactions as well.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,110
Do you go ahead and read this wikipedia article for more information on how it actually works.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,390
But suffice to say it details how light interacts with a surface.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,650
So let's get rid of that and hop straight back into a blender.

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,000
So we need to link both of these outputs to the surface.

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,880
Now the surface determines what's the actual surface of the middle of the geometry is going to look

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,450
like here.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,000
So if we try and link them together we'll see we get one or the other.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Now the good thing there is it does look like when we had transparency and just transparency we it goes

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,430
transparent so that's a good thing Hello that is working.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,730
Now we've got to mix these two together and they're both shaders So we need to mix a shader.

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,260
Now I'm going to go to add and shade and then let's say there's something called mix in here.

31
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,250
There is mix shader.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,370
So if we select that and literally we can pop anything on top of something like that and it puts it

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,820
in.

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,770
Now before we connect the other one let's just move this factor up and down.

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,620
Okay so I can see there that when the factor is at zero this top one is 100 percent.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,670
And as we go down it gets less and less and less and eventually becomes black which is zero.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,250
So that means it's got nothing of this one and 100 per cent of this bottom one.

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,220
So with that in place Let's disconnect that for a moment and play with the other one that's this one

39
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,690
in and see what happens.

40
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,840
So again with it's at 100 percent of the bottom one here it's black.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
There's nothing going on.

42
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,890
And if we move it all the way this way.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,820
It becomes all black and white still so we still got the alpha channel plugged into the colour let's

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,270
read link the colour to the colour so we can see what's going on so we can see here it goes from 100

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,430
percent the image itself all the way down to nothing because there's nothing plugged into the bottom

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,800
one.

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,240
So let's go ahead and plug in the transparent shade and see what happens.

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,650
So let's move this backwards and forwards.

49
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:34,070
So we can see we're going from 100 percent of the diffuse to a hundred percent of the transparence.

50
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,550
That's not quite what we want to do.

51
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,220
Let's try these round the other way.

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,650
And moving them up and down that won't replug them in looking going to swap these round here and see

53
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,420
what that does it swaps it around for us.

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,100
So we go to 100 percent of the transparency to the image itself.

55
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,910
Okay that's starting to look better but we need to control this not on an overall scale but on a pixel

56
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,610
wide pixel case.

57
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,800
Now what we can do is we can use this alpha channel which we've already seen creates a mask a black

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,810
and white image.

59
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,840
That's what it looks like.

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,680
So if I plug the alferd channel straight into one of these shaders and remove that then we can see here

61
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:23,530
that the alpha channel itself just gives black and white how we can use that to control because it's

62
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,830
a great node it's output in a value for every single pixel here.

63
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,000
We can use that Alpha channel here to plug in to the factor.

64
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,000
Excellent.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,060
Let's remove it from the shade of air and let's link these back up and see what effect we have.

66
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,240
Right that doesn't look quite right at the moment.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,490
Let's try reversing these round.

68
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,140
So let's put the diffuser on the bottom.

69
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,020
Ah ha.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,770
Brilliant.

71
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,510
That's looking much better.

72
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,100
It's completely transparent.

73
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,760
I think I'm going to move over the top of this one here and lift it up.

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,430
Excellent.

75
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,950
So we're seeing straight through it.

76
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,490
That's absolutely brilliant right.

77
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,020
So now we've got a nice little set up here with these three areas here.

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,670
We've got these two shaders being plugged into a mix shader And that's.

79
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm just going to reorganize it here to make it look a little bit better.

80
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,530
Yes.

81
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,270
Lines crossing over everywhere.

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,450
I think I'm going to be able to avoid that that easily.

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,190
But what we can do now is we've got essentially a system we've set up a series of nodes here to do a

84
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,000
task and that is to make a background image transparent.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,830
Now if you had hundreds of images that you would go to do this too you'd want a quicker way of doing

86
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,740
it without having to add to shaders to your defence one that comes automatically.

87
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,610
And we can do that by grouping.

88
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,560
So holding down shift I can select the others in our group that we want to make.

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:00,790
When I go down to node I can go to make a group and we can see here its control and G.

90
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:08,140
Now when we go into the group we can see it's got a group inputs the actual shaders themselves and the

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,550
group outputs.

92
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:18,310
Now it's very important that you tend not to put in input nodes i.e. this image texture or output nodes

93
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,960
with in a group itself.

94
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,320
Now in order to get back we can tab out because that will go between the two screens.

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,620
However what you can do is put the groups inside groups and if you do do that you can't just tab out

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,880
it or take you to the next level down.

97
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,240
And on the header bar of the know this this little up arrow so it would not use nodes.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,610
Take a little drawing pin and then this bakara And that will also take you up a level which is brilliant.

99
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,720
Now this looks a lot better.

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,600
Its much more clean with back down to three nodes so its easy to see whats going on.

101
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,750
Now as you can see there's little arrows next to the names of these groups that you can collapse down

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,830
if necessary if it starts getting really busy very useful.

103
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,610
And of course what you can do isn't named this node group.

104
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,630
Some think more useful.

105
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:15,940
So if we open up our properties and we can see it's called node group and I'm going to be calling It's

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,340
trans make image essence.

107
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,780
Now I have named it when I needed it to use it again.

108
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:32,170
I can go down to add and go to search and I can go make Inish transparencies actually now in the file

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,090
and I can use it again and again and again if I bring this up make image transparent.

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,980
There it is.

111
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,040
And we can open that up and see that ARG group still exists.

112
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Brilliant.

113
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
Okay a bit of a transition there.

114
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,750
I am Michael from the future and I'm here just to make sure that you guys are fully informed.

115
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,870
We've had a couple of questions and hopefully this will help clear up and give you guys further knowledge.

116
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,110
I've started a new blender file here.

117
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,470
I'd like you to do the same Make sure you saved your work.

118
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,220
And we've got the default cubin so now we're going to get rid of that.

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,470
Hit the x key and delete.

120
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,270
Now that's gone instead of going add.

121
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,150
We scroll down just a little images as planes.

122
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,330
This time we're just going to have a simple plane right at the top.

123
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,380
There we go.

124
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,050
Okay now we have the plane in the sea.

125
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,040
We're going to was sign everything manually and see how that comes across.

126
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,080
So I'm going to have to create a new window.

127
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,760
I'm going to make the tool shelf and propertys panel disappear and drag a new window so we can see what's

128
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,700
going on.

129
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm also going to switch this view ports on the left over to rendered mode.

130
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,960
And it goes that's rendering ready to go on this side.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,480
We need to first of all give this material we don't have a material just yet.

132
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,240
So let me pole open the propertys panel and go to materials.

133
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm just going to click on you.

134
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
It's got materials 0 0 1.

135
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,810
Let's call this grass.

136
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,540
There we go.

137
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,780
Now I'm just going to make that disappear a bit more so we've got some room here.

138
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,690
We're going to switch this viewport across to a different view point we're going to go to the node Ed.

139
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,380
And where we've been before.

140
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,870
Now we're going to have to build this up.

141
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,130
Bit by bit we know all the components that we need.

142
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,770
But there is one extra.

143
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,650
So what do we need.

144
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,640
We need to diffuse shader we need a.

145
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,530
And before I go and add this in if you do want and little micro challenge pause a video and see if you

146
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,030
can populate the other bits that we need.

147
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,980
If you've done that great Welcome back.

148
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,810
Now are we going to need a mix shaded to mix these two together.

149
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,760
We are also going to need a.

150
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,770
That's right a transparent shade.

151
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,330
I'm going to put that transparent on top because it's going to plug into me top.

152
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,110
Oh I put that in the wrong place.

153
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm looking at the wrong part of the screen that's linked these back up so we've got this coming through

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,430
fine.

155
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,370
And we needed to control the fuse by an image says go ahead.

156
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,610
I'm going to use the menu this time and actually search for image.

157
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,750
There we go image texture.

158
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,610
Plop that in there and we're going to link the colour into the colour here.

159
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,590
And the Alpher into the factor that looks good so far.

160
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,140
Now it's gone pink over on the left hand side.

161
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,810
And that's because it doesn't have a texture.

162
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,480
So the kind of standard colour when it doesn't know what to do we go ahead and open up a texture and

163
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm going to go to where I've stored my assets.

164
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,820
Now at the top of the head were beheaded bar basically for the file viewer.

165
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,640
We've got these thumbnail views and this is a great way of having a look at these are done which will

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,470
I'm going to pick.

167
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,160
I'm going to pick grass blade 7 for this example.

168
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,640
And we can't see anything.

169
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,980
And this is set up exactly how we had it before.

170
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,630
But there's one thing that the insert images Plains is doing which even though it looks the same is

171
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,130
slightly different.

172
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,980
Now at the moment we're not explicitly telling blender how to map this image to that plane.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,140
Now to you and I it's obvious it can only exist one way on that plane.

174
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:28,030
Perhaps if you rotated it round but essentially it's still be the same blender needs a bit more help

175
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,590
than that so we need one more note.

176
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:38,470
So let's go ahead and add in is a type of inputs because we're telling blender information and it's

177
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,660
called a texture a walnut.

178
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,750
If we go ahead and put that in there at the moment we can't see anything.

179
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,810
And we don't have many of these other options available you'll see here there are lots and lots of options

180
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:58,160
generate normal uv's object camera window and reflection by all means play with those.

181
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,510
But since we have a very simple plane it certainly doesn't need unwrapping.

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,310
We can get away with using generated if we link up the generated to the vector.

183
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,150
Suddenly our grass will appear.

184
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,670
So if you go through manually you may have to put this texture coordinate in as well.

185
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,010
Or indeed if you alter something or give it a different type of mapping you may lose that.

186
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:29,190
This is done automatically when you add images as planes even though it doesn't look like it does in

187
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,270
the node editor.

188
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,330
So a slight subtle difference there.

189
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,550
And of course now it's time for a challenge.

190
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,670
I would like you to apply transparency so make your three shaders into a group if you've not done already

191
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:50,590
and then apply transparency to the other P N G files you have imported using the group you've just created.

192
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,130
So I'd like you to pause the video now and give that a go.

193
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,610
OK guys welcome back.

194
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,940
Let's hop straight on over into blender.

195
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,430
Okay so now that we are back over in blender I'm going to go up a level and I don't need this one here

196
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,470
I was just the demonstration so I'm going to get rid of that.

197
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,530
Some are just going to grab this other image and move it.

198
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,000
And you'll notice there it doesn't look the same as it does usually and that's because I've got my pivot

199
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,240
points at the 3D Curson was going to send it back to medium point and then it sits on top of the origin

200
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,750
itself.

201
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,000
Brilliant.

202
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,700
Now that that's there we can select the other image how we're going to get rid of this diffuse STF because

203
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,580
that's built in to our module that we've created that we can just drop straight in some of the leite

204
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,790
that's an I'm going to go to AD search and making farraj transparent.

205
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,550
Brilliant and pop it in.

206
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:56,060
Oh you can go colour into colour and Alpha into a factor and then shape that onto a Surface.

207
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,890
And that should have worked and why hasn't it.

208
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,840
Let's dive in and have a look through what the facts are coming in and across here we've got the transparent

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,920
on top and this on the bottom and it goes to an output.

210
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,790
So let's just make sure everything is working as it should be.

211
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,490
Let's go and compare it to the previous one.

212
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,260
So you've got the grass image here it coming in.

213
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,970
And we can zoom out here transparent tops all of this seems to be absolutely fine.

214
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,350
Question is why is that not showing it's as transparent.

215
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,380
And here is the problem.

216
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:43,670
I haven't selected use Alpher cellmates that's now ticked and sorted and I'm going to set the Alpher

217
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,440
to pre multiplied here.

218
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,950
They do look very similar but pre multiplied tends to be better with small edges that change rapidly

219
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,250
much like these seeds we've got at the top here and the way the grass moves quite rapidly and it's quite

220
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,670
thin so we want the best quality possible.

221
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,700
So armed with that knowledge over on this one I'm going to select my image texture the user helfer is

222
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,190
already applied to its Which is excellent.

223
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:23,270
I can delete the diffuse shader add in a source while search for my make image transparence and when

224
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,440
I plug this one in.

225
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,830
It should work without issue.

226
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,750
There we go.

227
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,890
Perfect.

228
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,330
How did you guys get on.

229
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,540
I'd love to see your transparent grass.

230
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,850
Do share it in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
