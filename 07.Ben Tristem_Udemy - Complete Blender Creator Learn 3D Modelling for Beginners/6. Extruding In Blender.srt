00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,860
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,720
In this lecture we're going to talk about extracting extraditing is a novel way of creating additional

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,550
geometry in your objects.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,340
Here we can see a very basic church like building and these very very straightforward to put together

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,380
through simple extrusion and also building upon everything else we've learned so far.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,490
So let's go find out more and hop on over into blender.

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,710
Hello everybody and welcome.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,780
So let's talk about extrusion.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,670
Now you can extrude vertices edges and faces.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,430
We'll start off with faces.

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,550
So I go ahead here and hit the tab key to go into edit mode what we can do is making sure I'm going

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,960
to select all of these for the moment so I can just select each one individually to demonstrate.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,770
If I go ahead and select the vertex and press the key it generates an edge.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,780
But this is what we call loose geometry.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,020
It doesn't actually form a face.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,460
And this can cause problems if it's not kept under control.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,650
If you ever think you might have loose geometry like this which does tend to happen if you're working

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:17,920
on more complex models what you can do is select everything Go F three to search and type pin loose.

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,070
And one of the options will be to select a loose geometry which identifies it here.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,280
Hey guy you might have noticed that there's a bit of a difference when Mikey used the F3 menu to bring

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,780
up select news geometry.

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,220
It didn't actually work for you ask because the actual geometry is still connected to this to see if

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:47,910
we were to extrude this second that C and removed the now central that C by deleting with the leak case.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,390
And that's C..

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,910
Now we have a lose that C..

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,900
So when we go to F3 and select to use loose geometry then we'll see that that vertices.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,890
Ultimately though if we delete that vertices array throughout this from the key as we had before and

28
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:17,800
select all go into A3 and delete loops it will still delete that vertices as if it's loose geometry.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,970
So something to watch out for when you get to this lecture.

30
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,750
The other thing we can do here is if we go back to searching for loose is the least loose geometry and

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,090
get rid of that.

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,510
So you may think that's extruded a vertex is not useful then.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,530
Well it is.

34
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,490
Let me show you how so we can go ahead and let's say look at our model from the top extrude.

35
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:50,330
So that say over here extrude again to over there and then extrude again so we're close to this individual

36
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,470
vertex.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,450
Now it's tempting to then link these together maybe snap them in the same place and merge the vertex

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,290
and at that point you may think Ah I can fill in the gap between those two.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,620
See.

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,840
Press escape to stop but you still have a duplicate vertex there.

41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,670
It's very easy to get caught out of that.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,380
If I press the GK You will see that it is in fact still there.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,330
So I look at press X and delete that Vertex are going to select this new vertex here make sure it is

44
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:25,400
by itself and then shift select this vertex here and press F to fill in select the other two vertices

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,750
and press F and we filled in a new face.

46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,440
Okay so let's move on to edges.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,970
Then I can go ahead and select an edge and extrude that and that will generate a new face.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So what happens when you extrude a whole face then.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,010
Well what will happen there is we will end up with some new edges and a new face appearing from its

50
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,010
pretty cool high.

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,040
This is an incredibly useful technique for building up a block model of whatever you are trying to make.

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,370
I'm not sure what this is here.

53
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,180
It started off looking like some sort of tents or shelter but this could quite easily be the floor plan

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,940
to a building or an area that you want to create perhaps.

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,220
This is a factory and this is a filling station or whatever it happens to be.

56
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:21,090
You can very quickly block out an idea without having to worry too much about putting things together

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,930
appropriately you're just blocking something out at this time.

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,950
And that's essentially how I made the church at the very beginning.

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,980
And a lot of models will start off like this even if later on they end up with hundreds of details on

60
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,180
them.

61
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,490
So this if you will is like sketching.

62
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,980
But in three days.

63
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,420
And with that comes your challenge.

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,800
Okay so your challenge use extracting to create a simple building you can use any of the other techniques

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,940
learned so far as well so it's not just excreting use everything you've learned so far.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,550
Now don't focus on realism We're focused at the moment on just a representation very much like the background

67
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,460
that you can see here very much like the church you saw earlier as well.

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,350
It's just a representation a 3D sketch of an object used some reference material.

69
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,100
That's something that people tend to forget if you are unsure if you want to go Oh I fancy making a

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,800
bomb.

71
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,070
Well Google a bomb.

72
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,890
Look at the images there and then just make a rough outline a representation of that building.

73
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,900
Now you can pick any building you like pulls a video now and give that a go.

74
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,240
Okay everybody Welcome back.

75
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,980
Let's go ahead now and make a simple building okay.

76
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,020
So we're over in Blender now and I'm going to create a couple of simple buildings because I want to

77
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,050
really just make a very basic one and show you guys how I would do that and then move on from there.

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,330
So I'm going to go into edit mode here and lift it up by one unit.

79
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,190
I'm going to grab the face at the end.

80
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:03,250
It's going to make sure that I've got all of these selected and I'm going to go g x two.

81
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,170
So you end up with a shape like that.

82
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm going to grab this top face should that be selected this I'm going to grab this top face and extrude

83
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,990
up by hitting the right key.

84
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,880
Apologies I've clicked the wrong key there.

85
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,770
Let's try the OECD.

86
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,060
Lift it up slightly and I'm going to scale that but lock that scale to just the Y axis to zero.

87
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,070
And there we go we go off first house almost.

88
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,810
I'm going to go whilst those are all selected vertex and remove double vertices.

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,690
So we know that the roof is sorted and I'm going to go over and make sure I've named my objects so easy

90
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,220
to forget what you're working on.

91
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,470
So that's my basic house.

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm going to come out of there and go Gee y and just shift it over there for the moment and then I'm

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,290
going to add a new mesh object.

94
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,020
I'm going to start again with a cube.

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,870
This time I'm going to make the church that you guys saw earlier.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't go into edit mode lift the whole mesh up and I'm going to play with the cube here and I'm going

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,740
to think carefully about where I want things to be.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:17,240
So this part here is the tower I can extrude that up I can extrude it again and scale it by 0 or as

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
we learned earlier.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,790
I'm going to go controlling Z on that and just go Alton am emerge at the center.

101
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,330
So there we go.

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,520
There's a nice tower that we've got there.

103
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,560
And then I can go ahead press E. and extrude along here.

104
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,250
E to extrude out here and then it's just a matter of lifting these two up to various heights that different

105
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,390
from one another.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,310
And then we should be able to on the y axis here and on the x axis here.

107
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,350
So it's going to scale X sorry y 0.

108
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,950
And whilst those two are selected I'm going to go to vertex and remove double vertices which is good.

109
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,630
Then this face at the top here scale x 0 move in together.

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,010
And there we go we've got a representation of a church and that's probably pretty accurate compared

111
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,180
to the house next to it.

112
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,790
Okay.

113
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,580
So there we go.

114
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,300
Those are my two models.

115
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,010
The one thing I haven't done before song goes are my.

116
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,440
You forgot to name something.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,220
There we go.

118
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,820
We've got the church and the House named appropriately.

119
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,220
Brilliant.

120
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,690
How did you guys get on.

121
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,760
What did you end up making please do share your work over and discussions.

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,290
I'm looking forward to seeing you develop now because we're starting to get things that look pretty

123
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,420
decent.

124
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,380
Do share them over on the forum and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
