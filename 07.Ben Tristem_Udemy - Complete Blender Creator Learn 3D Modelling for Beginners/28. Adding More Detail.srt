1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,670
Welcome to adding more detail in this video you will go and do some organization to the outline before

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,580
things get out of hand if it's like minors at the moment it's not too bad but it's starting to get a

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,230
tiny bit unwieldy and we need to make sure we name things appropriately.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,050
We'll get an elodie B level besch object ready to be linked into our main scene.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,260
So let's go hop straight on over in a blender.

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,730
So I am going to go ahead now and open up my.

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh where is it here.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,830
Front door.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,200
That's work on the front door itself.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:47,140
I'm going to make the U.S. image editor a bit smaller but I'm going to be using that in a few moments.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,500
So let's go ahead here and just have a look at this.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,330
Outliner itself it's a bit of a mess.

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,300
So the first thing we can do here is create a couple of empties to organize things.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,860
I know immediately.

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,840
I need to be in object mode.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,610
I know immediately I'm going to need an empty and I'm going to use a plain access as I do normally and

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:18,190
I'm going to call 1 elodie a lady a barm also going to here put in there that is the holder because

18
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,850
that's what it's doing is your elda.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,220
Now the reason why I've done that is when we import them into another scene none of these have.

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,600
When we link them they all come across as objects.

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,570
Little square blocks because their object data it doesn't tell us what type of object they actually

22
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,250
are which can be a little bit confusing.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,230
On first glance.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,150
And if you haven't named them correctly.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,470
Well that's going to be a very sore point as you start moving things about.

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:58,060
So I've duplicated those two air load D and I'm going to make it an elodie B Holder and the other one

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,010
is going to be called archive.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,390
Oh I can't spell archive but there we go.

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,730
And I am looking around my model itself.

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,440
If I enable these things I really do like this smooth arch way.

31
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,350
I'm going to go with my block working set so I'm going to move those two archway profiles.

32
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,390
Bear in mind there curve objects anyway to the archway profile.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,950
Now this archway array is going to hold down control there and make sure I turn off everything under

34
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,440
the archive empty there.

35
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,880
So I want this one that's the one I want to move across so I will move those two.

36
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,210
I'm not going to rename them at the moment but I'm going to move those two into the elodie be holder.

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,990
I've got an l o d b front door and that is the actual door itself something to put that there.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,540
The elodie that needs to go into there and the archway itself is that the.

39
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,500
I'm not sure what that one is that's hide everything else would be useful to have the actual doorway

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,740
on itself.

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,190
The elodie be archway.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,900
Ah yes that's the one we extruded manually.

43
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,790
Im not going to use that one at all but Im not going to delete it at the moment.

44
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,360
Im going to call this L O D.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,410
B Well it's not elodie I don't want to confuse it with the actual l'eau mesh mesh when we solidify it

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,060
in a bit.

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,850
I'm going to call this extruded arch way.

48
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,660
Might as well say what it is.

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,180
Hey.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,600
Okay and I'm going to pop that in the archive.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
This was out of way.

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,510
Of course if you really don't want those you can just get rid of them just delete them out of your scene

53
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,780
especially if you're using version control.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,200
If you are using birth control then you don't have to worry about doing any of this because you can

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,360
always go back to how it was at this point anyway.

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,300
Now I am using version the job I just want to show you this particular option later on when I start

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,960
trimming out all of the nonsense are probably want to get rid of anything.

58
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,940
I really am not using just to keep things simple so the archway array that we've got here that needs

59
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,010
to be moved to l.a..

60
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,730
DP Okay so now we've got that I'm going to turn off elodie and go to the B.

61
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,160
Service is what we want we want.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,960
This is one solid object so we can just import it as a whole.

63
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,040
The issue is of course at the moment.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,130
This isn't one mesh object.

65
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,790
It is a combination of two mesh objects and a control curve and a series modifiers.

66
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,160
So we're going to have to be careful about how we go ahead and apply these things because some of them

67
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,770
once we've applied them we can't undo them again.

68
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,650
So with that in mind I want to join all of these bits together.

69
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,060
But first of all let's get all the texturing and everything else sorted so the wall itself.

70
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,370
I'm going to switch over to ren mode.

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,780
The wall itself is going to have the same material wall door material now is not quite there yet because

72
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,420
we have not unwrapped it to tell it how to put the texture on the wall so the material is already set

73
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,610
up with the texture in it.

74
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,200
We just not defined how the texture is mapped so I'm going to go into it.

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,370
I'm going to come out of rended mode go into edit mode select everything hit you and smart use projects

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,170
that worked before it should work.

77
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:16,160
Now I'm going to pivot this around the 3-d cursor it's already selected to select everything and just

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,580
scale it up so it's roughly right again at this point in time.

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,200
It doesn't really matter if it's not accurate because were bound to make some changes once we start

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,210
building up detail the changes themselves are the detail essentially.

81
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,790
So with this in mind let's hop into surrendered mode.

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,420
That's absolutely fine if I go ahead in object mode and select the bits going around the outside.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,940
The brick work and going to call it brick work.

84
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,740
I am going to give that a new material.

85
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,050
I call it brick work or no no arch block work or something along those lines.

86
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,690
If I call it brick work that kind of got a different meaning I want to avoid.

87
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,070
I want to avoid confusing myself because it's so easily done.

88
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,330
I can give it whatever colour you want.

89
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,010
I'm going to go a bit outlandish at this point in time I can always change at any point but just to

90
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,680
make sure it's really apparent that the materials have come across individually after we've joined all

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,770
this lot together.

92
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,130
So looking at the modifiers tab.

93
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,530
What's going on here is you've got a layer or a layer here of four modifiers in total.

94
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,760
And some of them when we turn on and off dont make any difference whatsoever in terms of the general

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,970
layout and in this case I would do want to keep it as low poly as possible so I am going to actually

96
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,210
just turn off the subsurface modify it's not difficult to reapply any points that aren't any special

97
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,310
settings I've just gone for too.

98
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,820
So with that in mind I'm literally going to delete it from here.

99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,850
The array defines the length of the repeat.

100
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,200
And the curve defines its shape.

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,240
That's sorted now if I had if I was doing this with a bit more detail I would probably remake the curve

102
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:09,110
so it stops halfway and then that mirror that's around and around the other way as well so it comes

103
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,030
on both sides of the door and that way we get a much better lump at the very top.

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,530
So it's not well so it's not asymmetric so symmetrical at the top.

105
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:28,070
So with that in mind we are going to go ahead now and solidify these and make firm into one object.

106
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,010
Now that we've clicked apply we've got to mesh objects left in the scene so that the arch way first

107
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,770
and then the thing rejoining too which is the block work behind.

108
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,430
And I'm really going to hop out of here so I can see what I am selecting Also we've got a dark orange

109
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,970
around everything that's selected and then finally the active object has the light orange and go control

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,720
and J that's now join them together into one mesh but it's retained all of those material properties.

111
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:06,320
And that now if I make sure the naming is appropriate so elodie be front door I dont need one there.

112
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:15,680
Ldv front door that is what I will need to import when I go to my main scene and with that in mind I've

113
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,760
got a challenge for you guys.

114
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,490
Now this challenge can be as big or as small as you like but I would like you to up your models to l'eau

115
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,430
dbe status so increase the level of detail of your building blocks you are using in your scene.

116
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,350
You don't really have to up the level of detail of a wall segment at this point in time and you certainly

117
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,580
need to be careful around the perimeter.

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,880
Otherwise you cause it to look horrible when they're joined together.

119
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,500
We'll go into more detail of how to ensure that works properly later on.

120
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,770
And I'd like you to link them back into your main scene.

121
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,310
Remember.

122
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,670
Replace your elodie a parts with elodie be.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,540
Where appropriate.

124
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,060
So if you don't need the extra level of detail don't worry about adding it's at that point.

125
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,060
As I said off the wall parts I'm not going to do anything to that at the moment.

126
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,160
And of course the floor the walls and the floor at the moment can stay as solid blocks.

127
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,960
We don't need any extra detail at this point in time.

128
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,030
So both video now and give that a go.

129
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,060
Okay guys.

130
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,980
Welcome back.

131
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,550
Let's go get my doorway into my scene.

132
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,570
Right so let's go ahead and make sure that it is saved before we do anything else and open my Gothic

133
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,660
church scene.

134
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,840
So let's go ahead and as you can see here set it so it renders a bit vertically from the outside from

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,730
this camera.

136
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:57,030
And just to show you guys real quick and then we'll link this other part in I have literally just reverse

137
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,320
the resolutions here.

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,770
So instead of being ten feet wide.

139
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,210
Sorry.

140
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,060
920 wide it's 920 high by 10 feet wide and that gives us a wide screen on its side anyway anyway so

141
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,040
let's go in and first of all go and grab that so we need to link the file.

142
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,710
Go to our meshes our front door object.

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,290
And here we go.

144
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:26,040
This is why I was saying naming is really important because if we have lots of things that were similar

145
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,090
in names then you wouldn't be able to pick which one it was and you can see here they've all were the

146
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
object data block.

147
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,080
Now of course you can filter in the menu of options at the very top.

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,550
Here we can turn turn on.

149
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,980
Is this seen as a curve is it an object.

150
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,140
Is it a mesh.

151
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,670
Well not in this part of it.

152
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,370
Etc..

153
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,940
So we can filter up the top here and we can hold down Shift to term more than one of those on an arm

154
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,260
can move them all turned otherwise you can get very confusing and I'm going to go ahead and link in

155
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,220
the front door.

156
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,010
There it is.

157
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,000
And I'm not sure what layer it's on at the moment has it gone to the right now.

158
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,040
Yes it has.

159
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,600
And of course I need to select that and make it a proxy then I can start doing things with it.

160
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,990
So we've got a couple of options here as to what I want to replace so I've used the archway itself at

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,980
the very top of my church but I dont know at the moment whether I want the fancy bit around it.

162
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,020
But I know I certainly want this one down here.

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,720
So this obviously has own object data block here.

164
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,560
Now we just go and try and change that.

165
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,050
My initial thought was that would be the one of the best ways around doing it.

166
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,510
I can't type that in there.

167
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,890
I need to first of all select here.

168
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,050
If I now go and type in d e.

169
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,050
And a school B.

170
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,320
There it is the front or proxy.

171
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,740
It doesn't actually do anything.

172
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,410
It literally just changes backwards and forwards all the time.

173
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,260
What we need to do is change the mesh data.

174
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,160
So lets go to the mesh data part of it and select elodie.

175
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,300
Front Door 1.

176
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,450
There we go.

177
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,390
That's in there.

178
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:13,300
Now the one thing that we've got so be careful with here is when we've got multiple objects in our scene.

179
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,000
So we've got another one of these doors over here and I can't select everything else.

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,950
Now I've selected this one and changed it over.

181
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,460
So what I could do before actually applying them.

182
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Let's do it with the walls for instance so those silly with the walls we selected the walls and then

183
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,000
we can use our linking options as we've done in the past when we've been creating these and moving them

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,700
about.

185
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:46,400
So I can go shift in how to select all of the ones that share the same object data and then it's highlighted

186
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,170
all of the wall 40 force.

187
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:57,720
Now I can go in and go and change that by clicking making the act the selected active one misword down

188
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,670
at the bottom.

189
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,910
Because that's already in the scene can also change one of these to the door and then go control and

190
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:13,230
L. And then we can make a link and if we do object data we end up with big doors all over the place

191
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,210
or Windows of course if they're high up.

192
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:23,100
I can then set it back again if I wanted to but since I'm just toying around here I'm just going to

193
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
undo.

194
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,890
Of course now I can go in and move the other parts in as well.

195
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,850
And I will see you guys back in a few moments.

196
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,580
Well are those Zen.

197
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,120
So I'm midway through constructing my window piece at the moment and few things as you can see the outliner

198
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
is nice and neat at the moment.

199
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,100
One of the things I've realised is that I want to use the material that I created in the last project

200
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,090
of the actual door the blockwork I think I called it BLOCK What door block wrote archway blockwork.

201
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,050
I think what it is anyway I can go in and go file link.

202
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,970
And as we are more ready I've already gone to it.

203
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,690
But I need to go to my front door blend file into the material this time not the object but we want

204
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,110
to go and grab the material and there is Arch and blockwork.

205
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,130
Once I've linked that I can make sure I've got the appropriate mesh selected and under the materials

206
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,880
tab here we can see it's linked and apply it to there.

207
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,380
I've also decided to make the texture slightly smaller because I don't think it was making it look a

208
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,440
bit Noddy's actually the blocks are looked far too big.

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,070
I think this is a better scale for them.

210
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,330
One thing we have to watch out for with scale is repetition starts to become more and more apparent

211
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:50,080
the more and more you scale or tile a particular mesh even if it is already a tiling texture it can

212
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,970
become apparent that you've tiled it.

213
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,380
If we're not careful.

214
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,120
But that's absolutely fine and it also the other ones as well.

215
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,780
I'll continue working on this particular model and I'll see you guys again in a few moments.

216
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,570
So now I've brought the window itself into the scene as well everything's coming together nicely and

217
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:16,360
this is going to give me a basically go ahead or not on whether the textures themselves I need to do

218
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,020
the wall.

219
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,700
So here we go being lean about only to do the wall as well.

220
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,810
But whether the textures themselves if that's the right size.

221
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,160
Now that does look much better.

222
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,830
I'm going to change the wall and see how that looks as well because that takes up a vast majority of

223
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,190
the entire rest of the model.

224
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay so we're back in the church hop into random mode and that blog post you can see a bit of repetition

225
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,520
but otherwise that is looking pretty good.

226
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,600
Does it match up with the model underneath.

227
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,070
Yes it does it pretty seamlessly as well.

228
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,990
I'm liking how this is coming on.

229
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,400
I might go ahead and obviously change the colour of this.

230
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,260
It's almost terracotta at the moment and we can see one of those rendering artefacts that I've mentioned

231
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,580
coming through just on this area here.

232
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,840
So I still need to sort out the actual alignment of the building and lots of other things to do with

233
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,410
that.

234
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,710
But I did want to make sure I got all the brickwork and everything right.

235
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,430
First before I start messing around the underlying structure.

236
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,230
How did you guys get on how are your elodie Level be piece coming along.

237
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,840
Please share them in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
