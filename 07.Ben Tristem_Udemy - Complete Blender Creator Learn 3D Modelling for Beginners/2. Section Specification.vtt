00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.880
Okay so let's talk about our project specification.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.870
What we're going to be doing in this section and what to expect.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.090
So we're going to be creating assets to be exported straight to an external program like a game engine

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.270
or anything else she may work with externally.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.260
We will be creating our own textures and other maps from high detailed models and applying them to the

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.320
low polygon version will be focussed on modelling the interior of a building.

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.020
In this case I'm going to choose a gothic church.

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.860
You can model your own house with the lessons learned in this video is entirely up to you now.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.520
More on the product specification.

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.260
You can use any of these techniques whether it's going to be level of detail or whether it's going to

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.540
be baking some textures and of course there's more on that in the section itself.

12
00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.080
But you can use this technique within blender itself for optimization to increase not increase your

13
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.260
end times increase your efficiency by lowering your render times.

14
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.770
And that's very important as we've already experienced render times can take hours or even days.

15
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.130
Some of you with the animations back in the animated land I know had to leave their computers running

16
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.890
for a couple of days to get that out there so we can make this a little more optimized then we can certainly

17
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.180
get things out quicker and more importantly iterate more which means we get a better end result.

18
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.930
Now I'm going to be testing my model externally as I go.

19
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.710
So you guys can appreciate that impact on externally and we'll be looking at level of detail in detail.

20
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.610
So more on this I'm going to be keeping my scene relatively simple primarily for teaching purposes but

21
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.330
of course I encourage you to go to the MFA degree and get some really detailed models going.

22
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.530
I encourage you to add more detail experiment and have fun.

23
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.960
For instance wouldn't the scene look a little more interesting with a chess set in it.

24
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.040
Okay guys let's move on now to the next lecture.
