00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.670
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.120
In this lecture I'm going to introduce you to the node wrangler.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.970
It is as I got the title they're super super useful and I'm genuinely surprised it's not turned on by

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.600
default.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.440
It's so helpful.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.690
It's quick for making your nodes set ups and many many actions to speed up the node based workflow.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.220
Well what do I mean by that.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300
Let's hop on over into blender and find out more.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
Okay so now that we're over in Blender let's go ahead and play with the node wrangler.

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.000
Now is not enabled by default.

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.160
I definitely have it turned on by our need to show you where to turn it on first of all if we go to

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.900
edit go down to preferences or missed it.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.760
Here we go.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.460
So you will need to go to the add ons tab on the left hand side once you're in there.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.420
Just go to the search box at the top rather than just scrolling through it's far easier and you can

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.030
either type in the word node.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720
Probably the easiest thing to do.

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.380
And there we go.

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.430
Node wrangler.

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.200
Make sure there's a tick in this box here.

21
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.770
Now by default we've covered this before right.

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.710
Early on but by default you're also safe preferences will be turned on but you may have turned those

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.770
off especially if you like playing but not committing to a particular set of settings.

24
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.060
So what we can do here is also save preferences and then we know it's definitely done.

25
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.900
If you don't have also save preferences turned on if you didn't have that on or save it it means that

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
the next blend file you open up won't have node wrangler turned on and you're going to need that for

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.320
the next set of demonstrations.

28
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.900
So if we go over into the shading tab along the top there we go.

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.740
We can see everything is switched over its shading mode and we have a principle to be SDF.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.310
This is our shader our shader controls how the surface of our model.

31
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.930
All of those faces on the cube are going to interact with light and we can see there's a material output

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.780
node as well.

33
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.100
This actually make this area bigger and the cube smaller.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.010
I don't really care seeing too much of the cube we can zoom into it there.

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.260
So that material output.

36
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.930
Now that's essentially what we're going to see on screen.

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.140
You'll notice here that we've got an all dropdown.

38
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.860
If we click on that we can see that we've got eevee in cycles so we can actually set up specific materials

39
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.740
that work in either one.

40
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.950
Now most of the time you can get away with just leaving it is all.

41
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.230
And it will work perfectly in both eevee and cycles.

42
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.550
Occasionally that's not true in which case if you need to separate something out you can make a material

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.640
specifically so the output is set to eevee or cycles really really useful volume is for volume metrics

44
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.050
which will cover towards the end of the section and displacement is awesome but it is quite computationally

45
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.070
heavy as well.

46
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.930
Okay.

47
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.000
So what about this node wrangler why are we using that.

48
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.360
Well ordinarily in order to set up a texture so we can use it in the principle be SDF or any other thing

49
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.050
that would accept a texture we had first of all.

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.570
Which way should we go should we go backwards or forwards.

51
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.940
Let's go forwards.

52
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.280
So first of all we would need a texture coordinates.

53
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.860
We need to tell blender how we are mapping a texture to our model.

54
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.310
So the first thing we need to do is go to either the ad menu at the top here or go shift in a.

55
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.390
And then we need to go to an input tab which is a texture coordinates.

56
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.480
Now you can also use the search if you are quick at your search.

57
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.360
Bringing up the texture coordinates.

58
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.810
Boom.

59
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.950
Here we go.

60
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.690
Now fortunately for us and we'll get to you v mapping in a bit but the default cube comes already unwrapped

61
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.030
and we will do our own unwrapping of a cube later on.

62
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.900
So from the texture corner there's an optional step in between.

63
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.680
But I'm going to keep it simple for the moment.

64
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.640
Let's go ahead and add in a texture.

65
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.590
So an image texture.

66
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.700
Here we go.

67
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.040
We can pop that in.

68
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.030
And then you've got your texture coordinates you can pick any one you like for the for the moment.

69
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.310
If you're playing along I'm going to select EUV and pop it into the vector.

70
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.390
Notice here that the purple and the purple link up together the purple simply means it's a vector inputs

71
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.770
or outputs.

72
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.200
So three values is going to be coming out of there.

73
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.500
The yellow Well that is also three values but it is color information.

74
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.480
So usually yellow goes to yellow gray goes to a gray etc..

75
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.050
Now this is Alpha or we don't have any image loaded up.

76
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.050
Now you could load up any image you'd like.

77
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.930
Go ahead click on open and I'm going to go to my downloads and just pick one of the images that's in

78
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.780
here now with the file browser that's come up.

79
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.660
This is one way that you can work on your on your images and we can see I've got the tile textures just

80
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.640
down here.

81
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.120
I'm going to cancel that for the moment cause another way of bringing in an image texture like this

82
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.100
you can all click on open and go through but you don't have to do that over.

83
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.150
Oh sorry.

84
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.520
Up here I've got a series of options so I can come into my downloads again here and I can see my texture.

85
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.870
There you go.

86
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.080
That's the texture I had earlier.

87
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.200
Those tiles.

88
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.460
I can click and drag that in to my node area down at the bottom here my shader sets up and then we goes

89
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.660
already added in.

90
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.380
So there's a couple of different ways that you can add a texture to your model.

91
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.210
I'm going to delete my image texture by clicking on it.

92
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.820
It's got this white outline and just pressing the X key you will notice that a lot of the controls you

93
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.750
use to move around in the node ed are very similar to that of the 3D Ed so holding down the middle mouse

94
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.840
button is enabling you to pan around.

95
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.300
You can zoom in and out with the scroll wheel which is incredibly useful.

96
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.370
And yes you can get node setups that can fill this area with ease of course I wouldn't advise doing

97
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.670
that.

98
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.630
We'll talk about grouping things together later on as well to make it more manageable in your mind.

99
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.350
Okay.

100
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.550
So let's go ahead and link these together.

101
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.070
So we've got a generated normal u v object camera window and reflection.

102
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.410
Let's go ahead and grab you VM plug that into the vector and let's plug the color into the base color.

103
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.450
So here we go.

104
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.670
Here it's called base color.

105
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.640
And look at that.

106
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.240
My texture is applied.

107
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.840
Now if you've got a seamless texture it may look really nice like this does if you didn't have a seamless

108
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.090
texture let's say it was this swirly thing that I've got here a vortex all a half combine them together.

109
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.840
OK well we'll leave it like that.

110
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.580
That's pretty awesome.

111
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.590
By the looks of things.

112
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.580
OK.

113
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.610
So you can see there it's very easy to pop things together.

114
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.430
I did that accidentally when I dropped it in and over a line.

115
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.650
So that's pop these things back together.

116
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:11.880
When I dragged it over that line connecting the two sockets it automatically joins the two together

117
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.380
which is incredibly useful but we still not touch node wrangler.

118
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.070
OK.

119
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.630
So let's delete all of those.

120
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.890
I use that the leak that time rather than the X key.

121
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.090
Plenty of options to do it.

122
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.430
So let's click on the principle B SDF.

123
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:33.030
Now we can add what we've just talked about plus another node called a mapping node by pressing control

124
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.350
and T.

125
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.490
There we go.

126
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.930
That's added in automatically the texture coordinate a mapping node.

127
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.140
And this enables us to basically transform our texture so we can scale it move it and rotate it as the

128
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.440
information beneath here sort of lends us to believe.

129
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.220
So we go ahead and open or because we've already loaded something up in memory for instance these textures

130
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.340
here we've already brought in a couple even though they've now got 0 users scrolling so that's easier

131
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.450
to read.

132
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.080
Even though these both now have zero users I can click on it again and there we go.

133
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:16.770
It will map it in and then we can change the position in the X Y and Z for these and usually well rotation

134
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.680
can be incredibly useful if it's necessary but I find the scale is something so I'm going to highlight

135
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.480
everything there and this is counterintuitive when you have a high number on the scale your texture

136
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.070
is repeated lots.

137
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.390
And this is almost an example.

138
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.330
I think we're on the borderline here where even though it's a seamless texture that I have here you

139
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.740
can start to see the repeated patterns.

140
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.030
If we up that to something like 50 to really exaggerate it you can see the repeated pattern over and

141
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.570
over again.

142
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.440
In fact I see it is some lighter lines and dark lines going up and down.

143
00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:01.320
That's what you have to watch out for tiling textures or seamless textures doesn't necessarily mean

144
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.090
you're going to get away with just repeating endlessly but I'm going to set that.

145
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.490
So I think I'm going to set it in this particular example to to let's try for.

146
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.260
Yeah that's a nice thing.

147
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.780
In order to show off the textures.

148
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.050
So what else can we do with the node wrangler.

149
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.000
Well instead of those three I'm going to delete them out of the way.

150
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.500
If I was to select the principal nodes in you you'll get in the field here's a little keyboard shortcuts

151
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.210
going on and you're right.

152
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:37.930
Control shift and see and then let's go all the way to where is it my downloads.

153
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.670
Can't see the wood for the trees.

154
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.270
And I to change the view type here.

155
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.610
This is different view types so let's go up next to the filter icon and in between that and the search

156
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.430
button we can change this to thumbnails.

157
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.400
Now we can scroll down and find the appropriate ones.

158
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.870
Here we go.

159
00:09:53.870 --> 00:10:00.020
Now if I select all of these pages or tiffs it doesn't matter blenders not too fussy.

160
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.400
Other programs can be fussy with things like tiffs but blender accepts them.

161
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.850
Here we go.

162
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:11.460
We've got all of those selected because they've been named appropriately when we click principle.

163
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.360
Texture sets up.

164
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.800
Wow look at that.

165
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.170
Everything's all linked up for us very quickly.

166
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.860
That's incredibly useful being able to have that's there.

167
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:28.160
I'm ready to use now it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it's a great start.

168
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.390
And now you can do loads of other things with the note wrangler.

169
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.120
I'm just going to show you the web page now.

170
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.800
OK so here we go.

171
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.960
Over on the blender manual again this is a link that I'll leave in the resources for you.

172
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.650
We've got the node wrangler introduction tells us all about it and we can start to see here control

173
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.830
and right mouse button and drag.

174
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:56.860
Oh shift control right mouse button so there's a way of linking things together without having to precisely

175
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.230
select the sockets.

176
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.790
So that's one of the things where you're dragging that little one output socket to an input socket.

177
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.620
It can be really really bad.

178
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:12.490
Lazy mix ult right mouse button so you can mix two shaders together very very quickly.

179
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:18.880
Now we won't cover all of these but we'll start using some of them as we progressed to create our textures

180
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.450
for our models.

181
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.830
There is far too many to cover in here and you're not going to remember them all at once.

182
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.210
I want to hammer this point home.

183
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.460
We're dealing with nodes.

184
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.430
There are so many but trying to remember every single one especially as a beginner is difficult enough

185
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.950
if you add on this tool.

186
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:43.330
This is a lot of stuff to remember and ultimately you're only going to really remember the ones that

187
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.460
you use the most shade of you.

188
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.900
I was hoping it was going to come up as I was talking shade of you is something I use all the time it's

189
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:56.800
incredibly useful to see if you're making tweaks somewhere what is its real effect rather than looking

190
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.290
at the final output of combining all your notes together you can separate out just that bit that you're

191
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:10.150
working on and that means that you can go ahead and control it much more precisely and as you can see

192
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.440
here.

193
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:17.530
There are many many many many options and this is why probably why it's not included by default is probably

194
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:23.280
a little bit overwhelming for the beginner but we're not going to use it all at once.

195
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.420
So it doesn't have to be overwhelming.

196
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.680
It's incredibly useful.

197
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.440
I recommend you turn it on under Edit Preferences.

198
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:38.650
Node wrangler get that turned on you'll thank me for it now and forever more it will be very very useful

199
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:45.470
for you and not only that I will be referring to it lots as we progress through this section.

200
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.040
Take care and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
