1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,850
Welcome to the mix.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,130
RG been showed in this video will use it to mix two colours together.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,930
Will see that it can also be used to mix more than just colours except six channels in through the two

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:21,890
colour inputs and three channels out mixing together those two colour inputs based upon two things.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,830
The blend type and the factor says Go play with this mix r.g. be note now and hop on over into blender.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,290
Okay so I'm going to be working on a sphere because I'd like spheres.

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,230
Simple as that.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,950
So let's go ahead and add a basic sphere to my scene.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,660
I'm going to lift that up and I'm also going to add a plane to the scene and scale it outwards.

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,350
Now just to make sure my materials from last time are working I'm going to make a chequered floor and

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,450
this is going to be that.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,870
Ready.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,510
Plastic.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,620
Let's switch into rent mode.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,450
Perfect Couple of things left to do here is this particular sphere needs to be so nice and smooth so

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,960
we can see what's going on.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,230
Excellent so that's all set up and ready to go see the power of having all of these materials set up

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,030
ready to go just makes things setting up so much quicker.

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,980
So let's grab a node editor.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm going to just get rid of some of the toolbars around here and the node editor open here.

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,990
Now one thing we can do here is change the colour so oh notice this is polished wood here I've obviously

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:40,340
used this basic for an L node that we had set up before the scroop node used on something else and forgot

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,590
to click the little number over the property to make it unique some chemical that P.

24
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,950
B r and I made a note to go ahead and make sure I save that to my the fault file again so I don't have

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,370
to do that multiple times.

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,040
So we've got a colour input here.

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,720
Now what we can do in this colour input is have a mix of two separate colours coming in for instance.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,600
So you could go ahead and add in a colour under the add colour menu mix.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,480
RG So you've got a colour output that we can put straight into here.

30
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,680
Now we've got two colours now I'm going to choose almost 100 percent green.

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,190
I know we shouldn't choose 100 percent colours but again we're just testing the mixing that's going

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,180
on here and 100 percent red and non-support or not surprising at all we get a yellow out with a 50 50

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,050
mix.

34
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,410
Now we've got a couple of options here we can change how all these are mixed together.

35
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,660
If we want to and you can go through and try the different varieties of mixing that we can go through

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,410
I tend to leave it's just on mix in general and we have a factor here that obviously we can change it

37
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,920
from one to the other.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
But of course that's boring.

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,320
We'd want something to control this factor itself.

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,410
And that leads me nicely onto a challenge.

41
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,070
I'd like to go ahead and get mixing so use the mix.

42
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:14,870
RG been known to mix together to colours control the factor with the generated texture.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,890
And then for a bit more interest why don't you try adding a bump node into the system using the texture

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,490
to add more interest in the material and affect the normal so it's not just a smooth surface anymore.

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,490
Pause the video now and give that ago.

46
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,250
Okay guys welcome back.

47
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's go mixing over in blender.

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,860
Okay so we're back over in blender and we've got this mix note here and it's a bit boring at the moment

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,330
with just these two colours.

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,660
Now I've got an idea I'd like to try.

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,590
I'd like to try adjusting this factor using a texture.

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
So let's go ahead and go to textures.

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,470
And of course if you got an image texture you could apply.

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,080
You could go ahead and do that.

55
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,610
But in this case I'm going to use one of these generated textures wave.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,020
I to add that to our model.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,770
I've added it to the wrong part.

58
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,200
There we go.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,520
So in fact and let's just have a look at what the wave is outputting on the colour and on the factor

60
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,130
whereas putting the same thing on both in this case.

61
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,550
So here we have a black and white texture so it's alternating between green and red.

62
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,860
So let's go back to our Mc snoad and see what the outside of there is.

63
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,420
Okay.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,090
And everything together.

65
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,800
Okay that's starting to come together.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,100
Now I'm going to play with the scale settings here.

67
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,680
And I want to increase the distortions a bit wavy Yeah.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,830
Okay.

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,710
That's a lot of distortion there that's lower the scale even more if I can.

70
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,840
And this detail I'm going up the detail so we get a kind of a mottled affect.

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:01,370
So so go take a little bit of playing to get the kind of effect that I want some not quite there at

72
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,830
the moment 50.

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,860
Let's try a hundred and fifty.

74
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,640
How that's starting to look better.

75
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,740
Excellent.

76
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,060
So we changed these colours here servair a bit more representative of what this sort of colours that

77
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,620
I want to.

78
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,140
Again I'm going to try and avoid using extreme to extreme colours.

79
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,230
I want them to be semi realistic.

80
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,670
Okay so we've got almost like a cloud covered marble or something on those lines.

81
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:38,660
Now to add a little more interest into this I could actually use this wave texture that we've got here

82
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,590
because it's black and white.

83
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,610
We can use it to control something else now flat things like this are boring so we can add some real

84
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,230
texture some real bumps to it.

85
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:55,490
By utilizing this wave texture as well to control a bump node so if I go ahead and add in a bump node

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,790
to remember where it is and a vector bump and we can use it to control the height some would become

87
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,310
to use the factor in this case to control the heights and then are going to have a look and isolate

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,890
the bump mode and see what's happening.

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,460
Now we will see the normal output but we can see there's quite a cool texture being applied there and

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,750
we can adjust the strength of that accordingly and leave it set to one and distance here is obviously

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,390
going to make kids more or less extreme.

92
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,890
And I'm going to leave that's quite low down so we don't o'farrelly exaggerates what's going on.

93
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,430
Okay so these together let's have a look at what it looks like.

94
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,950
I need to plug the normal in to the normal input we've got set up a How about that they're starting

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,040
to look much more interesting with all the textures.

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,730
Now we've got something we can look at and I can see the we can still see some facets around here because

97
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,500
we've not applied a subsurface division modifier to it to smooth it out for shading.

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,600
Now we can go in and tweak these settings to see little of all those almost like rivers running through

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,130
a valley.

100
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,670
We could use a colour ramp know to make things even more interesting here.

101
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,170
Now I'm going to go diving into details there.

102
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,680
I really like that looks like some sort of rocky marble Let's turn the scale down tweak it a little

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:12,990
more.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,070
Okay.

105
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,830
There's lots and lots of fun you can have just tweaking settings left right centre.

106
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,740
Just see what you can come up with.

107
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,480
And of course I have not got time to play with it all.

108
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,000
All.

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,750
I like that.

110
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,360
Another time to play with it all day long.

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,320
But I'll leave you guys to do that.

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,890
Please share your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
