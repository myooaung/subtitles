00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,180
Welcome to the introduction to blender physics.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,860
So why use physics.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,620
Well it simulates the real world we live in a physical world where things fall over they bounce off

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,570
of one another and we can use the physics engine in blender to simulate this.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,080
Now you can manually place every bit of destroyed or deformed geometry if you wanted to.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,730
And that's what this section is focussed on is the destruction and defamation of geometry.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,610
However you can also use the physics engine to animator with.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,040
So instead of animating a ball rolling down a surface or bouncing off of something you could use the

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,830
physics engine to do that for you.

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:48,850
Now it does enable you to create complex scenes easily and quickly so you can go down the route manually

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,400
placing things and having that exact control.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:59,230
But if you were trying to simulate a wall falling over or perhaps some glass shattering you probably

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,510
don't want to do that manually because it would be an absolute pain to do so.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,020
But if you fancy a challenge you can go half and through that I'm not going to because this is great

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,820
for realism.

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,360
As I've mentioned shattering glass falling towers you can even make some dominoes or something along

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,400
those lines with it.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,670
Of course those things are quite complex so we're going to start with something simple.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,950
We're going to focus initially on rigid body physics what's rigid body physics will as the name suggests

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,700
it simulates the physics of rigid or solid bodies.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:44,170
So if you imagine just hard surfaces said chairs tables glasses etc. they all come under that solid

22
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,040
body.

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,220
Now this works very closely with the animation system as I've been alluding to it.

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,040
You can simulate a ball rolling down a hill or two objects bouncing off of one another and it works

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,130
in conjunction with the animation system rather seamlessly.

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,930
Some of the other physics simulations don't work so well with the animation system.

27
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,370
Now it's all move and rotate objects.

28
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,910
That's important so it was going to translate them and rotate them as they fall through the air or as

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,590
they break apart.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,300
Now what it won't do is deform them.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,370
Okay so now we've got that under our belts.

32
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,990
Let's go play with rigid body physics and hop on over in a blender.

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,360
Okay so over in blender and I'm going to do a couple of things.

34
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm going to just save a default layout.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,390
I'm going to keep it almost like the fault lay out when you first open blender.

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,110
However I'm going to set the end frame at 50 for the moment.

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,310
I've got a feeling I'm going to set this up several times so I'm literally going to save the starter

38
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,950
file as it is there.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,850
Perfect.

40
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,490
So don't open up the tool shelf here and select my cube.

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:01,150
Now there are a couple of ways of adding a rigid body physics to a any mesh object in blender.

42
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,630
So there is a physics tab it's quite hard to redev when it's all squished up but it's just there and

43
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,560
want something selected.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,990
We have two options to add active and add passive.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Now you can also do that on the properties window itself.

46
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,970
There's a little bouncy ball icon and we've got rigid body and when you click that's there.

47
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,820
By default you'll get an active object.

48
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,690
Now what does that do.

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,460
Well let's go ahead and press play now or use a shortcut.

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:29,840
Oh.

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,590
In a way we can see that it falls away.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,370
And 50 frames seems to be a good loop point because it's disappeared from the screen.

53
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,700
Now if this was active it means that it is being controlled by the physics engine.

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,720
If it's passive It means it's not but will still interact with other Richard bodies.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
So if we set this now to passive we can see it just sits there.

56
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,130
However if we put another cube into the scene.

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,930
Well let's do that.

58
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Let's and Jube jubilate This cube.

59
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,370
And I'm just going to move up on the.

60
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,590
Z axis there and then move it across just a little on the X and make that want active.

61
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,420
Okay let's see what happens.

62
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,550
There we go it falls off into oblivion.

63
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,200
So that's quite useful and in fact here I'm looking a set that a little longer since now it's falling

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,630
for longer.

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,470
There we go.

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,310
So with 75 frames there we seem to get quite a fall animation we can see it disappearing.

67
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,580
So what are the other options.

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,020
Because in general it's great to just hit add active or add passive.

69
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,520
But in general we're going to want to have a bit more detail.

70
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,350
So over in the properties panel itself we've got some options now.

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:53,840
Active and passive are here animated is very useful because it enables us to use the animation system

72
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,190
a key the movements in and then let's blend of physics take over later on.

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,060
We won't do that at the moment but we can do that later on the mass.

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,390
Now the mass itself is pretty self-explanatory it's the weight of our object.

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,160
Now this is in kilograms and that is a was that's a two by two metre cube essentially weighing one kilograms

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,610
so it's going to act like a 1 kilogram two meter cube.

77
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,720
However if that weighed 10 kilos it would act slightly differently as you can see it's not sort of bouncing

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,650
off as far as it would do before.

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,330
And if we set that as a very lights one we can see it behaves differently as well so we can change the

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,010
mass of our objects.

81
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,750
Now one thing to bear in mind is if you haven't set the scale correctly.

82
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,100
So let's bring out the properties window here.

83
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,270
So we've got a scale here of 1 1 1 and on here of 1 1 1 which is absolutely fine.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,830
However if we scale something up an unfit flies there.

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,210
If we scale something up like that we we see that it's going to act slightly differently.

86
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,940
In fact in this case because we scaled it and moved it whilst the physics engine was running it's not

87
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,550
like that at all so let's just put it slightly above.

88
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:20,410
So this is going to act differently because it's bigger but it will still act as if it was a smaller

89
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,400
cube.

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,630
So what we'd need to do in this case is make sure we apply with control a or go into object and apply

91
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:38,050
the actual scale and then it should be hafe like an appropriately sized cube that weighs 10 kilos that

92
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:44,950
can be very odd to get your head round at first but it does mean that the physics will act more realistically.

93
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,010
Of course if the desired result you want is a little bit unrealistic then you can do that so that's

94
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,950
absolutely fine.

95
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,840
Now rigid body collisions the next area down we've got a convex hull and the meshes self.

96
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,960
In general I wouldn't bother picking any of the others for the moment because it does change how things

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,750
behave.

98
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,240
So if I selected sphere this will act more like a ball.

99
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,000
And as you can see let's zoom in here so we can see it is actually intersecting and that's because instead

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,290
of using the outside faces of our mesh as basically where it's bumping into it's put a sphere inside

101
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,050
our model.

102
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,410
Now there may be reasons why you want that so either no to make a cube roll.

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,260
But so if we were doing that we could go down to the next area and go to collision margin put that on

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,910
and then increase it.

105
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,000
Now we set that top one and see what happens it will work.

106
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,380
It hasn't seemed to do much in this case.

107
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm guessing it's still going inside the model.

108
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:53,410
Let's send it back to Convex Hull and let the simulation run and we can see there's a one blend the

109
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,670
unique gap.

110
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,690
It's literally hitting it a blender unit away.

111
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,120
So this can be useful.

112
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,780
I would not set it to zero.

113
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,300
But if you're having objects passing through one another the small small at that it was at before the

114
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,460
point 0 4 is usually more than enough to prevent it passing through.

115
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,520
Now friction is as we can gather is that how friction is the surface of that is.

116
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,800
So it was set down to zero it would have no friction and freely scoots across a lot of surfaces.

117
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:31,980
And if it was one it would really grip onto any surface it comes into contact with bounciness of course

118
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,110
is how bouncy an object is.

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,710
And we might not see in this particular simulation perhaps a ball bouncing on the ground would be a

120
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:46,710
better object bearer example of something as bouncy or indeed something that's got zero friction and

121
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,520
high bouncing us.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,910
There we go.

123
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,460
We can see that was skipping over the surface really quickly and bouncing away.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,540
Brilliant.

125
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,190
Okay.

126
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,520
So there's rigid body dynamics down here at the moment we won't go into that just at the moment.

127
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,380
But you can literally deactivate something until something else comes into contact with it.

128
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,400
If you wanted to and well since we're here let's do it anyway dampening.

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,230
Well we can dampen its movement or its rotation so we can say here that it's resistant to rotation.

130
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,920
Then when it hits Oh that is just really odd.

131
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,030
Was that what we intended.

132
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,810
Well maybe not let's turn it down a little.

133
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,520
So something is irritating a little too quickly after it's hit we can dampen that rotation and translation

134
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,990
is exactly the same.

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,800
At one you can see that well it's kind of like it's falling through goo rather than falling free.

136
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,160
Is she not getting through.

137
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,460
But if we lower that we can make the whole thing just a little bit more controlled rather than bouncing

138
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,440
all over the place.

139
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,870
So you can play with these to your heart's content of course to get some an effect or a simulation that

140
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,880
you desire.

141
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,840
And of course that is up to a challenge.

142
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,690
I would like you to go ahead and create a short physics simulation.

143
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:14,700
So create a simple scene using basic meshes gennari a physics simulation with some interactions so things

144
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,110
are hitting one and over and use both passive and active rigid bodies.

145
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,220
Pause video now and give That's a go.

146
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay guys welcome back.

147
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,090
Let's go create a short physics simulation.

148
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,780
Okay so I've started off in a default scene here and I'm going to really icky but I don't want a cube.

149
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,220
I want a plane.

150
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,330
I'm going to scale up the plane.

151
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,370
Not pushing it through itself too about that and I'm going to tilt it so slightly down here so I'm going

152
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,050
to rotate on the x direction and then just do that.

153
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,390
So whatever lands on here should then slide down.

154
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,990
So let's go ahead and add something to land on it's going to add in a U.S. sphere and then we use it

155
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,610
as a ball and pop it in here and just see what happens.

156
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,090
Now of course we've not applied any physics yet so what do we need we need on here.

157
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,690
This is going to stay still so we need to add a rigid bullet to both of these.

158
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,110
And of course if we decide to play at the moment they both fall away.

159
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,820
So what I'm ONLY to do is make the ground itself passive.

160
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,500
And then the ball should hit the ground and roll.

161
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,660
Excellent.

162
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,830
Now looks like in this case we're going to need slightly more frame someone to go up to 200 here.

163
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,800
That should give us plenty to see what happens.

164
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,670
It should accelerate down here.

165
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,230
Perfect.

166
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,860
Okay.

167
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,560
So now that we've done that let's play with some of the settings and see what happens.

168
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:52,370
So both of these have a friction point five which is resistance to moving and about in this syrup.

169
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,290
So what happens if we set the ground with a bounciness of 1.

170
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,510
Extremes are a great way of testing things doesn't do anything.

171
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay so what happens if we set both of them to a bounciness of 1.

172
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm guessing it's going to bounce x.

173
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,000
So there we go there's a bouncing ball going down the hill.

174
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,260
Let's set this to zero.

175
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,640
And I'm guessing it won't bounce.

176
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,220
Okay so this is a great example of experimentation and working out the bounciness.

177
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,800
If both of one or more of the items have anything with zero in them especially the floor if you've got

178
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,190
more than one item then it's not going to really work.

179
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:38,140
However what this could both do for us is if we go back to the BE IN of the animation and let's say

180
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,760
let's go from a top few here and let's duplicate this a couple of times before it hit the right key.

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,220
So there we go.

182
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,130
So you got plenty there.

183
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:57,540
Now if they impact one out of it because they of course they won't impact each other down a straight

184
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,440
slope like that.

185
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,780
They'll just race one another into oblivion.

186
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,470
Bought we can do here is well let's subdivide our plane and give it some substance really under we go

187
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,780
for a simple subdivision and I'm going to apply that subdivision Locanda in edit mode.

188
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,420
There we go.

189
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,640
So now we've got something to play with.

190
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,930
I can pull up some geometry for it to for them to bounce off of.

191
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,760
Because they won't bounce off of it till we're actually in object mode.

192
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,420
Okay so we're letting them roll down and we can see that the bullet Oh things are falling through the

193
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,070
floor.

194
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,540
Let's just let it settle.

195
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,320
Let's redo the animation.

196
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,670
Well I wasn't expecting that.

197
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm going to add modify and add.

198
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,940
A subdivision is surfacing just to smooth those out ever so slightly.

199
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,070
Let's see if that's made any difference.

200
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,650
Okay so these balls are now passing through the surface of our model.

201
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,890
Now that would suggest that it's not having time to calculate the impact that these balls are having

202
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,270
or literally they're passing through the surface.

203
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,650
I'll make sure that's let's say the mesh itself rather than a convex whole let's see if that makes a

204
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,100
difference.

205
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,580
This resets and plate.

206
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,240
Yes it does make a difference.

207
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Now will these balls collide with one another kind of.

208
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,400
But they're not bouncing off of one of.

209
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,580
So let's give the ground a bit of bounciness and the balls will maybe be a bit more interesting.

210
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,290
And again this is one of these things that you can play with to your heart's content until you get it

211
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,170
how you want it to be.

212
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,150
Now the margin here might help if he probably does now that these aren't falling through.

213
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,180
That's one of the differences here.

214
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,760
The convects hole the coalition margin if it's not there allows them to fall through.

215
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,320
So I see examples of that actually work in action so we can move it's convex whole and we can see they're

216
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,500
hitting one another and they have got a bounciness of one.

217
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,740
Let's give them let's make them frictionless or make this one frictionless and see what happens.

218
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,520
So that's just sliding and pushing the other one down.

219
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,030
So because it's got no friction it's not rotating so we can add in a tiny bit of friction because that

220
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,280
ruins are a physics model.

221
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,620
So we've got to start from the beginning again and that's because some friction it should grip.

222
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,940
There we go and rotates.

223
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,450
I don't think I've got enough things that for it to bump into.

224
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,900
But by now you should have got the gist of your marble run or whatever you guys have created and do

225
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,740
remember to show your work in the discussions over the forum.

226
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,310
Love to see what you guys come up with some simple physics in blender.

227
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,120
And as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
