Hello everybody and welcome back. 
1

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.420
This is going to be a very quick lecture hopefully some of you guys are giving me some feedback and
2

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.030
I think it is wonderful so I'm gonna show you an alternative way now of importing reference material
3

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.310
as well very similar to what we were doing before.
4

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.000
However we can actually specify the size and we can tweak some of the settings as well.
5

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.940
So let's go ahead and do that without default cube in front of us.
6

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.530
We can just delete that and get it out of the way we can then go in and I'm not going to orientate my
7

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.680
view just yet because I'll show you we can just change things later on as well.
8

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
I'm going to go to add something in a shift and A and we're gonna add in this reference material.
9

10
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.920
Let's go and find our pin.
10

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.550
Go to my bookmarks that I've already got here or recent.
11

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.270
Remember this is this side bit here.
12

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.130
It's very tricky sometimes it gets in the way and you can pull it down and suddenly everything's back.
13

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.580
Err I need my pin reference.
14

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.240
If you're unsure of course you can click the thumbnails option at the very top here we can see everything
15

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.000
is going on as you can see this is Michael from the future.
16

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.510
This is what we're going towards.
17

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.230
Brilliant isn't it.
18

19
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.610
Okay so let's open up the pin reference so we get it in the screen here.
19

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.740
And if we scroll down these tabs on the left here and go to the one that looks like a picture that's
20

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.090
the object data properties that image there does change if you're working with a mesh objects it's different
21

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.300
from if you're working with the camera or if you're working with a lamp etc..
22

23
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.790
So is currently an image and we get lots of options here.
23

24
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.020
So we can actually specify the size to be point three eight if we wanted it to and it's suddenly gone
24

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.980
a lot lot smaller.
25

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.550
There we go.
26

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.610
So if we wanted that size we could pop it in there.
27

28
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.280
I can scroll down here and I can turn on use Alpha and then you can see through the image as well.
28

29
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.780
And the other really cool thing here is you can change whether it's shown only in orthoraphic or
29

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.190
in orthographic and perspective or only in perspective.
30

31
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.030
So what we can do here is we can align this image with our view first of all.
31

32
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.980
So if we go ahead and open up the properties sidebar here and then go to the rotation settings I'm going
32

33
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.500
to zero them all out because I'm not sure which way we need to rotate is is going to be 90 degrees on
33

34
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.680
the X axis and then we can have a look at it from the front when we look at it from the front we can
34

35
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.110
just change this option here.
35

36
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.540
Display in perspective.
36

37
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.260
So now when we move out of this it will disappear but it will be there whenever we're looking at it
37

38
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.370
in front orthographic because because that is the way that it is facing.
38

39
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.140
So there are a couple of options there very quick lecture I know but just just go in and at this.
39

40
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.570
So it's the appropriate size and you can see here because I've added in point three eight.
40

41
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.480
The question is there of course what size is that referring to.
41

42
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.600
Well okay.
42

43
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.480
And the size thing we can just check for real if it's the right size at point three eight I think this
43

44
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.650
needs to be one point nine nought point one nine.
44

45
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.670
My mistake.
45

46
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.120
There we go.
46

47
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080
That should sit exactly on the floor.
47

48
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.660
Then we can go ahead and add in our reference cube again and set its dimensions two points three eight
48

49
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.810
on base height and left it up to point one nine.
49

50
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.230
I believe the dimensions here I think we said Point 1 2 12 12 centimetres in fact we can type twelve
50

51
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.240
centimetres remember you can do that.
51

52
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.370
And now I think you'll find that if we go into wireframe.
52

53
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.210
Yes.
53

54
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.980
Perfect.
54

55
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.870
So there you go.
55

56
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
There's another way of adjusting your reference material to the same size.
56

57
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.390
Now you'll find that both this and the one taught in the last lecture will be useful in different circumstances.
57

58
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.470
Hope you've enjoyed this quick tip on your reference material and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
