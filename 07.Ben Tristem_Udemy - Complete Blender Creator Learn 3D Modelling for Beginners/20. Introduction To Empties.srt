Hello everybody and welcome to empties in this lecture.
1

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,110
We're going to introduce the concepts of an empty itself.
2

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,250
It is a null object.
3

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,780
It has no geometry is mainly used for control and organization and it can also be used in modifiers
4

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,990
as well and we can do really funky things with the array modifier if we use an empty, they can use be
5

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,970
used as a handle to control objects.
6

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:35,110
So later on when we get to animation we can set up an empty to make sure that a piece of a model tracks
7

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,490
to that empty.
8

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,440
And of course when we go to render it means that it will not be in our scene at all which is very useful.
9

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,590
It can be used as a parent object for a group of objects.
10

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,960
So much like you can shove everything in a collection.
11

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,730
Well if you need to move a whole lot of objects at once you can assign them to one empty and then just
12

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,290
move the empty.
13

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,260
And of course they'll have many other uses as well.
14

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,810
So let's hop on over to the blender and explore empties.
15

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,250
Okay so we're over in the default blend file here the first thing I'm going to do is add an empty so
16

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,870
you can get to it via the add menu or shift and A.
17

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,490
And when you do that we can go down to where it says empty and you will see that there are loads of
18

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,180
different types of empty that you can use.
19

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,930
They are all the same.
20

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,540
That's something that's very important.
21

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,430
This is just their appearance.
22

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,290
That is how they look in the 3D viewport.
23

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,430
Which one you actually pick doesn't matter at all.
24

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,390
I'm going to pick the plane axis for the moment and I'm just going to move over here.
25

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,710
Out of the way to show you what it looks like.
26

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,720
So it's got an origin just like every other object does and then it will have a certain shape as you
27

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,190
can see here it intersects the origin.
28

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,360
If we were to add a different type of empty let's say a single arrow this could be used to donate the
29

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,490
direction of something and how it should move.
30

31
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,370
And that's the purpose for having these different empties it's just to infer a different type of movement
31

32
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,420
or different use case.
32

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,300
So I'm going to delete that empty from there.
33

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,460
So what we can do here is we can select tile cube shift and select our empty go control and P and parent
34

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,120
it.
35

36
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,400
Now that means that when we move around this empty much like when we move the chessboard around all
36

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,980
of the associated pieces followed.
37

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,040
Now just remember over in the outliner.
38

39
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,010
Everything is in one collection at the moment the scenes collection.
39

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,590
However if we wanted to see the hierarchy of how things are parented we'd need to switch from view
40

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:37,210
layer to the scenes and then we can break everything down into the objects and their hierarchy itself
41

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,560
and that's useful being able to switch between those two because depending on what you're doing you
42

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,060
may find one view more informative than another.
43

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,380
And it's certainly when you start getting things piled on top of each other much easier to open up your
44

45
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,170
outliner.
45

46
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,220
Maybe stretch it out a little here and select the item by just clicking on it here.
46

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,240
So empties are incredibly useful they just go in your scene.
47

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,890
You can use them to control.
48

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:09,760
So at this point we could rotate the empty you can see that the cube will rotate from this point here.
49

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,070
Now that's really really useful because that means we could also use it as a pivot point.
50

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,530
So if you've got something that opens and you need to use this elsewhere in order for it to work that's
51

52
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,370
what you can do.
52

53
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,470
So now we've had the overview of empties.
53

54
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,040
I'd like you to use them now in our challenge.
54

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,350
Okay.
55

56
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,850
So your challenge sets up an empty for the black and white pieces and also add another empty for the
56

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,110
pawns themselves.
57

58
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,160
Now where you store the empty in the scene.
58

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,730
Just think about it logically and where you would want to place that she may wants the whites and black
59

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,800
pieces to be in certain locations and obviously dumping all of your empties on top of one another might
60

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,530
not be a great idea for selection.
61

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,840
Also you're going to have to add those black pieces into our scene and give them an appropriate material
62

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,500
as well.
63

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,660
Parent the pieces to the appropriate empty.
64

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:08,340
You may have a different hierarchy from me at the end you may have the white pieces being a parent of
65

66
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,000
the empty for the pawns.
66

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,820
That's entirely up to you how you structure that.
67

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,710
There are a couple of ways of doing it my way is not necessarily the right way.
68

69
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,850
It would just be an alternative way.
69

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,720
Now use collections for grouping as well.
70

71
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,520
We haven't used collections in a while.
71

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,130
I'd like you to practice the skill of adding things to collections for the grouping as well.
72

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,540
So we're going to have a hierarchy with parenting and children and we're also going to have a hierarchy
73

74
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,890
of collections as well.
74

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,890
So for the white pieces maybe for the pawns it's up to you how granular you want to be but certainly
75

76
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,870
for the whites and black pieces and then check your reference material is your board the right way round?
76

77
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,680
I know mine isn't so I'm going to have to sort that out. Pause a video now and give that a go okay.
77

78
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,580
So with our chess scene loaded up the first thing I need to work out is selecting everything at the
78

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,920
moment is going to be a real pain to go along and just hold down shift and select things is perfectly
79

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,980
possible because what we have here isn't too difficult to do.
80

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,370
In fact what I would do here is I'd highlight everything and then hold down shift and just click the
81

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,140
board twice to make the active selected and then deselect it.
82

83
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,400
Now I think we've got all of those objects selected and first of all I'm going to move them into a collection
83

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,480
because when we move them into a collection then these will be black pieces.
84

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,250
Initially when we move them into this collection what we can then do is whilst we're in the scenes view
85

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,700
in the outliner.
86

87
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,180
You can open up scene collection and just click on black pieces or just click on selection and it will
87

88
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,460
automatically select everything.
88

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,030
If you are in the other view the view layer when you do that.
89

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,810
Let's go down to black pieces if you click on it it doesn't select the black pieces.
90

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,420
You'd have to right click and select objects to do that.
91

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,410
So I'm going to go back to the scenes layer so everything's both got the collections there so I can
92

93
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:01,920
test them.
93

94
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,650
And it's got a hierarchy that we have.
94

95
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,150
So we've got a chess board and then we've got everything else underneath it.
95

96
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,290
And of course this will change in a moment when we start adding our empties.
96

97
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,770
But the first thing I want to do is select my black pieces duplicate them move them on the X axis by
97

98
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,460
I think it's going to be minus 30 or sorry the Y axis.
98

99
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,330
There we go.
99

100
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,610
And whilst they're all selected I am going to have to select these two notches because they're not, there
100

101
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,350
we go and then move them once again to white pieces
101

102
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,470
okay so now we have the two collection the two main collection set up.
102

103
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,130
It is now a matter of selecting everything else here and G Y.
103

104
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,760
And I think that's going to be twelve.
104

105
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,900
Yes minus twelve.
105

106
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,780
Okay so we've got the basic set up there.
106

107
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,350
These all need an appropriate material on them.
107

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,430
So let's go ahead with just one of them selected for the moment and go to our materials have going to
108

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,670
add a new material and I'm going to call it black pieces because we may have a different material for
109

110
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,520
the black squares certainly worth bearing in mind.
110

111
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,320
And I'm just gonna make it a dark gray for the moment.
111

112
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,060
There we go because it's a linked object linked duplicates all of the other linked items of inherited
112

113
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,420
that which is really awesome and that's the purpose of doing that.
113

114
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,810
Now I can just select black pieces from there.
114

115
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,830
Same thing happens now.
115

116
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,810
These don't have a material at the moment so I'm going to create new material and call it white pieces
116

117
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,960
and that's fine that's now applied to all of the linked.
117

118
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,020
And finally here we can just select it from the dropdown white pieces.
118

119
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,990
Excellent.
119

120
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,440
So now everything has got the appropriate material.
120

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,040
Everything is in collections.
121

122
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,060
It's just a matter of thinking about ordering things naturally.
122

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,880
So we'd need to add in a couple of empties.
123

124
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,130
So I'm gonna select all of my pawns here.
124

125
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,590
Now there's a couple of way of selecting all the pawns.
125

126
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,620
What we can do here is just select all of the objects that share the same object data, the same mesh
126

127
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,900
data I'm going to press shift then L and that also select linked.
127

128
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,880
So we want to select things that are linked by object data and then we go we've got all of those selected.
128

129
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,810
I'm going to go shift and S to move the cursor to selected which is smack bang in the middle.
129

130
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,800
And I'm gonna go and add an empty it's going to be a plain axis which is absolutely fine.
130

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,950
I'm gonna make the radius a little bit smaller maybe five centimeters because our scale of our model's
131

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:41,070
quite small rather than a meter across and I'm going to call this object black pawns.
132

133
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,560
There we go.
133

134
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,230
So that's the black pawns one done there.
134

135
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,530
And I can do the same thing again.
135

136
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,000
Shift L select all of the linked objects.
136

137
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,380
Now it may be difficult to select the empty without clicking on the board so I'm going to go over to
137

138
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,130
my outliner to find the black pawns empty and parent all of them to it's excellent.
138

139
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,100
And now we need another empty.
139

140
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:09,700
And I'm gonna go to my 3D cursor here and just move it's using the field over on the right and I'm going
140

141
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,250
to place.
141

142
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,190
Let's see.
142

143
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah probably they're going to add in another empty plain axis I'm going to call this empty black pieces
143

144
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,170
and now we've done that.
144

145
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,970
I can select everything that shares the same material.
145

146
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,050
So shift and L, select material.
146

147
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,510
There we go.
147

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,570
We've got everything there.
148

149
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,730
Find the black pieces and parent it.
149

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,380
Now you can see here there's going to be a backwards and forwards coming here.
150

151
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,970
So at this point I am going to not have the pawn selected actually I'm going to select the bishop shift
151

152
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,230
and L object data.
152

153
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,070
I'm going to make sure these notches are selected as well and I'm going to link those and parent them
153

154
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,460
sorry to the black pieces individually so making sure that the empty is the last thing to be selected
154

155
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,170
and then the black pawns empty.
155

156
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,850
I'm going to parent that to the black pieces empty.
156

157
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,020
So you just have to think carefully about the order in which you do things.
157

158
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,980
And now I'm going to repeat the same process on the other side.
158

159
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,080
Now rightly thinking you could actually just duplicate everything we've now got here and move it over
159

160
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,630
to the other side and switch that piece color out and then do a bit of renaming.
160

161
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,930
And I think that might actually be a good idea.
161

162
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,250
Yes I'm going to give it a go.
162

163
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,460
It may fail but I think that's actually going to be the better way of handling this particular operation.
163

164
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,700
So I'm going to delete all of those pieces.
164

165
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm going to select all of these ones and it looks like I've managed to capture everything but concern
165

166
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,980
that we've we're missing a notch over here.
166

167
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,990
So something's happened to our notch at some point I think.
167

168
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,920
Yes.
168

169
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,200
So when we've applied the parent at some points there we go.
169

170
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,480
When we parented in our bishops here so control and P we need to keep the transform.
170

171
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,440
Otherwise it moved the notch away.
171

172
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,430
Okay.
172

173
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:12,880
And then I think we need to go back and do the black pawns and parent it to the black pieces parent object.
173

174
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,500
And there we go it's not moved anything else.
174

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,250
Perfect.
175

176
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,840
So now we've caught that one out.
176

177
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,770
It's important to check your work as you go not just blindly blunder forward like I just did.
177

178
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,800
We can delete all of those select all of these including that empty there.
178

179
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,330
I think they're all selected.
179

180
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,170
Perfect.
180

181
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,480
Let's duplicate those and then move them on the Y axis by minus 30.
181

182
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,160
Again that didn't move quite right did it.
182

183
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,510
Let's just continue moving it on the Y axis.
183

184
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,060
So that's roughly right and we can place things perfectly in a moment.
184

185
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,590
In fact let's just have a look at their world position.
185

186
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,900
If I said that's a minus twenty one we should be good because everything else has been pulled along
186

187
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:00,260
with it and then we can go ahead and grab these bishops I can do that but just aligning it like so and
187

188
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,550
moving them on the Y axis by minus twelve, I move them to the right position.
188

189
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,370
Now we've got a slightly different position now for all of our pieces.
189

190
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,830
So I'm just going to undo that and rotates all of these pieces around.
190

191
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:22,670
So I'm going to select this one here rotate everything on the Z axis by one hundred and eighty and then
191

192
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,790
move it forward and then we should have everything in the right place.
192

193
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,240
So we're moving it forward by nine centimeters.
193

194
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,160
Here we go.
194

195
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,530
So that saved me faffing around with everything else and that's a great thing of actually using an empty.
195

196
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,490
I couldn't realistically done that operation as easy if I didn't have everything linked to it.
196

197
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:49,010
So the final thing here is to call this white pieces and then find this one and call this white pawns.
197

198
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,950
So this is the downside of doing it this way.
198

199
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,350
There was a couple bits of renaming to be done.
199

200
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,650
Now the pawns themselves they are obviously a bit different than they have been duplicated not linked
200

201
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,220
duplicates so they even though these are all linked duplicates of one another because we duplicated
201

202
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,270
them from here.
202

203
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:13,350
They've lost the association with the first low load so we can go along here and set it to white pieces.
203

204
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:13,840
This one.
204

205
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,540
Also to white pieces really quickly.
205

206
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,910
Okay.
206

207
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,700
And now it's time to test our hierarchies.
207

208
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,390
So you've got white pieces.
208

209
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,910
Doesn't select anything.
209

210
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,410
Perfect.
210

211
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,520
So let's go and make sure we've got things in our collection make sure we've got everything selected
211

212
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,370
looks good.
212

213
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,240
Move it to white pieces and I'm going to do that.
213

214
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,150
Oh did that actually move things.
214

215
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,050
Yes it did.
215

216
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,810
Hey sometimes when you click off it's not so easy to get select this lot here move them all to black
216

217
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,210
pieces here we go.
217

218
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,920
So that's good.
218

219
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,320
We should now be able to select the white pieces and the black pieces really quickly.
219

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,240
Excellent.
220

221
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,010
We should have black pieces and then white pieces individually.
221

222
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,580
Excellent.
222

223
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,320
We can just pick up everything by selecting that or selecting this one here and there's one last parent
223

224
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
to do all of these pieces.
224

225
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,560
Should be parented to the board so control and P parent it to the board itself.
225

226
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,820
That means if the board moves everything moves.
226

227
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,410
If we move the White pieces everything moves.
227

228
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,020
Excellent.
228

229
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,970
I think we're done and dusted.
229

230
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:26,860
Just gonna check my hierarchy once more so we've got black pieces white pieces chess board so a nice simple
230

231
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,520
object hierarchy and then our scene collection.
231

232
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:38,130
I'm just going to call this board for the moment because that's all that's within there.
232

233
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,480
There is a camera and lights as well so I'm going to call it board camera and lights.
233

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,910
Of course that may change later on as well.
234

235
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,350
Hey it's Mike back from a few lectures time I was about to go brilliant we're all done.
235

236
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:00,280
Please share your work and I just realized that just moving it to the side of the board doesn't put
236

237
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,470
a black square in this lower corner.
237

238
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,270
So there is one final thing to do here.
238

239
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm going to select both of these empties and so the middle point will still be accurate when I go and
239

240
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,310
rotates it on the Z axis everything will swing around perfectly.
240

241
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,370
And I only need to do it by 90 degrees and then we've got the black square in the lower corner.
241

242
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,000
There is of course another way of doing it.
242

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,370
I could reassign black to white and it would flip all the colors around but simply rotating it around
243

244
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,420
the central point of these two empties is all we need to do.
244

245
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,890
And there we go.
245

246
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,760
Brilliant.
246

247
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,390
I can finally say it we are all done.
247

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,790
I'm really happy with how this is working out so far.
248

249
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,330
Hope yours are coming along really well as well.
249

250
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,150
If you did decide on a different hierarchy I'd love to see what you've done so please to share your
250

251
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,200
work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
