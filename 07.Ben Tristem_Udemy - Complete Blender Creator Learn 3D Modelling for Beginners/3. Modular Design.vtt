00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.400
Hello everybody and welcome back in this show.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.140
I'd like to just dive straight into the core principle that we're going to be focused on whenever it

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.250
comes to repeating parts in our models and that is thinking modular.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.240
How can we go ahead and make a level or an area with repeating parts that aren't too repetitive but

5
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.680
make it easy for you to construct a level to a world an environment that you can be in right.

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.180
Think about ways of building that make parts of your model reusable and modular so that you can produce

7
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.940
one piece and use it multiple times depending on what you're trying to do.

8
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.130
Even if that means you scale something slightly larger for something else.

9
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.040
And one of the best examples of this is Lego.

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.560
The reason why it's one of the most popular toys in the world is these building blocks are standardized.

11
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.180
You can fit them together and you can make representations of the world around you.

12
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.940
And this is one of the great things and one of the things that I want you to embrace within the section

13
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.480
is you're making a representation of a world around you especially in the early days before we get to

14
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.560
the detail we really need to make sure that our major shapes are correct.

15
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.280
We need to make sure that our outline basically erupts three dimensional sketch of the world we want

16
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.010
to create is there.

17
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.460
Now one thing to realize is this gives you quick iterations great prototyping potential from just a

18
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.580
few parts.

19
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.240
One of the great things here is you can iterate around really quickly which is basically just going

20
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.330
through the same process again and again and trying out new ideas.

21
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.250
And this is what really speeds up your flow.

22
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.410
It will be a crying shame if you were to go ahead and model an awesome Gothic church realized that it

23
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.770
needed to be a couple of blocks wider and it wasn't easy to fix if you got building blocks you could

24
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.250
probably just move it apart slightly and add the additional blocks and now you do have to be wary of

25
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.840
the scale that you're working at because if you end up doing lots of small parts it becomes a bit owner

26
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.600
risk trying to build a building.

27
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.210
In this particular example anyway as of all of these tiny parts you may want larger more specialized

28
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.980
modular parts.

29
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.670
Now finally if you are a supplier of assets your level design and level maker is going to love the fact

30
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.860
that they can redesign something with your own assets.

31
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.300
The other good thing is if you are that level designer it does mean that you've got a suite of models

32
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.510
that you can put together very quickly in a game engine and be able to create a level really quickly.

33
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.720
And this is just as applicable in Blender not just in a game engine calling it's a level brick quite

34
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.880
easily just be your scene.

35
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.330
So whatever approach you're taking to it's being able to quickly iterate through scene ideas and designs

36
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.790
is spot on and it's really what you want at the beginning of the stage when you're starting to map out

37
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.400
your projects and how it's going to work.

38
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.180
Let's go take a fundamental look at modular design and hop on over into blender okay.

39
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.010
So here we are over in Blender and we've got the default cube in front of us.

40
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.670
Now I'm gonna go up to the very top here and turn on the snapping toe and I'm going to leave it but

41
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.850
I am going to change not just increments but I'm going to snap its absolute grid snap in case I just

42
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.840
move my model around and I don't want it's in there in between the grid so pressing G enables us to

43
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.010
move things around and we've got the fundamental and we've got the fundamental building block that is

44
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.960
Minecraft so you can pretty much make as we experience right back at the very beginning of the course

45
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.420
your ability to make something just out of basic cubes and that is one of the fundamental things when

46
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.030
it comes to modelling.

47
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.940
Now this isn't a very inspiring model if we start working on this so let's tweak it a little first let's

48
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.070
go over into edit mode go to face select select this face and let's move it on the x axis and make it

49
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.720
more of a a wall piece and what I'm going to call this a wall as well.

50
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.740
Now I'm going to recommend that you name your pieces straight away I don't recommend that you leave

51
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.720
it till later.

52
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.330
This hierarchy is going to get very messy very quickly when we start building up a level full of individual

53
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.400
pieces.

54
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.140
Okay so we've got our basic wall piece now one of the key things about using modular designs is they

55
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.820
have to fit together.

56
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.470
So we've got a short wall piece here what are power.

57
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.130
If we have a longer war piece so I'm just going to duplicate it with shift and D and move it across

58
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.160
a little and I'm going to call this long wall and I'm going to rename the other one short wall straight

59
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.760
away.

60
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.370
Now I would encourage you to do this as well.

61
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.150
It's very tempting to not rename something until later on but we've just changed the purpose of this

62
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.840
I'm going to shift it along and unskilled scalar on its y axis by 2.

63
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.950
So we've now got a short wall and a long wall.

64
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.610
Now at this point in time I'd also encourage you to materialize your model even at this beginning stage.

65
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.270
So let's go to our materials and set this one as a base color of maybe green and switch over into the

66
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.200
material view.

67
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.630
So both of these are sharing the same material.

68
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.210
Let's remove the material from our first initial wall and just give it a brand new material and make

69
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.350
it cyan.

70
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.560
This just helps distinguish your individual models.

71
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.140
Now one of the things that we can now do is let's say grab this and make ourselves a corner piece.

72
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.500
And now there are two types of corners.

73
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.090
There's an interior corner and an exterior corner and it does depend on what type of style you're going

74
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.540
for.

75
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.380
As to what you can to try and make say for instance here if I go ahead and duplicate this again.

76
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.230
Now bearing in mind at this point I'm making a whole new bit of mesh data.

77
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.190
I'm not doing a linked duplicate.

78
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.210
If I wanted to reuse this again and it wasn't it's own unique item I would want to link duplicate it

79
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.480
with bolt in the but because we're about to make it something of its own.

80
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.960
Then we can make it have a new material.

81
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.250
I want to make this one yellow.

82
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.630
So this is going to be a corner piece a Hopkins edit mode.

83
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.940
Use a loop cut around here and then pull out this particular face which I'm going to have to go in and

84
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.420
grab and let's pull it out on the y axis.

85
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.690
I'm going to extrude sorry not the y axis the x axis.

86
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.140
There you go.

87
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.520
And now we can have an interior corner by grabbing that edge running down there and let's say levelling

88
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.860
it's to give us a very low poly.

89
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.650
Let's give it a couple of Bevel points there.

90
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.370
Excellent.

91
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.960
So we've now got an interior corner and of course we could go round the other way as well.

92
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.090
So what we could have done knowing that we're going to do that I'm going to undo that because it's a

93
00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.800
very simple thing to undo.

94
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.000
I'm going to duplicate this corner piece again.

95
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.190
I'm going to give it a another new material so that we can track our pieces then I can hop into here

96
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.550
and make our interior corner with a bevel and then we're going to have this piece here.

97
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.520
So let's move it first of all not on the z axis a shift in Z.

98
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.790
I'm going to place it roughly where I need it and then I'm going to rotate it on the z axis by 180.

99
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.760
Now you could argue at this point that we could have this piece here having a rounded piece on this

100
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.740
side of it over here.

101
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.100
Now I don't want but I do want two distinct pieces so we can have a sharp corner and a smooth corner

102
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.100
depending on what our needs are.

103
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.490
Let's pop this back against the other piece.

104
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.650
So because it's absolute grit snap it makes it so much easier.

105
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.860
So this will be the final piece in here with the exception of the floor because now we've got a curved

106
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.040
piece in here we've got something to consider when it comes to the floor.

107
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.880
Let's Bevel this edge here and again it's got two points.

108
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.900
So you've got a very simple setup when it comes to this.

109
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:12.430
Now when it comes to the floor itself let's just add into our world a plane.

110
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:19.510
This is three dimensional but the plane the floor doesn't have to be now it's entirely up to you how

111
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.530
you decide to organize this.

112
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:29.950
So if I was to link duplicate the floor piece here and here you now notice that we cannot pop it in

113
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:35.310
this corner without the two pieces intersecting which is okay.

114
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.750
That's not a particular issue but it's because we've got this curved corner.

115
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.320
If we didn't have that curved corner It'd be absolutely fine.

116
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.630
But we do have it.

117
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.350
So what's the solution here.

118
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.360
Well there are a couple of solutions.

119
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.310
One of them would be to make a tiny piece with that same radius on it.

120
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.910
Now that might be a bit over the top for the type of modelling we're doing.

121
00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.620
The other thing that we can do is we can come in and give all of our wall pieces grabbing that lower

122
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:08.980
edge focusing on it with the number pad period K and just extrude a face out and we can do the same

123
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.460
over here as well.

124
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.280
This is one of the ways of coping with corner pieces like this and of course we can round that myths

125
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.260
off as well.

126
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.400
If we wanted to.

127
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.440
So you've got this corner piece here that we want to extend.

128
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.790
What are the ways of doing that.

129
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:28.300
Well what I would do in this particular case is I'd grab vertex select grab this individual vertex here

130
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.640
and just extrude it out and then we can go ahead we can extrude again by pressing the eek enjoyment

131
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.810
together and then merge.

132
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.320
By distance bouts that's a bit dodgy because we could forget to do that.

133
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:45.160
We can simply select the other vertex press the FTA and it'll fill in an edge and then we can go round

134
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.190
select the other ones in that series and fill that in and then we can do the same over here as well

135
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:59.180
so we can make sure we're in edit mode and pull this back along the y axis to their extrude all the

136
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.100
way on the x axis to.

137
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.170
And there we go.

138
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.370
And then finally select the individual vertex there and fill it in.

139
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:13.250
Now one of the things that you'll notice at this particular point is that all of our models all of our

140
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.070
assets that we're creating here are all whole sciences.

141
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.310
That is really really important.

142
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.650
It is critical that things snap together.

143
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.720
If you're making modular assets like this if these pieces don't slot together if you've made one that's

144
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.320
got a wall that's slightly thinner or in a slightly different location like that when you try and put

145
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.040
them together.

146
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.550
I mean this is a real mess up here.

147
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.390
But imagine you'd done that you'd spent all this time modeling this wall.

148
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.880
And then when you put it in it doesn't match up with anything else that would really a real heartache.

149
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:55.430
Now one of the ways around that is making sure that you start with one model and then copy it and then

150
00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:02.060
work along and you can see now that with these simple pieces we can build up quite a complex level.

151
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:08.060
Now we certainly aren't very inspired pieces but it does enable us to construct pretty much any level

152
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.870
layout or any world layout that we want.

153
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.570
How about Mike.

154
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.400
You've got a Gothic church.

155
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.900
We have it solar.

156
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.130
Well that's fine isn't it.

157
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:21.940
We can go in press g z and then lift up maybe two and then we get to the building.

158
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.990
And then if you want to put a quick window in one of these that's gonna be something that we want to

159
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.870
do anyway.

160
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:35.600
Well let's do that let's go GZ to lift it up by 2 and then let's inset this front face and the back

161
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.810
one at the same time.

162
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.030
This is going to enable a bit of a speed build up.

163
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.680
I don't know that's the exact shape I want my balance scale on the z axis and make it a bit smaller

164
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.260
or maybe I want to move it up on the z axis.

165
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.210
Now remember we're snapping turned on it's going to snap to an absolute grid which might not be what

166
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:58.190
you want but if you are in this mode you can hold down control and just slide.

167
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:04.220
And now with those two middle bits selected what we can do is EF 3 to bring up the default search menu

168
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.760
and I can bridge edge loops.

169
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.110
Now bridging edge loops is a phenomenal way of making those windows.

170
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
And there we go.

171
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:17.540
Now it can come back in and I do need to do this on every other piece and we don't just have to do it

172
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.200
piece by piece if I select both of these pieces and go into edit mode.

173
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.940
I can select the top surfaces of all of these.

174
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:33.080
Now it's a bit onerous to do on everything and then extrude it up or indeed move it up by two units.

175
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.750
Now that's one of the great things the multi edit feature now obviously because we have started this

176
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.270
work and then altered it later on that's something you're just gonna have to accept as you progress

177
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.310
through and we got these floor pieces here.

178
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.960
You know what I wants to give them and materials is they don't have anything at the moment let's give

179
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.650
it a darker material but you can see now how you can build up a modular based assets system.

180
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.040
And these are just a few fundamental building blocks.

181
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.030
We've essentially got a corner and interior and an exterior corner and then we have a window a wall

182
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.090
piece and a floor piece.

183
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.770
Now you may want larger floor pieces than that but the critical thing is that all of them match up.

184
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:21.180
And the easiest way of doing that is to make sure that everything goes to a whole number.

185
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.800
So if things are one two three four units wide.

186
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.260
But remember if you have things that are three units wide and everything else is two you're going to

187
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.990
have to make sure you've got some one unit wide pieces to fill in the gaps.

188
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.870
Otherwise you're going to have overlapping geometry and that's never good.

189
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.630
I want to know what this looks like with a bit of shading on it.

190
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.890
Yeah looks like a toy house that a child might have.

191
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.050
Now I've been playing around for a bit and explaining how you might lay these things out.

192
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.880
I've got a very quick challenge for you okay.

193
00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.680
So this should be quite a straightforward challenge I'd like you to make a couple more blocks create

194
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:07.430
a basic in Syria is what we're aiming for at this point in time and think big Don't worry about details

195
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:13.100
like skirting boards etc. You really need to think about those at the very beginning because the other

196
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.340
pieces that we've made need to incorporate that from the very beginning.

197
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.650
Otherwise it's going to be difficult to match everything up but we're just thinking big at the moment

198
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:29.240
we're thinking about general layout so perhaps doorways stairs a ceiling those sorts of things and use

199
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.660
alternate data duplicate pieces you need to complete your building then if you change one or modify

200
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.440
it's going to affect everything.

201
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.340
And remember to give them a material as well.

202
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.330
Pause over there now and give us a go

203
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.300
Okay everybody Welcome back.

204
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.430
Let's go ahead now and completes a basic anterior okay.

205
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.180
Everybody welcome back over into blender so the first thing I'm going to work on here.

206
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.060
How dare.

207
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.450
This is a challenging one.

208
00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.610
How big is the door going to be.

209
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.370
Is it going to be a two.

210
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.790
It's going to have to be a big piece like this.

211
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:11.950
I do want to keep my numbers even either 2 4 8 etc. rather than risk having to have an individual paella

212
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.780
or something along those lines if I Piller could be a individual corner piece although I'm likely to

213
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:23.190
make it two by two and then come into a one by one in the center of that anyway.

214
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:29.570
So we have this piece here will be a great starting piece for a doorway because it's almost there.

215
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.240
So let's go ahead and duplicate it sit with shifty first of all I'm just going to move it down here

216
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.920
and out of the way so we can work on it.

217
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:42.250
Focus on it with the number pad period key and let's have a look and see if we can match things up.

218
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.910
Now this is where actually we might be better with a different starting point but we could.

219
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:54.850
GROSS grab this and lower it down until it's right at the bottom like so you've got intersecting geometry

220
00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:00.370
at that point which is not great for rendering but this was just your block you know that that's done

221
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.640
and dusted we can just move on with it now.

222
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.130
Now the completion test in me would want to perhaps do it this way where we duplicate this block move

223
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:16.030
it across scalar on the y axis by two just like we did before and then go into edit mode and perhaps

224
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:23.230
add a couple of loop cuts in to an appropriate place and look it doesn't work anymore that looping that

225
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:29.080
we wanted to do because of this extra thing that we've dragged out at the bottom not the end of the

226
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:35.170
world though we can still work with what we've got here by reconstructing geometry but I'm not going

227
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:40.000
to do that at this point in time and the reason why I'm not going to suffer around with that is look

228
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.030
we've already got one that works yes we might end up with some Z fighting and in sorts of horrible shading

229
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:51.970
going on the past not our final product we're making basic items at this point in time so that is all

230
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:58.330
I really need you may notice here that the floor doesn't have any thickness we'll get into more details

231
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:04.450
on how we structure our models in the upcoming lectures but for now let's just give this a brand new

232
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:12.070
material I'm going to make this one pink doorway now of course we can rotate that round by 90 degrees

233
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.400
on the z axis and put it somewhere.

234
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.350
So now we can start putting our world together let's bring this down make sure it's in the right place

235
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.360
and we need an interior corner we've already got one of those so we can duplicate that not we shift

236
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:33.010
the though if you do do shift D and you didn't realize that you have indeed managed to duplicate it

237
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:40.050
you can look under the mesh tab down here we can see this is cool cube six and look at my naming up

238
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:46.590
needed to sort that out urgently and this is cube 2 so we can go ahead grab this and change this to

239
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.050
cube 2 and we should think about renaming those.

240
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:55.310
This one here is called whereas it's short wall 0 001.

241
00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.610
No no no no no it's not this is called interior corner

242
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.130
and I'm going to copy that.

243
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:14.220
I'm going to go to the objects tab then I can click on the next one and paste that in and it will also

244
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.740
append the 001.

245
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:24.000
Let's go GZ bring that down are 90 on the z axis and then go g y and pull that back.

246
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.460
There we go.

247
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.600
So we've got in Syria coming together really well.

248
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.520
Now some stairs.

249
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.540
Now this one will be an interesting one because we're talking about keeping things nice and simple.

250
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:40.890
So I would start with a plane in this particular case and I'm going to duplicate that and bring it out.

251
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:46.720
So let's say here now we've got a decision how long we want the stairs to be.

252
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.580
And now this is interesting because this is where the height comes in as well.

253
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.460
So we've got four meters here which is a pretty high room but we'll work on that anyway.

254
00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:01.070
In fact a lot of game rooms tend to be slightly oversized so I'm fine with that.

255
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:09.300
And we can either have a smaller stair piece or a large EFP so we can have two by four or just two section

256
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.190
here and then add it together again.

257
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:18.390
Let's give it its own material before we go ahead and color anything else in let's go in and do that

258
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.320
in object mode.

259
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.110
Let's give it a or what color don't we have a darker blue.

260
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.790
So there we go.

261
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.230
Or purple when we go into edit mode here.

262
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.630
Only use loop cuts.

263
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.080
Now I think I'm going to have four.

264
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.980
Now I need to decide how much they're going up by each time.

265
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.800
So I'm going to go into face mode.

266
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.250
So that's extrude that up by one meter.

267
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.310
This one's going to be extruded up by point 75.

268
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.940
And this one's going to be extruded up.

269
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.540
So Ian and Z by point five.

270
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.910
Oh miss that.

271
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:52.650
And there you go.

272
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.800
And this one extra shooting up by point to five.

273
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.150
So you've got asked as there.

274
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.390
The great thing is we can just grab that duplicate it with Alton.

275
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.170
Because it's going to be the same thing again.

276
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.180
Maggie GZ one and lift it up.

277
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.800
Now these areas here where you can't see don't matter.

278
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.620
That's one of the important things to take away.

279
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.410
And I think I'm going to create one more room at the back here.

280
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.810
Okay.

281
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.550
So you've got the gist of putting these items together.

282
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:29.550
I'm going to speed up the video now and just finish off my little room which could turn out to be quite

283
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.150
a big room.

284
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.610
Okay everybody Welcome back.

285
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:39.430
Some just finished off my building here as you can see there are lots and lots of floor pieces and everything

286
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.830
is now correctly named something to watch out for.

287
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:48.870
Another thing that you can start doing is putting things into collections as well to help maintain it.

288
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.720
Now I'm going to fly through my world now by pressing shift and the grave key just to move around.

289
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:59.470
Use the scroll wheel to make it bigger so we've got a front door here that leads up and out.

290
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:05.030
So this is incredibly useful being able to put this together took hardly any time at all.

291
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:11.800
If you were trying to model this as whole pieces then you just don't have the flexibility that you'd

292
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.540
have had previously.

293
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.070
Now there are a couple of things here.

294
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.530
And I've left them in deliberately to show you.

295
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:24.280
So we've got this floor extra floor piece here which is now outside of our world outside of our view

296
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:31.360
which can be absolutely fine if we're rendering our model from somewhere like here where we don't see

297
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.870
it.

298
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.200
However it's a bit of geometry that's pointless at the moment.

299
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.740
So there is a question to be asked.

300
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:45.280
Do we make a piece like the windows that don't have these ground pieces.

301
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.920
That's entirely up to you how you approach that sort of modelling and also your team as well you may

302
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.180
find that this piece is being used lots in a game that might be not so very optimal.

303
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.220
It's also pretty low cost just having the single plane there that's not being rendered in your scene

304
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.350
however is something to watch out for.

305
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:12.340
There are a series of hidden faces here that would also be a waste everywhere where these pieces butts

306
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.330
up together.

307
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:20.260
We need to consider whether or not it's a solid object or whether or not we need to remove those internal

308
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.250
faces that aren't being shown.

309
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.980
We'll discuss that though in a future lecture.

310
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.690
Now I'd really like to see what you came up with what design did you go for.

311
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.770
I've only decided to flip this round and plonk it in for speed.

312
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:39.750
Now I did have one issue during the construction of this and that was that I had to go from increments

313
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:46.580
snapping to vertex snapping sulphate gone slightly out of line and I wasn't able to line things up again.

314
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.650
And that is one of the things that we'll discuss in an upcoming lecture.

315
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.890
Where do we put our origin points at the moment where they are not very good.

316
00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.100
And unfortunately there is not a one size fits all answer to that.

317
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.480
So that's it for this lecture please share the work that you've done and I'll see you all in the next

318
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.720
one.
