00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.490
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.240
In this lecture we're going to talk specifically about dedicated graphics cards.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.670
There are two types of graphics cards are going to work really well with Blender and that's ones by

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.830
MDA and and video.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.550
You may also think you've got a graphics card that's dedicated Iva and Intel Iris or Intel HD.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.720
Unfortunately they are not dedicated graphics cards.

7
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.770
They're built into your CPM.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.570
The first thing I'm going to do and this is applicable to the Windows environment.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.110
I'm not sure how you do this on Linux.

10
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.010
So please do let us know in the Q and A's if you're having trouble knowing this on Linux.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.320
I do suspect that if you have a Linux based system you already know this.

12
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.160
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to press the Windows key and the Aki at the same time when I've done

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.850
that I can type in M.S. info 32 if I can go ahead and press okay we get a system summary now I can see

14
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.160
here that I've got a processor.

15
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.090
This is the CPO of the system minds a seventy seven hundred K so I know that I've got four cores and

16
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.840
eight logical processes or eight threads and we'll see as we use cycle therapy eight little squares

17
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.500
that appear which is where and why I have eight of them.

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.080
If you've got a slightly different system you might have to cause forth red you might have four cores

19
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.120
for threads it doesn't matter but basically the more cause you have the faster cycles will be.

20
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.050
Now let's have a look at our components and go to display now in this particular section.

21
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.020
I have two graphics cards listed.

22
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.820
I have an end video G4 city X 10 80.

23
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.780
Now you may see and the radio on our 7 or Vegas 64 or something else in that list.

24
00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.230
And further down we also see that I've got my built in graphics as well these HD graphics 630.

25
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.790
Now one thing I will say is that if you've got this dedicated graphics card here it doesn't necessarily

26
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.090
mean it's going to be faster than your CPSU.

27
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.190
That's a pitfall.

28
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.660
Sometimes does occur.

29
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.340
You may have a really good CPO and a very basic graphics card which means that cycles will actually

30
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.670
be faster just using your CPA but let's dive into blender now and have a look at how this is all manifested.

31
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.850
So if we go to edit and user preferences or just preferences now and go to the system tab when we're

32
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.090
in the system tab we've got a couple of options along the top CUDA which you can see here under cycles

33
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:50.800
render devices CUDA is end Vidya only open S.L. Is an d and I have seen some Intel chips appearing on

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.940
that list as well.

35
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.650
So this is what you'd need to select if you have AMG and you want to use that graphics card to help

36
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.870
accelerate your rendering.

37
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:06.080
I am using CUDA and we can see here actually lists my processor and the dedicated graphics card itself.

38
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.950
Now B cos it's also driving my display my screen in front of me.

39
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.960
What that can mean is when you're rendering with cycles the system can lock up and become unresponsive

40
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.740
or very jerky and slow because it's busy rendering your render rather than displaying images on the

41
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.810
screen.

42
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.430
Now what you can do with Blender is you can stack multiple GP use if you're fortunate enough to have

43
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.310
multiple GP use.

44
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.470
You can put them all inside your machine and tick them all.

45
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.380
I'm not in that position so I've just got the one and because I use most of my screen recording software

46
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.770
uses software based encoding I'm not going to put a tick in this box because what you can do is pair

47
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.270
up your dedicated graphics card and the CPE you together to hopefully accelerate.

48
00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.470
Now there is one caveat with this and that is that my g text Haiti is very fast my eye seven seventy

49
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.460
seven hundred K is also very fast but it won't be as fast as just the G text ten eighty so if I wasn't

50
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.590
recording this video right now even though I've got the option of rendering where both of them for me

51
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.490
this would be unbalanced the GTA X tonight you would be waiting too long to render with the process

52
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.630
are also helping us out however towards the end of this section we're going to be rendering out an animation

53
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.420
and there's a couple of tips and tricks that we can use where we do utilise both of these but with different

54
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.130
instances of blender but we need to jump through a couple of hoops to make sure that's all set up and

55
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.750
working and it's not just on the same machine it can be on multiple machines as well so that's another

56
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.780
way of rendering out things really quickly.

57
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.660
Of course if you don't want to use this we can just click none and if you click none you may think Well

58
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.760
how's it going to render if I select none.

59
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.460
Well it still will be able to it'll just use the CPA.

60
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.810
Now you may find that makes blender more stable doing it that way.

61
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.370
And certainly some of the more experimental features which we may play with later on you may have to

62
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.900
use the CPE you to render and not the GP use.

63
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.660
One final thing I want to quickly go over the difference between CUDA and open S.L. when you go ahead

64
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.510
and render something we've CUDA all of the special stuff that CUDA uses is already compiled and ready

65
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.090
to go.

66
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.010
So you will often see the more complex scenes that my scene starts rendering quite quickly with open

67
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.510
S.L..

68
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.420
It has to compile all of these special bits and bobs before it starts rendering.

69
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.270
So if you add something to your material it will have to add it and compiler and then it will start

70
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.930
rendering.

71
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.620
So that initial render with open S.L. can be a lot slower than the initial render with CUDA because

72
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.120
it's already there and ready to go.

73
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.150
So I'm going to leave mindset as cuda.

74
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.990
Now one of the things that has changed is the blender preferences now.

75
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.180
Auto saves which is something to bear in mind because before you've had to explicitly say yes I want

76
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.940
these settings saved and you can see under the hamburger in the lower left that we've got some options

77
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.320
here including loading the factory settings or saving the current state.

78
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.210
I'm going to leave auto save preferences turned on but one of the things I'm also going to do whilst

79
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.310
I'm here an assistant tab I believe I've already set this once but obviously during the changes that

80
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.730
blender 2.8 happened or perhaps I did it on my other computer I can't remember but the undo steps 32

81
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.110
No no no.

82
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.310
I've got lots of memory on my machine so I'm going to crank 4 up as high as it will go.

83
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.000
I much prefer being able to undo something if I've made a mistake and 32 different undo steps.

84
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.200
That's not a lot of undoing and I don't need to save that.

85
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.550
Now one thing at the very bottom here there is this little up arrow if you do click that it brings the

86
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.630
header up and here the hamburger goes to the other side but also it gives you the option.

87
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.820
As with everything in blender of changing this particular type of window so you can bear that in mind

88
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.140
whenever you're trying to edit the user preferences you don't even have to go all the way up to edit

89
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.290
user preferences.

90
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.940
I could have gone to the edit to type dropdown and just selected preferences straight.

91
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.630
Boom.

92
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.130
There we go straight in.

93
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.390
Not entirely useful for what we want to do in the header at this point has gone to the top of the window

94
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.480
rather than being at the bottom unless switches back to the 3D viewport.

95
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.210
Brilliant.

96
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.740
So how do we use cycles once we're in blender.

97
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.140
Well we click on the little camera icon on the properties panel and change our render engine from eevee

98
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.950
to cycles.

99
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.000
Now in general I'm going to switch over to cycles when I'm checking out lighting but continue to work

100
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.210
in evey just so the display updates nice and quickly for us.

101
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.370
However as we get further through the section I'm going to spend more and more time in cycles.

102
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.990
So what I'd like to do over the next couple of lectures is go through the difference in lighting reflections

103
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:06.370
and also talking about optimizing cycles rendering times because they are pretty well known for taking

104
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.960
a long time.

105
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.400
So that's it for this lecture we've got everything set up for a dedicated graphics card.

106
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.740
We've got cycles selected as the default rendering engine for the moment and of course that just applies

107
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.350
to the scene we're currently in.

108
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.260
Now if I wanted that to apply to every new scene that we've got I can go to file defaults and save the

109
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.250
start up file so then cycles is the default.

110
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.120
I'm not going to do that in this case what I am going to do however is open up I'm going to discard

111
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.660
changes nothing that I want I'm going to open up my am animated lamp and make sure that I've got that

112
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:46.120
switched over to cycles I'm going to test to make sure it works and you can see here it's a lot grainy.

113
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.850
But it does settle out and we can see here this is coming along really nicely and we've got shadows

114
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.840
straight in.

115
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.830
You don't get this with eevee if we switch over to eevee.

116
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.780
The shadows are there but we've had to tweak and set up and this this border at the bottom how to turn

117
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.170
off the overlay is at the very top here.

118
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.720
Toggle that off and I'm also going to hide that drawing that we've got the Scene Sketch from earlier

119
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:17.290
and we can see here there's this well should be a darkened rim around the base of this lamp but it's

120
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.090
not there.

121
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.500
However when we turn on cycles we don't need to worry about that it's naturally got the right shadow

122
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.550
where it needs to be.

123
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:31.240
So this is one of the great things shadows as we've already discussed are much more accurate in cycles

124
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.340
than they are in evey.

125
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.880
And that theme will continue over in the next lecture.
