00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,220
Okay everybody before we get cracking with this lecture what I'd like you to do is grab a couple of

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,730
textures.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,780
Now one of the places that I will recommend is textures dot com.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,320
Now you will have to sign up for an account on here and it will give you permission to use those textures.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,790
And what I'd like you to do before we start this lecture is go ahead and go find something that looks

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,280
cool to you.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,920
Now I'm gonna go ahead and just show you a couple of textures so you get the hang of what's going on.

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,410
Not difficult at all.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,880
I'm gonna be working with tiles so let's just find a tiles example.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,430
I can't see one on the home screen hits probably under floors but I'm just going to go up to the search

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,090
box at the top right here.

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,500
No I don't endorse textures dot com at all I'm got no affiliation with them.

13
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,910
It's just a particular site that I found very useful.

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,870
I've typed in tiles that scroll down.

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,450
These are all HD RS that we've talked about in fact.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,040
And then we scroll down a little further.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,480
Okay that's interesting.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,700
Did I actually type in tiles or oh I types and texture I am super silly.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,860
I do apologize.

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,170
Okay.

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,340
If we search for tiles look at is fantastic.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,450
So we have here a series of tiles that we could pick from.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,940
This one's quite shiny.

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,030
This one's got a bump on it.

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,680
This one's all breaking this one's broken.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,540
That's a very interesting one.

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:37,550
Now these are all high resolution as you can see here and you don't get the full super duper resolution

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,560
as part of a free setup.

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,610
All of this if you want super high high definition you're going to have to pay for.

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,070
That's just how it is when it comes to textures.

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,130
Someone has to take the time to make these things and they're really good so I'm just going to pick

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,690
one now I'm just scrolling down so you can see what's going on.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,900
And I picked this one here every scroll down a lot further you'll get to your standard textures that

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,590
are much more flat and not represented in this ball fashion.

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,160
Here we go.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,240
These ones here.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,020
The difference here is these are substance designer materials already set up perfectly.

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,750
If you wanted them and these are just your standard images.

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,180
However when you select any of these you will often find that though this one here just comes with the

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,260
diffuse what we want to make sure let's go up to these balls here.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,200
Just select any one Oh I like that circle and so I'm going to go back that circle on there with the

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
impulse so to get the actual substance material that is not something that comes free.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,640
But what is down here is the flat maps and this is a one with one two three four five different maps

44
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,810
so you can only usually get up to 1024 by 2024.

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,030
For this example you don't need to take up a lot of space on your computer by all means if you want

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,140
the higher resolution one go for it and you don't have to use textures dot com.

47
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,440
You can go elsewhere to get textures or use some of the textures provided as part of this course.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,380
And I will make sure that there's a link against this lecture where you can go and grab those textures

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,280
there are free packed by picks are not super duper high resolution but they will get the job done but

50
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,520
you simply click that will download that to your computer and you can use it straightaway over in Blender.

51
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,000
OK.

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,800
So now you know just one resource where you can get textures from there are plenty of others out there

53
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,880
as well.

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:39,670
All you have to do is use your favorite search engine and search for free textures and off you go.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,350
You're bound to find something that suits what you want to do.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,300
I would always encourage you not just to download exactly what I've got but experiment and have a look

57
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,790
at different textures there's plenty out there.

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,860
If you find a great one share it over in the discussion so others can use it as well.

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,920
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all over in the next one.
