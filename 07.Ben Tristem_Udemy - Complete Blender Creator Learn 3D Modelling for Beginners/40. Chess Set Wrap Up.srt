Hello everybody and congratulations for completing the chess set section.
1

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,350
Now we've completed basic polygon modelling here you can pretty much make anything your mind comes to
2

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,680
in a low poly sense.
3

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,540
At this point we've also not only applied materials but textured materials both using procedural and
4

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,360
a photo or an image texture and applied it to our model.
5

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,840
There's much much more to learn about texturing and we'll cover that in the game asset section coming

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,250
up later in the course.

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,360
Now if you haven't shared your work already, Please do I'd love to see how you're getting on and if you're
8

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,330
one of the few out there that do have a 3D printer and you printed out your chess set.
9

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,460
I'm really looking forward to seeing those models so please do share them over in the discussions as
10

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,150
well.
11

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,490
Now it's time to hop on over into a blender and carry on this course and go straight over to section
12

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:51,980
