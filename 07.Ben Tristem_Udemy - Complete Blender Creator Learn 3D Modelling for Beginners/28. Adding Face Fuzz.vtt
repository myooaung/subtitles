00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.130
Welcome again in this lecture.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.060
We're going to be working on the face and ears of our animal.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.870
Let's get started.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.530
Animal facial hair generally tends to go away from the mouth, away from the nose, because you imagine

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.210
if they're running down the road chasing some sort of prey, then you want to make sure that your hair

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.830
is not going against the grain.

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.700
You want to make sure that their hair is nicely flowing backwards from the wind.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.380
So I'm going to start off with a challenge for you, which is to give you animal some face fur, some

9
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.130
face fuzz.

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.180
And first of all, create a new vertex group for the face and for the ears.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.940
You might want to do the ears separately.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.590
I've decided to do my ears, my animal, the same as the face, but they're a little bit different.

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.740
The length of the hair is often not the same.

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.050
So you might want to do them separately.

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.160
And as you're doing your weight painting, make sure you carve out some notches for the eyes so that

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.180
you don't have hair growing right through the eyeballs and put eyeballs in later on.

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
And then to groom it and tweak it as you see fit.

18
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.800
So there's your challenge jumping.

19
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.540
Take that on RC Mackie when you're done.

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.330
Okay, step one, let's create a new particle system, so clicking over.

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.110
Plus and I will change it to here straight away decrease the size Tallassee point three, just as a

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.680
starting point, should probably rename this to be face.

23
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.070
Hey, we also need to create ourselves a new vertex group.

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.770
Click on Plus, I'll call this face hair.

25
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.020
Now back to my particle system.

26
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.110
And for the particle system we're working with.

27
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.620
Scroll down.

28
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.220
Scroll down.

29
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.180
We want to find.

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.950
Down, down, down, down, down.

31
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.250
Vertex groups click on density changes to face hair.

32
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.730
It'll probably all disappear, which is fine, saying that you don't have any at all.

33
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.900
Now scroll back up, up, up.

34
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.060
I'm up again and find my original particle sitting, so I'm just gonna rename this in here as well.

35
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.910
So it's very clear this was the body hair.

36
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.290
And the next one along was the face hair, just so it's clear.

37
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.780
So the top one body hair.

38
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.280
I'm going to turn this off.

39
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.180
So it's off in the viewport.

40
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.580
And also when I render it so I can do some renders of the face here, as I go more quickly, click on

41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.820
the face hair, jump over to object mode, find out where all white paint.

42
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.980
Make sure that I'm clicked on brush.

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.120
Increased the weight all the way up to one.

44
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.810
And just paint in the area that we're going to want the hair to appear.

45
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.110
Okay.

46
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.270
I haven't turned off this one.

47
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.580
I'm going to turn off my current particle system as well as over on the right there.

48
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.970
Click the little television that says, I don't wish to see you at the moment.

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.230
I just want to see where I'm painting my whites.

50
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.430
So let's go ahead and paint our whites.

51
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.840
Now, as soon back on our particle system so we can view it.

52
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.560
That's good.

53
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.260
I'm going to turn the number down to say for 200 at this point, you need a reasonable amount of depth

54
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.540
to it so that it's following all the contours and the interpretation of our children when we're doing

55
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.440
our interpolated.

56
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.810
It doesn't have to do too much interpretation.

57
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.920
Is that the right length?

58
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.270
I think that's going to be way too long.

59
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.310
So at this point, I will decrease the length probably down to about point to make sure we've got enough

60
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.760
segments.

61
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.170
Five year.

62
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.840
That's pretty good.

63
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.500
Okay.

64
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.020
And now we will go at our children interpolated.

65
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.020
I will put in probably 60 for mine.

66
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.030
Again, if your computer is really not enjoying having so many, then scale accordingly.

67
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.630
Okay.

68
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.620
Looking pretty spiffy.

69
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.180
I'm going to do some initial grooming.

70
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.340
Just a quick groom particle edit.

71
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.770
I'm going to select on the middle option here, which is the point mode is push everything to the side,

72
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.770
to the side side backwards as if we're running through a wind tunnel, wind tunnel, wind tunnel.

73
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.890
This instance on have it reasonably glued to the head with a little bit of puffery going on.

74
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.420
Sorry about the years just yet.

75
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.380
We will get to those when we get to those just looking at the face details and then to the tip so that

76
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.070
I can get a little bit more precision on the final direction of these things.

77
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.520
Catch some stragglers like that that are hanging around fairly decent.

78
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.990
I'm not going to worry about having it perfect on the face the face to get it looking really nice.

79
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.410
You need to have it fairly chunky and take a lot of time to groom it.

80
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.860
But I want to go a little bit quicker on this because I think by now you get the picture of what we're

81
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.110
doing here and you know how to groom these things.

82
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.200
But I will put a little bit more love into the front of the face here by adding how fine interpolate.

83
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.050
Yes, count one.

84
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.290
Good.

85
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.580
So just over to the side so I can be pushing them to the left.

86
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.200
These ones here, the left, these ones here up, probably might want to cut this one out from the nose.

87
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.610
I don't like them when they're sticking right on those areas that I don't think they should stick on.

88
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.470
Next thing I do is I didn't do this a moment ago.

89
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.980
But white paint, I'm going to dig out the eyeballs, so put my weight all the way down to zero and

90
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.440
carve a notch where I think the eyes will go.

91
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.100
It's okay if I go a little bit further on this.

92
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.490
I just want to make sure there's no hair right in the middle of it.

93
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.140
Okay, back to object mode to a test render at this point.

94
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.910
Okay.

95
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.810
Looking okay.

96
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.100
And one thing we've forgotten to do.

97
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.920
I've forgotten to do you and forgotten to do it is to change the material under render.

98
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.370
Change the material from body material to body hair.

99
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.730
I guess that should've just been called hair, not body hair.

100
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.560
Now do a test run to see how that looks.

101
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.880
Okay.

102
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.780
Very golden.

103
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.160
But it's in the right ballpark, some little bit of yuckiness around the eye there.

104
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.070
We still need to do these years.

105
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.650
Let's go and groom those now.

106
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.310
So back into particle edit going to trim the length of these a little bit.

107
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.240
So click on length.

108
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.410
Hold down shift.

109
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.810
Same over the other side.

110
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820
I find you don't need to have them too, too small in length.

111
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.390
So long as they're brushed in the right direction it still looks okay.

112
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.030
But I will go and give a bit of an ear hair trim on the inside of the ears.

113
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.460
That's a you know, if you're getting old, if you have to trim your ear hairs.

114
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.380
Thankfully, I'm not at that stage just yet.

115
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.680
I did have a hairdresser a number of years ago.

116
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.530
When I'm starting to get, you know, still thought I wasn't that old.

117
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.660
They said, would you like me to trim your eyebrow hair?

118
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.130
I thought, well, that's very odd.

119
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.810
Is that a thing?

120
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.510
But that was a sign that I was getting old and maybe it was time for me to not go to hairdressers anymore.

121
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.090
If they're going to say such crazy things.

122
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.230
Okay, let's have a look at these.

123
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.800
Is.

124
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.510
Yeah, looking pretty messy, scraggly.

125
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.860
Not exactly what I want.

126
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.190
What I will do is jump in a particle, edit and go and add.

127
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.830
I'll turn off interpolate and as I add, I'll add some hairs right on the edge here.

128
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.240
Ristic straight out.

129
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.010
That'll give me a little bit more control over these scraggly edges that aren't looking as nice as they

130
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.610
used to look.

131
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.420
OK.

132
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.860
Done on them quite so long.

133
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.930
So with interpolate off, it's going to follow the face that we're putting it onto.

134
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.300
Let's jump into.

135
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.570
I'm just going to cut these actually.

136
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.650
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

137
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.880
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

138
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.450
We'll see how that looks without doing any grooming it.

139
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.110
Okay.

140
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.090
Love it too long.

141
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.610
SEAL the cat in my picture here.

142
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.710
There's some of these hairs that do protrude forward on the ears.

143
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.890
So we don't need to have it groomed perfectly on these guys.

144
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.020
But I do need to trim them a little bit further.

145
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.800
Let's go.

146
00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.980
Let's go.

147
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.320
Half of that size.

148
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.610
Just to give a bit of fuzz is what I'm going for here.

149
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.420
And I'm gonna be a little bit shaky as well, because I know my camera is gonna be down here.

150
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.200
I'm not going to worry about what's happening just over there, for example, but feel as if you've

151
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.370
got a different camera angle.

152
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.320
Well, you looking to do a pan around, rotate around, then you might want to make sure that each angle

153
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.100
is looking good.

154
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.830
Okay.

155
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.190
This hair here is creating all sorts of havoc.

156
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.450
You've probably discovered by now that just one lone hair can really mess things up.

157
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.940
When we're in in light with our children, all YoY.

158
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.550
There we go.

159
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.460
I think that's going to clean up this whole area.

160
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.350
I'll quickly do the other side now.

161
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.210
OK?

162
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.720
Not too bad.

163
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.350
I want to reduce the length on some of these hairs at the front.

164
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.220
Right now, turn both both particle systems back on to a test render.

165
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.220
It's far from perfect, my friend.

166
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.560
And that's okay.

167
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.730
I might come back and do a little bit of more finessing, find more of these bold patches and fix them

168
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.930
up, you know, fill them in.

169
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.260
But for now, I want to keep moving on and work on the whiskers.

170
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.390
So that's what we'll do next in the next video will add some whiskers to our animal.

171
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.000
If our animals have whiskers.

172
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.060
That is okay.

173
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.540
Great stuff.

174
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.830
I'll see you in the next lecture.
