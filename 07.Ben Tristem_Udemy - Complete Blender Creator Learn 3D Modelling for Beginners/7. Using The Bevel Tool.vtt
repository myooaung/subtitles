Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to have a look at the bevel tool, a bevel 
1

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.770
tool is very useful for the sharp edges here rounding them out.
2

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.320
And also in general on objects sharp edges like this generally don't exist.
3

4
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.140
Everything's got a slight bevel to it.
4

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.810
Whether it's a box or a desk or anything else that's hard surface.
5

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
Very few of them have this complete sharp edge to them.
6

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.490
Of course that may be a stylistic decision that you're going for but if not the bevel tool might be
7

8
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.080
something you want to use.
8

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.040
Let's find out some more.
9

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.510
Okay everybody welcome back.
10

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.400
Now this is where we left off last time so the first thing we need to do is actually get this shape
11

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.720
this cylinder here more representative of the pawn itself.
12

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
We're just focused on the base at the moment and we'll worry about the rest of the pawn once we have
13

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.580
finished off the base.
14

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.000
The first thing that you will notice is that even though we can set let's come out of edit mode for
15

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.250
a moment this image of the back underneath the object properties we can scroll down and under the viewport
16

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.610
display we can scroll down a little more and we can put a tick in the in front.
17

18
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.510
Now at the moment that doesn't actually shift in front unless you're in solid shading mode and then
18

19
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.010
it does move in front of everything else.
19

20
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.540
But if we are in any of the other views we cannot see through the model if that is the case then we
20

21
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.960
can go about it another way instead of making this particular piece stand out in front.
21

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.810
So I'm just gonna turn off for the moment.
22

23
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.540
We can select our other objects and whilst the object properties go to where it says display ads at
23

24
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.530
the moment it's set to textured.
24

25
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.560
We could also said it's a solid, wire or bounce.
25

26
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.050
In this case the set it as wire and that will essentially allow us to turn that one object into wireframe
26

27
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.070
and see through it.
27

28
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.710
Now in the next couple of lectures we'll get to exploring some other construction methods as well.
28

29
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.060
But this is one way of seeing through your model so you can construct it using an image behind.
29

30
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.880
So now it's in this wireframe mode but the rest of our scene is not in wireframe mode.
30

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.580
We go into our object making sure we're in edit mode and with the shortcut key control and R we can
31

32
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.890
start adding in some loop cuts.
32

33
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.070
Now I'm going to add in these loop cuts at points where I want it to be the widest and where it comes
33

34
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.850
in again.
34

35
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.480
So I'm just going to manually add them in.
35

36
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.430
So we want that narrow they're wide here and there's a little lip just here so that's how many I'm going
36

37
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.210
to add for the moment.
37

38
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.880
I don't want to go over the top.
38

39
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.110
There are other construction methods where you can add more geometry and control it much better.
39

40
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.770
And the bevel tool is one of those ones.
40

41
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.890
So let's go ahead.
41

42
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.700
Whilst in Edge select mode I'm going to hold down ALT and select this top edge and I'm simply going
42

43
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.470
to scale it down to approximately the right size.
43

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.940
It doesn't have to be exact.
44

45
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.570
We're not working 2 engineering measurements here and this one somewhere around there.
45

46
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.530
And then I leave this one just a little bit in but not too much but I'm going to grab this one and scale
46

47
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.910
it all the way in and I'm going to leave that other one.
47

48
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.090
So we've got this jagged shape here.
48

49
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.440
Then I can change the display back to solid or textured in this case.
49

50
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.700
And there we go we've got a rough outline that matches what we had before in fact in this case I'm going
50

51
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.700
to scale this in just a little bit more so we get more of a change in direction.
51

52
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.370
OK.
52

53
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.520
So now we have our base model what we can do is use the bevel tool.
53

54
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.040
Now the bevel tool is available on the tool shelf.
54

55
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.720
Now sometimes these tools shelf options behave slightly different to the shortcut key.
55

56
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.740
I think that's a bug at the moment.
56

57
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.770
But with here we can see the control and B will be the shortcut key for it when we hover over on the
57

58
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.190
tool shelf and what the bevel tool will enable us to do is select an individual edge or edges and add
58

59
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.410
additional geometry to smooth out transitions.
59

60
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.590
Now the tool shelf does behave slightly differently in this case.
60

61
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.960
So if I just press control and B we can start bevelling everything at once and that's my preferred way
61

62
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.840
of using the bevel tool and we can use the scroll wheel at this point to add additional geometry as you
62

63
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.700
can see there we can add quite a bit.
63

64
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.820
Now I encourage you not to go over the top whenever you do a bevel like this.
64

65
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.370
In fact this isn't a great place to give an example this edge here perhaps is.
65

66
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.930
So if I bevel around that we can see that I can bevel out there and then I can use the scroll wheel to
66

67
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.660
add additional geometry in its place.
67

68
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.530
It does shrink the geometry a little bit.
68

69
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.860
Now we have a nice smooth curve going round and in  the operator panel will give us further options
69

70
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.820
so we can make it more pointed and even going in the other way if we wanted to.
70

71
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.960
So there's lots of options adjusting here.
71

72
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.680
Now we've already played with vertex bevelling and that will give us a completely different shape.
72

73
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.970
So we're not doing that at this point and there are different varieties that you could do.
73

74
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.490
I'm going to leave the profile at point five so it produces a nice rounded surface.
74

75
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.560
Now the tool shelf itself does act a little bit differently so if I was to go ahead with the tool shelf
75

76
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.450
and click when you've got things highlighted you have to then click and drag to get the appropriate
76

77
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.370
effect.
77

78
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.700
Now that is pretty cool but that's not what I desired.
78

79
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.470
So let's just undo that for the moment.
79

80
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.420
So with this I'm going out with background to orthographic projection by pressing the number three
80

81
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.390
when we click on that we can individually select edges as well.
81

82
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.140
And when we do that we then click and drag to do the bevel.
82

83
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.090
So this could produce some nice shapes going round our model if this is what you choose to make.
83

84
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.960
That's pretty cool I like how that's working out.
84

85
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.700
Let's undo that for a second and have another look.
85

86
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.970
So how would you use the bevel tool button on the tool shelf and do what I did earlier.
86

87
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.670
Well you'd simply hold down out first then click everything then click and drag and you'll have those
87

88
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.910
other options.
88

89
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.380
Now you do not after you've done that have the options to add in additional segments you will have to
89

90
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.850
open up the bevel and add those segments in afterwards.
90

91
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.090
This is why I personally prefer the keyboard shortcuts.
91

92
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.490
It's a much faster workflow and you will find that the loop cuts tool over on the side is also very
92

93
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.290
similar.
93

94
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.020
I've had a couple of you point that out in the Q and A's.
94

95
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.810
Okay.
95

96
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.480
So another thing that you can do here and it's going to undo those changes and whizz round.
96

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.010
Now you may notice we've got a bit of a clipping issue.
97

98
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.220
We'll deal with that in the next lecture.
98

99
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.860
But for now I'm just gonna whizz round to orthographic or it doesn't matter the zoom level and what
99

100
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:51.440
we can do here is select multiple edges or edge loops at once and apply a bevel modifier to all of them.
100

101
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.080
Now the downside of this is you cannot control individually how many segments are going to be made in
101

102
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.040
this case it's going to be three two one.
102

103
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.820
So you don't have as fine a control as you do when you selecting them individually and now it's time
103

104
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.320
for your challenge.
104

105
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.810
Okay see your challenge I'd like you to go ahead and finish off the base.
105

106
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.890
Now using the bevel tool you can use that to round off our sharp edges and just make them a little bit
106

107
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.260
more smooth finish off adding the fine detail to the base itself.
107

108
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.180
Now don't go over the top.
108

109
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.640
I'll give you a little hint in a few lectures time.
109

110
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.760
We're going to undo some of those steps to learn some new techniques.
110

111
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.880
But at the moment finish off adding detail to the base.
111

112
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.290
Use your artistic license have a bit of fun and see what other shapes you can come up with.
112

113
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.660
When it comes to this base we're going to explore some other construction methods as well so feel free
113

114
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.690
so run riot and actually make something quite unique.
114

115
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.750
And remember to save your work as you go.
115

116
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.000
Whether or not it's in beta at the moment blender can still crash whenever you're working on it.
116

117
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.120
I always recommend to save your file.
117

118
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:09.600
The other thing to bear in mind is that auto save if it is working on blender at the time seems to only
118

119
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.220
save when you are in object mode.
119

120
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.790
If you are doing something in edit mode and it crashes during that you will probably lose all of the
120

121
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.540
stuff you had been doing whilst in edit mode so remember to save often pause video now and give it a
121

122
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.810
go.
122

123
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.860
Okay everybody, Welcome back.
123

124
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.860
Let's go head now and finish off the base.
124

125
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.760
Hello everybody.
125

126
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.950
Okay so the first thing I want to do here is a few bits of adjustment with our geometry.
126

127
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:45.100
I'm going to take this loop here and approach G twice and move it down slightly and we can.
127

128
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.580
Oh I do want it a little bit higher at the same time.
128

129
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.620
I think I just need to move the geometry around a little perhaps move this bit up before I move this
129

130
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:02.910
bit's up and make that's a little bit wider and I'll show you why I'm making that extra wide in a moment.
130

131
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.540
And you've probably experienced that yourself as you've been playing around.
131

132
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:12.210
The other thing I want to do here is this comes out and there's no way I can do it unless I put a loop
132

133
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.920
cut in there and actually scale it out again so it goes up and out and round.
133

134
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.090
Okay so the first thing I need to think of is where do I want my bevel to be.
134

135
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.300
Well do we need any around here.
135

136
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:31.530
Well I can probably add a little at this top point to smooth out that transition so if i just go control
136

137
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.510
and B an add in some extra geometry do I want that much geometry.
137

138
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.630
I think two segments smooths out nicely actually.
138

139
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.910
Then we've got this area here.
139

140
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.190
So the question then is do we need anything now or is it okay with that angle change.
140

141
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.220
And I'm gonna keep that angle change in this case.
141

142
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.380
This one here is an interesting one and the reason why I've made it wider is is you probably noticed
142

143
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.950
by now when you use the bevel tool it shrinks things in.
143

144
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.320
So we do have to be careful.
144

145
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:09.120
We can only go so far and there we go we can move in then I think two is still too sharp three is getting
145

146
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.970
there and four is spot on.
146

147
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.910
Okay now we get this bit here where it comes in and this is what I was concerned about as we come down
147

148
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.310
and round we've reached this sharp area.
148

149
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.410
I can't really do much with because there's all this extra geometry here.
149

150
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:30.120
Some of the press the G key twice and move that down a little bit more and then scale it in and then
150

151
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.340
move it down a little bit more until it's about half way I'm probably going to have to do a similar
151

152
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.120
thing with this.
152

153
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.880
I'm going to bring that down as well.
153

154
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.710
Now there is really only enough space here.
154

155
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.790
That's too much geometry although it looks nice for about another two.
155

156
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:51.280
And these last two here they are say the last two because I'm thinking of this bottom bit as well.
156

157
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.400
This piece otherwise will sit.
157

158
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.900
Dead center on the floor and they have this incredibly sharp bottom to it.
158

159
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.170
And that does that as I was saying earlier really doesn't happen in real life.
159

160
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:11.170
So let's go ahead and add some bevels in there and we end up with this piece that's come out.
160

161
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.190
I'm starting to like how that looks.
161

162
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.020
It's got enough geometry in there that it looks nice and smooth.
162

163
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:24.610
Speaking of smooth it whilst I'm in object mode if I go ahead and right click and shade smooth that
163

164
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.690
looks a lot lot better straight away so that zoom out and have a look.
164

165
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.670
Excellent.
165

166
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.800
So this is what I've ended up by playing with the bevel.
166

167
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.140
I'm really interested to see what shapes you came up with.
167

168
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.420
Did you play like I suggested.
168

169
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.370
If he did come up with something funky.
169

170
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.140
Remember you don't have to proceed with it but it may be worthwhile to share to see what you came up
170

171
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.950
with.
171

172
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:50.100
I've often ended up making something really cool when it was just a happy accident.
172

173
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.030
So there we go.
173

174
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.460
That's me done.
174

175
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.470
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
