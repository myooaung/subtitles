00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.660
Welcome to force fields and other objects.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.850
So they act slightly differently when force fields are applied to different objects themselves.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.040
Now they are aware of exerting different forces onto our models just like they have always been with

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.650
particles now as well as particles.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.690
They will affect soft bodies rigid bodies and cloth objects as well.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.510
So it's worthwhile bearing in mind you can use them with several of the physics models.

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.460
Now there is a shift in set up compared with particles.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.460
And the reason for that you will see in a moment um hope it's going to be buggy so you can see why we

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.250
need to set it up slightly differently and then we'll have a look at how to make an object completely

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.710
unaffected by certain forces.

11
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.790
Now this can be important if you want part of your scene to stay put.

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.320
Was making the other part of it explode dramatically perhaps in a real heroes or a realistic physics

13
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.430
cingulate and the whole lot would get obliterated.

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.320
But you might not want that to happen for more artistic effects or more had choreographed effects shall

15
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.910
we say.

16
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.630
So let's go play it with force fields and other objects in this case were play with rigid bodies over

17
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.640
in blender.

18
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.920
Okay so welcome back to blender.

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.180
Now my default starting scene looks a bit different to how I set it up before I had a bit of a computer

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.170
wobbly.

21
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.710
I've sorted that out but unfortunately I've got my default scene back as this.

22
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.610
So there will be some things that I have to redo don't worry assist me resetting up my computer and

23
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.740
silly me I didn't back up the actual blend start file.

24
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.800
So I was left with that offer anyway.

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.600
So let's start by giving this cube in the physics properties a forcefield and a rigid body.

26
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.860
Now just like the particles it won't self affect.

27
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.770
So let's add another one into the scene some just going to duplicate that and pop it over here.

28
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.450
Now the forces needed to move objects is often a lot higher especially rigid bodies than particles so

29
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.000
whereas particles would be streaming everywhere of whoop play is not guaranteed in this case so just

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.150
to make sure if we do have any effect at all I'm going to set the strength of both of those force fields

31
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.420
to 100 and then we when we press play Oh we haven't turned off gravity yet.

32
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.380
No reason why are we turning off gravity as simply so we can see the effect of the force fields by themselves.

33
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.090
And under this set the end frame to 100 as well and did are.

34
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.520
And let's let it reset.

35
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.670
No they're not doing anything now.

36
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.360
I've had this trouble before you think they would affect one another but not themselves but with those

37
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120
settings they just don't.

38
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.170
Now I've turned forcefield of field on rigid body off rigid body on and occasionally they actually react

39
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.930
and start B.

40
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.530
What I say behaving themselves as we'd expect them to.

41
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.870
But of course each time you turn these things on and off you actually lose the settings you have before

42
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.520
so that's not ideal.

43
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.150
So this is where the set up change comes.

44
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.380
It will start to become important.

45
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.510
So what we need to do here is instead of actually attaching it directly to there is just like we did

46
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.030
with the particles we add a separate force field.

47
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.090
Sorry go ahead and add a force force field here.

48
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.110
We can already see it starting to push that cube away this one on the right.

49
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.010
So let's go ahead and just increase.

50
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.400
That's maybe 10 and we can see it pushing away and obviously if we set it to minus 10 it will pull it

51
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.540
towards it.

52
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.230
Now once we've started it moving like this we should see them bump into one another.

53
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.340
Oh no we have not got enough frames.

54
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.930
So there's two ways of dealing with that.

55
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.010
And I'm just going to increase the force.

56
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.550
Now they're knocking to one another and then be pulled back.

57
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.400
Did you see that they started to slow down and that's because the force itself is not parenting to the

58
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.210
other cube.

59
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.620
Says the other Q moves the force itself does not.

60
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.860
So we can link those two together imperent them if we wanted to.

61
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.810
Now one of the things you may want to do is let's say let's duplicate another cube just over here and

62
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.290
they all get pulled in.

63
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.850
Now say we wanted this new cube to not get affected by the physics will simply we could turn the physics

64
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.310
off.

65
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.090
However if we still wanted other things to bump into it would still need collision or even perhaps a

66
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.090
rigid body.

67
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.480
But what we want in this case is it not to be affected by this particular force field.

68
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.860
As a couple of ways of doing that.

69
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.400
Number one we can literally move that to another layer that the force feels not on and then it will

70
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.650
not be affected by that force field as we can see here.

71
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.440
That is one way of doing it and then when we bring the two together because they're on separate layers

72
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.370
one will not affect the other.

73
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.810
Let's just reset the simulation and we can see moving things about cause it to go just a little wobbly

74
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.030
but it's unaffected and that's the easiest way to do it to put things on layers that affect one another

75
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.740
and not on others.

76
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.780
Now if you wanted it if it was a particle system itself and we can see this is now emitting particles

77
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.310
you can scroll down there to field weights and well we can change all of the ones that we want to hear

78
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.100
so we can set gravity to have more or less effect on these particles.

79
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.090
The force.

80
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.660
This one over here to have more or less effect.

81
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.840
Of course what we've got at the moment is it on a different layer so it won't affect it all.

82
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.720
We popped it back onto layer 1.

83
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.310
You'd see these particles being attracted in.

84
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.900
There we go.

85
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.240
Once you turn the force up.

86
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.220
However if you make the force zero then they just get emitted and scattered.

87
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.630
Hey that looks like a comet.

88
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.020
How cool is that.

89
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.950
Okay so we're ready now to set you up for a little challenge.

90
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.840
Okay so your challenge is all about meche objects affecting each other.

91
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.050
So use a force field to make two or more meche objects affect one another.

92
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.630
Things to try.

93
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.440
Well we've got a wall that's already having a projectile hitting it.

94
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.370
How about setting up an explosion which happens when the projectile hits our wall.

95
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.650
And perhaps you want some of the bricks not to be forced out by the explosion.

96
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.120
That's something to think about.

97
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.210
Now something extra you can do.

98
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.460
And I found this quite funny and I show you a clip of it after I've completed my challenge is getting

99
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.380
objects to orbit one another.

100
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.270
That's great fun and prehaps you will find a use for it as well.

101
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.160
I certainly found it as I say a lot of fun anyway.

102
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.570
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go.

103
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.320
Okay guys welcome back.

104
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.660
Let's go have our wall exploding.

105
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.620
When the projectile actually hits the wall.

106
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.990
Okay so I've opened up my wall here and let's just recap on what's happening here.

107
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.540
Let's play the animation.

108
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.720
Oh the help of we had a time line as well so we can see what's going on.

109
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:07.870
Okay so what we can do here is step through and say its all 20 it's okay.

110
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.360
It's impacted.

111
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.530
They're actually in the wall at that point so I can set myself a forcefield coming on at frame to end

112
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.880
too.

113
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.650
So let's go back to frame 0 and I will need the force and that's very tempting.

114
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.590
I've done it in practice as adding the force field to this object.

115
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.940
It won't do anything as we've already discovered it totally ignore everything you've got going.

116
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.560
So we've got our projects let's go ahead and move the cursor to select it so we pop the cursor there

117
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.190
and I am going to do a bit of tidying up because this is driving me just a little bit bonkers that we've

118
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.590
got all of this mess.

119
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.650
So what should we do here.

120
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.470
Let's parents.

121
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.790
Well certainly that parent in the field to that cone and call the cone projectile.

122
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.430
Excellent.

123
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.840
And scroll down and I will.

124
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.110
Well we added the force.

125
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:12.690
No we haven't so let's add a force field force and parent it to the actual projectile.

126
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:19.340
Otherwise when the projectile moves our are actually forceful or not.

127
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.600
So that goes in and doesn't seem to do anything let's set a force of 100.

128
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.400
And that also doesn't seem to do anything.

129
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.590
So that's sort of five hundred.

130
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.570
We can see is pushing the wall over as it comes towards.

131
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:42.520
And what I'm hoping is for the Brits to go absolutely flying so let's do five five thousand.

132
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.290
There we go.

133
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.950
That's pretty impressive how Kate's now we got that.

134
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.160
So we've got an approximate force.

135
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.630
We actually want it to be zero at the very beginning have said it's a zero I'm going to press to key

136
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.980
it in an hour at this.

137
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:06.070
It's cached some information about there actually some set it frame it when it first starts nudging

138
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.070
and going to set again the strength at zero and by twenty five.

139
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:19.290
Unlost suddenly set the strength twenty six so yeah about there an MMA set the strength the five fouls

140
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.410
and an unknown to turn up the power to the power of two just so it fades away so it's not constantly

141
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.730
pushing things a way.

142
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:35.970
Okay so let's see how that looks when we play it back so it should go being oh you know I didn't do

143
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.710
I didn't actually key in that last thing so let's play it through.

144
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:45.510
Scott all if we don't play it through it starts ruining itself because things aren't cached So we got

145
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:51.680
zero here zero here and at 25 I won it five thousand.

146
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.960
And remember to quit this time there we go.

147
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.830
So it start from the beginning.

148
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.650
Boom.

149
00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:58.710
Okay.

150
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.480
Let's try.

151
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.630
Fifty thousand that did that didn't do any of this try on the right place 15 1 2 3.

152
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.340
I didn't have the effect I wanted it to go back and.

153
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.390
So the effect ramps up.

154
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.810
Oh only five thousand again.

155
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.610
Fifty.

156
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.920
And why not keep it in my kerson Must not have been over.

157
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.260
Pretty sure I did that.

158
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.070
Oh something weird goes on there.

159
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.910
Okay so the power was a bit too high.

160
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.130
That works but I'm going to have it ramp back down again.

161
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:49.670
So it's not an A not a continuous force just a sudden force back to zero almost straight after like

162
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.220
a real explosion because after you get the shock wave not continuous force.

163
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.510
Okay that works brilliant.

164
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:03.410
So the final thing here is just to keep some of the wall intact and make it basically on a different

165
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.740
layer.

166
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:11.180
And I'm just going to randomly select some bricks hopefully getting a bit bigger as we get to the bottom.

167
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.360
There we go.

168
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.660
And perhaps a set over here as well.

169
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.690
So that's a rough selection there need a couple more in there.

170
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.810
Very exciting me selecting bricks are there apologizing going to move and hot to layer all two or three

171
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.260
in this case because of accidentally moved them to three.

172
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.760
So let's turn on layers 1 and 3.

173
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.890
And now they shouldn't affect one another so that send in our projectile.

174
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:37.900
Boom.

175
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.660
But they are affected by just falling over.

176
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.460
They are affected by each other.

177
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.480
Excellent sort of gone explosive impact there.

178
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.570
Exactly what I wanted to see is that as the projectile comes through.

179
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.340
Perfect.

180
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.630
How did you guys get on.

181
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.310
Did you manage to destroy a wall.

182
00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.140
Did you have the same sort of issues I did with the strength you had to turn up and play with it.

183
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.400
It can be quite interesting trying and get the right settings and I'm happy with this.

184
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.630
And there was this final thing that I wanted to show you so I will show you this orbiting collision

185
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.350
that I set up.

186
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.880
It took quite a while to read because of all the physics involved but it was great fun setting up.

187
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:24.030
Okay so I I honestly I can't remember how many little balls there are in this scene but they've all

188
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.880
got their own little forcefield and they're all attracted to one another.

189
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:33.280
And of course when a big bunch of them get together well they attract more so than anything else.

190
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.530
So he have them orbiting together and eventually forming.

191
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.440
Well I don't know what you call it a planet perhaps with all these satellites going around it.

192
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.330
If I just speed up this process you will see that eventually you get a solid moon of three of these

193
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.680
little spheres orbiting as well.

194
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.750
That was great fun.

195
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.060
I enjoyed it anyway.

196
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:59.710
So I'd love to see what you guys have come up with remembered to share over on the forum and I will

197
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.430
see you guys in the next lecture.
