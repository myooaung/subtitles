1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,710
Welcome to texture resolution.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,990
So in this video you will understand that resolution will control the level of detail at a particular

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,300
distance.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,220
We'll go ahead to realize when a texture is ever going to be too large or too small.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,340
We're going to learn about the power of two and wine.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,430
And when it is important so let's go from the bottom up and start with the power of two.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,720
So bit of theory for you all here.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:39,490
Computers work with binaries zeros and ones a lot of external programs need power off two textures that

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,540
is important.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,440
Now they aren't necessary in blender but are a good standard to adhere to especially when working with

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,060
external programs and they don't have to be square providing the length of the side is a power of two.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,950
So I've been saying paratroop character in some of you will be scratching your head.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,850
Go Mike.

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,420
I kind of get these English words you've put up here but I don't understand what the power of two is.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:14,470
So which numbers are power of too severe Imagine a rectangle or a square and the length of four sides

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:14,860
there.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,900
So mathematically they'll be two to the power of N..

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,730
Or as shown there two to the 5 etc equals thirty two.

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:31,870
So if you've been around computers for a while you recognize this sequence 2 4 8 16 and so on and you'll

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,540
notice that's your RAM will fall into those hard drives tend to fall into those lots of different things

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,800
fall into these particular numbers.

22
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:48,550
And this is where we do the power of to see you can have two five six on one length off of side by a

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,280
thousand and 24 and another.

24
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,400
Or you can have a thousand and twenty four by a thousand and twenty four and it be square.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Each one of those is okay.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,200
Now it is important that you can't have it here to these standards especially if you want to export

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,800
your Textus But there is one critical thing to remember because it's very tempting to say on let's say

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,870
your diffuse smap.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,790
I don't need much detail here so I'll make it 32 by 32.

30
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:21,190
It just needs a slight gradient change that set across it and then you go ahead and use a normal map

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,140
let's say or a bump map displacement map to add more detail but you need that super fine detail so you

32
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,240
do to 0 4 8 by 2 4 8.

33
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,140
Now that is great but you're going to have a problem when you come to textures of different sizes.

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,780
First of all they need their own you v map that is important.

35
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,990
If you decide to have textures of different sizes within blender they're going to need their own e.v.

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,600
Map.

37
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,570
They're probably not going to be exportable even due to the need for multiple UV maps.

38
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,250
Most programs when you import them say you're exporting as an effort because they'll take the primary

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,720
the first you've Emap you've created and use that so the other textures.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,240
Obviously if they're a different size they won't match up with your you.

41
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,000
Unwrap it is best to stick to one texture size for any given unwrap.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,170
So if you've unwrapped one particular model and you're going to give that to a 4 8 by 2 4 8 that is

43
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,260
great and you can of course do another model that's not doesn't have to be as detailed and do it 5 hour

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,390
by 5 12.

45
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,820
You're going to have to play with these and it does.

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,740
There are several things to think about when you're dealing with textures of what size you're going

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,890
to require.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,890
I will go on sibor offer in a moment but the important thing to remember here is larger textures require

49
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,220
more memory.

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,880
If you had a texture that there is 256 pixels by 256 pixels and one that was 512 by 512 you may think

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,740
the difference there is two it's not.

52
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,940
It's quadrupled.

53
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,430
That's going to take up quadruple the amount of space as the two five six one is and so forth as we

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,300
go up that number change that we saw a moment ago.

55
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,590
Okay so what size textures and this is a very good question.

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,380
It's very tempting to just say you know what I'm going to use the largest size textures I can possibly

57
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,730
use.

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,390
Then nothing can go wrong.

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,110
Well as you'll learn and develop skills you'll find that you run out of memory very quickly.

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,030
If you decide to make the largest possible textures or blender will slow to a crawl or your game won't

61
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,660
work it won't be able to load into the graphics memory.

62
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,260
There's lots of different problems you can come to.

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,780
So there are two main components to how large a texture needs to be and they're quite logical when you

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,870
think about them.

65
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,530
So first of all how far away is the camera from the object.

66
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,460
Slash the texture that you were using.

67
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,210
Of course camera you can place that with character.

68
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,670
If you were in a game situation.

69
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,550
So if you're looking at a building that's across the street but you're never going to get any closer

70
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,470
to it there's going to be a finite amount of detail that you can actually resolve.

71
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,220
And so there would be no point for instance probably going to eight fouls and it depends on the size

72
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,040
of the objects as well so these two oscillate between one another.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,490
So we do need to be careful.

74
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,660
I was going to say it doesn't matter you shouldn't go for an 8 k texture.

75
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,270
Well actually you might need to if the object is really really big of course then you may split it up

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,680
into smaller objects itself.

77
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,930
But for instance kitchen tiles now they're a lot smaller but you get a lot closer to them.

78
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:41,390
So what we have decided to go for here is thinking about what's that retina texture level.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,760
Now we've all heard of Apple's retina displays where you can't see the pixels.

80
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,240
So we're going for a an utmost upper limits that your texture size would be and things beneath that

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,830
would be okay.

82
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,740
So the retina limit is really pushing it because that is when you can no longer see the pixels on your

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,520
texture.

84
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,130
In fact after that point you just wasting memory.

85
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,150
So what is the retina texture level.

86
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:16,670
Will the retina texture works out roughly to be three thousand two hundred sixty six times that tan

87
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,900
of the size over distance.

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,290
Now you can actually use Google you can type that into Google and replace size and distance and it will

89
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,700
give you a sort of a texture size as it were that you could use.

90
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:36,950
And then we need to actually round that up or down to the nearest power of two that would work for it.

91
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,130
Hey it's Michael from the future here and we've had quite a few questions regarding this formula.

92
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,520
Your calculator has been in radians in order for this to work.

93
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,080
If you don't have a calculator that can go into radians or you don't know what that is or how to get

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,500
there.

95
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,640
You can use 57 times the tan of the size from a distance and that will work it out.

96
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,870
If you can is in degrees.

97
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,480
And of course there is one final thing here and that we haven't met.

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,780
Im actually measured or spoken about and that is the importance of the texture or object.

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,800
If it's something that's not really brought into the player's attention or the camera's attention it's

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,550
something off to one side it's not the focal point of your scene.

101
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,040
You can probably get away with a lot lower texture quality than otherwise.

102
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,060
And you see this a lot in games where perhaps the scenery is not as textured in certain places as others.

103
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,700
And the characters tend to have a lot more detail in them then perhaps a mug that they're going to pick

104
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,110
up.

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,380
You see this all the time and that is important.

106
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,930
You don't want to make something.

107
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,810
Incidental on the side or you might depending on the quality level you're going for but you don't want

108
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,850
something that's incidental on the side.

109
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:01,130
Having the same sort of quality level as the main object and the main focal point of the scene now obviously

110
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,890
that's that's your discretion whether you go to that level of detail with other objects in your scene

111
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,460
as well.

112
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,480
If you're going for a more photo realistic feel where for instance a mug is completely circular you

113
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,600
can't see any of the jagged edges going around making up that then then that's absolutely fine.

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Just bear in mind the higher level of detail the longer you're going to have to be working on that particular

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
model.

116
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,860
And let's say we do take the mulga example forward.

117
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,530
The last thing you want to do is spend all of your time modelling a mug when you could have been modelling

118
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,710
the main character that everybody's watching says worthwhile.

119
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,320
Bearing that in mind as well.

120
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,590
As with most lectures we've got a challenge.

121
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,040
I would like you to calculate the following.

122
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,720
Now I'm going to be a bit loose on this one and allow you guys to actually pick the size and distance

123
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,400
that some of these objects are going to be from you.

124
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,800
So play with them and see what you come out with.

125
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:07,520
Remember if you're going to use MM meters kilometres in the case of the moon there remember that the

126
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,490
size and distance have to be in the same units.

127
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,320
Otherwise it's not going to work out.

128
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,120
So balls of video now and give that a go.

129
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,240
Okay guys.

130
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,250
Welcome back.

131
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,900
Let's go through and fill out this table.

132
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,960
Okay so the first thing the moon has a set things are going to go die and mitts of the moon.

133
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,610
Okay.

134
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,350
So we are going to look this one up.

135
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,990
I don't know zarmina Plock that in the table sets 3 4 7 4.

136
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,880
Okay.

137
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,470
And I'm going to change that to distance.

138
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,980
That's not grammatically correct.

139
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,060
I'm sure Google worked out for me.

140
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,350
So three.

141
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,580
Wow that's a long way away isn't it.

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,040
It's going to take us a while to get there.

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,550
So now I know that I can actually plonk in my equations that was three to six six times.

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,010
Men tan.

145
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,910
I can group that together there and I don't feel fancy the open book open bracket.

146
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,930
I need it here.

147
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:15,240
So tan and we need to go in and do size over distance.

148
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,700
So that's 3 4 7 4 over.

149
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,150
3 7 0 3 0 0 0.

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,520
That'll give us a result of 30.

151
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,410
So there you go.

152
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,490
That is quite low.

153
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,050
So that's going to be 32 by 30 you can actually get away with 32 by 30 to texture.

154
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:43,450
If you were standing on the planet looking at the moon because it doesn't take up much size just make

155
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,520
sure I got my dimensions the right way round there.

156
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,500
So I've got size over distance so size over distance brilliant case building.

157
00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm going to pick a hundred meters tall building and I'm going to be stood at a distance of a kilometre

158
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,480
away.

159
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,880
So I'm going to be stood at a foul a thousand meters and 100 meters.

160
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,880
So then we go up and hit the back button here and hopefully know how.

161
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,410
There we go.

162
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,740
I've got my equation so I'll be 100 over a thousand So this is one of these things we can leave open

163
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,380
in a tab here and we get back to it.

164
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,490
So that's 327.

165
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,070
Now this is a good one isn't it.

166
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,770
I've picked something where the power of two is ended up halfway in between.

167
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,490
So I've got to make a decision at this point.

168
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,710
Well not necessarily at this point but I feel at this point whether or not I'm going to get any closer

169
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,110
to the building if I am going to go for five 12 or I could probably get away with 2 5 6.

170
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,600
Remember these are retin-a pixels.

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,550
So at this point you as the viewer would not be able to see any of those pixels.

172
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,020
It would be perfectly resolved.

173
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,490
So in that case I'm going to go for two hundred and fifty six.

174
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,040
Okay a kitchen tile.

175
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,990
Well I'm going to do that in centimetres.

176
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,940
I'm going to remember to put my units in here as well that is very important.

177
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,850
Okay so a kitchen tile.

178
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm looking at kitchen tiles at the moment and they're about 10 centimetres across.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,380
So 10 centimetres and a distance Well if I was washing up I'm going to be stood roughly about 90 centimetres

180
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,260
away from it.

181
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,300
So I'm up to about a meter depending on where I am going to go for 90 to me.

182
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,840
So I lean forward.

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,040
Let's go for 70 centimetres.

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm picking at a dish from the from the liquid there that's so that's going to be 10.

185
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,240
So I can adjust these figures here 10 over 70.

186
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,930
Okay.

187
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,180
Let's see what we've come up with here.

188
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
Okay so that's close to 512 k.

189
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,110
And finally a car well a car is approximately where.

190
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,850
Depends where you are in the world.

191
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,160
I've driven a smart car that's very tiny and I see some American cars like a Humvee or something like

192
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,170
that are huge.

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,190
So I'm going to go for a four meter car.

194
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,090
So for me it's a car.

195
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,850
Now if you let's say walking along the pavement then this is the distance thing again.

196
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:20,910
So the car's never going to be any closer to me than let's say a meter but it's four meters long.

197
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,350
Okay let's see what that works out to us.

198
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,860
So for meters and by a meter.

199
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay.

200
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:36,960
This one ends up very large in fact that is closer to 4 0 9 6 than it is anything else.

201
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,900
So let's bring up my chart here.

202
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,840
Now did any of the shock you.

203
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,540
Did you think for instance that the moon was going to be a lot higher than 32.

204
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,620
By 32 in order to accomplish a sort of retina level that did shock me and the car was particularly high.

205
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,400
I wasn't expecting it to go quite that high.

206
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,100
The building didn't puzzle me too much I thought that would be around sort of 2 5 6 5 12.

207
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,520
I didn't anticipate the kitchen towel being quite the higher thought because it was quite a small object

208
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,680
be able to get away with a lot lower.

209
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,780
Now remember it is very important but these are retina level textures.

210
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,280
You could probably get away with a lot lower than these probably half of these themselves.

211
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,860
I hope that's you found that incredibly useful.

212
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,830
Did you come up with some other size and distances.

213
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,350
Did you come up with some crazy figures and just as a side note here most game engines at the moment

214
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,710
don't support over eight thousand odd by eight thousand odd pixels.

215
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,860
So you can't go much higher than that without causing yourself some memory problems so that's worthwhile.

216
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,230
Bearing that in mind I'd love you to share your results if you came out of anything wacky there.

217
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
And I will see you in the next lecture.
