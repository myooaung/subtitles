Welcome to Profar modelling by extrusion.

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.570
So in this video you'll understand what Profar modelling is potentially speed up modelling by mirroring.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.880
Use a series of methods to produce a profile that we can use in our scene and then in the next few lectures

4
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.380
will use the same profile.

5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.100
In a couple of different ways which have significantly different effects.

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.040
So what is profile modelling.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.200
What profile modelling is the outline you get when you view something from a particular angle.

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.410
One of the best things to do is imagine slicing through your model.

9
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.240
Now realize we have used them in the past.

10
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950
We've used the lab over them the ability.

11
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.820
They realize we've used them in the past.

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.040
We've got the lamp base which was produced with curves and the pin was geometry based so the methods

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.880
we're going to use up ahead.

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.330
We don't bump up our extrudes speed so we don't have to keep pressing E.

15
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.110
Every time we going to be using the bevell tool for constructing and defining sharp edges and a subsurface

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.400
modifier for making the surface nice and smooth.

17
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

18
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.600
Hello everybody and welcome back.

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.620
First things first.

20
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.970
This is an insert video.

21
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.510
This is Michael from the future.

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.050
And as you've probably noticed I'm on a P.S. here rather than a mat and I'm on a different version of

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.410
blender.

24
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.690
But what we're about to learn will apply to the version whatever you are using.

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.540
So the first thing we need to do here is go ahead and continue our series by opening up our door.

26
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.230
So I'm going to go ahead and open up my front door here and work on that and we're going to create a

27
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.390
profile in a moment and then do an extrusion based upon that profile.

28
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.750
So the first thing I'm going to do here is take a Jew placates of this of door frame here because we're

29
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.770
going to produce something with a bit more detail.

30
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.820
So I'm going to use shift indeed to duplicate it.

31
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.640
And I'm just going to press Escape here so goes right bang on top of the previous version.

32
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.200
Now we see here after duplicate and this is elodie a front door 001 over the outliner.

33
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.470
I'm going to change that.

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.720
It's going to be elodie be because it's going to contain more detail.

35
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.980
Front door.

36
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.290
And there we go.

37
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.160
So this is our first stage here and elodie a will we can change that on the mesh data as well.

38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.270
Of course if you cannot see your mesh data remember it's these upside down triangle.

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.810
After you've selected the mesh object.

40
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.390
Okay.

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.030
So now we've done that.

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.970
The next thing we need to do is decide where we're putting our model.

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.600
So we've got elodie Door front door and we want to hide the elodie a Otherwise it's gonna be messy if

44
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.710
we try and render etc. So what we could do here is just hide elodie a by clicking the little hide icon

45
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.230
here and we can even hide it from rendering as well.

46
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.860
Over on the outliner what I'm going to do however is to just move this elodie front door to a different

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.190
layer.

48
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.820
So we've currently got everything on Layer 1 we can see the orange dots down at the bottom.

49
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.010
If I press the M key whilst my cursor is in the 3D view I've got the option to move whatever the active

50
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.400
selected object is to another LAN when to move it to Layer 2 and then we see because it is the selected

51
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.270
object the orange daughters moved across and is now on layer 2 but we're not looking at there too so

52
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.750
I'm going to click on layer 2 and we can now see what's going on.

53
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.610
Okay.

54
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.100
So now we've got everything set up ready to work.

55
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.790
Let's go ahead and start making this profile.

56
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.120
Now you can make a profile any which way you want to.

57
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.050
I'm going to create a 3D object and start cutting it up a little.

58
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.150
Some go into edit mode.

59
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.510
No we're not going to go into edit mode and add it as more meche data to this mesh object.

60
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.830
We're going to create a new mesh object and we're going to do that because we're going to apply some

61
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.230
modifiers and we want the modifiers to apply to that new mesh object not just the front door.

62
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.740
So let's go ahead into edit mode on here first because we need to find a placement for our new object.

63
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.800
Some are going to find.

64
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.180
Let's go to virtex select and this lower vertex at the bottom of the dorm and select that one and then

65
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.820
go shift and S and move the cursor the 3D cursor to the selected.

66
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.270
Now we can go ahead and add in as a separate object we can add in a cube that's going to be far too

67
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.850
big for what we want to do.

68
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.780
So going to bring that scale all the way down now we have got snapping turned on at the moment that

69
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.250
shouldn't cause as many issues and we've got an object that we can work on now.

70
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.060
I'm going to go ahead and apply that scale as well as a control an A and apply a scale okay and go into

71
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.640
edit mode.

72
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.280
And we're going to use bevell.

73
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.400
We've done several before on this edge and this edge control and B and we can bring that in ever so

74
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.160
slightly longer use my mouse will to make that slightly more curved.

75
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.780
And on this edge here I'm going to bevel again but this time bring it inwards so we've got our curve

76
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.850
there that's fine but I want it go any other way.

77
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.910
So over on the operator panel I can bring that up in out a little.

78
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.120
We've got the amount of bevell That's just bring that back down to where it was the number of segments

79
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.290
and the profile and obviously if we push that inwards we get a slightly different profile going round.

80
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.740
Okay so that's looking good so far.

81
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.460
The next thing to do here is start thinking about the profile itself because we're really talking about

82
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.940
just how it's looking here from the top and bottom so we could go ahead here in at a subdivision surface

83
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.760
modified to smooth things out.

84
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.310
In fact if we do that we can learn a few other tricks as we go as well.

85
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.680
So let's go out into object mode and apply a subsurface modifier subdivision surface and you see here.

86
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.940
It crumples everything up.

87
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.530
Now one way we can remove the crumpling at the top and the bottom is to actually just delete the faces

88
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.230
at the top and bottom which is absolutely fine.

89
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.650
We can go ahead and do that we're not using these faces anyway in a few minutes.

90
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.200
But let's learn something whilst we're here.

91
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.230
Now we've got this here.

92
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.760
We could increase the mean crease off the top edges as you can see there.

93
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.960
Overall the properties panel for those particular edges we could increase it there.

94
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.940
But in this case I am literally going to delete those faces so would both of them selected press the

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.280
x key and delete faces and you can see it automatically straightens that up anywhere because there's

96
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.860
no Lot is no longer trying to smooth out those faces because they dont exist.

97
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.160
Okay so that is looking pretty good at the moment.

98
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.470
And of course if we zoom in a bit too far you will notice that the clack the camera clipping distance

99
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.180
not the rendering distance but it actually starts eating into our object.

100
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.180
We cant see it.

101
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.040
And again over on the property panmure facts right here we've got clippings is the 3D viewport clipping.

102
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.250
If we move that down we can start seeing things when we zoom in nice and close into our model.

103
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.490
Okay so now we've set up all of those options there.

104
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.490
We can use that crease for these two edges here to make that nice and sharp.

105
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:07.930
If we were to go ahead and make that sharp and then final thing I might do here is go in and set the

106
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.850
shading to smooth.

107
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.670
So there we go we've got a relatively straightforward object there that we could repeat round but we're

108
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.030
more interested in the profile and controlling it a bit better.

109
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.410
So what can we do here.

110
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:26.080
Well we can go in and start with just the base and extrude it to a particular height instead of back

111
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.470
into object mode.

112
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.030
I'm going to use the old key and select top edge loop running round.

113
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.030
And once that's done I can press the x key and rather than deleting just that top edge firmware delete

114
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.670
the vertices and that I'll delete everything coming up.

115
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.920
So again we can now go ahead and go out and select this edgerley around here.

116
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.570
Now we're about to do some extruding some quick extruding rather than just pressing E and extruding

117
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.270
all the time.

118
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:56.020
We're going to use the control key to extrude rapidly but we need to be in the right direction because

119
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.780
if we hold down control and left click we can see that we can put edges in but they've gone somewhere

120
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.280
random in 3-d space.

121
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.280
Can undo control and Z.

122
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.170
How.

123
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.260
So what can we do here.

124
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.840
Well we can make the view orthographic and press the number pad 5 key and then number pad 1 to view

125
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.340
it from the front.

126
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.960
Now we can line everything up.

127
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.690
I'm going to dismiss the tools on the left hand side with the T key and the properties panel on the

128
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.580
right hand side with the n key.

129
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:24.970
There we go.

130
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.860
They are gone and now I can hold down control and zoom in to where I want to go and click there.

131
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.940
Click here.

132
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.830
Click there and click their number just holding down control as I do that.

133
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.790
Now we've got a couple of options here where it comes to this top point because we're now going to mirror

134
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.440
this object and if we go ahead and mirror this object we're going end up with this horrible triangle

135
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.940
in intersecting geometry.

136
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.130
But we can get around that by going all the way around to the next point.

137
00:08:52.140 --> 00:09:01.050
Now if you wanted to make this just a little bit let's say all you wanted to make this a bit less mechanical

138
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.450
or less candy you could carry on going all the way around and then it would be unique on both sides

139
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.070
which can add an element of being natural into it.

140
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.560
But cannot undo that because I want to think about speedy workflow.

141
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.100
So once I've gone this far because this top bit here is going to be pretty much upright I can then just

142
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.740
delete this edge again with X and then delete the vertices and it brings it back and notice this time

143
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.190
it's kept this relatively upright.

144
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.310
Now the more egalite amongst you will have noticed that our lovely profile that we've extruded up in

145
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.280
around the door frame has its Normal's the wrong way round.

146
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.410
So I'm going to select everything there and go control an N and we can see that's flipped around and

147
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.010
the normals are now facing the right direction.

148
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:51.330
Now we may increase the subdivision count on this later on but remember we're only working at elodie

149
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.710
B for the moment.

150
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.550
In fact I'm going to nest this cube whats called cube we should do something with that.

151
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:04.800
I'm going to put it under neefe l'eau dbe and I'm going to call this door profile number one because

152
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.640
we may make more than one profiles.

153
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.550
So now that's done what we can do is add a mirror modifier to this so we go to add modifiers mirror

154
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.190
modify.

155
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.620
And that's why we created it as a separate mesh object because otherwise the modifier would apply to

156
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.600
the whole door.

157
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.180
Now I'm just going to hide up the subdivision modifier for the moment subsurface to vision modify.

158
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.060
And let's think about this mirroring at the moment it's happening around the objects origin.

159
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.020
It be nice if we can mirror around the centre of the door.

160
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.740
Let's just try using the mirror object as the door for the moments elodie front door.

161
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.740
That's not worked as expected.

162
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.820
The axis is correct.

163
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.890
We're mirroring along the x axis.

164
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.020
Whats happened there.

165
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.600
Well if we use the door then it's mirroring around this origin.

166
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.020
So we need to mirror around something else.

167
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.210
One of the easiest things to do here is create a mirror point using an empty so we can go ahead and

168
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:57.960
do that.

169
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.580
One of you at the front again.

170
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.950
And if I do that I can see that the middle of the door is well has a width of two we can double check

171
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.410
that in object mode under the properties panel we can see here the X dimension of the entire object

172
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.060
is for Blender unit so the middle is going to be two.

173
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.440
Couple of options of moving the 3D cursor to that point to create our empty or in fact we could just

174
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.750
place the empty there manually afterwards.

175
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:27.910
But let's go down to the 3-d cursors position and on the x axis type in a number of a value of two.

176
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.010
That's going to place it in the middle.

177
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.770
We can then go shift and 8 add a new object.

178
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:38.920
I'm going to add in an empty it's going to be just a plain axis and I'm going to call that plain axis.

179
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.280
Mirror point.

180
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.630
I'm going to make sure that the Mirror point is a child of the dorsal if we move the door it doesn't

181
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.000
ruin our mirroring.

182
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:53.250
And then finally on this mesh object that we've created the door profile now we've not named it door

183
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.220
profile here let's do that as well.

184
00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.750
Now that those are named If we go to our modifiers the mirror objects we can use the mirror points and

185
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.050
there we go things line up perfectly.

186
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.820
But what of this very top we probably dont want a gap there.

187
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.680
Well there are two options here.

188
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:16.820
At the moment what will happen is if we're in edit mode and grab this edge loop move it just to we got

189
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.600
snapping still turned on yes we haven't turned it on and just move it you can see that it intersects

190
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.180
with itself which you may have that could be quite cool but around this point in the middle where it

191
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.800
does intersect you're going to end up with it potentially looking horrible during rendering because

192
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.570
it won't know what face to show you.

193
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.460
So I'm going to undo that if we turn on clipping We could manually move these two things together and

194
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.550
adjust it to our heart's content.

195
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.380
That's a pretty good starting point and we can lower it down.

196
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.100
Alternatively you can go to the merge limit himself and just turn up that merge limit and they will

197
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.580
naturally snap together.

198
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.280
Now you do have to be careful with the merge limit because because if it's a more complicated object

199
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.350
you may end up merging points that you didn't intend to merge and that you intended to leave a gap on.

200
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.690
But now that's set up there we've got a mirror modifier in place.

201
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.800
You could extend this even further a mirror of the whole doll that would be a possibility especially

202
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.220
if we wanted to join the door profile onto the front door we'd even have to do that and mirror the whole

203
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.910
object.

204
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.110
All we'd have to apply our mirror modifier.

205
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.440
I'm not going to apply the mirror modifier at the moment because I still probably want to go in and

206
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.310
tweak this a little bit more.

207
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.290
And what you see here is a little jerky as it moves around.

208
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.280
Not to worry with that we can even.

209
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.680
Increase the subdivision's surface modify.

210
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.020
And I think because we remove that looks smooth shaded to me I could see faces.

211
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.300
So if we go to our tools here and go shading smooth That's much better and then you can easily get away

212
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:52.650
with a much lower subdivision surface in its entirety and in deed we can just turn it off at the top

213
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.660
here we can just use the eyeball to hide it and see what it looks like on its head and you know what

214
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.290
that looks absolutely fine is.

215
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.070
Now the shading gets a bit weird around the bottom here and that's because we have a look at the bottom

216
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.730
is got no face around the bottom so the final thing we could do here is just fill in that base.

217
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.890
So let the Edge loop going around the bottom.

218
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:18.750
It looks like it's broken in one place and then have to select it in two lumps and then just fill that

219
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.890
in we'll make sure we press the right key and fill that in.

220
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.060
Now just to make sure that everything working as we'd expect there because it does look a little bit

221
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.410
funny I'm going out once I'm in it man I'm going to select everything off my scene.

222
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.790
I'm going to press the space bar to do a general search for all operators and I'm going to type in doubles.

223
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.970
I think there are some doubles in our model and I would be correct it's remove seven vertices from the

224
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.910
model and there we go.

225
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.850
That is looking much much better.

226
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.420
Excellent.

227
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.950
And again I'm going to turn back on the subdivisions surface modifier and that has come along really

228
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.830
nicely.

229
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.870
And of course now it's time for your challenge.

230
00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.070
Okay guys a quick challenge for you.

231
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:06.570
I'd like you to create some more extruded profiles so try using extruded profile on other models.

232
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.410
So we've got the window you used to round there and you can maybe even put some detail on a wall.

233
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.880
Now do remember this can be used at a macro and micro level so it can be used for many different levels

234
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.500
of detail from archways to arms.

235
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.170
Other bench for instance supports a video now and give that a go.

236
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.490
Okay guys welcome back.

237
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.430
Let's go add some detail to a window.

238
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.670
Okay so first of all I'm going to make sure I've got everything named appropriately great.

239
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.580
And I'm going to save my work.

240
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:45.390
And then I go and find and open up my window a lot easier to find it now it's just called window and

241
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.870
we're going to add a profile around here.

242
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.590
I'm going to move the 3D cursor to where I want this detail if I can add a couple of profiles I could

243
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.480
do the window ledge itself and the arch way.

244
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.490
But going to focus on just the arch way and I'm going to go all the way round rather than mirroring

245
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.410
because I want to slight a symmetry to it any way.

246
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:08.930
So I'm going to flip over in two virtex select select a vertex and using the cursor movement.

247
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.880
I'm going to move the cursor to selected once I've done that I can add in a shape for I want to work

248
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.100
with and I'm going to add in a cube and scale it all the way down.

249
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.480
It's nice to work with that.

250
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.660
So now we've done that we just need to add some detail so I want it.

251
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:30.360
I am actually quite pointy here so I might need an extra level of detail but again I've got to remember

252
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.090
that this is going to be all I've jumped straight ahead another ad it started adding to the level of

253
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:36.560
detail.

254
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.690
A.

255
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.060
So what can we do here.

256
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.410
Well it's very straightforward to sort this lot out.

257
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.160
Fortunately I haven't gone too far or jumped ahead of myself.

258
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.910
I'm just going to undo a couple of times and then go ahead and duplicate that object.

259
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:59.520
There we go duplicated the object and let's move it to layer to rename it l'eau dbe B and then Windows

260
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.590
absolutely fine.

261
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.030
The 44 just describes the size I don't have any other sizes.

262
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.460
At the moment I was going to be a bit of a lethal one on the end.

263
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:14.100
There may need to sort out that naming convention later on as long as I'm consistent.

264
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.800
That should be absolutely fine of renamed all of those things hop to lay a toe.

265
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.760
And now we can start modelling Fortunately the 3D cursor is still in the same place so I can go ahead

266
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.580
and add that cube.

267
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.930
I do want to add it is a different mesh object at the moment so its going to object mode.

268
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.940
I could add it to the other mesh but I don't want to ruin the underlying mesh just at the moment.

269
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.240
I don't want to ruin it at all of course but I don't want to disturb it.

270
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.360
So let's go ahead into edit mode.

271
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:51.200
Click fair and let's move this edge right in to make it nice and pointy.

272
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.890
Now I'm going to use this profile to stick it in a little.

273
00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.500
And Paul that so we've got a nice homes or curve going on.

274
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.230
They are like fabulous it's slightly in the wrong place so we can start moving things about snapping

275
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.390
turned onto whole increments.

276
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.210
I don't want that something to hold down Shift to do some smaller increments.

277
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.710
Once we finish the bevell of course.

278
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.400
Select everything and let's move it with much smaller instruments instruments.

279
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.580
With much smaller increments locked to the x axis.

280
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.450
Move it on the x axis.

281
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.090
And yes I'll go to that.

282
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.850
Maybe not that depth.

283
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:43.580
Let's go and see where it's placed here and just move it back so it's just inside the wall that's perfect.

284
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:52.070
Now I'm going to grab this face here extrude it slightly this way that's not slightly That's lots.

285
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.410
A turnoff snapping to do that.

286
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.370
There it go.

287
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.260
And I'm just going to do that bit by eye.

288
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.890
So that's that's okay.

289
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.930
I'm going to round off this particular edge.

290
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.480
Again using the.

291
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.560
I'm not going to go free inside rounce on the change that profile and make it move the other way.

292
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.400
And then finally I'm going to add a bit of detail using a subsurface modifier but I'm going to delete

293
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.650
those top and bottom faces first so it looks nice straight away.

294
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.970
So at top faces and bottom faces the leak those.

295
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:31.710
Then we can add a subsurface modifier up seemed to have zoomed in so that selects something and they

296
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.740
get perfect.

297
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.780
So now we've got that now I just need to make this edge here sharp.

298
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.420
And the one on the inside as well.

299
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.600
So I'm going to be careful to do that.

300
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:50.330
It's already on the round setting so I know that an arm and a bevel there as well.

301
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:56.800
Now if this is being mirrored on the other side this would need to be totally sharp or near enough sharp

302
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.560
otherwise it will look silly.

303
00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:04.690
So what we can do there to make absolutely sharp is a couple of options.

304
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.310
I'm going to bevell but make it incredibly small bevell.

305
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.150
And I can change that here on me and mount's by point one there.

306
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.730
SS Absolutely tiny now.

307
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.230
Okay now we have our I can delete this top edge loop.

308
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.680
Select the bottom edge loop and start modelling.

309
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.260
I'm going to whiz around to the front and I'm going to go all the way up and all the way down.

310
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.880
So let's control and click.

311
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.650
Click there.

312
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:42.140
Now we can see there start is slightly off centre but so k. because we can go back to it later on and

313
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.860
sort it out.

314
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:49.670
One of the benefits of this ikenne or it's also slightly at the wrong place down here but that's okay

315
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:55.410
because we can select that bottom edge loop and start moving it and straighten it out again.

316
00:20:55.470 --> 00:21:01.220
Don't have to be perfect unless it's a model that absolutely requires everyone to turn snapping on here

317
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:08.030
and faces and moving in the z axis only I'm going to snap it to this bottom face.

318
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.270
Now that's looking pretty good as a couple of things that we can do to make it look a bit better.

319
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.590
We can go and grab an edgerley running around here for instance and scale only on the z axis and we

320
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.540
can give it a much taller or thinner approach that's now I don't like thin ultra.

321
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.790
This would probably work a bit better on the door and snapping turned on which is not making it very

322
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.370
smooth.

323
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.500
But I can make that smaller or thinner if I want to make it slightly bigger.

324
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.360
And around these edges here I've having trouble selecting them.

325
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.870
We'll get there eventually.

326
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.920
That edgeley there and this one.

327
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.150
All missed it.

328
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.110
That one there.

329
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.820
Hopefully that skorts the entire age group selected what we can do here is add a small bevell to those

330
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.770
areas.

331
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.520
To help define that shape a little more.

332
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.280
And of course smooth shadings not turned on here so we can go ahead hop into object mode and turned

333
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.420
smooth shading on.

334
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.950
And that's looking pretty good.

335
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.990
Let's check it out in rendered mode.

336
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.680
There's no light in our scene so this is one of the downsides about removing a light so we can go ahead

337
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.560
and add a lamp into the seen the sun.

338
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.170
I'm going to randomly rotate.

339
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.680
So if we can get a good light source come in I can always hop out and sort that out.

340
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.610
But that looks pretty good.

341
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.440
How did you guys get on.

342
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.010
What sort of extruded profiles did you make.

343
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.740
Please share them in the discussions.

344
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.560
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
