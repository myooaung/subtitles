00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.680
Welcome to a profile based modelling using mesh objects in this video.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.700
You use the array modifier to repeat a mesh objects along the length of a curve will then deform the

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.710
array using the same curve data and hopefully end up with some pretty awesome results.

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.570
So let's go hop on over in a blender.

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.330
Hello everybody and welcome back over into blender.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.840
The first thing you might notice here is I'm back on my p.c SO is me Michael from the future.

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.380
And the other thing to mention here is that this particular door that we're about to work on doesn't

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.310
have the curve profile that we set up in the last lecture.

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.370
But that doesn't matter because we can do everything we need to do with what I've got in front of me

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.740
here.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.470
Or you could even use your curved profile to work office as well a little mini challenge if you want

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.710
to go off and do that later on.

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.450
So the first thing we need to do is think about what we're going to do in terms of duplicating the information

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.950
we have in front of us here because I could just go ahead duplicate the entire mesh objects in front

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.640
of me and then go and delete the geometry.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.120
I don't want or I could go into that mesh object itself by going into edit mode find the bit of geometry

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.580
I want to select in this case it will be this bottom face here although there is something odd going

18
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.700
on the bottom face I'm not sure what is going on there.

19
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.260
It seems a bit crooked.

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.090
In fact it looks like there's still sivers doubles over there you know.

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380
Yes it's it's done something very weird with that profile.

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.960
I'm going to delete that bottom face at the moment and then sort that out.

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.330
Now this will obviously didn't want to do that I just to delete the face itself's X and then delete

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.180
the face.

25
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.310
So there is some rule.

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.540
And so you'd lose geometry and here perhaps there might be.

27
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.550
I'm not entirely sure thing I'm trying to select the main axis there.

28
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.590
So we can select the age group running around.

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.570
There seems to be a break in edge loops around there when to select everything here remove doubles.

30
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.120
Nothing there no increase the merge distance.

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.040
Not that much but ever so slightly and just make sure that the profile remains intact which I think

32
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.070
it has done.

33
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.160
Yes I think there might have been some geometry that was very close to itself anyway.

34
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.740
I'm happy with that now.

35
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.340
And what I really want is this bottom edge running ran and we see excellence being selected all at once

36
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.770
there.

37
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.370
So at some point a duplicate a bit of geometry moved it to one side.

38
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.290
But now I've got that bottom edge loopier I can both fill it in and we can see that one of the issues

39
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.820
that it makes there's with the subdivisions surface model the fire as she brings it all together.

40
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.770
So finally I'm going to increase the mean crease so doesn't do that.

41
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.890
Now that that's done I can grab this bottom face and duplicate it will shift and day and then press

42
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.730
the P key to separate it by selection and it will generate a new mesh object with the same name as before.

43
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.450
That's fine.

44
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.390
Only change that name to door profile.

45
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.890
So this is going to be a mesh profile that we're going to use before we do anything else.

46
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.780
There are a couple of modifiers attached to it so let's go ahead and remove those and then hide.

47
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.240
Profile one.

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.440
So we've got our starting point here that we're going to build up a bit of a an example with.

49
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.650
So let's go ahead into edit mode and select that face and extrude it up almost flip around to the front

50
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.270
view I mean orthographic mode here so I can extrude that up by let's say that amount.

51
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.610
Now we can see straightaway that this isn't going to work as I intended because the normals are flip

52
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.890
so let's go select everything and then control an N to flip those normal so that's a great start.

53
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.540
The next thing I'm going to do is background to the front view with the number pad number pad number

54
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.450
one in this case.

55
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.140
And I am going to duplicate this mesh that I've generated.

56
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.240
Fix it to the x axis and then just lift it up with enough space for two hours of fake mortar or a gap

57
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.430
in the brick work that's going to add a bit of shadowing and then I'm going to zoom around or not zoom

58
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.810
Let's move around here select a couple of these faces that I want to pull out.

59
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.100
Now I'm not just going to pull them out.

60
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.010
Actually that might work in home.

61
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.880
I can just pull it out like that and be done with it.

62
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.300
Yeah.

63
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.720
Okay.

64
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.790
That will do for the purposes of this exercise.

65
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.580
I was thinking of extruding rather than just moving but that looks all right there.

66
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.950
Now a couple of options we've got with these corners here because we've got some odd shadowing going

67
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.340
on top.

68
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.310
Now the odd shadowing of course is is caused by the fact that there these are in ons here and it's not

69
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.760
what is trying to smooth it the best it can but it doesn't really know how.

70
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.660
So we can bevel this edge around the top.

71
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.070
We could make some loop cuts closer to it.

72
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.420
It's entirely up to you this very top face here.

73
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.120
We're not going to see any way any shading artefacts around.

74
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.440
We'll deal with that later.

75
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.100
If there is indeed an issue.

76
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.680
So we've got our meche object.

77
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.500
Let's go back into object mode and add in an array modifier because we want this to repeat itself.

78
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.910
So the array modifier is under the generate column so it's right at the very top array.

79
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.190
And it's going the wrong way.

80
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.930
Of course we can increase the counts and that's great and looks like a brick wall it's going the wrong

81
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.130
way.

82
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.470
So let's turn relative offsets on the x direction to zero and we probably want it on the z direction.

83
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.030
Excellent.

84
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.590
And I'm going to zoom in here because one of the issues will be is that it butts one object up against

85
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.220
the other and we don't want that we want a little gap between the two.

86
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.780
So this is going to need to be something like 1 point.

87
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.180
No that's too much too little I'm going to hold down Shift to move this in a much more controlled manner.

88
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.480
Let's say about there sir.

89
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.550
Oh port o points.

90
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.760
Not the rry of a blender unit up.

91
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.420
So there we go.

92
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.170
Perfect.

93
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.020
Now if we increase the account number.

94
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.050
Oh dear that's that's no good is it it's going in a random direction.

95
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.790
Now we want to control this.

96
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.960
We need to fit to something else at the moment it's being fitted to a fixed count to ten of them.

97
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.580
If I change it to fit courval Fit a length Well we dont have a length for it to fit because I dont know

98
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.960
the length of this curve.

99
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.370
But what we can do is select fit curve and we need a curve for it to follow.

100
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.200
Do we have a curve at the moment.

101
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.340
Unfortunately we dont.

102
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.940
So were going to have to generate one.

103
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.540
And of course following along from the last lecture you would have actually had a curve.

104
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.220
Im going to generate one very quickly by going to my elodie BE front door going into edit mode selecting

105
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.900
the mesh that runs around here or rather the edge that runs all the way up and down.

106
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.950
Thats selected it first time brilliantly.

107
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.860
Im going to duplicate it presses scapes So its definitely not moved anywhere.

108
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:34.060
Then Oulton see I of course silly me Oulton see it needs to be object mode that we do this is not going

109
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.320
to work whilst we in edit mode of that particular object.

110
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.550
We try it and see in there.

111
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.540
It's an object mode operation easily done say.

112
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.190
So we're going to convert this to a mesh from our curve.

113
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.710
I dont need to convert the array.

114
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.210
No we need to do the other way sorry for a curve.

115
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.910
Our mesh and we dont need to keep the original.

116
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.500
Okay.

117
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.330
So now we've got all that sorted the next thing to do is go back to our door profile that we've created

118
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.510
these bricks and fitted to the curve and bang.

119
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.920
Hopefully it will now shoot up into the sky.

120
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.740
Why is it not doing that so let's have a look at the door.

121
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.460
Curve it follows round that's absolutely fine.

122
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.830
Let's have a look at our scale factors have I scale this.

123
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.230
No that's absolutely fine as well.

124
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.200
Door curve.

125
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.760
Have we go object mode in edit mode again.

126
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.050
This is now as tall as that length is long.

127
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.300
Okay brilliant.

128
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.430
The next thing we need to do here is actually have it follow the curve going round.

129
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.430
So we go to our ad modifier again and this time we're going to deform.

130
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.780
So it's in the form it's the fourth one down with a curve.

131
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.880
And again if we scroll down here I'm just going to minimize the array modify our curve here the object

132
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.170
we're going to follow is the door curve and it's gone off in a random direction.

133
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.820
So this is one of the problem solving parts of this.

134
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.430
Now we've got to figure out why it's going off in that direction what the defamation access is probably

135
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.110
what's going on.

136
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.120
It goes up and over in the z axis.

137
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.520
So we go to set up.

138
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.590
It seems to fit but it's been offset.

139
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.040
How annoying is that.

140
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.640
Well it's been offset because of the difference between the objects origins.

141
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.120
So we have a look at the door curve the origins all the way over here.

142
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.930
We have a look at the door profile the objects origin's all the way over here.

143
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:24.120
So I'm going to move my cursor my 3-d cursor first to the objects origin that we're using so the door

144
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:31.450
profile in this case so shift and s cursor to selected so that's in the right place.

145
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:39.300
Now we can go ahead to the door curve and in object mode go in the tool shelf itself go to set origin

146
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.470
to the 3-d cursor.

147
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.740
Now it should be in the right place but it's not.

148
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.660
Why is it not.

149
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.340
I bet it's the same issue we have before it's not in the right place at the moment because we probably

150
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.480
need tab in and out.

151
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:59.570
And in fact there we go if we hop in and out of edit mode and back into object mode it fits things imperfectly.

152
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.720
Now I'm not sure of this smooth shading actually when it comes to this brick work so I'm going to turn

153
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.610
smooth shedding back.

154
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.780
Ah yes that's much better.

155
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.240
Let's go into a rendered mode.

156
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.770
The lighting is not too great in this scene but that is coming along really nicely.

157
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.970
And in fact I'm just going to shove in a lamp into our scene.

158
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.400
Let's go to a lamp.

159
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.930
Make sure an object married yes.

160
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.380
Sunlamp and Im going to press the ah key twice.

161
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:31.140
So it's got a track ball rotation it's a lot easier to try to align things when you do that.

162
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.810
And here we go really and that's followed around perfectly exactly how we expected.

163
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.410
So a couple of things to remember there sometimes when you make a change youre going to have to tap

164
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:48.330
in an out object mode to edit mode for Brenda for Blender to reset itself there and theres something

165
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.260
else Ive just noticed and were going to have to rotate our curve.

166
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.320
By the looks of it because this is not will it look like when I was creating it.

167
00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:00.320
So lets go back to our door curve going to go into edit mode on the tilt.

168
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.640
I'm going to try ninety degrees.

169
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.750
Oh that is pretty cool.

170
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.510
It's not my intention.

171
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.810
Yeah that is pretty cool.

172
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.750
That's because I'm not monitoring what I'm doing if I go back into solid mode.

173
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.250
We'll see.

174
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.170
I've only selected this bottom vertex down here so want to set that tilt back to zero and I'm going

175
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.320
to select everything and then I mean tilt maybe minus 90 instead.

176
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:26.880
And hopefully that would have twisted everything back round how I would want it to sticks out.

177
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.260
That way wasn't it.

178
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.640
Oh it is minus 90.

179
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.410
There we go.

180
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.500
Tab in and out.

181
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.010
Perfect.

182
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.320
That was the intention as it goes around and that has worked really really well and it's not too bad

183
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.080
at the top here even occasionally you have to fill about especially on this mirror point here at a mirror

184
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.530
point.

185
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.870
So what we could do is have it going half the length of this arch arch way itself so we can do that

186
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.730
itself with the door curve.

187
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.200
We come in here we select the points that we want to delete which is going to be all the way to the

188
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.450
top one here and delete them.

189
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.470
Now when we tab in and out it will come to this point and stop there.

190
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.890
And then finally on the door profile we add in a mirror modify.

191
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:11.310
Now this is going to be a bit different from before we can use the same mirror points that we had.

192
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.820
We've now got this empty gap at the top.

193
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.830
Now that's an ideal place for you guys to go in and put in a I think is called a cornerstone at the

194
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.380
top or something like that I can't remember what it's called.

195
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.730
There's a special name for the thing at the very top of doorways that big block you can put that in

196
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.030
manually or Again you can tweak the curve itself.

197
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:37.200
So if we go back to the curve and come into it it obviously comes up here and then doesn't go 90 degrees.

198
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:43.500
So what you could do is bring that curve back ever so slightly to maybe here and then extrude a new

199
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.500
point for it to come across like that.

200
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.110
Now this will because I've not turned on clipping.

201
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.300
Intersect itself and cause probably some rendering errors.

202
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.180
So this has got to be played with and made accordingly.

203
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:03.340
Now in this case I'd probably just truncate this back to around here and then add in another bit of

204
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:11.140
geometry just to make up that difference there or in this case come in and solidify these these objects

205
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.920
and adjust them after that there's lots of options that you could do with everything in blender.

206
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.480
And of course looking at this you could come in and perhaps add a bit more of a subdivision surface

207
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.200
modifier.

208
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.000
The choices here are absolutely endless.

209
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.050
Of course with me rambling on about curb's Now it's time for your challenge.

210
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.380
Okay guys it's Challenge time.

211
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:39.850
I'd like you to create curve driven mesh objects so this is incredibly powerful tool set however can

212
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.740
be confusing and a little frustrating so we really need to nail this.

213
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.350
What else do you think.

214
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.030
What could you use this method for.

215
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.590
I think I'll throw one in there straight away.

216
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.370
A wobbly path winding through a woodland.

217
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.670
Something along those lines a brick path of AC.

218
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.000
Maybe even the yellow brick road.

219
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.700
Who knows.

220
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.530
So go ahead and add some more detail.

221
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.370
See your other models using this technique.

222
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.950
Pause a video now and give that a go.

223
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.920
Okay guys.

224
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:10.760
Welcome back.

225
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.380
Let's hop back on over into a blender.

226
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.730
Hey welcome back.

227
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.670
So let's have a look at making this window a bit more interesting.

228
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:26.790
So I'm going to borrow the curve that we've used to generate and the profile to make a.

229
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.500
Brick that we can use in our model so let's go ahead and duplicate that curve down there and convert

230
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.350
that straightaway to a mesh.

231
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.600
Let's get the curve that's going on here let's duplicate.

232
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.130
Oh that's a different curve.

233
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.940
We don't want to keep duplicating it.

234
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.980
That's get rid of that idea.

235
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.530
Duplicate it in that case.

236
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.200
Where's the.

237
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.880
There we go the path itself.

238
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.350
All I want.

239
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.460
So that's duplicate that as well.

240
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.700
And I'm going to call that a ray.

241
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.860
I can do some renaming later and I'm going to call this a ray profile.

242
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.430
Okay now we've got those two parts enable We just need to make sure that the array isn't causing us

243
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.010
any problems and hide.

244
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.160
These other two.

245
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.870
So we know or working on.

246
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.140
So let's go to this profile itself and hop into edit mode.

247
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.070
Select the edge lube fill and then extrude up ever so slightly over the make these bricks quite thin

248
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.000
so we can have a lot of them.

249
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.460
And once I've done that we just need to set it following the path.

250
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.810
So we're going to need an array modifier and set it.

251
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:40.720
It's fit tight to fit a curve and we want it going in the z direction.

252
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.480
And in this particular case what I can do is the Z relative offset by one.

253
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:53.120
I could actually bevel the edge just here so that when they join together will not be but control and

254
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.300
B when they actually join together.

255
00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.440
I'm not sure of a anough fine control over this at the moment and need to zoom in a bit more.

256
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.810
But when they join together these will actually have some.

257
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.060
Natural gaps between them.

258
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:19.900
Okay so now that is done let's hop back in to the modifiers and do the curved deform using the same.

259
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.060
Curve.

260
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.190
Now that's not happening at the my rent and I'm guessing it's a scale problem going on again.

261
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.670
So let's just have a look at the transformer properties.

262
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.230
Yes.

263
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.540
So let's apply for scale.

264
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.140
And would backup here.

265
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.660
Something still isn't working properly that's Have a look at the array and turn the curve off list do

266
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.300
one thing at a time.

267
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.240
There should be lots of those.

268
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.100
I haven't assigned the array itself the curve objectively array.

269
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:56.020
Now let's go back on to deform and see whether or not we need to generate R own curve.

270
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.580
Yes we do.

271
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.710
So let's go ahead and create a Bezier curve that will follow this path.

272
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.940
Fortunately I already have the origin in the right place.

273
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.920
So here I can move the cursor to the selected because that'll move it over there.

274
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.360
We can add ourselves a Bezier curve and start moving control points about and was done doing that.

275
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.030
I will fast forward the video.

276
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.920
I'm going to remember here to set my resolution down at 1.

277
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.640
And now that the curve is complete I should be able to go back to my array profile and change the properties

278
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.280
here in the modifiers to follow the new Bezier curve.

279
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.380
Okay so looking a bit.

280
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.920
It's looking kind of right but kind of funny as well.

281
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.940
I think what's going on here is something gone wrong with the curve itself.

282
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.040
Let's have a look at that Bezier curve in more detail.

283
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.110
I think it's probably these control points.

284
00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.000
Yes it is.

285
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:06.310
Some just going to turn off a self snapping and snap it to the same point there.

286
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.390
That should bring it back round to looking pretty decent.

287
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.430
Yeah that's looking pretty sweet.

288
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.860
Now that's really good.

289
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.610
I like the way that that's come out.

290
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.130
I think it's probably a little thick but we can always obviously modify our.

291
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:25.070
Okay there's there's a bit of rotation going on here I can see that's not the profile I'm looking for.

292
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.750
So let's highlight everything and mean tilt.

293
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:36.010
Last time it was up to 70 or hundred or minus 90 and that looks spot on.

294
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.980
There's a couple of other things I'd want to hear there's some odd stuff going on is that a rendering

295
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.100
artefact or something else going on.

296
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.710
I might have crossed something over at some point.

297
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.090
Wrong.

298
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.540
It being a rendering artefact wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing laughing.

299
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.120
Looks pretty cool but I can investigate later as to what's going on there.

300
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.890
How are your archways and how's the rest of your building coming on.

301
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.530
I'd love to see your results.

302
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.690
Please remember to share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
