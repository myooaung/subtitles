1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,210
Welcome to reference material.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,560
Now at the risk of sounding like a broken record because I've said it plenty times throughout this course

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,190
reference images are critical.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:19,660
And this particular section they are even more critical than they've been in the past now drawn or photos

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,790
are both okay.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
The important thing is that you have a reference image.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,160
They're going to help define your model or help the major parts whether there's a strong jaw line whether

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,420
the heads around head or perhaps an elongated head.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,630
There are lots of different shapes that heads can be.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,270
So of course they're going to help define it.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:46,210
They're going to guide an influential character as well so if the if the particular head has a scar

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,640
on it or it cuts or something like that or crooked nose or anything along those lines it's going to

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,810
help guide and influence both the character and the model itself.

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:03,280
Now just following along or without using reference material will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,760
time.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,890
I will stress at this point because it's quite a complicated thing that we're doing.

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,530
It's important that you have some sort of guidance behind what you're modelling so you can actually

18
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,560
see what's going on because it is going to be challenging not only is this the last section of the course

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,150
it's going to be one of the most difficult it's also because the human face is very hard to make object

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,210
it's because we as humans know when something's wrong with it.

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,830
And as an artist you also know when something's wrong with your work even if no one can see it you'll

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,570
spots every little thing that's wrong with it.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,820
So don't beat yourself up over it especially in the first couple of tries because you're gonna end up

24
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,580
with something that's more like an alien than a human head.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,940
I can guarantee that.

26
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,120
But don't fret.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,410
So did mine when I first started.

28
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,920
Now I don't recommend that you try to be realistic the first time sooner.

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,640
Take any incredible amount of effort to get to realism.

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:08,110
And of course if you're struggling with the basics because you're new to it it's going to be even more

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,390
difficult to attain realism perhaps go more like a caricature of your chosen head to begin with extenuates

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,940
certain features if the person has a big nose then make it a big nose big ears etc. etc. a strong jaw

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,300
line.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,330
Big eyes small eyes always looking angry those sort of things can really help bring the character out

35
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:36,390
in the model rather than making ultra realistic think about things like Pixar films and most animations.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,100
They're not ultra realistic.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,910
Be prepared to make several rough models as you go honing your skills.

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,640
Now you'll want to go through the entire process a couple of times to make sure you know from the very

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,270
beginnings to the very end stages but also when you get to a certain point you'll want to save often

40
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,900
and save versions as you go.

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,850
So the reason why I say that is if you save often of course if you make a horrible mistake and destroy

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,230
your model topology you will be able to go back in it won't hurt you too much in your time.

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,480
Now saving versions is important because you can at a certain point you'll notice that you are have

44
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,020
a standard head and from that you can make a lot of other heads and it's silly to take or start from

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,690
scratch all the time once you've got to a base head that you can work with and generate lots of other

46
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,630
heads from whether it be human or other.

47
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,090
It's a great starting place to be.

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,140
Now of course it's time for a challenge.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,720
Prepare your reference material.

50
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,740
Go and get your reference material prepared.

51
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,820
Now you could use Google Images you could sketch your character perhaps even take a photo of yourself.

52
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,220
It doesn't really matter which way you go if you do take a photo of yourself and make sure it's not

53
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,800
too wide an angle lens because that will accentuate your features and make it a bit difficult to work

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,130
with.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,450
But any photo would do absolutely fine.

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,610
I would recommend like I have done taking a photo from the front and from the side.

57
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,340
Just one of the sides it doesn't have to be both.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,010
So.

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,240
Video now and give that a go.

60
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,510
Okay guys welcome back.

61
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,340
And as you can see here this is the reference that I'll be working from.

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,770
Very handsome chap there.

63
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,190
It looks a bit grumpy though.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,240
But it's going to be just the front side there and front and side there.

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,250
And of course I'll be using this as my reference material.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,690
Feel free to use it yourself.

67
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,680
You can make a model of me or using it as a base.

68
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,210
Of course if you've got your own.

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,270
I'd love to see what you've done especially if you've sketched your own characters.

70
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,970
I'd love to see what sort of characters you guys are going to create so share in the discussions and

71
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,810
of course I will see you in the next lecture.
