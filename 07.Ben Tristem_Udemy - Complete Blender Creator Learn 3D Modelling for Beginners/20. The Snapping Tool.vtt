Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.220
In this lecture we're going to make these guardrails going up and down our pyramid.
2

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.970
We're gonna make use of snapping in order to do that because it doesn't just work on a object level.
3

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.820
It works when you're editing as well and can be incredibly useful as you can reference other parts of
4

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.750
your model in order to create new geometry, Lets hop over into a blender and find out more.
5

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.360
Okay so in front of us here we have our lovely ramp that we've got in place now it is connected to the
6

7
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.540
rest of our model so when we put these two loop cuts in so let's put to loop cuts in we've got to bear
7

8
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.350
in mind that they run around our entire model.
8

9
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.980
So we have to think carefully about that if we do any operations especially if we end up selecting a
9

10
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.920
face loop and forgetting that it runs around our model because that could really screw things up.
10

11
00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.290
Now with these selected I'm going to go ahead and select both of these and then using subtract just
11

12
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.370
select the other ones around the model itself.
12

13
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.710
Okay.
13

14
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.790
So in order to separate these I could move them individually I could slide them.
14

15
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.540
In this case I'm going to use the scaling function.
15

16
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.070
Now that looks like it's just scaling in and out but if I lock it to the Y axis it will in fact just
16

17
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.910
move backwards and forwards from one another.
17

18
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.200
And I'm going to pick an arbitrary point just because I can.
18

19
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.200
And that's going to enable me to set the the thickness of our railings that are going down.
19

20
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.140
The next thing I need to do is actually extrude these up and I need to snap them to a certain level.
20

21
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.950
Now it won't matter which parts of the model we used for the example you can use a different part of
21

22
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.910
it if you'd like.
22

23
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.880
But in this particular case we're going to use the snapping functionality in a moment to tell blender
23

24
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.970
how far we want to extrude something.
24

25
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.940
So let's go ahead and select this face loop going down and this one and that will of course of selected
25

26
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.960
everything else.
26

27
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.660
So its still on subtract.
27

28
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.750
I'm gonna get rid of all of those and those as well you will end up with some funny stuff going on.
28

29
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.620
If we don't do that.
29

30
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.150
Okay.
30

31
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.470
So we going to here,
31

32
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.650
use the snapping tool to actually lift this up and move it across to a certain location.
32

33
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.910
So the first thing we need to do is extrude.
33

34
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.900
That's fine that's working but we could extrude and snap it to the very top of these corners. 
34

35
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.560
And I pressed Escape that will have extruded by nothing.
35

36
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.970
I'm going to undo that before I do anything else I want to turn on snapping and I'm gonna turn it to
36

37
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.820
vertex snapping and I'm going to press the E key again and we can see that almost immediately it snaps
37

38
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.530
to all of these vertices even the ones that are far away from the parts of the model we're actually
38

39
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.410
extruding that's incredibly useful if we wanted it to match the height we could do that as well.
39

40
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.610
Now you can see from the side here that it's a bit different.
40

41
00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.420
If we select something that's higher up in fact it doesn't appear to be snapping to the right height
41

42
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.140
as you might expect it would.
42

43
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.560
And that's because it's actually snapped
43

44
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.410
so it's in line.
44

45
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.470
So if we were to extrude all the way up that would meet with that top edge perfectly.
45

46
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.080
And the reason why it's doing that is because it's snapping to a normal.
46

47
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.860
Notice the blue line isn't going directly up this time but it's going outwards slightly.
47

48
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.990
And if we have a look at the top left we see that it's two point one two one meters normal.
48

49
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.670
If we were to press the Z key again it would turn to local and face directly up in which case it does
49

50
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.640
snap exactly where we would expect it to snap.
50

51
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.270
So if we press the Z key once more is actually now literally snapping and dragging the model over.
51

52
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.490
And if we press Z a couple more times we can switch between local and global.
52

53
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.650
But unfortunately we've lost the ability to go back to normal.
53

54
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.210
So I'm gonna press escape which will still once again keep extrude there but have a look at the top
54

55
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.200
header bar.
55

56
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.270
Notice it says global currently.
56

57
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.550
Which means now that we've extruded by nothing.
57

58
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.930
If I was to go G and start lifting things up only on the Z axis once again it's locked to the global
58

59
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.510
Z all the way up.
59

60
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.950
If I press Z again it's locked it's the local Z which in this case is still all the way up.
60

61
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.720
What I want to do is change where it says global to normal.
61

62
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.080
This gives us the ability to go back to where we were before and snap it exactly where we want it to
62

63
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.190
be.
63

64
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.670
And in this case it's going to be right there okay.
64

65
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.070
So that's pretty much sorted out the main ramp section.
65

66
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.350
How about this area at the top here and at the bottom it would be nice if they sat flush and at the
66

67
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.940
moment.
67

68
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.920
Before we get onto our challenge I have noticed that as I'm trying to move around is really difficult
68

69
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.770
at the moment.
69

70
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.780
If you also find this is happening what you can do yourself is go to view and frame selected or indeed
70

71
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.040
frame all, frame selected will help focus on whatever selected and then you can move about much more
71

72
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.800
freely and around the objects.
72

73
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.020
And it also will reset your zoom if you're having trouble moving around your model and you can see the
73

74
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.040
option there is the numberpad full stop or period key.
74

75
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.110
And now it's time for your challenge.
75

76
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.840
Okay.
76

77
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.620
So for your challenge I'd like to finish off creating the railings that we've started.
77

78
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.490
Connect them to the pyramid at the top and the ground level at the bottom and try and get it as accurate
78

79
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.750
as you can.
79

80
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.720
Let's go have a look at what you're aiming for.
80

81
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.460
So here we go we've got the railings at the bottom meeting the ground and at the very top they connect
81

82
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.760
with the rest of the pyramid towards the back.
82

83
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:51.330
And I've decided here to snap them in place to where this part of the geometry of the doorway exists
83

84
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.780
already.
84

85
00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.370
OK so go ahead pause video now and give that a go. Okay everybody welcome back.
85

86
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.100
Let's go see how I went about finishing off these railings Hello everybody and welcome back.
86

87
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.500
OK.
87

88
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.860
So we've got a couple of options here on how we go ahead and do this.
88

89
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.860
As I've said before there's going to be no right or wrong way.
89

90
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:24.350
So we've got to somehow get these faces all the way back to this wall that's not going to be easy to
90

91
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.040
do unless there's an extrude.
91

92
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.090
Otherwise we're going to change the overall ramps dimensions or actually changing direction here.
92

93
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.190
So I'm going to extrude and I'm just going to let it snap to a random place for the moment.
93

94
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.210
And now we've got these two edges.
94

95
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.390
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to select the lower edge then it's very difficult
95

96
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.370
to work your way around this model.
96

97
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.100
So I'm going to switch it's a wireframe mode to see that edge and that edge there.
97

98
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.130
Yes I've been very fortunate being able to select it and I'm going to go G to start moving it and see
98

99
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.970
if I can get it roughly in the right place.
99

100
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.570
It doesn't look like it's going to snap.
100

101
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.980
Ideally some of the press escape and just have a look at the different options I've got.
101

102
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.310
So I'm going to go to face select first and then go G Z and select this face down here.
102

103
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.410
Now I don't want the normal I'm going to have to press that again to lock it
103

104
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:26.450
to this top face now is going to turn transparency off and we can see here that it's now locked in solid
104

105
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.160
mode to the bottom here.
105

106
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.330
Excellent.
106

107
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.000
With it's still selected it is still selected.
107

108
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.960
Yes it is.
108

109
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.760
I can move it along the X axis again.
109

110
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:43.220
So I'm locking it to oo No not X. Y, yes the Y axis and lock it onto this face here the one right at
110

111
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.930
the front.
111

112
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.910
But I can also do that if it's not.
112

113
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.530
It doesn't seem to be working quite how I want it to.
113

114
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:55.070
In this case to just vertex once more because I can go G to move it Y to lock it to the Y axis and then
114

115
00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:00.740
I can snap it smack bang where I want it to.
115

116
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.050
Now it looks like it was never snapped quite to the right place in the first place.
116

117
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:11.730
So when I go G Z this time and snap it right down at the bottom thought I had it there but I obviously
117

118
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.660
didn't.
118

119
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.060
Okay.
119

120
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:19.570
So the next thing that I'm going to do here is grab these two edges at the top and do a similar thing.
120

121
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.420
In this case I'm going to go G lock it to the Y axis and move it along.
121

122
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.940
In fact I don't want it moving in the Z.
122

123
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.920
There we go that is exactly what I wanted.
123

124
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.770
Now these two here aren't quite lined up how I want them it actually be a bit higher but you know what
124

125
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.200
I'm going to let that slide.
125

126
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.830
That's the top bit done for me.
126

127
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:47.010
Let's move round to the bottom and once again there are a couple of options here and let's frame them
127

128
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.240
in.
128

129
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.600
Okay so there are a couple of ways that we could go about doing this.
129

130
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:58.860
I think the easiest one is to eyeball it and whizz round to the side and just extrude outwards.
130

131
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:05.290
And I'm going to extrude roughly the exact number to extrude by is about that actually.
131

132
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.890
It's going to be half of root two and root to is about one point four something.
132

133
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.920
So that's pretty much on the money.
133

134
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.670
And if we have a look here with just a little bit off so compressed G again and press Z to make sure
134

135
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:28.320
is moving along the normal still and get it lined up pretty much bang on and then these bottom two edges
135

136
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.150
if I'm still in the position to select both of them edge there.
136

137
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.010
And this one here we can lift them up.
137

138
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.190
If I go to this properties panel to where z equals zero.
138

139
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.570
And we can tell I was almost right there because that's a point five will be spot on.
139

140
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.250
Okay.
140

141
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.240
So there we go.
141

142
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.250
That is the bottom of my ramp.
142

143
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.560
Not too bad at all.
143

144
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.680
And that's starting to look pretty good.
