00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.200
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.270
In this lecture we're going to set up a few lights in our scene and see the fundamental difference that

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.730
cycles which we can see in front of us here gives us versus Evey.

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.160
So just quick rundown and we'll set up this scene in a few moments.

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.520
I move it around it is a life scene here.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.050
This is currently cycles.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.650
So it is a bit noisier.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.090
So it's got these speckles in it.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.950
That's one of the things that we'll cover in the upcoming lectures of how to minimize it.

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.640
At the moment in preview it doesn't really matter but in your final render it will do.

11
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.400
Okay so let's switch over to evening and see how it looks there.

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.880
Oh dear.

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.900
So what's going on here why is this not working.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.560
I mean it seems to have a light thing in the middle here.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.680
Well the light coming from this bulb in the center if we go to these cycles rendering engine this white

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.240
slash blue area here that is an immersive surface we switch over to evey we can kind of get a similar

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.650
effect coming from them.

18
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.290
First of all we can turn on Bloom now for want of a better description that can be a little bit annoying

19
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.030
in your scene and you can play with perhaps the intensity bring it down just a little.

20
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.010
It's just not over saturating of seen because why you want it can end up doing is making the whole scene

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.790
slightly dirty and murky rather than nice and crisp.

22
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.260
But what I've had to do in order to emulate cycles because the immersive surface here is actually add

23
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.480
another lighting.

24
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.960
And when I do that we do get something very similar to what we have before.

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.880
But it's required that extra bit of effort and the shadows aren't quite as soft as they would have been

26
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.320
otherwise.

27
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.110
There's been a lot of setup and tweaking to try and get it to resemble as close as I could to cycles.

28
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.200
And obviously it's still not quite there.

29
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.860
If we rendered this out fully it would look much better than eevee did.

30
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.920
And this is where it starts to really become apparent that you have to pick and choose your rendering

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.370
engine based upon the scene you're creating.

32
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:16.290
This is a scene that we're going to be focusing on lights and because it's only estimated in evey and

33
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.030
approximated rather than calculated like it is with cycles.

34
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.960
We have this tradeoff between having something that's really quick we can whizz around our scene and

35
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.750
using cycles and it being slower to get to the end point.

36
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.720
So let's go ahead and set this scene up now.

37
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.820
Okay.

38
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.010
So this is where we left it before the first thing I'm going to do is over in the render a Tab I'm going

39
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.860
to switch it from cycles CPE to GPO.

40
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.510
I forgot to do that and the last lecture so let's just save that there.

41
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.560
That's for me to make sure that the recording runs smoothly.

42
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.150
Now that I've got that sets up the next day I'm going to do is just switch over into rendered mode and

43
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.710
see what we have.

44
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.370
So currently we have all seen lit by a sun lamp which means if we switch between the two we get a very

45
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.620
similar outcome.

46
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.880
Sun lamps are supported in both of them.

47
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.520
Now I'm going to switch this over to cycles and leave it in cycles for a bit.

48
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.940
One of the things you may want to do just to speed up your computer as you're moving around is notice

49
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.870
the top left.

50
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.240
We've got path tracing sample and it's counting up to 32 over in our render a tab.

51
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.800
We have sampling and on the viewport it's set to 32.

52
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.170
So you may speed up your rendering slightly in terms of your viewport how quickly it's responding.

53
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.440
I can certainly tell very little difference.

54
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.410
After about twelve so let's set that down to it's 12 and that just means that we're not wasting energy

55
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.290
every time we move things around.

56
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.280
Yes a bit a bit rough around the edges and perhaps all need to turn it up again later but for the moment

57
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.500
setting around 12:00 would just mean the pupils a bit quicker let's go a bit more extreme let's go to

58
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.930
six.

59
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.170
You know what.

60
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.270
I didn't think that would be any good.

61
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.630
I think six is absolutely fine for the moment.

62
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.760
Again we can tweak it at any point and because we're playing in cycles do remember we're rendering all

63
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.710
the time and because we're rendering there is always a chance that blender will crash especially when

64
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.720
we're moving things around and changing settings.

65
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.430
So the first thing that I'm going to do is remove the sun lamp from the scene so I'm going to select

66
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.300
it in the outline.

67
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.180
I dunno where it is in the world and delete it.

68
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.600
And the reason why I don't know where it is in the world actually is because I've still got my overlays

69
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.370
turned off.

70
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.610
It's on the header bar of the 3D window I'm going to click on the overlays button and it's going to

71
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.670
bring back our 3D world so we can see where things are.

72
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.810
Okay.

73
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.990
I'm going to come out of cycles for a moment and have a closer look at our lamp.

74
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.700
I'm going to open up my tool shelf with the tiki grab my 3-D cursor and it will snap to the surface

75
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.280
of objects we can see that it is in the appropriate position if we collect there and what we're going

76
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.970
to do is we're going to add in a U V sphere.

77
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.730
We're going to scale it down massively.

78
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.550
We're going to move it on the y axis outcomes forward.

79
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.360
I'm gonna rotate it on the x axis 90 degrees so that's the polls are this way round that I'm just gonna

80
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.090
scale it's on the y axis to make it a more elongated bulb we can see there that's still a bit large

81
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.520
list tuned it down a little so and what we're going to do is this sphere here we're gonna find it and

82
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.910
we're going to call it a bulb this mesh object is going to emit light if we go over to the properties

83
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.020
editor and scroll down to our materials sets up we can add a new material to our bulb and I'm going

84
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.950
to call it light and then we're going to change the surface from print supposed to immersive so let's

85
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.170
go up emission now what will happen now is that we can zoom out slightly and this is gonna be the only

86
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.630
light source apart from the world itself which is a dark gray it's hardly contributing anything that

87
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.410
will be the only light source in our scene so let's go to rendered mode we can see it's lighting up

88
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.920
a small area in the material properties we have this parameter called strength if we turn that up to

89
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.650
maybe 100 it's supposed to represent wattage and we can see here straight away that we've now got a

90
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.800
shadow being cast from the cube itself from the platform and we've also got these other shadows being

91
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.970
cast as well that's pretty good and we've got all of these speckles in our scene these are also known

92
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:31.240
as fireflies They're just incomplete sampling we've only got six samples we've got to this stage now

93
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.910
I'm going to bump this up once again to maybe 200.

94
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.410
There we go.

95
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.070
So we've got a much better defined shadow on our cube.

96
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.970
Okay.

97
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.290
And we've got this shadow on the floor as well so that's looking good.

98
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.560
Okay.

99
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.450
So we have our bulbs set up I'm going to come back out into solid shaded mode and add into our scene

100
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.670
another type of light which is an area light.

101
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.470
Okay.

102
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.730
I'm going to go g x and move it out here G.

103
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.310
Z lift it up.

104
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.440
And then finally they rotate it round and this will be on the y axis.

105
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:09.100
So going to rotate it and I'm having a look in the top left it's going to be 45 degrees and I then probably

106
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.400
going to move it to the center of my scene around there.

107
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.510
Now if I turn on rendered tap again I can hide my bulb.

108
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.640
And now we're looking at just the lighting that's coming from this area lamp so we can increase the

109
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.860
power perhaps put it at 200 again we can see it's really lit up the scene there and also let's give

110
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.390
it a slight color to it.

111
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.190
So let's make it's an orange color.

112
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.560
That's always a good thing to do.

113
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.360
Let's turn the bulb back on.

114
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.310
I'm going to go to the bulb itself and make it a blue color so we know where the lighting is coming

115
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.560
from both OK.

116
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.840
That's pretty good.

117
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.580
But with this sets up like this we've no longer got a shadow being cast because this light is overpowering

118
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.280
it so we can come back in and we can tweak these we can make it 500.

119
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.500
We could make it eight hundred.

120
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.510
You can see there keeps going up.

121
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.370
I don't think setting it quite that high is the solution here.

122
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.150
I think we're just going to make our area lamp which if I go back to selection mode rather than moving

123
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.010
the 3d cursor I can just tone down this maybe back to 100 watts that's much better.

124
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.660
Okay.

125
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:21.190
So we've got everything set up like this let's say Okay it looks good lighting wise what happens if

126
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:28.120
we switch over to Evey and we go back to this dull effect so we can see here that in fact area lamps

127
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.270
do work in evey side got that bit wrong earlier.

128
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.060
And the reason why is because if you turn bloom on it sorts it out and then if you turn blue off.

129
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.940
Well unfortunately unless you come in and out again it doesn't correct itself and we can see here we

130
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.280
can move the area lamp around accordingly.

131
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.830
It's a brilliant area lamps are working in evey now which is great to know but we're not getting any

132
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.910
light from this bulb here.

133
00:08:52.930 --> 00:09:00.160
So with the bulb selected if we wanted to imitate this we could go ahead shift s and move the cursor

134
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.850
to selected which is going to place the 3d cursor at the center of the origin of our bulb and then we

135
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:13.830
can go shift in a and and in a light just the point lights because that's essentially what we're imitating.

136
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.700
And then we have to go into our lamp properties increase the power a little bit.

137
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.510
There we go.

138
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.630
So we've got a bit of a shadow being cast here so around 60 watts seems to do it.

139
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:31.360
Now we could tweak our radius etc. But I think at the moment what we're lacking here is the shadow properties.

140
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.930
So if we go down to the parameter of clip star we need to lower that down to a lot less.

141
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.380
So here we go.

142
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.740
Not too low.

143
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:46.000
Let's bring it back up again so you can see here we're having to play quite significantly to get the

144
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.230
right type of shadowing which is a bit of a nuisance really because it just works in cycles.

145
00:09:52.300 --> 00:10:00.460
So you can see here how the time spent tweaking eevee to try and replicate cycles is actually eating

146
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.770
up into our design time at the moment but we'll carry on we'll go and add contact shadows in and we

147
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.960
can see we've got a bit more along the bottom here.

148
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:14.050
We can turn up the softness of these shadows as well they are much much softer on cycles and of course

149
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.360
we can change things like the exponent here to perhaps make it just a bit smoother between them and

150
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.100
I think that's fine for the moment in terms of just replicating what we have there.

151
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:32.100
Couple of things that I would do at this point is I would parent the bulb itself to our lamp so control

152
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:39.070
and P parent that and I'd also grab the point lamp that we just created and parent it to the bulb.

153
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.410
Now the bulb itself is now hidden under the lamp so I can select them like that control them pay.

154
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.630
There we go there now.

155
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.270
All parents.

156
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:54.680
Which means if I move this they all move along with its okay so the downside here is if we go from cycles

157
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.520
to evey what we have to watch out for all that said this is a blue as well.

158
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.130
So we get a similar effect.

159
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:07.580
What we need to watch out for is as we go to cycles we don't necessarily want this extra point light

160
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.940
showing so we'll need to make sure that we turn off which we can quite easily do but clicking the eye

161
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.730
only turns off in the viewport blender has now introduced this filter system at the very top of the

162
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.380
outline.

163
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.430
So we've got options here.

164
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.830
We can exclude from the view layer.

165
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.930
So it just disappears entirely.

166
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.830
We can make it selectable or non selectable which is really useful if you've got a dense collection

167
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.560
of objects or lots on top of one another.

168
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.720
We can toggle whether it's visible in the viewport.

169
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:42.270
We can say whether it appears in renders as well which is this camera icon.

170
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:49.210
So we can change and add all of these settings or less of them by just ticking on these boxes.

171
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.350
I'll put the camera one on because that's going to be really useful because what we don't want is whilst

172
00:11:54.350 --> 00:12:00.110
we may want it appearing in the scene so it's visible to us we don't want it appearing in the final

173
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.550
render.

174
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.460
So we can actually hide it by clicking on the camera icon.

175
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.620
Then when we render things in cycles it won't appear very good.

176
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.730
But the thing we have to remember is if we do a test render an Eevee it will actually appear.

177
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:20.600
So there's a double edged sword that you need to stay on top of these things and perhaps arrange a hierarchy

178
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.280
in a slightly different order or put things in a couple of multiple collections so you can turn off

179
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.220
evey extra lights as you go.

180
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.560
And here we go we get to a very similar position as we were at the very beginning of the video and this

181
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.590
will give you a much better appreciation of things like area lamps of a massive surfaces.

182
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.160
You can have them in cycles and they behave as you would expect them to.

183
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:50.420
However to replicate the scene in eevee you're going to have the extra workload to make sure things

184
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.620
behave as you'd expect them to.

185
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.690
And with that in mind it's time for a quick challenge.

186
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:05.130
OK so your challenge is to set up a bulb using geometry within a missing material in your lamp.

187
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.940
Now you might want to make your bulb a little more all night.

188
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.420
We'll just leave it as a sphere.

189
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:15.840
Essentially we're not going to be looking really at that's eventually are our lamp itself is not going

190
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.020
to be hollow like it is at the moment is actually going to be a cone.

191
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.340
Or of course whatever you design your lamp to be.

192
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.670
But at the moment sets up a bulb using geometry and an immersive material.

193
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:33.120
So when we render it in cycles we can see that it looks really really nice and create additional lighting

194
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.920
for your scene.

195
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:41.220
So remove the sun lamp like I've already done and use area lamps or point lamps in your scene so that

196
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.510
you've got additional lights that don't overwhelm we want the lamp itself to be the poignant light we

197
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.280
want it to be the brightest but we do need to see the rest of the scene.

198
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.140
Otherwise it would just leave our audience guessing.

199
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.380
So go ahead pause video now and give that a go.

200
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.550
Okay everybody Welcome back.

201
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.450
Let's go ahead now and just finish off our scene.

202
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.490
OK so we've gotten along quite fast so far.

203
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.060
I'm going to tweak my area lamp that I've got here now because I want to swap backwards and forwards

204
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.370
between cycles and even you may think oh I just use a point light source.

205
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:25.640
But the one thing to remember is that the lighting will be dramatically different between the two as

206
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.900
we've already experienced in the past.

207
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.340
So it's probably best that we leave things right in cycles and just approximate elsewhere.

208
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.590
So you've kind of got this blue orange thing going on and you don't have to follow along with the orange

209
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.950
blue sort of country colors going on sometimes blue and pink can work really well as well.

210
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:51.530
If you trying to do the 80s neon vibe or of course different lighting more natural lighting as well.

211
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.150
So this I'm going to grab and just move along here.

212
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:03.050
Ever so slightly and I'm going to use the trackable method suppressing the Archy twice to make it face

213
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:10.160
off seen I'm going to duplicate that but with Alton D so I have another lamp with exactly the same properties

214
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.930
place it over here.

215
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.310
And again I'm going to move it towards our subjects.

216
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.910
So our scene is quite evenly lit.

217
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.330
Moving around that's looking good and I'm going to switch over to evey really quick to see what the

218
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.120
stage looks like there looks pretty good to me.

219
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.300
So we can see here that that point light source is adding a lot in eevee.

220
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.660
It's not doing too much in cycles.

221
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.190
And the reason for that is just turning it on and off you can see there's very little difference in

222
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.130
fact this face of the cube gets lit a bit more but other than that there's very little difference.

223
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.750
And the reason for that is the point light source in evey is much much brighter than it would be in

224
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.990
cycles.

225
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:54.990
So there we go that's all set up and ready to rock and roll brilliant.

226
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.090
Well how did your scene end up.

227
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:02.600
Please show your basic lit scenes over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
