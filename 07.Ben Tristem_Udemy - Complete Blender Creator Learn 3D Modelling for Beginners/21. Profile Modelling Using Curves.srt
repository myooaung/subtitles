00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,830
Welcome to profile modelling using curb's in this video.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,080
You'll create some alternative detail convert mesh objects into curve objects.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:22,230
Then use two curves to create geometry along and then use those two curves to create geometry one controlling

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,000
the profile.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,660
The other path will see that this is great for a more accurate path following.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,450
So let's hop straight on over into a blender.

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay so we're back over in blender and the first thing before we move onto the curves I notice wind

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,400
spinning around my model.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,760
It looks a bit odd at the top here and when I say went all the way round I saw that I've got crossed

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,000
over geometry.

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,590
I think when I was scaling I've inadvertently managed to push the model through itself.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,930
Now whether or not that's going to have a massive impact on the end of production it probably will.

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,140
So now I spotted that mistake I will have to go back and correct that.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,660
Make sure you check your models over and make sure that you haven't pushed any geometry through itself.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,610
I didn't spin round so I didn't see it.

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,180
I was just looking from the area that looked good unfortunately.

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,080
But there we go.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,590
So let's move on to Curves themselves so first of all I'm going to select this object the window frame

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,290
that we've made and I'm going to duplicate it because I'm going to use the same profile that I've already

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:33,040
created to generate the next curve and then going to hide the original window frame hop into here and

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:39,710
I'm going to call this window frame profile curve for the moment so I know exactly what it is.

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,070
Once I've done that I'm going to hop into edit mode and remove all the unnecessary geometry.

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,280
Now you can limit vertices to a visible if you want to with the toggle on the 3d edita header.

24
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,020
I do prefer using the wireframe mode because then its really is explicit that you're going to be able

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,150
to select items through your model.

26
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,340
I'm going to go here and grab and we can see the mess at the top there and then go and grab these top

27
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,660
vertices here and deletes those and then I'm going to grab the ones down here as well and get rid of

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,150
those.

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,470
And that leaves me with the profile itself.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,980
But this is a mesh profile at the moment so what we can do is hop into object mode and go to object

31
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,300
and convert.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,370
And that's right at the top here.

33
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,630
Convert to curve and obviously have so convert curve so curve from mesh.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,140
And here we have old C..

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,760
Just to remind you what that is.

36
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,360
So now it is a curve object.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,100
I do not want to keep the original.

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,470
In this case I'm a believer untaped and that will remember the last setting you had so if I had kept

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,860
one before then it would still be there.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,110
The next thing that I want to do is generate a curve.

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,090
Now I could go through creating a curve and lifting it up and through.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,580
Now one of the things that you can do is obviously duplicate this edge that runs around here and use

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,440
that as a curve.

44
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,710
So lets go and try that.

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:09,400
Now lets go ahead and go to the appropriate model and hide the other one is well from the scene or is

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,660
done automatically.

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,540
On a different.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay so lets go ahead and copied to edit mode.

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,310
Select the edges we want to be used for a path which are these outer ones here.

50
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,970
Once those are selected we go going to duplicate them.

51
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,640
We are going to separate them.

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,940
And there we go we've got here and I'm going to call this curve.

53
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,160
I suppose I should call it window frame path because that's what it's going to become.

54
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,450
Now in object mode I can use Oulton see.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,720
And once again convert from a mesh to occur.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,640
Well again I don't want to create.

57
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,770
Keep the original.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,100
So let's go and see how this works out so we need to give the path a bevel to go around.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:01,470
So whilst the path is selected we can hit the curve data and down here we can bevel it around that particular

60
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,740
object and in this case we can use the profile curve.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,950
There we go we end up with a very similar curve as we did before of a help out of wireframe.

62
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,010
Ah ha.

63
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,650
You will see here that the normals are in fact the wrong way around.

64
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,280
No we're not going to deal with that right at this moment.

65
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,880
How would just have a quick look around the rest of the model first before sorting those out.

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,730
Let's just check that that's right does that fit the curve.

67
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,470
It doesn't look quite right in the middle is something missing.

68
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,810
Ah okay.

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,690
So when I selected the outline originally from the window frame it looks like I've missed the bit.

70
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,950
It hasn't come back out here at all and it should have done or is it inside the model.

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,950
Okay so there is a rotation going on here now.

72
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:55,140
It's a rotation of the path itself even though it's a line in 3-d space.

73
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,970
It has rotation.

74
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:05,040
So what we can do is hop in to the path's rotation so go and go into edit mode for the path itself and

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:13,380
we can see is there a select all of them and change the mean tilt which you can see here over in the

76
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,720
propertys panel of the 3D editor and that will twist it along that path looks kind of funky obviously.

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,490
If you keep going round and round and round if I hop out of wireframe married we can see that as we

78
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,720
tilt that round it then appears the right way.

79
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,730
So at this point I think it's going to be minus 90 to put it in the right place.

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,410
No more than that.

81
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,390
Oh that's mine as tight the right number in is it minus 90.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,760
No that looks wrong let's try 90 that looks right.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,220
And of course at this point if we wanted something the other side which we haven't done yet.

84
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,770
If I wanted something the other side could apply a mirror modifier.

85
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,150
Now I have in this the do I have the mirror plain.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,140
Was that the doorway.

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,830
I don't seem to have a mirror plain here so I'm going to try mirroring our round.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,610
Nope none of these options are going to be good enough Sard have to create an empty and mirror around

89
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:12,700
that.

90
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,550
I'm going to do that at the moment but there we go that's a nice and simple path.

91
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:23,350
The normals are the wrong way round and that will be generated from this profile curve itself that means

92
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,150
the normals of this curve are in fact the wrong way round so we can sort that out now.

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,290
Now we can convert this to a mesh objects and flip the normals.

94
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,550
We know how to do that.

95
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,530
However we can also change the direction that this curve is being generated.

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,210
It is the profile one that's causing this.

97
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:46,300
Normal inflection and we might not want to remove the curve object from the actual blend file for various

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,370
reasons.

99
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,960
So in this case we can flip those by selecting all of the points along the curve.

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,940
The profile curve and then go into curve going to curve segments and switch direction and there we go.

101
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,340
That has been reflected of course at this point.

102
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,290
We can play with the resolution of the curve so we've got a couple of resolution points here.

103
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,780
We've got the one that follows.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,640
It's round and we can't really make that any sharper than it already is without manually editing it.

105
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,070
And we got the profile itself so we can go in here and change the preview for both of those.

106
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,100
It doesn't get any better by changing the profile curve because it's already got as many segments as

107
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,980
it needs and the window path.

108
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,360
Well let's just try changing that.

109
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,270
And surprisingly or unsurprisingly it doesn't make a difference either.

110
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,670
And that's because the path is fixed at certain points.

111
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,910
There is no bend.

112
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,670
So changing the resolution doesn't matter.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,040
However turning smooth shading on can help it look much better.

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,050
Brilliant.

115
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,740
And of course it's time for a challenge.

116
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:02,570
I would like you to create some curve driven geometry try using a bevel curve on your other models and

117
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,080
remember to share your work.

118
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,790
In the discussions pause the video now and give that a go.

119
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay guys.

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,390
Welcome back.

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,590
Let's go straight back over into blender.

122
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,620
Sunday is going to make sure I've saved my work here so I'm going to go file save and then I'm going

123
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,620
to go to my door and demonstrate a similar thing on the door.

124
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,160
So get a copy the archway and see a group get of that perfect.

125
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,080
And name its arch.

126
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,200
Way.

127
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,410
This is going to be profile or convert that to a curve in a moment.

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Now I'm going to do V.

129
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,250
Elodie door as well and select.

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,050
Excellent.

131
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,510
I could just select the edgeley there it's got all of the information I need yet.

132
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,640
So let's duplicate that.

133
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,210
Separate that.

134
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:03,360
And there we go we have it down here and I'm going to call that arch way all path.

135
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,860
Okay so now that we've got the archway path and the archway profile we need to sort out the profile

136
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,330
itself.

137
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,100
So it is an actual single profile of entire work so let's pop in.

138
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,580
And of course it's myriad.

139
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,130
So this is going to be even quicker we can just select those there.

140
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,160
In fact if I hop into a wire frame and make it even easier to select everything x for the LEA and legal

141
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,630
vs. no case so let's hide away the front door archway that we've created.

142
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,540
There we go.

143
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,120
And we should now be able to convert.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,660
That's all.

145
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,430
There's one the other side as well.

146
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,920
That is the mirror modifier going to hide that to prevent myself getting confused or in fact in this

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,290
case I can will just remove it altogether.

148
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,050
Okay so now I've got a hunger to leave the subsurface modifier hidden for the moment.

149
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,890
I'm just going to see how much of a difference that can make as well.

150
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,350
So I've got my profile ready.

151
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,410
Let's go ahead and convert that into a curve and the same with the archway path as well.

152
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,020
So now those two items are done.

153
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:20,020
We can go straight into the PAFF curve data scrolled down to the bevell object as like the archway profile.

154
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,440
Now is it the right way around.

155
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,500
And are the normals the right way.

156
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,500
Normals are the wrong way.

157
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,270
But this time the archway itself has actually been generated the right way round which saves me a lot

158
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,470
of time faffing.

159
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:44,250
The only thing I need to do here is go to the profile itself and go to oh don't edit mode curve segments

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,730
switch direction.

161
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,240
And that is sorted.

162
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,630
It's gone all the way over.

163
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,600
Let's just see if the subsidies surface division makes any difference whatsoever.

164
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,490
I don't think it will.

165
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,540
So let's go to the PAFF itself add a subset.

166
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,350
The always made quite a bit of difference that helps smooth out the archway really nicely.

167
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,390
A pleasant surprise there of course.

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,830
This one's actually got the mirror objects inside can go one step further on this particular model and

169
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,640
mirror it around my mirror point.

170
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,190
And now my all he says needs to be on the y axis that we do not be x.

171
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,060
Okay.

172
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,650
And there we go we've got vads in roughly the right place now it looks like ah okay the mirror object

173
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,120
is not really in the right place doing this is to be in the middle of the door itself so I'm going to

174
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,460
go ahead and grab the mirror.

175
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:44,720
And in its location transform on the properties I think it's going to have to be minus point one.

176
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,690
Location.

177
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,300
So minus point one.

178
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,170
There we go.

179
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,620
Now the archway is on both sides of the door.

180
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,340
Interestingly here is that's.

181
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,980
Yeah.

182
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:04,930
There's a little bit of a dent here where it's being constructed but that's okay that adds to the detail

183
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,750
in the door itself that is coming along really well.

184
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,270
How are your models coming along.

185
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,520
I'd love to see them please share them in the discussions so everybody can see what you're up to in

186
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,570
your designs.

187
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,060
If you're going for an alternative style I love seeing those as well.

188
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,260
If you're not following along with the Gothic church what are you doing.

189
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,840
I can't wait to see it.

190
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,060
So remember to share them in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
