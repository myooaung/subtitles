00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,760
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to have a look at textures and explain

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,030
pretty much what a texture is.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,230
Now in this particular case we've got some tiles in front of us and you may recognize some of the types

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,250
of texture I'm about to show you.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,940
So this is just a series of tiles and it's a tiling pattern.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,890
So it means that if we repeat it lots it should be seamless.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,790
We shouldn't necessarily see where things join together.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,610
However you'll see later on in this section if you abuse that you still see repeating patterns our brains

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,600
are very good at noticing that.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,370
And this one here.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,610
Well this is a normal map and you're probably familiar with this.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,240
They've been around for absolutely ages.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,560
We'll go into more detail of all of these maps as we progressed through this section.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,570
This one here I believe this is a roughness map.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,650
So it shows where things are rough and where they are smooth.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,450
We'll have a look at a little bit more detail in this picture.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,950
And a lot more detail later on.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,920
So our textures just images.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,250
Well no they're not just images.

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,930
They are a map of bits.

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,640
In fact you may recall the name bitmap which is essentially it's a map of bits.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,700
Now the most simplest one would be a single pixel.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,810
So just one individual pixel would be a tiny image but it could represent a 1 or a 0.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,140
That's the lowest bit depth you could possibly have.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,710
But you can have more bit depth and the more bit depth you have the more of a graduation you can have

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,080
between black and white.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,100
So then you end up with gray scale.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,150
Now typically a lot of the images would deal with the images your basic camera will take are typically

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,790
8 bit images.

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:56,820
Now while lots of modern smart phones and some modern cameras can take a higher bit rate than that and

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,360
that means they've got more data in them.

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,560
The more data means the more you control using the images.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,900
Now a word on this eight bit thing here.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,590
Most people's monitors are typically these days eight bits.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,630
So that's absolutely brilliant news if you've got a relatively modern monitor it's going to be 8 bits.

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,100
Now if you've got a really fancy monitor it may even be HDR or Dolby Vision compatible.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
And that means you're going to be able to see a lot more colors.

38
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,710
If you've ever seen some graduation where it looks like it should be a very smooth gradient but it's

39
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,730
not and you end up with lines going across as it slowly transitions between light and dark.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,970
That's the bit depth essentially if it's not got enough bit depth.

41
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,600
It will look like it's in stages rather than a smooth transition.

42
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,490
You will not be able to see a 10 bit image properly on an eight bit screen.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,650
That's unfortunate.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,450
If you have one a very modern TV that's got HDR or Dolby Vision that will be able to show you 10 or

45
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,210
12 bit depth images absolutely phenomenal being able to see them.

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,540
I don't have access to that unfortunately I'd love to but it is absolutely amazing the type of dynamic

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,010
range and if you ever download an image that's for your world so you can place your models in a realistic

48
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,440
lighting setting.

49
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,550
Those are often high bit depth images.

50
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,480
Now they can have multiple channels.

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,170
So if we take a one channel image then that's often that is just grayscale.

52
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,230
It will be from zero to one.

53
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,810
So black being nothing white being one and therefore everything.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,690
And in this case it would be gray scale depending on the bit that would depend on how smooth that gray

55
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,650
scale is.

56
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,590
Now three channels now that's often going to be color.

57
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,440
So your normal maps will fall into that your diffuse maps or your albedo maps whatever you want to call

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,050
them red green and blue channels.

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,770
Now occasionally and we'll come across this in the fluffy bunny section when we use textures with transparency.

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,640
Well the fourth channel can be used to add transparency to color so it can be quite confusing because

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,330
you may see that an image is 24 bits but what it actually means is it's three channels of eight bits

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,680
and a 32 bit image might be you're catching on here.

63
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,580
It may be red green blue and Alpha.

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,680
It doesn't mean that the bit depth is 32 bit.

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,460
It means that in this case it's got four channels of eight bits.

66
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,290
So you can get some very very large images extra bit depth equals extra storage space required.

67
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,380
Now I've mentioned these standard ways of using it but technically you could use the channels how you

68
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:58,740
likes you could store different information on each one and being able to control different things blenders

69
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,450
got an incredibly detailed notes system will allow you to strip the channels into individual grayscale

70
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,770
images essentially and be able to control different things with them which is incredibly useful to do

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,070
now the final thing here is resolution.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,470
Now you.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,220
You okay.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,810
So resolution here is the final thing.

75
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,900
You've probably all heard of resolution your screen in front of you will have a resolution it be so

76
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,490
many pixels across by so many pixels down on the X and Y.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:37,750
A typical 10 ATP screen is 1920 so 1920 pixels across by 1080 down.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,320
Now that's the quantity of those bits.

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,690
Obviously they can have various bit depths as well and they're arranged in that grid which is absolutely

80
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,270
fine.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,900
Sides are typically a power of two.

82
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,610
I'm not going to dwell in detail in this lecture about the power of two.

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,240
It doesn't have to be a square image it can be a rectangular image but simply you will see things like

84
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,420
256 by 256 or 512 by 512 or 1024 by 2024 etc..

85
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,500
Now you will notice that's also in line if you know anything about computers with things like memory

86
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,400
and everything else.

87
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,520
And there's a good reason for that.

88
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,350
Basically graphics cards work far better if they have a power of 2.

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,550
It also allows in your games etc. for something called MIP mapping which is not something we're going

90
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,990
to cover in this course but it's probably something you've seen when playing around in a game engine

91
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,680
so they can be just images.

92
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,070
I'd like to circle back around so well is it just images.

93
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,370
But it can also be procedural.

94
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,450
So blender has a great wealth of procedural ability.

95
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,750
So basically you can create anything you like providing you link certain nodes together and it does

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,870
get increasingly complex.

97
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,250
Now we're not going to dive into a lot of detail with procedural textures will touch upon them in this

98
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,880
course.

99
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,130
And I think we've used some actually over on the chess set when we were making the board.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,910
But if you do want to know more of course we've got our environments course which does do a huge deep

101
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,330
dive into procedural texturing and how it can be used on your model.

102
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,520
So if you're really into that do check out the other course now map types where's map types come from

103
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,850
a heap say well mapping is what we do when we apply a texture to the surface of the model.

104
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:32,100
So these are often also referred to when when an image is used as a texture is often called a map.

105
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,870
Now there are different names for that base colour diffuse or albedo.

106
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,620
That is the colour of the objects.

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,700
Now depending on the game engine you're using it may call it different things height.

108
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,370
Well that's simply a grayscale image with black being the lowest points and white being the highest

109
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,260
points.

110
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,950
We'll dive into these map types in a lot more detail as we start using them as well.

111
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,320
So this is just an overview of what's going on.

112
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,980
We've got our normal map which shows us the direction that's a red green blue.

113
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,920
It's purposely in colour but it will have three channels to it being vector values.

114
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,520
Now metal on and spectacular these aren't names that can just be interchanged they are often not 100

115
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,870
percent but they are often inverse of one another metal.

116
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,360
This is how metallic surfaces.

117
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,390
It's a physical property and therefore is often used in the PBR workflow and then we've got spectacular

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,810
how shiny surfaces and the colour at which the lights will be reflected off.

119
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,530
That's not physically accurate however is another way of working with your textures roughness now roughness

120
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,780
is basically is something smooth or is it rough the smoother it is the shinier it's going to be the

121
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,530
more reflective it will be.

122
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,550
And again this is part of the PBR workflow because as you get to a tight angle on something that's shiny

123
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,500
it reflects more and more.

124
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,690
And if you crank the roughness all the way down to zero you essentially get yourself a mirror up and

125
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,780
then we have our ambient occlusion so basically areas that are in shadow not having a shadow cast upon

126
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,700
them but if Light was being shown on the surface from every direction.

127
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,870
What areas would be naturally occluded crevices cracks in pavements etc. as you'll see in a moment will

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,200
often be exaggerated or have ambient occlusion so make them look more realistic.

129
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,350
Displacement is quite an advance the map type you can have individual displacement which is essentially

130
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,780
the heights map or you can have what's called vector displacement vector displacement we are not going

131
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,450
to be covering in this course it can get quite complex it's very exciting but we're not going to delve

132
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:49,650
into the details of it however we will use height based displacement as we move through final one here

133
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,170
I wanted to touch on it's not really a texture that you'd see but it's a texture that controls where

134
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,970
things are and where they aren't.

135
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,620
It's called a mask and on the on the basics you could have a white and black mask showing you a brick

136
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,580
texture on one and a paint texture on another and you can make it look like the paint is starting to

137
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,960
wear off and showing the brick underneath but just having a black and white one wouldn't do you probably

138
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,070
want a gray scale so you could fade the paint in announced try and make it look a little bit more realistic.

139
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,650
Now each one of these by themselves doesn't add to a very convincing image.

140
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,640
However when you combine them magic really does happen it's amazing when you get your diffuse texture

141
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:41,490
and you start putting it in with the normal and height and the roughness automatically your texture

142
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,890
looks so much more raw life it's amazing the difference these textures make and they say if you work

143
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,730
modelling that detail that's half the point behind them.

144
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,330
Now let's have a look at a couple examples before we move on.

145
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,960
So in front of us here this is the base colour map.

146
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:03,900
These are all of the same objects and then we have a figure this is the tiled or bricked surface.

147
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,540
Then we've got our normal map.

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,080
Now I thought this was the height map originally it's not this is the height map down here with the

149
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,410
dark hair is being low down and that obviously be in the crevices there and the gray areas being higher

150
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:16,630
up.

151
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,020
Notice there's not a big difference between the darker areas and lighter areas when it comes to the

152
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,430
height map.

153
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,540
That's kind of important.

154
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,060
If you make it too big you can end up with quite an exaggerated height map and it just looks wrong if

155
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,100
that's the case.

156
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,510
This one here is our roughness map and then we have this.

157
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:42,720
Oh this is ambient occlusion in the crevices are black basically and the everything else is white and

158
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,330
you can see that's quite a large area of contrast in comparison to some of the other ones here.

159
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,520
Let's have a look at a final one it's kind of a leather armor.

160
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,330
In this particular case this is our base.

161
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,960
This one here is our normal map it's got a lot more detail in it.

162
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,880
This is the height map so it's in a slightly different order this time around but we've got three at

163
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,470
the bottom here.

164
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,240
Well one of them is the ambient occlusion that's our first one here.

165
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:19,470
Then we have our roughness pretty uniform but you can see how the edges here have ended up being quite

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,130
all white quite light indicating that the edges of something are rough but the rest of it's quite smooth

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,570
pretty awesome.

168
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,120
And this one here is technically a mask.

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,570
In many ways because it is black and white like we were talking about we can see that these areas as

170
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,000
a white are probably these metal studs works in the leather armor itself.

171
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,860
Now what is happening here.

172
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,400
Well these are the metal.

173
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,060
It's saying that these ones here are metal and anywhere that's black is not metal.

174
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,170
So effectively it's not only a mask but it's also a metal map or a metal honest map.

175
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,810
Now these textures that I've shown you here are ones that I have gone to textures dot.com and downloaded.

176
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,540
I've got no affiliation with textures.

177
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,860
Dot com is just a great place you get 15 free credits every day that you can download and you can just

178
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,620
use and download textures experiment with.

179
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,420
I'll make sure there's a link in this lecture.

180
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,530
So you could go off and check that out if you've not seen it before.

181
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,580
But there are plenty other places you can get textures from and you can even make your own if you want.

182
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,240
Right.

183
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,850
So that's a overview there of textures themselves.

184
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,010
And we'll start playing with them and seeing how they affect in the next lecture.
