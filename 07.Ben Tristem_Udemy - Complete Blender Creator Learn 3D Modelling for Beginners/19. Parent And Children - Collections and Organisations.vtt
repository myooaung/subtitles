Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on parents and children.
1

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.210
As you can see the scene in front of us is what we're going to be working towards.
2

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.910
And if we have a look there are all of these lines going from the pieces to the board itself.
3

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.140
And if we select only the board and then move it around you will see that all of the pieces move along
4

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.990
with it.
5

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
That means that all of these pieces are children of the board itself.
6

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.270
So let's go start setting this up now and find out more.
7

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.200
OK so we'll start with the default scene here and then we'll start creating our chess scene itself.
8

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.650
So we have in front of us a camera a cube and a light.
9

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.450
And these are all objects.
10

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.770
They can be parented to one another and how we do that is let's say we select the camera noticed that's
11

12
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.480
it's bright orange.
12

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.280
If we then shift and select the cube it goes dark orange meaning its selected but not the active item.
13

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.520
Now the cube is the active item because it's that light orange.
14

15
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.790
Now we can go to the object menu go down to parents and you see we've got a load of options here.
15

16
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.760
But basically we want the top one just the parent it to the objects.
16

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.260
So if we select object and then make sure you click objects again we can see that the operator panel
17

18
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.660
says make parents we can open that up and we can keep the transform if necessary.
18

19
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.040
And we'll see in a moment with the Bishop why that might be necessary but for the moment these two are
19

20
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.620
now parented together and you can see this dotted line going from our camera to our cube.
20

21
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.940
You can turn these off under the overlays options if you want to and turn off relationship lines as
21

22
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.030
we get more and more pieces in our scene.
22

23
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.040
We're going to have 32 pieces in total.
23

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.290
It can get a bit crowded with all of these relationship lines turned on so you may want to turn it off
24

25
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.490
for simplicity.
25

26
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.890
I'm going to leave them on for the moment so I can see these two objects apparently.
26

27
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.750
Now what this means is that the camera is now a child of the cube which means if we move the cube around
27

28
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.640
the camera will follow it.
28

29
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.780
However if we move the camera around the child it will not affect its parent and actually very very
29

30
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.930
useful whenever we are creating a hierarchy which we are certainly doing with the chess set itself.
30

31
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.330
Now at the moment you cannot really see there's no affordance other than this dotted line that
31

32
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.220
these two are connected.
32

33
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.450
If we have a look over in the outline however we can change the view type itself from view layer to
33

34
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.410
scenes.
34

35
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.440
If we change it to scenes we get a hierarchy of everything that's in the scene and we open up that we
35

36
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.120
see that we've got objects in our scene.
36

37
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.100
If we open up that we see that we've got a cube in our scene and a light.
37

38
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.700
But where's the camera.
38

39
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.380
The camera is now nested under our cube and we can see here there it is the other way that you can parent
39

40
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.060
things is by clicking and dragging them on top of other items in here.
40

41
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.580
So for instance the light itself I can parent that to the cube as well by clicking and dragging it over
41

42
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.400
the top of the cube and letting go and it's now also parented which means that the lights and the camera
42

43
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.580
now follow that piece wherever it moves however they can still move independent of one another.
43

44
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.050
Now you can just have a stronger hierarchy if you wanted.
44

45
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.920
So if the camera and lighting were set up in such a way you could link it together.
45

46
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.980
So no matter where you place it you're seeing the camera and lighting were consistent.
46

47
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.220
And this is great if you're showing off your model.
47

48
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.260
So what we could do here is parent the lights to the camera.
48

49
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.880
And again I'm going to do this by clicking and dragging and there we go we can now see the relationship
49

50
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.470
line has moved.
50

51
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.060
Occasionally you're going to have to just go No I don't want this parented into anything else anymore
51

52
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.340
and we can also see that's under the object menu under parent.
52

53
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.590
We've got the option here to clear parent.
53

54
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.270
Now what I've not done yet is used any of the shortcut keys so we could use alt and P to clear the parents.
54

55
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.330
It will bring up this menu and we can clear the parents.
55

56
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.010
We can also then reapply the parent by making sure the objects are selected and then go and control
56

57
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.270
and P and selecting objects or objects and keep transform you've always got the option to do that
57

58
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.670
at the same time.
58

59
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.190
Finally you can select multiple items and then select your final item and parent multiple children to
59

60
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.670
the same object as you can see there if you change an object's parent it just overrides what was there
60

61
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.020
previously.
61

62
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.930
So let's start this up for real now let's go into a new blender file.
62

63
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.880
I'm going to call this chess scene.
63

64
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.220
This is going to be where we're going to import all of our pieces.
64

65
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.270
So the chess scene save blender file I'm going to delete my cube from this scene I'm then going to go
65

66
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:03.400
ahead and append the objects I need into the scene so we can go to file append and find the appropriate
66

67
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.420
models or you can go to your file system itself.
67

68
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:15.010
This is pretty awesome find your files and duh der duh where are we repos blender remaster chess sets and
68

69
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.570
what we can do here is if you've got your blend pieces we can just click and drag them into our scene.
69

70
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.380
So you'd be in your three, 3D view here.
70

71
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.490
You would select your models and let's drag the board in and when we go ahead and drag the board in
71

72
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.490
it gives us a series of options.
72

73
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.000
Either link or append or open it's in this case I want to append it.
73

74
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.500
Now we get our list of things that we want to append and I'm just going to append in my object.
74

75
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
So in this case just the chessboard I don't need the lights or camera.
75

76
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.680
Obviously it's very small.
76

77
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.060
I'm going to press the number pad full stop or period key to zoom into it and then we can quickly put
77

78
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.780
it on shaded mode or Look Dev mode to see the object there.
78

79
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.290
Brilliant.
79

80
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.290
Now I'm going to do exactly the same thing but this time with the bishop and when we drag the bishop
80

81
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.740
in and append that and go to object and just append in the bishop itself you'll notice that the notch
81

82
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.000
comes along with it because it's integral to our model.
82

83
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.600
Now we're not going to apply that modifier just yet but we will now move this into the appropriate location.
83

84
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.410
So let's have a look at its position in the world so making sure just this one objects is selected we
84

85
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.510
can see here its at 0 0 0 and it's placed it on the right place.
85

86
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.760
All we have to do is move it on this horizontal axis rather than the vertical.
86

87
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.740
And I've been playing with these I think this is nine not nine metres nine centimetres okay.
87

88
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.330
So this is the first thing this is a new file let's just make sure that we can have the settings that
88

89
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.880
we want so I'm going to go to my scene settings go to my units and making sure it's in metric for me
89

90
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.620
if you're working in different that's fine I'm going to go to centimeters and save my file and then
90

91
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.180
when we're moving things around they're going to be moving correctly and this I think is twenty one.
91

92
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.800
There we go.
92

93
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.610
So our bishops now in the right place but Oh no the Notch has not followed Okay so we've forgotten
93

94
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.380
to parent the notch to the bishop.
94

95
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.410
That's because we didn't know about parenting.
95

96
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.510
So let's just undo that move from place it back to where it was.
96

97
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.110
Let's parent the notch to our bishop control and P done.
97

98
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.290
Now let's go ahead and parent the bishop to the board.
98

99
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.190
Control and P done.
99

100
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.720
We should now find that when we move the board the bishop moves along with it.
100

101
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.910
When we move the bishop the notch moves along with it.
101

102
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.070
Perfect.
102

103
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.640
Now we can go ahead and move our bishop to the appropriate location.
103

104
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.000
So if we move this to nine and 21 again of course it may be different on your board if you're using
104

105
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.020
different scales.
105

106
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.790
I know that works for mine.
106

107
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.610
And then we've got everything all sorted.
107

108
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.130
Now I'm going to switch my view in the outline ahead to scenes so I can just make sure that we've got
108

109
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:57.700
chess set.
109

110
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.040
Yes Bishop Yes.
110

111
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.200
And then we've got this not just here.
111

112
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.870
Now one thing I do want to show you I've managed to go into edit mode is sometimes when you parent things
112

113
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:14.380
together let's say we wanted to parent this together again you can end up with the another object just
113

114
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.200
disappearing into the distance like so and resetting to the center of the scene where it was originally
114

115
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.190
imported to.
115

116
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:27.090
Very easy to do if that does happen just remember to click keep transform and that will not happen.
116

117
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.200
So that's the example of where that is incredibly useful.
117

118
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.420
Now you may argue at this points that we've solidified how the bishop is going to look.
118

119
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:44.020
So we could actually apply this boolean modifier and then go ahead and delete the notch object itself.
119

120
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.170
I'm not going to do that at the moment but that is a valid option.
120

121
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:53.230
The other thing to bear in mind is because we have parented this already if we go ahead and whilst
121

122
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.870
both objects are selected alt and D to link duplicate.
122

123
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.270
So they're both the same type of mesh.
123

124
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.610
So we alter one mesh we alter the other.
124

125
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.260
Notice that it is already parented.
125

126
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.110
It has inherited its parent.
126

127
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.760
The same is true is if we have duplicated it it's inherited the parent as well.
127

128
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.190
Now we do want linked duplicates what this means is that if this object here changes the other one does
128

129
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.350
as well and that is really important at this stage because if we make an edit to one of our objects
129

130
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:30.670
we want to make sure that both of them gets updated and I think that leads us nicely onto our challenge
130

131
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.580
okay.
131

132
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.640
So your challenge is to append the pawn into the chess scene.
132

133
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:41.620
So we're almost there now sets up the correct parenting hierarchy and linked duplicate the rest of the
133

134
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.570
pawns and the other bishop if you haven't done yet and place them in the appropriate position and then
134

135
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.790
test to make sure that when you move the board piece itself the others follow along as well.
135

136
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.640
Pause video now and give that a go. Okay everybody Welcome back.
136

137
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:04.610
Let's go ahead hop on over into blender and complete the board with the pieces we've got already okay.
137

138
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.630
Everybody welcome back.
138

139
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.680
So the first thing I'm going to do here is we've already got the bishop in our scene.
139

140
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.140
We can lower its position to zero.
140

141
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.370
Now notice at the moment the active selected object is the notch.
141

142
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.970
I don't want that.
142

143
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.830
I want the active selected to be the bishop.
143

144
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.260
Otherwise I'll be moving the wrong piece.
144

145
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.920
There we go.
145

146
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.080
And this is probably going to be minus twelve or minus nine.
146

147
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:26.420
Yes.
147

148
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.100
There we go.
148

149
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.200
And 21 wasn't it.
149

150
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.070
OK.
150

151
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.000
So that's that's in.
151

152
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.100
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab my pawn.
152

153
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:40.630
Drag that into our scene append it and then go to all wrong one.
153

154
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.360
Go to object pawn append.
154

155
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.350
There we go it's in the scene.
155

156
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:52.440
I'm going to shift select the board itself and go to control and P to parent it to the board.
156

157
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.700
OK.
157

158
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.140
So that's the first one done.
158

159
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.760
The next thing I need to do here is go ahead and move it to the correct location.
159

160
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:06.230
So on the y axis oop making sure you've got the right thing selected we are looking about 15 centimeters
160

161
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.400
perfect and we're going to start over here and that's going to be 21.
161

162
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760
Okay.
162

163
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:17.580
It's now a matter of linked duplicates or we could use an array modifier.
163

164
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.360
Mm hmm.
164

165
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.000
Interesting.
165

166
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.360
I'm going to do linked duplicates because otherwise it's going to be a pain to switch the object data
166

167
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800
out afterwards.
167

168
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.730
So in this case the array modifier is not going to be suitable.
168

169
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:33.170
I'm going to use Alt and D to make the leap linked duplicates and then we'll move it on the x axis probably
169

170
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.360
by minus 3.
170

171
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.310
I should imagine minus 6.
171

172
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.890
Perfect.
172

173
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:37.550
There we go.
173

174
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.710
I'm going to select them both and when they're both selected I'm going to go alt and to duplicate
174

175
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.940
of them again.
175

176
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.350
Escape out of then go G X minus 12.
176

177
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:47.740
Yep.
177

178
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.510
There we go.
178

179
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.040
Select all four alt and D.
179

180
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.050
There we go.
180

181
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.450
G X minus 24.
181

182
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.140
There we go.
182

183
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.370
So that's all of those duplicated.
183

184
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.180
You could have done them one at a time.
184

185
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:07.490
Now I am going to double check that these all have the same mesh data even if they're separate mesh
185

186
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:13.610
objects and you can test that by just selecting one of them going to edit mode by pressing tab and they
186

187
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.580
all switch to edit mode and you can see here.
187

188
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.270
That means that the entire sets of pawns all adjust.
188

189
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.050
And there we go.
189

190
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.490
We've got everything all set up in our scene and everything is all linked together we can test that
190

191
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.190
by moving this perfect the pieces should move individually which they do do.
191

192
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.060
And then the bishop itself moves individually and the Notch is still parented.
192

193
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.890
Excellent.
193

194
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.300
So we've got a hierarchy all set up there.
194

195
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.320
How did you guys get on.
195

196
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.760
This is brilliant.
196

197
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.610
This scene is now coming together really well.
197

198
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:49.320
We've got a couple more pieces to make and the board to make a bit more ornate as well.
198

199
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.740
Show your progress over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
