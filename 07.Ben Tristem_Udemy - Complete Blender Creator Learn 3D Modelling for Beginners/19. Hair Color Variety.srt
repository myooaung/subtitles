1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,580
In this video we can add more of a textured look to our hair by adding color variation within our hair

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,790
so it looks a lot more like hair actually looks rather than just one uniform color.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,170
And we'd be using this simple material set up to do that.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,330
My computer's been really struggling to do the screen recording and to do this exercise so I'm going

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,020
to reduce the numbers.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm in my particle system clicking on head hair I'm going to reduce the number of display for the children

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,390
down to say 10.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,870
And also the render amount to 10 so I can be in cycles mode still see the hair but there's not quite

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,700
as many children here as many hair strands hopefully that'll make things go a bit more smoothly and

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,990
very briefly before I forget we've talked about this nearly talked about a couple of times I was going

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,150
to one of my other views here the material view you can see that our hair strands have a curve to them

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,900
and you can see there's quite a distinct edging to it.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,890
So it makes the hair not quite as polished.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,540
If you want to get some more detail and there go into your particle properties look for viewport display

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,580
strands steps instead of two let's increase that to three or four or five you can see after all it doesn't

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,060
really make any difference the difference between two to three was the most dramatic.

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,010
Let me see if I can zoom right in here on my hair strands because of the length of hair that I've got

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,870
in the way that I'm using this from two to three that looks a bit smoother and from three to four.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,710
That's when we get a much more smooth line and I reduce this back to to just so I can have a look in

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,390
this view and have my computer not misbehave too much.

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,090
Suddenly my render at four I think I will say five.

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,080
That's right smooth skin maybe take a little bit longer to render but that's gonna make the hair look

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,270
nice and smooth while or in the viewport even if I'm in rendered view you can see that it's a little

24
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,110
bit angular.

25
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,470
Okay.

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,170
Now let's talk about color so I'm clicked on a head hair you can see when I'm looking on my shader editor

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,110
which I'm on at the moment shader editor we still have the material from our head instead of head we

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,170
want to create a new material head hair I think we'll call it so open to material property Tab I'm going

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,020
to hit minus or delete or get rid of remove that's what I'm after the head everything goes white as

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,740
it should.

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,000
We need to click new and I'm going to rename this click then rename it hair now within the material

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,310
properties you can see we have the surface which is currently principal B.S. The F we want to change

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,370
that to be hair.

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,990
The SDF so it understands that this is hair that's going to rearrange my shader edit here a little bit

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,450
so it's easier to see now we need to plug something into hair base there be SDF to give us variety and

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:38,280
that's gonna be a color ramp so shift a and search for color ramp puppet to the left the hair B SDF

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,790
we want to connect the color to the color.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,680
Now we have a standard color slider so I can move the black node up and down and that will give us more

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,590
black as a proportion of the hair and less white.

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,190
So we now have black strands we have white strands.

41
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,180
If I scrolling around a little bit actually you know let me change the colors to make it a bit more

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,520
pronounced if I click on the White node and then click on the large white area below that then we can

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,350
change the color to say we'll make it green so it really stands out makes it very obvious and you can

44
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,910
see that we've got some black and we've got some green really pops let's change the black to make it

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,100
even more obvious so it stands out a lot so click on the Node click on the color just drag the wheel

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,940
drag the slider up so that we get more color in there and I'm going to change it to pink and you can

47
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,730
see that it's black and white why is that.

48
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,640
Well it's not giving us the full range of the colors when we try to go from color to color we need to

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,210
add one more note so give ourselves a bit space over on the left here shift a and I'm going to search

50
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:47,730
for hair info that will let our material know that what we're doing is hair info grab the random slot

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:55,620
and drag that over to the factor the f I see now you can see that we've got lots of pinks and lots of

52
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,180
greens within our hair because our note our color ramp feeding into our hair be SDF understands that

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
this is hey we're working on looking a little bit nasty at the moment because I don't have a lot of

54
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,140
hair strands in there I've reduced the numbers and my computer behaves a little bit more it kind of

55
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,540
looks like a punk rocker who's lost all his hair it's very thinning isn't it but we can go on create

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,240
more sensible colors so if I click the color slider drag down to a Brown a darker kind of brown now

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,610
we've got brown and green still looks a little bit wrong click on the green click on the green again

58
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,980
and then do something more in the White area that's starting to get into what actual hair is going to

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,760
look like where we have some varieties some texture again so it's thinning so I do need to add more

60
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,940
children pretty soon but for now it is looking at the color I can drag down the slider to give different

61
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,090
proportions and I can also click the plus button here on the left hand side of color click the plus

62
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,300
button I can drag that slot or that color slot up and down whatever I want it and I can change the color

63
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,820
so now I'm putting in a third color make this more of a pure white or a gray kind of white color.

64
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,310
Then you can see that we've got these three colors being represented so you can have two or three or

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,740
ten colors that are being represented and with variety throughout your hair and the positioning of the

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,270
slider.

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,060
How much space it occupies within the slider is going to determine how frequent that hair strand appears.

68
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,050
So it is going to increase the display amount for my children and my particle system just so we can

69
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,440
get a bit more of a fuller look.

70
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,910
And he doesn't look quite so old and decrepit.

71
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,430
There we go.

72
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,750
So it's a full kind of look we've got the texture there's some light hair popping through it's overall

73
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,800
it's kind of got that darker brown color with a little bit of the lighter brown in it.

74
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,690
And that's the foundations of how we get variety into our hair.

75
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,260
Now I've clicked on F 12 just to do a quick render so we can see how this looks when it's properly rendered

76
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,500
out.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,260
I'll just speed up the video a little bit here so I can show you the output of this render.

78
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,870
OK.

79
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,440
That's how I expect it to be some texture some different colors represented in the hair look and how

80
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,950
I wanted to.

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,900
So let's just close that out OK.

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,710
Let's have a look at the material here so you can see the nose hair info into color ramp.

83
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,590
We can change our colors and add more in if we want if we want more colors.

84
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,360
And then into hair BSD.

85
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,720
And then finally into the material output.

86
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,130
This is all the material that is applied to our head hair.

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,420
We can also change the roughness roughness you and roughness V to see if we get a different look that

88
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,340
we like in terms of our color on our hair not gonna play around with this too much because my computer

89
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,380
is really unhappy at the moment with the screen recording and with Blender doing a lot of this high

90
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,210
intensity work.

91
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,670
But that's something that you can fiddle around with if you want a slightly different look.

92
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,770
Now let's get you creating it's time for a challenge add some color randomness create a new material

93
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:49,520
for your hair switch to hair BSD f add a color ramp node and then change the color as in the current

94
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:56,270
node add more if you want add Hey info node and link random to factor so that knows that we're dealing

95
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,640
with here and then to tweak the roughness in the hair BSD f if you'd like to get a slightly different

96
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,830
color and of course please share a render with us in our discussions so we can see what you've come

97
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,950
up with then we can celebrate how cool your particular head looks so I'm going to leave you with just

98
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,420
on screen here the material set up so I know that's the most important thing to look at as time's going

99
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,550
on so there's your challenge take that on and please when you come up with something cool please share

100
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,010
it with us in the discussions and I'll see you in the next lecture.
