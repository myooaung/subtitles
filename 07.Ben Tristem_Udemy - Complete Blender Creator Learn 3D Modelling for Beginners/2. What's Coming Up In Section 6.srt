00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,290
Hello everybody and welcome to this quick lecture where we're going to overview what were you about

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,590
to do in this particular section fluffy bunny.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,080
That's a good clue as to what we're going to do.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,990
But let's have a look and a bit more detail of what's coming up.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,060
Okay so the first thing here is a drawing we want a rough sketch of what we're going to do.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,600
But then we jump into some modern and we're going to use metal balls and then jump straight into sculpt

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,320
in some basic sculpting techniques.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,910
Then we're going to start applying our first particle systems and you will end up with a fluffy bunny

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,360
we sort out the fluffiness by starting to comb it in stylizing their hair and then we add some more

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,240
particle systems to generate some variety in our model.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,390
And then we go through with children as well and making sure that we get a more realistic output.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,150
We work on the eye because there's a focus point an ad in a sky box.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,990
The next thing we do is start to focus on the environment so we start with a blade of grass and then

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,430
we put hundreds in there you can see that's a bit fuzzy and I'll explain a bit more about that later.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,650
Then we start sculpting the land a bit more and making an environment for this baby to sit in.

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,650
We learn how to use saplings to create some wonderful trees and even using particle systems with a bit

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,260
more control to make a bush like this.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,730
Finally we bring it all together and make a simple scene like this.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,790
And if you're up to it we can even make a little animation here with depth of field to really bring

20
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,730
things alive.

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,420
Now do want to show you some student work here.

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,580
Absolutely phenomenal.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm really impressed with what these guys have come up with.

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,940
And I can't wait to see yours as well.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,090
Yes you can see here.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,690
And this was for normal reference material all the way through to a 3-d scene.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,220
Absolutely spot on.

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,590
Really really impressed.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,240
And wow what an amazing set of artwork there.

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,800
And I'm really impressed by what you guys of what I've been seeing you create already so I just wanted

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,670
to show those off.

32
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,380
Now before we jump straight in one thing I do want to say is that this section is going to be quite

33
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,710
taxing on your hardware whether you've got a fully blown system or just a basic laptop or something

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,540
along those lines.

35
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,920
But don't go rushing headlong in and tried to make super high quality things with thousands or hundreds

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,400
of thousands of particles.

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,770
We need to keep things sensible to do work within the capabilities of system and don't get beat bit

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,400
and if things are taking a while to render.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,850
They do take a while to render one of those animations that you saw in the in a few seconds ago that

40
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,270
she took about 10 hours to render out.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,400
That's just the nature of rendering.

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,690
And so do be patient don't worry about your quality settings don't whack them up high again as you saw

43
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,790
in some of those pictures.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,660
It was quite fuzzy and fuzzy for a reason because I didn't want to wait hours and hours and hours for

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,160
a rendering.

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,230
I just wanted to see the basics of how is going to look.

47
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,470
And I must impress upon you as well to do that and not spend hours waiting for a rendering anyway without

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,420
any further ado.

49
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,920
Let's hop straight in and begin this section.
