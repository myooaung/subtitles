00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,250
Hello everybody and welcome to this section.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,570
So in this lecture I would like to go through a bit more detail what's coming up.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,100
What are we going to be covering.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,820
So we're going to be creating assets to be exported straight into an external program in this specific

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,310
case where we're going to be focused on exporting four game engines now creating your own textures and

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,770
other maps from high detail models and applying them down to a low poly version.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,880
We're not just going to make high poly detailed models we can start off with those low poly models.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,040
They are important and we'll dive into more details about them.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,460
Now some of you may be thinking oh hang on a minute I don't want to make game assets.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,450
However you can use all of the techniques.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,020
I say this technique but any of the techniques that we discuss in the section most of them can be used

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,300
within blender as well to speed up things like rendering and just basic optimization of a scene.

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,800
And we're going to be focused on modelling a Gothic church.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,040
Well that's gonna be my focus and once I'd encourage everybody to do is take the lessons as they come

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,660
and actually apply it to your own project as well.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,990
I think that's really important.

17
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,270
So what else is coming up.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,570
Well I'm gonna be testing my model as I go.

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,550
I won't be always bringing it on screen and just showing you opening up in Unity or unreal or Godot

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,860
but I will be testing my model as I go.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,520
And I expect you guys to do that as well.

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,070
There's no point in making a model and then finding at the very end of the creation Oh it doesn't work

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,040
as expected.

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,650
And if you test your model as you go just as I'm going to do initially and then I'll do that in the

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,290
background rather than boring you every time with it.

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,200
But if you test as you go you spot the errors spot the mistakes or spot something quirky something that

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,230
you may need to adjust as you progress through and create your models.

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,400
We'll be looking at level of detail which is how detailed a model is based upon its distance in more

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,190
detail and I'll be keeping my scene simple primarily for teaching purposes more than anything else.

30
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:09,090
It's so tempting to start layering a ton of detail especially when we're talking about environmental

31
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,360
scenes within games and things like that.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,080
Now that's not to say that you need to do that.

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,020
Now I do recommend if this is your first time running through with such a setup then I do recommend

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,890
that you also keep your scene simple so as not to overwhelm yourself on the first run.

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,860
However if you're not I expect you to push yourself at this point and really go for it.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,810
And I encourage you to add more detail experiment and have fun.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,770
That's the most important thing when it comes to playing around in Blender.

38
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,170
If you get frustrated with one model this is a great section where you can actually just make something

39
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,240
else and use that in my scene.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,220
Obviously your scene will have a specific theme that you want to want to stick to.

41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,840
And as I've written here wouldn't it wouldn't the scene look much more interesting with a chess set

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,360
in it now I might not get round to actually importing the chess set that we've made it may not make

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,180
sense with what I'm going for.

44
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,260
But if you have the opportunity to bring in some of your other models that you've already made into

45
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,080
the scene all the better that type of thing brings a scene to life.

46
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,000
OK.

47
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,540
So that Bout wraps up what this section is all about and I'm really excited for all of you because this

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,410
is a chance to stretch your legs and make the projects your own.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,240
And we will start planning that in the next lecture.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,980
See you over there.
