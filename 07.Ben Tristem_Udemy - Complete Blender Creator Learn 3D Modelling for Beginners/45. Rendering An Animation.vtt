00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.830
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.940
In this lecture we're going to talk about how to render out your scene as a video.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.490
We'll go for that briefly we'll talk about some of the benefits and some of the downsides of doing it

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.360
this way.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.380
And in the next lecture we'll have a look at how to do it across multiple computers and making the rendering

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.180
a bit safer.

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.420
If you're rendering out something it's taking a lot longer to do.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.690
So let's dive into it.

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.220
We have our render settings so we've got everything set up we're happy with it.

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.510
Now we get to choose on this tab whether or not we're using cycles or we're using eevee it's entirely

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.630
up to you both of what we're about to talk about apply to both of these render engines.

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.070
And when we get onto the next lecture when we start talking about optimizing that and making it a bit

13
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.530
safer certainly applies with cycles.

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.640
But once you get eevee turned up and crank up those settings it can take quite a while to render out

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.130
quite a long eevee Render.

16
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.270
The next thing to bear in mind down here is the type of outputs.

17
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.660
So we've got on the first tab we're talking about what the rendering system is that we're using whether

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.250
it cycles eevee or indeed any other renderer that you've plugged into blender.

19
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.170
The next tab down talks about the output type.

20
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.060
Let's make this a bit wider so we can have a look.

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.840
So here we have the resolution that we're outputting.

22
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.910
I would recommend not going any higher than 10 ATP to be quite honest if your work is that spectacular

23
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.410
that you want to up it's a four K.

24
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.490
Brilliant.

25
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.440
At this point in time even 720 P is absolutely fine.

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.800
And remember you're going to probably be sharing it on platforms like Facebook or even with your friends

27
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.120
over something like I message or WhatsApp in which case it's going to be compressed anyway.

28
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.610
So that's something to bear in mind that when you upload a video that's really large both in detail

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.750
and resolution the platform you're uploading it to May crunch it down anyway.

30
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.210
So the next bit underneath is the resolution percentage.

31
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.480
And currently it will render out or whatever 25 percent of 10 ATP is that we crank for all the way up

32
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.830
it would definitely be 10 80 and we know that when we do that we can optimize it by turning down but

33
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.120
towards these final steps we want to make sure that we're running at 50 percent or greater.

34
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.600
I'm going to do 100 percent I know on my system.

35
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.910
This animation is not going to take that long.

36
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.130
Now down here this is important.

37
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.220
We've got a bit of dead space here.

38
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.290
Currently our end frame is set to 300.

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.590
So by the time we played the you know it's moved through we've landed.

40
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.200
We've then got 10 seconds is that 10 seconds 100 frames.

41
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.670
It's not quite with 30 frames per second we've got about four seconds of dead space at the end of our

42
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.000
animation.

43
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.560
Don't need that maybe from 170 to 200.

44
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.640
We can use.

45
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.830
I think that would be a good space.

46
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.710
So we can even change this figure in the timeline itself over on the top right or indeed here we can

47
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.280
set it to 200 over in the properties Panel time we can see that it's reflected that change over here.

48
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.790
So that's good.

49
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.100
We've truncated everything to the right size.

50
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.460
Okay.

51
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.010
So if we have to scroll down here on the output tab currently we're outputting to a temp folder.

52
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.120
I would suggest changing that to somewhere where you can capture your video.

53
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.760
I'm going to do that now and I as you can see here every other animation I've done so far has come out

54
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.910
as a PMG and we've been able to play it back by going up to the render menu and going to view render.

55
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.990
That's absolutely fine.

56
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.180
But at this point in time I want to output it somewhere where I can view it.

57
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.010
That's entirely up to you where you decide to outputs your stuff.

58
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.440
I personally while I'm doing tests will output to my downloads folder which I often clean up quite regularly.

59
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.960
However in this particular case I'm going to go to my desktop go up a level and let's find my videos

60
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.960
which is just over here.

61
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.700
Okay.

62
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.610
So now we can go ahead and output a video so we can go ahead and click on videos and there we go.

63
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.720
I can go ahead here and give it a name as well so lamp 10 80 and I'm going to call this a test at this

64
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.970
point in time and go ahead and click accept.

65
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.690
So we've set the output destination.

66
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.620
That's good.

67
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.700
We'll talk about some of these options down here the overwrite file extensions etc. in the next lecture

68
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.190
but suffice to say if you overwrite turned on it's not going to prompt you if it already exists it will

69
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.170
overwrite it.

70
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.120
So that's a good thing and a bad thing depending on what you want to do.

71
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.980
So just bear that in mind and I would of course add the file extension too otherwise you're not going

72
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.080
to be able to play it back.

73
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.450
So here comes the crux if we've got a short animation to render out and I would deem this quite short

74
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.490
but short is not just the length of the animation is how long it's going to take you.

75
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.520
If for some reason it stops work at any point your computer crashes.

76
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.070
Perhaps you have a power cut.

77
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.410
We'll deal more with that in the next lecture so we can switch the file format here from PMG.

78
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.360
I would recommend FS MPEG video as we've done earlier on when we were outputting some movies set the

79
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.250
container to MP for that will mean that it's the most compatible outputs.

80
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.660
And personally I would not touch these for the moments later on.

81
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.610
You can dive into details and optimizing for real good quality outputs but whilst we're just practicing

82
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.810
here let's leave them because these are good enough medium quality encoding speed of good I'm sure gonna

83
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.100
save my project there.

84
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.710
Before you go ahead and do any renders I would always recommend saving your project.

85
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.180
The reason is it blend does crash and you've made a lot of tweaks here and there very specific.

86
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.920
You may forget which ones you've done and not be able to get back exactly what you intended.

87
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.710
So you've got everything set up there and what we now can go and do is make a final check 10 ATP.

88
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.630
Yes.

89
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.430
What do we rendering out using we using cycles and I'm going to use my GP you to do this now you may

90
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.440
find that it's quicker using your CPA.

91
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.450
I've run across plenty of situations where that is the case.

92
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:29.630
It won't be in this instance and then I can go ahead up to the render menu and render animation now

93
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.340
this will take a few moments to do.

94
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.640
In fact we can see here I'm probably going to take all three seconds.

95
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.290
Times 200.

96
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.590
So that's quite a while to wait and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

97
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.080
Okay so we're all done and that was actually quicker than I suspected.

98
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.790
Now some of you will be thinking at this point.

99
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.170
Hang on a minute Mike.

100
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.240
Look at all the noise in here.

101
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.150
Well to be honest with you I don't mind at this point if you're sharing work like this at this prototype

102
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.370
stage you might still be tweaking things and that I predicted would take about 10 minutes and it wasn't

103
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.950
too far from it.

104
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:13.280
Now you wouldn't want to spend it let's say we increased the sample count by four with the samples render.

105
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.640
Well you know what that would mean we were waiting for 40 minutes.

106
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.440
That's an awful lot of time to wait for this test render.

107
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.960
Now I've got over on my file system now as you can see here in the videos folder we've got the lamp

108
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.390
180 and we've popped on the end the number of frames in there if we double click that they'll open up

109
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.490
annoyingly on another screen.

110
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.570
Let me bring that across and into the right place.

111
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.780
But here we go.

112
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.550
We've got the six second animation there roughly.

113
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.550
And here we go we can play it back.

114
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:50.060
And that's brilliant because that's something you can go in share to anybody for critique for feedback

115
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.290
or even yourself.

116
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.920
Now you're viewing it back at full speed there are a couple of things here.

117
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.530
We can see that the lamp itself has gone into the floor slightly.

118
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.720
That's a tweak that we can do.

119
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.040
And I believe at the very beginning let's just have a look here.

120
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.270
Oh look at that.

121
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.700
We've still got somewhere on our scene.

122
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.410
That was one of our control bones if I remember correctly but have a look at that.

123
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.310
That's not what we want.

124
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.710
Here we have something rendering that we didn't want so let's go and fix certainly this problem here.

125
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.160
And later on I can tweak the actual animation itself.

126
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.040
So let's get rid of the render result and switch ourselves back to the main viewport.

127
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.570
Here we go.

128
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.330
So at the very beginning we've got this issue where it's hidden in the viewport kind of left this in

129
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.660
here deliberately because I know some of you will have done this.

130
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.550
Let's go to our outline here.

131
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.770
This is quite a common thing where you leave something in your viewport and didn't realize it at the

132
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.430
time.

133
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:55.550
Now if I had rendered out quickly let's say number 36 or frame 36 I would've seen it there early on.

134
00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.290
So that's one of the benefits there of actually just doing a couple of frames through and I would always

135
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.820
encourage you doing this because it's easier to pick up on stuff like that happening.

136
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.360
So if you do happen to have a problem you can detect it early.

137
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.990
So I'm not sure what this thing on the floor is called.

138
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.300
It'll be one of the things though that we've turned off by I cannot remember which one it's called it's

139
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.700
probably the bone shape.

140
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.930
Look let's turn it on.

141
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.660
Yes.

142
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.750
So here we go the bone shape look.

143
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:29.270
Now if we turn it off in the rendering settings and also render out we can see it's no longer there.

144
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.480
Now I'm not going to say that mine is a throw away 10 minutes there.

145
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.520
I mean I managed to go grab a coffee but that was a three hour render.

146
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:45.030
Well you've just blown it and there are a couple of things that we can do to improve that situation.

147
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:50.240
So this is how I pretty much always render our shorts anything that's going to take me less than five

148
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.140
or 10 minutes to re render if I need to.

149
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:59.420
All let's say if I was popping out for a bit and it was no real time cost to me if there was something

150
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.240
wrong with the scene then that's fine.

151
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.490
But if something was really important we could break this down into smaller chunks.

152
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:14.690
That's one option and we can break it down in smaller chunks either with what we're rendering out or

153
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.780
how we're rendering it sounds.

154
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.390
So share your work over in the discussions.

155
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.900
What settings did you use.

156
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.330
How long did it take you to render out your full animation.

157
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.200
Did you use cycles did you use eevee and why did you pick those two.

158
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.660
I've decided to go with cycles to get the realistic lighting in that but I think the next one I might

159
