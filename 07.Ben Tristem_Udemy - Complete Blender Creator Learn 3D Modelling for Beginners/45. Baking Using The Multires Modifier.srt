00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,090
Welcome to baking using the multi Rose modifier in this video.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,860
You will learn how to bake detail from the higher multi rays to a lower one and you'll realize it's

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,370
very similar to the baking you've done before but this time only one model is involved so we don't have

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,870
to have multiple models on there.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,800
So let's go explore this now and hop on over into blender.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,910
Okay if you remember last time we had our multi rez blob.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,950
If you didn't save that don't worry let's go and create a new one right away.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,580
Just a good bit of practice there.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,080
So going to go ahead and delete my object.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,650
There it goes.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,990
Keep the save file there.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,780
I'm going to add in a cube.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm going to go to the subdivision's surface had a couple probably three.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,910
That's fine.

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,960
Then I'm going to simply go into sculpt mode after I've added in a multi resolution modified so let's

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,490
add that in.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,340
I'm going to actually take it all the way up to six which should give me yep three million polygons

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,480
to play with that is lots of polygons to lower the preview setting down to 1.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,430
And I'm going to go into sculped and I'm going to add some detail.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,060
Then move the strength of the brush using up so I get some dimples.

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,570
Now of course these dimples are the size of them is actually the distance I am.

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,570
It's measured in pixels from the image so if I move in I can put smaller dots around.

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,930
Now obviously I can go through to my heart's content and make dots and squiggles all over here until

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,990
I don't want to do it anymore.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,610
There you go add some fine detail in there as well as just a screen.

26
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,470
It's just the screen looks fine.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,770
Okay so now we've played with VAT's unjust underskirt.

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm actually going to put a recess in as well because we don't have a recess.

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,320
That's quite a big one.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,750
So that's fine let's see how that has come down in the preview So if we go to object mode here we can

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,290
see that it has affected the model ever so slightly but not much.

32
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,060
And of course this looks nothing like.

33
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,000
If we go into sculpt mode again it looks nothing like that.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,810
It's close kinda but really nowhere near it.

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,910
So we have this here.

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,510
When I said it's a smooth shade because it's going to be smooth shaded any way when it's done.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,590
That's important because when we bake the Normal's And that's what we're going to do in a moment.

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,200
It needs to be smooth because that's the starlight going for now.

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,880
Take note of the render setting here the render setting here is going to say from which level it's going

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,620
to bake downwards.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,660
That is very important so that before we can do any baking we need to go and add a material to our object

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,930
that material has to have something associated with it.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,090
Um no so see an image with it now so I can bake straight to that image.

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,560
Someone I go to image texture and there isn't an image yet so let's go ahead over to the 3D editor and

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,580
a hop into edit mode and just un wrap.

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,390
I'm going to put my own seam on here.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,650
Let's see where's all the detail.

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,070
If I'm going to use v smart you reproject to show you guys what happens hopefully what happens if it

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,750
gets it.

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,650
If it puts the scenes in the wrong place basically.

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,800
So now I've got vats I've unwrapped it.

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,140
We can go to the U.S. image editor.

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay that's looking good.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
We need a new image there.

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,900
So going to go a new image and I'm going to call this blob.

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,660
I'm struggling to see the keyboard here through a microphone but there we go blob.

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,560
Normal.

58
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,080
Good.

59
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,670
Keep it a 1 0 2 4 that's sokoban a Selecta.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,510
Over here in the material properties.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,730
So that's now signed.

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,180
We can go then go over to the render tab.

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,970
Now remember when you do any form of baking or rendering you are rendering and therefore blender can

64
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,400
be unstable and crash.

65
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,030
So we want to avoid that if possible.

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,580
Well certainly we want to avoid it crashing but if we can't control that we can control whether or not

67
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,020
we've saved our work.

68
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,400
So I'm going to go ahead and save.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,750
Let's scroll all the way down to the bottom and go to the back options and scroll down a little more

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,090
in the back type here.

71
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,470
I'm going to go from combined to normal and I'm going to just go ahead and hit bake now.

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,150
It's at a high resolution the six subdivision resolution quite a few polygons there.

73
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,500
And that's going to take a while to go through.

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,410
So it's come out here and we can see it's relatively smooth.

75
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,690
Now before we move on I just want to show the impact of lowering this the setting so if I lower it down

76
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,190
to one and then go and bake.

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,110
It's a lot quicker but you're losing all of those fine details.

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,780
So is that render sitting there that you also need to keep it nice and high if you want to bake from

79
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,450
one level down to another.

80
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,280
In this case we are baking down to where it is actually zero.

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,070
So if we go ahead and go back here.

82
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,840
Ake.

83
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,700
It's going to take a while again because it's at that higher level up subdivision.

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
And here we go.

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,860
So we've got these normal map all made and how we can go ahead and apply it to our model.

86
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,610
So I'm going to leave that alone for a moment and then go to the 3D view.

87
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,260
Go to object modes I can see what's going on and I'm going to go to rendered mode.

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,430
So this is what happens with seams on here now at the moment.

89
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,240
This isn't very bright.

90
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,480
So I put a sunlamp in and turn it strength up to four.

91
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,170
So we can see here that the we've got some scenes here and the reason why you end up with some nasty

92
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,690
seams.

93
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,600
In fact it looks like it changed the direction of the Normal's there midway through.

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,070
Now the reason why these seams exist is because you need to split up the model somewhere to cut it in

95
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,650
half.

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,820
But the reason why it can't match them up perfectly is because it's got two different normal points

97
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,890
placed on top of one another.

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,990
When you wrap this image together essentially they lay on top of one another.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,430
And of course that can cause an graphical artefact So we'll see those in action in a few moments when

100
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,140
we go and apply this normal map as a normal map rather than a diffused map.

101
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,670
So first of all I'm just going to hide my tool shell from propertys and move across and open up the

102
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,550
node editor so we're going to play with the materials.

103
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,820
Now I'm going to call it cheat hearing them call it efficiency.

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,270
We do want the image but we don't want it to control the diffuse colour.

105
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,590
So you can unplug it.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,930
There we go there so that's that bit sorted but we still got the image texture in here.

107
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:53,670
Now as you remember before what we're going to have to do here is set it up to be a normal.

108
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,970
So we need a couple of other things in this chain.

109
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,220
We need it's Tell blender how to apply this image texture and also that it's a normal map and give it

110
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,380
some control so we can control the strength of the normal map.

111
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,450
And of course that leads me onto a challenge.

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,410
I would like you to go ahead and apply the normal map so finish off the node set up and use your baked

113
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:22,120
normal map to control the normal of the day few shader the normal input of the the few shader pause

114
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,060
video now and give that a go.

115
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,240
Okay guys.

116
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,940
Welcome back.

117
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,040
Let's go ahead and apply that normal map.

118
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,470
Okay so the first thing I'm going to do over here is hide.

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,700
That's I've got a bit more space to work with.

120
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,200
So we need to define how the image texture is used.

121
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:49,220
And I'm going to use a texture coordinates and link-up the U V to the vector inputs of the texture.

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,330
Now of course you could also use at this point if you have multiple uv's Maps you may have to use this

123
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,430
particular technique.

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,920
Now where is it hidden under input you v map.

125
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,420
And we could also do that and select the only you v map we've got in there and plug that in as well.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,510
But I'm going to leave it as a text record and we need to make sure that we're not using colour that

127
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,830
we're using non colour data otherwise the normal map won't be interpreted properly.

128
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:28,310
Finally what we need to do is add in a vector normal map and then we can take the colour and plug it

129
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,210
into colour.

130
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,090
Colour out of image texture and plug it into the colour input of the normal map and then take the normal

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,730
output and plug it into the normal input of the diffuse shader.

132
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,280
Wow okay that's starting to look pretty good.

133
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,670
I'd like to see these two side by side at the end.

134
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,840
But that is really effective.

135
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,810
It's worked really well.

136
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,470
Now where that normal map was a bit funny that's also worked really well.

137
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,160
I mean I'm actually quite surprised that that hasn't decided to look a bit awkward.

138
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,030
We can see that we're working with the low poly model here because of the inclusion You see the jaggedness

139
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,260
around the very edge.

140
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,320
And of course that doesn't actually raise up as high as it would have done otherwise.

141
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:20,430
Of course we can go ahead here and add in the first level of preview and that really does accentuate

142
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,710
the normal map itself it adds that the geometry in there at the same time as some of these dimples.

143
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,560
But it doesn't give us the smoothness gives us quite jaggedness there.

144
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,500
So we've got two options there of which ones we can use.

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm going to preview one here so I've got some of these high points that I've done and of course what

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,080
we can do is just render that out what we don't know what it looks like at the moment is what it looks

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,050
like when it's fully rendered.

148
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,040
So the first thing here is to turn down the render from six.

149
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,560
If we leave on six and then we go and do a full rendering it will just be the high rez model.

150
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:05,970
I can demonstrate that straightaway by going to the can review and zooming in and that yeah this one's

151
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,530
here is absolutely fine.

152
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,930
Let's try and fill up a good portion of the frame with it.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,210
If we make the black um um just going to do this I love doing this sort of thing I'm going to make the

154
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,870
background completely black.

155
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,200
And then it does look like some sort of funky asteroid in space and I'm just going to go ahead and hit

156
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,890
the render again because I've got the render level set at six.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,910
It's actually going to take a while to do all the computation it needs to do to render out those three

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,360
million polygons.

159
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,000
So that's quite a high level and you can appreciate that if this was something you were going to use

160
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:46,650
in a different package or only part of your scene you probably dont want it that many polygons.

161
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:53,220
So here we go it's filling out all of these things and we've got a lovely crisp outline here that's

162
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,160
brilliant that we've got that.

163
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,190
But it really comes at a cost that detail comes at a cost.

164
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,630
And here we go looking almost in the centre of this picture.

165
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,010
If you follow my cursor there you can see where there's a seam here.

166
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,590
That's an that's an artefact of where the seam is.

167
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,900
So we can control where seams go and we certainly don't want it there.

168
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,530
That was the bit that was facing the camera some just going to change the render slot slot so.

169
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,680
And I'm going to drop the render level down to 1 so still got some geometry there.

170
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,930
Otherwise it's just the sphere again.

171
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,890
And we do one without the sphere as well that's render that out now and see what that looks like and

172
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,650
you can see immediately how much quicker that was to do the work.

173
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,500
So let's go between the two slots now and just see the difference.

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,020
Okay.

175
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,580
There is a difference.

176
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,160
There definitely is a difference.

177
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:53,340
Now what we can do here of course is potentially turn the amounts of normal map up a little that is

178
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,590
a possibility so we can do that life over here.

179
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,860
I zoom in that we're on preview level 1 let's turn the normal map strength up to two.

180
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,300
Okay.

181
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,240
Now let's render that out at this lower level.

182
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,970
See that is nice and quick as it's lower and we can see that the shadows are darker here.

183
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,550
And if we switch over to slot one to compare okay.

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,650
There a little bit too dark in this case.

185
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,340
So once again we got some horrible artefacts going around the top there.

186
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:30,960
So perhaps this is a bit too low a poly for this particular level of detail so we can up it again and

187
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,240
really for render basically take upper level here and hit render again and see what we get out there.

188
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,110
That is starting to look much better.

189
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,400
Of course we can tweak these things etc. but of course we're now at 12000.

190
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,760
But that is a lot less of course than 3 million.

191
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,660
So it looks like 12000 is going to be the sort of sweet point here before we start having too much detail

192
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,020
in our model but that is looking really really good and obviously compared to the 3 million polygon

193
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,530
one I am going to try here a value a strength of one point five see will that comes out that we use

194
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,250
slot to again and just render that out.

195
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,270
Okay.

196
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,050
I think the shadows here are looking a bit better now so we should be able to compare slot one slot

197
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,480
to yet but very close.

198
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,290
Now in terms of their tonal quality and that is really really impressive.

199
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,580
Now the final thing I want to try is what does this look like when it's baked all the way down to none.

200
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,580
But literally as few faces as possible so this is what this looks like now on just a sphere.

201
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:41,820
You lose all of the occlusion round the outside but you still got this detail here and that in itself

202
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,290
is very powerful.

203
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,590
Now on a static image like this it doesn't really show off what is really going on.

204
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,790
However if we go to the 3-d view and I go and grab the lamp I'm just going to leave it like this for

205
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,300
the moment on this no subdivision level.

206
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,820
I go and grab the lamp and just randomly rotate it's for.

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,290
There we go we can see the shadows are changing.

208
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,670
That in itself is incredibly powerful.

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,820
That means that the light hitting that surface is being affected by our normal map.

210
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,130
And there we go.

211
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,850
That looks like the sun or whatever it is if this was an asteroid is pretty low in the sky.

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,130
Now of course if we go and select are object that we are working on again and bump that up a couple

213
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,850
of levels we can see that we can still use our normal map to great effect without the normal map turned

214
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,180
out well we can test that we can simply unplug it and you can see immediately the difference.

215
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,310
This is what it looks like without the normal map.

216
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,210
We put that normal map on and boom it suddenly comes alive.

217
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,150
Amazing.

218
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,750
How are you guys getting on.

219
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,510
Did you make a funky shape yourself if you did or you applied this to some other model that you're working

220
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:53,660
on.

221
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,100
I'd love to see the results you've come up with.

222
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,680
Please share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
