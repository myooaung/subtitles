00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to fracturing with the grease pencil.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.350
So this is all about manual destruction.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.470
But this time with drawing which gives us even more control over how the object will fracture.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.100
Now this probably is about as manual as you want to get before it starts getting to owner risk to do

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.010
anything.

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.070
Okay so in a few moments we're going to show you how to set up the grease pencil to work with the fracture

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.430
tool because if you just use it by default it won't work.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.550
There's one setting that we've got a nail and then we're going to be using the grease pencil for fracture

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.510
guides.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.630
So let's go hop straight on over in a blender.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
Okay so before we jump in and start scribbling over our model with the greasepaint So we need to make

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.750
sure we've got a few things ready.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060
First of all I want a campus to be able to draw on.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.190
And this cube is not going to be quite right for me so I'm going to scale it on the z axis by point

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.270
1 so it's nice in then on the scale again on the without being on the z axis.

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.940
Though get eight.

17
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.900
That's plenty big enough.

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.950
I'm also going to apply the scale at this point with the right set of keys control and a scale.

19
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.000
Perfect.

20
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.630
So before we start scribbling on it we need to open up a 3D editor properties panel go down to where

21
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.510
it's his grease pencil and we need to change this to objects so that the grease pencil and the fracture

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.610
tool talked to one another.

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.940
Right.

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.370
So let's get rid of the tool shelf zoom around to the top and the properties window then that's gone

25
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.070
as well.

26
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.620
Orthographic projection viewed from the top.

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.370
Perfect.

28
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.460
And also going to get rid of the time line here.

29
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.840
It's just not needed.

30
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
So let's start by just drawing a single line.

31
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.270
I'm holding down the d key.

32
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.610
Grease pencils a single line.

33
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.690
I open up the cell fractured soul go to greasepaint So I'm not going to change any other settings.

34
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.510
And let's see what happens.

35
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.820
Okay so it looks like.

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.140
Excellent so the splintering seems to almost be perpendicular.

37
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.440
Come I'm calling it splintering here the fracturing seems to be almost perpendicular to that particular

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.270
line that I drew.

39
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.650
Okay so let's just undo that and see what happens with three lines saying to draw one line on this side

40
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.950
and one line on this side.

41
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.850
And let's do the same thing again.

42
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.560
Space enter grease pencil.

43
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.400
Okay.

44
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay excellent So what we're seeing here is the grease pencil itself isn't drawing where the fractures

45
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.860
are going to be.

46
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.740
That's quite important.

47
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.960
It's drawing a line guiding where the fractures are going to be.

48
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.680
So the fractures aren't necessarily following this exact path.

49
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.650
Let's go back to where those lines are so we can see them to a line here.

50
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.600
Line here the line here.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.820
In fact just so we know what's going on I'm going to go to the scene settings and read draw these lines

52
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.430
just so we can see them as well roughly as they are when we go over to our other objects.

53
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.700
So over here so we can see what's going on select everything.

54
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.450
All there we get so we can see here that it splits between these lines almost equally.

55
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.570
Okay so what happens if we join this line up perhaps with a spiral or a circle.

56
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.060
Let's try that.

57
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.920
So this point I'm just going to get rid of those points completely and on the object I'm going to make

58
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.880
sure I'm on the right object here so we can actually select that thing just get rid of it that's probably

59
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.680
be the quickest way rather than just the leting it going to go back round to the top.

60
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.090
Orthographic I'm just going to delete the grease pencil I've already done on the objects and making

61
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.410
sure it's his object.

62
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.010
Let's draw some concentric circles.

63
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.870
So one.

64
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.720
Soo.

65
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.430
The re I'm just driven.

66
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.470
Draw an absolute squiggle down the side there and see what happens.

67
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.290
You know this is one of these things where experimentation is going to reward you now because we've

68
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.400
got a few other bits to break up.

69
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm going to turn that up to maybe 200.

70
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.190
So there can be more shards.

71
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.240
How about that.

72
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.080
We've actually got shattering happening in a circle.

73
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.240
Now you may notice that when glass breaks sometimes it breaks in that type of pattern.

74
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.700
Again if you are trying to emulate something from the real world I would strongly recommend you're using

75
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.110
reference material.

76
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.750
Let's go have a look at how that looks.

77
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.900
That is awesome.

78
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.470
So I could just imagine something has impacted this bang in the middle there.

79
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.810
So let's make sure once again.

80
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.130
Well I'm going to say let's make sure I'm probably not going to correct it at this point in time.

81
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.940
But let's check and see how this behaves when you apply physics to it.

82
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.060
So just going to apply active body with no gravity whatsoever and basically make sure it doesn't throw

83
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.510
itself for parts because if you're starting from a model that spontaneously explodes on you and by the

84
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.880
way it's not I know the timeline's not here but with Oulton a we can see it's running through just here.

85
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.680
So that is already a great start.

86
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.250
Now of course we can have a bit of fun with that.

87
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.470
We can literally let's add something else to the scene rather than playing about so in object mode.

88
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.990
I'm going to add in a what shall I had Eevee sphere almost like a ball hitting it and then give that

89
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.400
active as well.

90
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.160
And then I can literally just lower it in there and smash just comes through.

91
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.100
How cool is that sauce.

92
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.450
Okay guys.

93
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.390
That's it for the grease pencil.

94
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.480
Have lots of fun with it.

95
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.600
Remember to share your particular work what did you come up with when you played with this boom.

96
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.820
Oh it's just research.

97
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.860
I love it without with Lawyer.

98
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.590
Okay.

99
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.610
I stopped doing that.

100
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.880
Now remember to show your work over on the forums and I will see you guys pile on a move too quick in

101
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.190
the next lecture.
