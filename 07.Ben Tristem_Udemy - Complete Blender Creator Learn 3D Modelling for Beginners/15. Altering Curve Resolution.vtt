00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.670
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.820
In this lecture we're going to get our lamp base looking that much better.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.180
Now in the previous section we were working on low poly it's time to move on from that.

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.940
Now the opposite of low poly isn't unnecessarily high geometry just making a high poly for the sake

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.270
of it.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.570
It's all to do with making sure that it appears nice and smooth and has the appropriate level of detail.

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.710
Let's go back to before this and find out more.

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.470
Okay so this is what it was looking like before you can see it's quite jagged around the edge here.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.260
It's pretty detailed on the way of the profile and how it's moving down.

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.930
And as we tinker with things we may have to go backwards and forwards to the profiles to just change

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.810
how it's looking.

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.130
So the first thing I'm going to encourage you to do is look at your model in wireframe mode.

13
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.450
It's going give us an idea of the vertical and horizontal nature of the mesh and we can see straightaway

14
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.310
it's not even the lines that come down our model.

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.640
They're just not of the same quality as the ones going around.

16
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.810
You can see the ones going around our model are much more numerous.

17
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.970
So we're gonna get a lot smoother geometry going down our model and not that much going round which

18
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.270
is why it looks jagged and smooth at the same time.

19
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.970
Now the way that we change those is by going into our curve data and adjusting the resolution.

20
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.360
Now the vertical ones here are driven by this curve itself.

21
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.950
The lamp base path.

22
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.550
So if I set that 12 we should get a much smoother object and the same is true with the profile.

23
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.490
Now what we really want to do is make sure that these bits of geometry are roughly even.

24
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.300
Now they start off small and get larger so they can't be exact but providing that the entire surface

25
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.000
is pretty even going around.

26
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.230
That is a good state to be in what is not necessarily a good state to be in is having it look like that's

27
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.740
where we've got two bits running around here and that's it.

28
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.610
So you can see here.

29
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.190
The other thing to bear in mind is at a certain point you lose the shape that you intended.

30
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.020
So this resolution is no good would have to increase increase increase until we get to the right shape

31
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.010
that we want.

32
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.190
And as I said you may have to go back into the profile shape and tweak it so you get what you want.

33
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.030
Now one way of making things high poly without making them high poly is to lower the resolution of everything

34
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.340
to a reasonable amount.

35
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.930
Let's go for enforcing.

36
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.220
We can see that's quite low poly almost back to where we were.

37
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.760
The chess scene if we went and shaded it flat.

38
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.550
Yes sir.

39
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.030
It's just a bit more detailed.

40
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.950
But what we can do is we can go to our modifiers tab and add a modifier which is a subdivision surface

41
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.550
and you can see here how that low poly very quickly set it back to shades move becomes high poly again

42
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.520
but we've lost that level hump there.

43
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.390
So this is where we might have to go back to our profile and adjust its accordingly.

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.240
And with that in mind it's time for your challenge and your challenge is to tweak your curve profile

45
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.510
and curve resolutions and get a good balance between the two.

46
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.430
So we end up with a good topology a good set of geometry across our model and what we're aiming for

47
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.240
is to use as little of that geometry as possible and then use a subsurface modifier to increase the

48
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.570
detail amount.

49
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.710
And as you're doing this don't be afraid to go back and forwards tweaking the curve resolution the curve

50
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.720
profile to get the shape you want pause the video now and give that a go

51
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.970
Hello everybody and welcome back.

52
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.980
Let's hop on over into blender and get our lamp base looking pretty high Polly.

53
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.440
OK.

54
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.990
So we left off here before.

55
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.580
Now I'm going to crank up the actual subdivisions to three and I'm going to see what I can do with much

56
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.690
lower geometry.

57
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.050
Go back to our curves now as we can see here a certain point is actually shrinking our lamps so we'd

58
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.280
have to make things bigger if we tried to do that.

59
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.280
But we can probably oh I don't know about this let's go to wireframe Yeah we can definitely go all the

60
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.960
way down to two on this one with three subdivisions we can go down to two but it's significantly smaller

61
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.760
than it was when we started.

62
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.740
So what we need to do is have a good idea of where we're going to.

63
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.660
Which is around here a couple of ways that you can mark on here but I'm just going to put the 3d cursor

64
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:57.890
there then I know when we're back down at 2 I can scale up to the right place apply that scale that's

65
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.210
important.

66
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.900
Let's have a look at the profile resolution and we can look down on this to work out how even we can

67
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.220
make it.

68
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.210
So at one that's about right.

69
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.860
But we lose this little indent can we adjust our lamp profile to have that make some sense.

70
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.330
I don't think we can because looking at this there's only one two three four points in the entire thing.

71
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.990
It's pretty straight.

72
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.860
So we need to increase that's a little.

73
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.850
And I think we're going to need at least that's to get there.

74
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.080
And what we can do is really exaggerate this by dragging the handle.

75
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.300
Oh I've hidden it very easy to do alternates to bring that back.

76
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.200
Select the handle and look at it from the top and just move it all the way across to make that much

77
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.010
more extreme turn.

78
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.760
Let's have a look.

79
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.590
Are our objects.

80
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.030
Yes looking pretty good.

81
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.470
Now I am going to go g here X and move it along as well because what's all of that has done as it's

82
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.610
pushed it slightly out.

83
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.860
Let's have a look at this.

84
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.990
In rendered mode.

85
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.890
Yes that looks much better it's well-defined.

86
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.410
Might be a little steep actually now that I've done that to it.

87
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.050
Let's have a closer look remember and to turn back to selection mode.

88
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.800
Yeah I'd say that was probably just a little bit too steep and this is all about your artistic decisions

89
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.010
at this point in time and I can pretty much see that that's probably too too steep if we have a look

90
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.290
at it let's go back into wireframe.

91
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.960
Yes and I think that just stems here from this handle here.

92
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.260
I can obviously push it and make it really steep but it stems from a mixture of this handle here and

93
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.370
this one here.

94
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.830
If I keep it at this angle but just move it so it's a shorter handle.

95
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.270
We should get less of a horrible transition.

96
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.560
Yes.

97
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.950
That's much better.

98
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.810
And that's really really subjective.

99
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.960
It does depend what you're trying to work on.

100
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.750
Let's make sure we've got the selected circle orbits around it.

101
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.440
There we go.

102
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.980
Pretty good.

103
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.930
Let's focus on here.

104
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.520
Yes I'm happy with that.

105
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.990
One of the things you do have to watch for is if you've got two little geometry running around here

106
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.400
which I don't think we do.

107
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.260
If you subdivide it it can end up a less circular.

108
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.320
And it does look fine from above.

109
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.810
So I'm happy with that.

110
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.310
What have we got in total 9000 now.

111
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:30.900
Common sense here would say that 9000 is a little bit on the high side for just the base of our lamp.

112
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.540
It's not that detailed either.

113
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.570
So I'm gonna go into here and turn down the subdivisions that we've got

114
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.790
and see if that's enough.

115
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.590
So we're down to 2000.

116
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.830
It does look pretty smooth still.

117
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:59.060
If I turn the actual outline off by just selecting something else or moving away you can see that it

118
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.850
still is a little bit jagged.

119
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.020
So I'm going to go back to the drawing board a little bit here is these vertical ones so we need to

120
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:14.520
make sure that we've got the path selected and just increase that by one or two for two there were back

121
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.730
to around 4000 not quite as high as before.

122
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.870
Gonna have to shrink that back down to how it should have been before.

123
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.240
Which I think's about there.

124
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.560
I did move the 3d cursor.

125
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.780
Let's bring our lamp back in and check.

126
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.730
Scale that back up to the right size height that away again.

127
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.250
Okay.

128
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.980
Yes.

129
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.370
That looks much better and I'm happy with that number of triangles.

130
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.480
Now later on.

131
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.050
Incidentally we will learn about things like normal mapping so that won't be till the next section.

132
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:51.600
But what we could do at this point is bake for normals of how this looks and put that map onto a lower

133
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.480
poly version of this and then it will look smooth.

134
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.310
The only thing we've still got to watch out for is the edge and it's inclusion because the moment you

135
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.820
move round to the side you start seeing those jagged edges again.

136
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.290
So that's the difficulty just making sure it still looks nice and circular.

137
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.740
And obviously the rest of the geometry is driven from that.

138
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.020
So that's what we've got.

139
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.820
Okay.

140
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.490
Brilliant.

141
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.670
Please share your lamp bases over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
