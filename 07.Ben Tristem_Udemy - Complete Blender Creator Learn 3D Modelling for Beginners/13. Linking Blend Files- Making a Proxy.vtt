00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.120
Welcome to linking blend files making a proxy in this video you will learn more about linking data blocks.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.290
Understand what is happening when you leap.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.230
Realize that when.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.140
Realizing of course when you need to use a proxy.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.580
And we already got some issues at the moment that we can't move are linked objects.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.670
Perhaps that's a clue of what's coming next.

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.730
So about making a proxy.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.540
What is happening in the background is it creates a new object that is a parent of the linked data and

9
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.080
what that in turn allows us to do is transformation of an object.

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.030
It allows us to edit the parent the new object that's been created the proxy object that's been created

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.800
and that allows us to do things like scale move rotate etc. and it also allows us to change the object

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800
properties of the parent which in turn will modify the linked data.

13
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.290
Otherwise it's exactly the same as the linked file.

14
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.580
It is identical to the source file that you brought in to Blender the object data blocks is linked to

15
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.630
the original and any dependent data blocks as well.

16
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.800
So if you've got you will probably have a mesh data in there but you might have imported lamps that

17
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320
won't be there but that will have like properties.

18
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.930
So in a mesh data when you brought that in so you will have the object data block you'll probably have

19
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.170
a mesh data block along with that.

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.430
And if you've got materials applied to that those are come across and any textures as well.

21
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.350
So let's go experience making a proxy over in blender.

22
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.840
Oh okay of course we're on our way to a blender at the moment and first of all we need to make the commit

23
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.790
message what we're going to do in this case it's going to be the title of the video that I'm doing of.

24
00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.790
And in your case it's going to be making my Linked objects a proxy or something along those lines or

25
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.930
of course if you're working on something else in between.

26
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.320
Remember to give it an appropriate name so you know what you've done right now that that is done.

27
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.820
We're ready to hop home over in a blender.

28
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.740
I just want to say at this point this is going to be the last time I'm actively going to be showing

29
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.060
you source tree working in the background.

30
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.410
I'll just be doing this as I progress.

31
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.910
Please do continue making your commits whenever you make major changes to your model because it's going

32
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.070
to allow you to go back if you have a problem.

33
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.880
We'll be visiting how to go back in a future lecture.

34
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.180
So don't worry about that.

35
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.340
That's still coming.

36
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.940
But otherwise you won't see much of sourced tree from now onwards right.

37
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.660
So now we're back over in lendu we've got a series of linked objects and we can see the outline of their

38
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.330
links because they have this little bits of paper on them with the arrow which means they're link to

39
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.300
a another blend far.

40
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.240
We can't see anything at the moment because we shove them all on too late too.

41
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.470
So let's go over to layer 2 now that's looking pretty good and we need to make these things a proxy

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.950
which will allow us to move them and therefore construct our church from these pieces.

43
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.720
Or your interior building if you're working on something different.

44
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.090
So I'm going to select that.

45
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.210
Now this is an object operation so we can go down to the objects menu and if we go up here we've got

46
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.090
make proxies about half way down the menu and you can see the shortcuts there are control Oulton.

47
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.570
P When we do that we get an okay message.

48
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.920
So we have to click again.

49
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.540
And now it is a proxy so we can see here that it's ever so slightly different.

50
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.000
It's been renamed underscore proxy.

51
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.970
And if we open it up it's got a little bit of a hierarchy.

52
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.630
We've got a linked church vault mesh down here and the linked object there as well.

53
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.350
So this is great.

54
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.770
This is showing us that it is a proxy it's renamed it for us.

55
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.340
And now of course what we can't do with any of the others is move it about and translate it in our world.

56
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.570
We can even rotate it and scale it.

57
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.460
Of course what we do have to be careful with is the whole scaling thing.

58
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.190
That's one of the reasons why I've made a series of church floors here because later on when I go to

59
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.830
apply a texture to those floors or walls or wherever if I decide to scale that object.

60
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.790
So for instance the church floor that's two by two can quite easily be scaled to fit even a two by four

61
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.080
or four by four.

62
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.800
However the textures will also stretch.

63
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.540
So with the church floor four by four what would have to do is remap the textures.

64
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.280
But if we've got the original object already mapped properly and will go into that soon then we don't

65
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.790
have to worry about stretching it and re rejigging all of the texture mapping to sort that out so that's

66
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.260
why I've got a series of objects there with the walls and everything else.

67
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.060
I think I'm going to be filed the settings that I've got.

68
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.660
I'm just going to undo the movement that I've done with this particular.

69
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.570
Church of here.

70
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.170
And of course I've got a very quick challenge for you guys.

71
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.990
I would like you to proxy or linked files some make the rest of your linked objects proxy's in your

72
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.740
scene.

73
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.160
Balls of video now and give that ago.

74
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.690
Okay guys.

75
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.670
Welcome back.

76
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.030
Let's go make those other linked files proxies.

77
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.730
I'm going hop into a blender.

78
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.020
And here we go.

79
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.590
Now I am just going.

80
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.870
I've not tried this.

81
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.530
I'm going to try selecting all of these going to object and make proxy.

82
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.890
No it's only done the selected one.

83
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:47.310
I think you do control all tempy make proxy control or to make proxy select it control orders and make

84
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.430
proxy make sure your cursor is not over the outline.

85
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.890
But over the 3-d editing window itself.

86
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.520
Otherwise you'll shortcut key is not going to work if I trying use it whilst I'm still over the outliner.

87
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.770
It's not going to do anything.

88
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.570
So make sure you're over the 3D editor window and there we go.

89
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:11.190
All of these have been made proxy's Finally I need to make sure I've saved my blend file and then if

90
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:18.750
I hop on over into source tree I can see my uncommitted changes which will be my Gothic church blend

91
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.230
file which is the scene I'm creating and my read me updating what I've done.

92
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.990
Perfect.

93
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.910
So let's stage those files go to commit.

94
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.680
And of course the name is correct.

95
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.340
Their hit commit and we're sorted.

96
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.920
Brilliant.

97
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.460
How did you guys get on how we're almost ready now to start constructing our church but we've got one

98
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.880
more thing to learn about when it comes to linking files and that so we can have some more control over

99
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.690
these files locally within this blend file.

100
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.040
But I would be discussing that in the next lecture.
