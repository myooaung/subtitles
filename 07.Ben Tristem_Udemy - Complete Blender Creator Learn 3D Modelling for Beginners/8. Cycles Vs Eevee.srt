00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,680
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,310
I'll show you a couple of examples.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,200
But often when you say cycles vs. eevee or something versus something else is always a matter of which

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,180
one is better.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,150
And I'll tell you what neither.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,200
It does really depend on what you're trying to do there are some high level features that aren't available

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,850
in TV and there are some that you just can't do in cycles as quick.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,000
OK.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,440
So let's focus on eevee to begin with there are two main points here and there are hundreds of little

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,240
ones as well.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,460
But eevee is generally quick and you get a very good result quickly so you end up with something that

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,130
you can present to someone and not have had to wait hours for it to render out which can happen with

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,350
cycles with more complex scenes.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,390
Now eevee isn't always instant.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,240
That's something that is a bit of a falsehood spreading around evey is something that sometimes takes

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,260
four or five seconds to render a scene even up to 20 I've seen in some more complex scenes.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:10,370
But the same scene in cycles would have probably taken significantly longer now cycles is a physical

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,200
based renderer it is accurate but it takes longer.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,760
It's designed for GP use but runs fine on CPD as well.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,050
And we'll see later on how that differs depending on the type of system that you have.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:31,250
But basically cycles sends rays out from the camera back to the light source and works out lots and

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,070
lots of different bounces eevee does not do that.

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,530
So cycles is good for reflections.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,870
It will accurately represent them even uses something called screen space reflections.

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,210
So if it's not on the screen it's not getting reflected and that can be a problem if you're trying to

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,610
reflect something that's behind the camera.

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,140
Now we are going to be focused on cycles in this section because we're modelling a lamp never to a cross

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,030
compatible as well so we're able to switch from eevee to cycles to test things.

29
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,180
And that's very useful if you are testing out movement and things like that where you want materials

30
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,040
on your model.

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,340
But we will be looking at the lighting specifically from the cycles point of view.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,750
But remember you can swap forward and back.

33
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,880
Now there are other renderings as well that you can plug into blender so cycles in the movie are just

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,430
two different rendering engines.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,680
They count collate materials and lighting differently but we won't be covering any of those extra rendering

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,240
engines in this course render time difference is a big one.

37
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,630
I will just shown you.

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,760
Well let's bring it up now.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,820
So here we've got two clips of the bowling ball physical animation that we've done.

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,410
So we've got eevee here and cycles eevee is on the left and cycles is on the right.

41
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,970
They both look pretty similar.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,030
So in this particular case I would put forth the argument that whichever one you're using it's fine

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,170
but I'd prefer to use eevee in this case because it gives just as good a result and so much quicker

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:09,620
the render on the left took four minutes to do the render on the right took 40 minutes to do that significantly

45
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:18,240
longer for very very little quality difference now your machine specs can make a big difference as well.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,160
Lots of different machines out there so you may be running a lower end machine you may be running a

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
massively powerful computer.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,890
This will make a big difference to cycles and it will make somewhat of a difference to evey the more

49
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,330
powerful your system the quicker it's going to do things that's pretty standard.

50
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,000
But the thing I've noticed with cycles is that it scales.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,120
So the more cores in your CPE the better the more powerful your graphics card the better.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,300
You can even use your CPA and GP you together in certain circumstances with cycles and we'll look at

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,260
that in a bit and render out out even faster.

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,610
But in my experience if they're not balanced it's probably not worth doing.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,570
So to sum that all up there isn't a better renderer.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,930
It really does depend on what you're trying to achieve.

57
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,120
If you're making assets that will ultimately end up in a game engine you may want to focus on eevee

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,020
but as you will find out in later sections that we can't do all of our baking that's necessary where

59
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,540
we solidify textures and materials for export.

60
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,980
Some of that will have to be done in cycles.

61
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,780
So we do have to hop between the two depending on what we're trying to achieve but eevee is much more

62
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:38,230
on par with a game engine set up then cycles is cycles takes a lot longer to calculate because it's

63
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,600
more physically accurate and as we will go through the course you will see between even cycles.

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,950
There are some things that are just not possible on TV which are on cycles and vice versa.

65
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,110
So that's it for this lecture we've had a quick comparison between cycles and eevee will die off a bit

66
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,850
deeper as we progressed through this section and the rest of the course with the differences between

67
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,510
the two.

68
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,580
Just remember one isn't better than the other.

69
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,970
It really does depend on what you're trying to achieve and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
