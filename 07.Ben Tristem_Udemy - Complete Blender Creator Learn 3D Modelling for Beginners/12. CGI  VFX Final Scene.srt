00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,160
Welcome to the CGI of VFX a final scene.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,700
Very excited because we're going to bring this all together now.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,530
So this is going to be initially all about getting everything ready.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,810
We're going to import assets that you wish to using your scene adjust your camera's view if it's slightly

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,760
out here you'll see what I mean about that in a few moments.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,930
And then finally get the ground ready for shadows.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,270
So let's go get everything ready now and hop on over in a blender.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,020
So we have the cube in our scene and it's mapped out relatively well.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,770
I'm happy with all of that.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,940
One of the first things we should do is just make sure that these sort of empties these little crosses

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,290
that are on the scene are actually in the right place in our world and they are all on the ground.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,850
Now I can pretty much guess with some degree of accuracy that this whole thing is flat and if it is

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,780
all flat all of these should exist on the same point.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,250
So let's whiz round and check this out in orthographic projection.

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,350
And from the side so we should find that all of these line up and they don't.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
All of these are slightly tilted as we can see.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,320
One empties up the top here and the others are below.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,500
Now they're going to be scattered about ever so slightly.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,710
However what we can do is rotate the camera and make sure we've got the camera selected rotated on its

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,560
x axis and let's bring it up so they're all roughly level.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,590
That's good.

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,100
And then just bring it down ever so slightly to the y axis.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,500
And I'm just going to rotate the Omni access is just a little bit more and I'm happy with how all of

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,730
those are laid out.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,310
We can also just check for any sideways motion as well from the other way.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,360
But that looks pretty much straight now the camera is definitely and fully set up.

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,260
So these empty empties are crossing through the ground plane.

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,990
Now the cube itself that can go completely and this ground plane here this is what we are going to use

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:17,430
for our shadows so let's make sure that scaled up appropriately to capture any shadows of our models.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,700
Now I'm going to have to toggle the ground on and off.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:29,310
I'm going to be wanting to place a plane there on the runway so I'm going to go ahead and spend on him.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:37,480
Go ahead and find the there where it's Section 10 assets models F 22 flying objects F 3 2.

33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,910
Wow it's huge.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,030
That is no good.

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,900
Well first of all let's make sure it's located in the right place in our scene and then scale it accordingly.

36
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,860
So I'm going to whiz round and the side is going to have to be there.

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,770
And if we look at it in 3-d space it'll have to be there and it's going to have to be lifted up ever

38
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,590
so slightly.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,530
Let's see what that looks like in the scene.

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,160
That is a wee bit large.

41
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,460
Dorner hide that one hide this.

42
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:16,640
And now we can rotate it locks to the z axis that's pointing down our runway and then we'll just scale

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
it down accordingly.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Now as you scale it is going to scale a way from the plane itself Summerset the pivot point to the 3D

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,720
cursor vanished scale towards the 3-d cursor.

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,110
I didn't start with a mouse far enough away so didn't have very granular control.

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,420
And I'm going to make sure it's semi realistic in terms of its size.

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,820
And I can go ahead and start animating that as well.

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,550
And one of the ways that you can animates to make sure things work out well is whiz round to the top.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,290
And we've got a set here now I don't know where the end of the runway is so before I do anything else

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,820
I can go back to the camera view and let's add in a key frame.

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,700
So at the beginning it's going to be where it currently is.

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,340
So it's go to frame 1 or in this case frame to key in the location and rotation data.

54
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,410
Now as the camera pans round it's going to come into view.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,100
And by the time it's at frame 48 so to be at least at the end of the runway so I'm going to move it

56
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,510
but only on the y axis.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,110
But in the press the y axis again so moving it's along its own y axis I can move that to the end of

58
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,490
the runway and press I and I again.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,920
And now as we play it back quickly we will see it moving along the runway.

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Now one of the things to bear in mind is that all of these movements will be naturally s curved so he'll

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,690
slow down between each key for it and that can produce something very unnatural to get around that you

62
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,340
would need to switch to the graph Ed as we've done in the past.

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,210
Instead of having these nice smooth transitions with the handles in this case just along the y axis

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,350
where you can adjust those handles if you want or indeed go to the handle type hit V and make it a vector

65
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,570
type that will work as well.

66
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,840
In fact you can select everything and hit V and go to vector and that kind of makes things nice and

67
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,150
linear to work with.

68
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:26,670
Not very good for organic movements or perhaps things that naturally need to slow down or you need curves

69
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,660
to control them.

70
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,780
But for setting up scenes like this this can be handy to have things moving linearly So they're not

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,570
sort of slowing and speeding up because once the plane starts going it's not going to suddenly slow

72
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,830
to turn a corner.

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,600
It can do that very easily.

74
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:51,390
So there's lots more to do in terms of moving things along and setting up nodes and now it is time for

75
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,750
your final challenge in this section.

76
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,660
It is time to finish your scene.

77
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,740
Set your samples and resolution low.

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,570
This will speed up your work flow a lot.

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,440
I can't impress as much as possible as you don't wait around for ages to get samples going create any

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,850
animations you want to use.

81
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,420
I've got a little bit more to go with mine as you're going through.

82
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,830
Check your animations are good.

83
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,850
At this stage in the course we really want the plane.

84
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,820
If you're doing a plane or whatever your animating really want it to look like it's part of the scene

85
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,160
and not separate.

86
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,080
Set up your nodes as per the still image.

87
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,950
Remember a movie is simply a series of still images played back one after the other.

88
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,960
Now when you go to your nodes and go to your compositing know what you'll see is there's already something

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,250
already set up.

90
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,550
Now in this case you could use that to move forward.

91
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,720
However I would recommend deleting what's currently there and setting it up afresh see you get the hang

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,460
of putting these things together.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,910
Finally up those samples up that resolution and render your final scene and share balls of video now

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
and give that a go.

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,390
Wow okay guys welcome back.

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
How did you get on.

97
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:23,010
Well it's time for me to go in and go through the stages I've done to finish off my scene.

98
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,950
So let's hop back on over into a blender.

99
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,920
Okay so this is my scene so far.

100
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,160
I will just make this a bit larger so I can show it to you guys.

101
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,470
And so all I'm failing in pressing the right keys on the computer that doesn't help.

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,830
So I'm just going to turn off the ground plane here so we can see what's going on so we got the planes

103
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,650
coming in from the side.

104
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,350
This plane taking off and then these planes will bank away.

105
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,850
The final move.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,090
Looking good now the first thing we need to make sure is just what happens when we go and render our

107
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,810
scene.

108
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:11,410
We get the movie and I do mean the movie because on the video sequence Ed we've still got our time line

109
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,780
our video here playing.

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,090
We're not going to use that at the moment.

111
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,250
In combination with the compulsive Teddy's her son literally just going to remove fat from our scene

112
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,960
and save my work now I've done that.

113
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,780
When we go back over and go and render our scene.

114
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,890
We kind of almost get a result but it's really horrible.

115
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:42,370
First of all I'm going to make sure I got CPR rendering turned on which I have done at 10 percent of

116
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,620
4 k..

117
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,410
That's fine.

118
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:54,500
And Wolf we got down here in terms of samples sampling and Willa up my render to five stars.

119
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,920
Glass got a little more detail let's go for it.

120
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,380
Well as we come through that's fine.

121
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,580
Let's go to a place where we should be able to see more of the planes.

122
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,790
Okay so something's going on it's not quite right.

123
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,930
That's fine I wasn't expecting it to be working straightaway.

124
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,330
Let's go have a look at the node editor.

125
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,600
Well I haven't created that but it's been kindly added in for me.

126
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,710
Bit confusing.

127
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,060
Yes.

128
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,610
So rather than going through and trying to recreate all of this lots or rather move it around so it

129
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,710
all fits.

130
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:40,540
I'm going to remove the bits that I know are at the moment just rubbish.

131
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,980
So let's get rid of that.

132
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,110
This undistorted I'm not gonna need that.

133
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,660
However I will want the scale just like we have before with single image.

134
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,000
This time it's for the movie.

135
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,460
We want the render size.

136
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,300
Be fine.

137
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,500
Yep.

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,320
And we want it to fit so it doesn't matter what size scene we have it fits our scene how what size resolution

139
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,630
we have here it automatically scales accordingly.

140
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,870
So that's the top bit done.

141
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,700
And we've got one render layer sorted here and the other one is not.

142
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,540
Let's go have a look at the render layers.

143
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,780
So you got foreground and background that is not that intuitive but we certainly don't know is where

144
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,710
things are situated at the moment.

145
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,020
So we've got our ground plane which is going to take our shadows this turn that's on.

146
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,770
There we go we've shadows through our ground plane here.

147
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,080
And that is on layer 10.

148
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,210
Fine.

149
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,950
Everything else is also on by a 10.

150
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,400
So we need to move the ground plane to a different layer.

151
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm simply going to move it to.

152
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,820
Or layer.

153
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh it's on both layers.

154
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,560
Is it.

155
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,890
That's interesting.

156
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,380
Let's move it to just layer one for the moment.

157
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
Perfect.

158
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,080
So now we have that on layer 1 we've got our planes on layer 10 all of them I believe.

159
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,620
Yup.

160
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,530
Now we need to give them a pass index.

161
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:09,800
I've set my plane so pass index of 1 so I can isolate them.

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,720
So that's that's all sorted.

163
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,580
And we've got the ground plane here.

164
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,550
So the final thing is on the rendle layers to set up the foreground and background foreground and background

165
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,040
doesn't really make any sense other than to call it whole scene.

166
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,550
And just ground so we can have the difference between the two and work it out from there.

167
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,720
Now we're going to have to have everything on here turned on and here.

168
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,520
We not going to mask anything off so that's Turn that off.

169
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,300
Excellent.

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,940
So on the whole scene we have everything rendered and it's just two layers of the scene renderings fine

171
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,900
on the just ground we want to exclude play.

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,820
Whatever layers this is.

173
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,950
This is like 10.

174
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,050
OK finally let's have a look at the lamp.

175
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:06,800
It's not sunlamp and I'm to have hard shallows one slightly softer than hard shadows but there we go

176
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,190
slightly fuzzy shadows but that's it for the moment.

177
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,830
I want the effect to be quite strong.

178
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,660
That looks fine to me.

179
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,890
Let's go in hit round and see how that comes out.

180
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,390
Well it won't come out as anything at the moment.

181
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,910
Why won't it come out as anything.

182
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:30,070
Well let's have a close look at the node editor and let's switch this back across to the road.

183
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,910
So at the moment nothing is plugged into the output do we have an output.

184
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes we have to on the board a select those and move them.

185
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,710
I didn't mean to move everything boots on to have moved them in so we can see what's going on.

186
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,120
Now I'm not going to use a backdrop here because I'm going to find it hard enough to see stuff as it

187
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,720
is.

188
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,500
But if we plug in the render layers into the compositors it auto renders we have that back out.

189
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Excellent.

190
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,630
So now it's just a matter of setting up a sim the settings as we had before.

191
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:08,950
Now notice down here we're missing index objects queening to go back into our render layers.

192
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,670
And on the passes of the object index an object index we don't need the vector outputs.

193
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,610
And on this one we've got some extra things as well.

194
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,880
We don't need those.

195
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,270
And then we reach render.

196
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,480
After we've done that right this should be ready to go and ready to link together.

197
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,180
Let's go ahead and do that.

198
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,750
Right.

199
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,080
Nodes nodes nodes.

200
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,680
These can always be a challenge to get right.

201
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm not only use my view I am gonna use the composite node I'm going and leave this as a 3D image editor

202
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,290
and we need to render we haven't rendered yet.

203
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,870
Let's go ahead and render.

204
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,440
Excellent.

205
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,370
So we got our planes and we got the just the ground itself as well.

206
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,990
Will a swap then round.

207
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,300
Okay so we're going to have to take all index objects.

208
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,550
I d.

209
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,900
From the ground and the planes are not sure if I've done the ground.

210
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,820
So let's just have a look at the grounds settings okay.

211
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,620
It's not got anything so set with the ground with the pass index of two.

212
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,520
Let's bring in the items.

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,250
I know we need so I need an I.D. mask.

214
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:29,290
And that is going to help us isolate the ground when we mixin the image after we've isolated the shadows

215
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,590
or what the difference is between the two.

216
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,220
And that's going to be an index of too because as the ground.

217
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,870
Let's move that to one side.

218
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm jumping ahead of myself we need to combine these two together.

219
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,900
So I'm going to add a colour mix and we're going to add them together keum add by dividing.

220
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,570
We're going to combine them with division.

221
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm going to put the image is in and the outputs that we get from here.

222
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,190
Plus it's strenth for commodities have a look should be bright white with anything.

223
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,110
That's exactly the same.

224
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,830
Because anything divided by anything exactly the same as one.

225
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,130
And any difference will actually be highlighted.

226
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,320
That's a great start to isolate the shadow.

227
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,620
And we've also isolated the planes themselves kind of bit but we're going to mask off the planes in

228
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,910
a few moments.

229
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,420
Let's now mix in our next bit so we've got this coming in.

230
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,700
We're going to have an I.D. mask here.

231
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,430
We're going to bring in our image itself that's starting to look.

232
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,370
A bit funky.

233
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,350
Have I got that the right arm dividing here.

234
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,910
I want to multiply.

235
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,930
We got that white layer that is looking good the shadow is also looking good.

236
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,250
Now let's plug it in.

237
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,270
Our Alpha layer here.

238
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,960
And that has brought back in our background but has made the rest disappear.

239
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,250
Have I got that the right way around I have gone the right way around.

240
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,690
Let's just rerun don't the make sure that everything's working.

241
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,060
How have there we go the shallows just by itself.

242
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,900
If in doubt re render and then if it doesn't work then you can be in doubt or something along those

243
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,420
lines.

244
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,020
Okay finally then we need to bring back in just the planes themselves who are going to be mixing the

245
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,560
planes with whatever's coming out of here.

246
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,810
So that's duplicate this multiplying node.

247
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,420
And we can use that as a starting point and plug in our planes.

248
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:37,300
Now we're just mixing together because we want the planes by themselves on top of our scene with a factor

249
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,100
of 100 where they are.

250
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,220
So we need another idees mask.

251
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,610
And using an I.D. mask of one here.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,180
So we've isolated that with saying any think that's the planes is 100 percent okay.

253
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,290
We've got that just the wrong way round.

254
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,030
Perfect.

255
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,020
Excellent stuff.

256
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,390
So let's just try that in any other place in the scene.

257
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,890
They'll If we move is that auto updating Well kind of it's moved the scene but it hasn't actually moved

258
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
forward our models.

259
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,550
So this is what they look like if they were just scooting around we do need to re render.

260
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,880
But that's okay because during a render there we go the planes just taking off.

261
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,140
And let's go back a little further.

262
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,310
Excellent so we've got the planes flying very low level over ground.

263
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,100
Hopefully they don't look like they're about to hit the ground.

264
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,660
That's crazy low level might be doing just that.

265
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,060
The final render.

266
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,140
But now is the first pass of my final animation now because it's my first pass.

267
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:44,170
I'm not too fussed about the quality I'm going to output this to my downloads folder and then I'm going

268
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:54,720
to set this to a year hand eight to six for encoding as an MPEG for the rest look so k..

269
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,900
Okay so this is slightly different in blender two point seven nine.

270
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,690
If we go ahead and scroll down to the output settings obviously we're going to change this once again

271
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,500
from a PRNG.

272
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
But those other options are not there.

273
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,630
But if we go ahead and pick MPEG video and I'm sure some of you have already worked that out under the

274
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,830
encoding Stetsons we can go down here and pick 8 2 6 4 in MP 4 and that would go we're in the same position

275
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,150
as we were before.

276
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,370
Remember it's about a decent output folder so you can bind your files as well.

277
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,040
And I'm going to call it this plane's first run.

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,910
Now it is important that I know what it is going to make sure that these settings are as low as possible

279
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't care about quality at this point and leave it set at five samples and I'm going to render out

280
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,070
this animation surrender render animation.

281
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:57,110
And as we can see here it's going to take several minutes to go through and render out all the individual

282
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,730
frames and put them all together into our final composite.

283
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,240
And I will see you guys back once this is rendered out.

284
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,120
And here we go see the planes taking off and the others fly past that looks great.

285
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,310
Apart from a little judder right at the very beginning as that plane taking off you see there it scoots

286
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,520
a little on the runway.

287
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,010
I think we can modify that.

288
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,150
We're ready for a full render.

289
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,950
Okay so here isn't a fool rendle Haven't gone as deep as that.

290
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,370
But what we have got here is a high resolution so we can see more of what's happening on the screen.

291
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,540
There's still a little bit of a judder on the runway something we can all fit well we always come across

292
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,380
things we can refine about your models but I'm really happy with that.

293
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,880
How did you guys get on.

294
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,670
I'd love to see your VFX and CGI.

295
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,390
Please show your work in the discussions.

296
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,590
And I will see you in the next lecture.
