00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome to the for an owl married.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.850
So what does this do.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:12.300
Well it makes things more physically accurate and that is because everything has a friend nele effect

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.530
in the real world and we go into more about what that is.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.990
In a moment now cycles does not do it by default so we have to mix some nodes together to make sure

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.540
we get the effect that we want.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.380
Now one of the things to remember is that if your surface has a low roughness it has a high amount.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.720
A friend now.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.830
So for instance anything that's glossy is going to exhibit this more than something that is rough.

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.020
So a high roughness equals a low amount for a now.

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.320
So how does it function.

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.550
Well simply put it calculates the proportion of incident lights of the light that is coming in from

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.510
our lamps from the environment from whatever that is reflected off of a surface versus the amount that

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.650
does something else.

15
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.050
Now I say does something else because it does depend on what surfaces some of it will obviously be absorbed.

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.680
Otherwise you wouldn't see the surface if we were talking about water and liquids.

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.710
Well is going to go through the surface and start lighting up the base of the pond or the lake or whatever

18
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.190
it happens to be.

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.770
So let's have a couple of looks at some real world examples.

20
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.490
So here we have the roof of a car now.

21
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.360
Cars are pretty reflective in general and you see that closest to us where we're looking at it's almost

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.340
straight on.

23
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.190
There's less reflection then if we go further along towards the other car you can see in the background

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.610
there.

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.970
So we end up with more of the lights going through and hitting the paint underneath the clear coat on

26
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.570
top of the car as it goes round so we see more of the base colour as we go around and further towards

27
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.460
the top of the car.

28
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.710
You can see more and more of the sky so you get more and more reflection.

29
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.540
The lower that angle of incidence is to the viewer here we have another example of a car where we've

30
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.310
got we can actually see the blue of the car and as we actually go further and further away from are

31
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.520
our straight on angle we get a white and that's obviously reflecting the sky in the sun.

32
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.560
And what we can see here this is the four an l effect happening so depending on the angle you're viewing

33
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.110
depends on the angle of reflected light that you're going to see.

34
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.280
Now a classic example of the for an l effect is something along the lines of this where we've got a

35
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.610
gorgeous scene in front of us and we pay attention to the water because that is the highly reflective

36
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.410
surface of this is an example of something with low roughness as all the others have been.

37
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.160
But this is extremely low roughnesses is going to have a high for an l effect.

38
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.130
So closest to the camera where we're almost looking through the water obviously we can't look into the

39
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.720
water on this particular shot but you can see more of the bottom so more of the light is being refracted

40
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.280
and hitting the base of the of the lake here and then being reflected now as we go further into the

41
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340
distance to the far end of the lake.

42
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.180
More and more of that light is being reflected rather than refracted and transmitted through the water.

43
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.720
Now here we have something that we've all experienced whether it's with a phone screen or a laptop screen

44
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.140
when the angle is not directly facing us.

45
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.010
We end up just seeing pure reflections of what's on the outside world rather than what we're trying

46
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.970
to look at.

47
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.750
This is something you can experiment with straightaway if you want to.

48
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.970
We can really see the effect in full flow.

49
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.520
So now we seen some real world effects of how the frenzel effect works.

50
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.370
Let's go explore this now and hop on over in a blender.

51
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.820
Okay so over on a default blend file now before I do anything else because I'm fed up of doing this

52
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.070
I'm actually going to modify my start-up file.

53
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.310
I want to select this lamp number of times I've now switched it to a sunlamp and change to the surface.

54
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.240
Use nodes.

55
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:26.220
That's NEWS NOTES here surface emission and set the strength to three the number of times I have had

56
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.530
to do something along those lines is getting a joke now.

57
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.780
So now I've done that.

58
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.820
What I can do is go ahead and save my start up far than the next time I go file a new.

59
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.560
It actually starts up with the lamp.

60
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.290
Perfect that's exactly what I want.

61
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.340
So when I go to rendered mode I actually get the bright uniform light across my scene.

62
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.900
I have to set up almost every time so I won't be setting them up any more because it's already done.

63
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.570
Okay so we've got our cube here and I'm just going to shift that back in our scene and again.

64
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.720
Well actually in this point what I can do is open up a previous file if I wanted to but I'm just going

65
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.600
to add a couple of objects into my scene.

66
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.050
Doesn't really matter where for the moment because we're going to see them reflected in the surface

67
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.660
in a few moments so.

68
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.540
One final object let's go for a cone.

69
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.390
Okay I'm going to turn snapping on so I can lift that up.

70
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.920
And the same with the cylinder and I'm just going to move that back in the cross slightly.

71
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.410
I'm going to put objects at slightly different places so I can see how the reflection changes with distance

72
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.860
in a few moments.

73
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.410
Kate.

74
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.270
Perfect.

75
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.820
I've managed to put that one relatively high.

76
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.180
The final thing I want to do is add in a plane along and scale that up to cover the entire lot.

77
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.440
The reason why I've added a plane is because this is going to become our reflective surface much like

78
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.160
The Lake is with the mountains and trees in it all in the background.

79
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.580
So all these low poly mountains and trees if you'd like.

80
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.220
So now we've got that setup.

81
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.540
I'm going to get rid of the tall shelf go into rendered mode make sure everything's working perfect.

82
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.420
Another shift this across so I can see still see what's going on in rendered mode.

83
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.470
But switch this one to the noda and I've gone to a vertical sort of workflow here rather than horizontal

84
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.930
and actually I'm going to get rid of those two will not get rid of them but pushed them to the side.

85
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.600
I'm going to add my alarm and make sure that selected the plane is selected and then create new material.

86
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.030
I am going to call this water doesn't have to be water but in this case it's going to be.

87
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.080
And we've got a set up here.

88
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.210
We've got diffuse going into a material output so that's the default material we've currently got.

89
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.920
So I need to show you guys where they're from l.a. is You might have seen it earlier if we go ahead

90
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.580
and add in input and friend now and there we go.

91
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.760
So that's now ready to be used in order to change the reflectivity of this surface based upon me angle

92
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.740
that you're looking at it.

93
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.520
Now one of the things we can do is actually hold down control and shift and click on for now and we

94
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.370
can see the effects in action so we can see that it's going to be a dark grey not black.

95
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.190
It will become darker and darker if you play with the Io.

96
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.940
Ah but we can see here it's dark grey when we're looking straight down.

97
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.000
So have a value close to zero.

98
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.040
And then as we get less and less as we start going down to a much shallower angle to that surface it

99
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.930
gets more white.

100
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.440
And as we can see here there's actually a gradient as well.

101
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.880
So we can see there that the which ordered to place things in as well.

102
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:54.360
We can see the gradient there from not quite zero maybe Point 1 or so on grey all the way up to one.

103
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.990
This will be white at the very top so that would be the most reflective.

104
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.420
So just set up the diffuse snoad as the main outputs again.

105
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.000
And then of course it's time for a challenge.

106
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.530
I'd like you to go ahead and set up for an l.a. SIR add the remaining shade as necessary to make the

107
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.150
friend node effective.

108
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.430
Remember we need a shallow angle furthest from the normal to be reflective.

109
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:31.640
And as we approach the normal off the surface for it to transition to another shader pause a video now

110
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.180
and give that a go.

111
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.650
Okay guys welcome back.

112
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.700
Let's go set up the four in l.a..

113
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.530
Okay so we're back over in blender and one of the first things that I need to do is decide on while

114
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.680
we need something reflective to begin with if we're going to make this work.

115
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.540
So let's go ahead and add in a gloss shader.

116
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.160
There we go.

117
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.620
So we now have two shaders to transition through.

118
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.420
So we need to mix these two together.

119
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.210
I'm going to use the node Wrangler shortcuts to do that.

120
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.700
There we go.

121
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:15.550
Got a shader plugged in and we need to change the front women factor here so where it's glossy or shady

122
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.830
so glossy here pure reflective just to test.

123
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.780
Of course I could use a control shift and click on it to us to isolate it.

124
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.140
Let's go back to the mix shaner.

125
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.560
We can see that the roughnesses say a point to so we're never going to get a decent reflection straight

126
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:29.820
off.

127
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.720
So let's lower that down to zero.

128
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:38.880
So we do get 100 percent reflection and we want it as we come up here to be.

129
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.610
Almost diffuse came with a tiny bit of reflection of course because it's not going to be there so that's

130
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.030
the factor in here and see what happens.

131
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.270
K. writes that is going the wrong way we can see that straightaway because it's not being highly reflective

132
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.870
when we're down here it's being highly reflective at the other end.

133
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:04.830
Kate So the next thing we need to do is swap these around then so let's swap them round if I'm going

134
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.780
to reorder them as well.

135
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.810
Just so it looks better.

136
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.440
It doesn't look nice if you've got things crossing over.

137
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.810
Okay so let's have a look at there now so it's diffuse all the way up here.

138
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.420
And it starts to get more and more glossy The further you come down.

139
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.280
Excellent.

140
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.580
Someone to drag this ball actually closer.

141
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.140
Oh it's.

142
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.240
Closer to us.

143
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.590
So we can see this far less reflection closer to the camera.

144
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.040
Then there is a way from the camera.

145
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.200
Okay that's perfect.

146
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.790
How did you guys get on did you play with certain things so we go back to the surface here.

147
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.970
Did you play with this Iowa to see what it does in fact.

148
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.280
Let's do that now.

149
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:53.950
I'm going isolate it first so we can see the pure what's actually going on so we keep it this shallow

150
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.730
angle so we can see almost no.

151
00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:58.720
Oh no.

152
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.670
Glossy coming through it all the way up to gloss coming through.

153
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:12.160
So here we have an eye o are one point four five oh if we lower that down we see that we get more.

154
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.720
All in fact if we go all the way down we get pure white.

155
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.640
We don't seem to be able to stop going up.

156
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.490
So is most effective lowering it because we get a much stronger gradient.

157
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:31.810
So this is going to really emphasize the fact it's not going to be glossy close and glossy further away.

158
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:38.680
I'm going to go for a valuable 1.0 and then control shift click on the mix shader again and just see

159
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.430
what's happening.

160
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:45.980
Okay so as you can see here it's at this sort of angle these are very reflective.

161
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.980
Well let's make this bigger.

162
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.090
So you guys can really see what's going on.

163
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.760
So at this angle you can hardly see the reflection of this sphere but you can see the reflection of

164
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.300
everything else in the distance.

165
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.190
That's perfect that's exactly what I wanted to achieve.

166
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.630
How did you guys get on please show your work.

167
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.950
In the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
