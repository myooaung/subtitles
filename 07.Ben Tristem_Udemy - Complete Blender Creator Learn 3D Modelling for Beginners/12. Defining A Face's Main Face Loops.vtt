00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome to defining a Faces main face loops.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.240
Now this is going to be the continuation of a challenge in the last lecture so let's crack on and hop

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.850
straight on over in a blender.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.280
Okay so we're back over in blender and I've got my head is coming along quite nicely and we've got no

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.690
no's at the moment.

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.940
We've got an eye loop although it's quite a basic one at the moment.

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.950
We've got this loop running around here in the loop and kind of the mouth loop done there we may have

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.330
to redo the mouth.

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.950
Or I might have to redo my mouth depending on how the rest of it goes.

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.850
And there is obviously an lack of knows at the moment.

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.560
Now looking at the geometry that's here just going to hide a couple of panels there so we can see what's

12
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.580
going on.

13
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.590
And I am actually going to just combine a couple of faces and with a dissolve this face here and dissolve

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.470
these two faces here.

15
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.830
And these two here.

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.170
And the reason for that is so I've got an edge loop down here but I can work with.

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.770
Now I'm also going to have to at the same time just dissolve these vertices.

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.700
Otherwise we won't have quads.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.500
Let's make sure that's working.

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.310
Excellent.

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.390
It is.

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.930
So before I actually start creating the nose I need to think about what's going to happen.

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.750
So I'm going to have an edge loop that runs under the eye and running down.

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.430
So let's pop that in now and then I'm going to have the bridge of the nose edge loop that will be coming

25
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.880
round and it will break off somewhere around here and flow down so the chain or just underneath the

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.310
chin depending on where I place it and that leaves us in fact at this point in time.

27
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.030
Before we go any further this floor grid that I've got I'm going to turn that off some time ago to display

28
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.340
a grid floor just not in the way.

29
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.210
So now I've got those edge loops in and defined.

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.560
I can literally if you remember in the last lecture one of the things you can do to create a five pole

31
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.830
is to extrude their riego So that will look a bit funny at the moment.

32
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.310
Remember things often don't look right when you're constructing them.

33
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.450
But we can move these bits about we can move that forward.

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.120
We can move this bit down.

35
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.050
It still doesn't negate the fact that now we've got an edge loop running around the nodes and that is

36
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.280
obviously going to have to have a lot of refinement to make it look more like a nose again.

37
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.670
But that is absolutely fine.

38
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.430
Okay so the next part of the head that we need to focus on here I wouldn't need to but the next one

39
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.380
I want to focus on is this bridge part here on the nose that's fine.

40
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.760
So we need to decide where this loop is going to come round I'm going to take it down to this part of

41
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.030
the chain and come up.

42
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.150
But we need to decide where to put those five parcels.

43
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.820
So were somewhat bounded by this going down here this face loop as it comes round so we can't go any

44
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.740
further than here.

45
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.260
So I'm going to place my five pole here and it's going to have to be here.

46
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.330
There's no other ones to go on.

47
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.610
So the first thing that we can do here is I'm going to grab the knife too and roughly cut to there.

48
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.600
Now I can't cut across how can I cut across there yes I can sir.

49
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.420
Triangle there initially and I'm going to solidify that knife cuts I'm going to put another trying goal.

50
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.800
Is it going to be up here to guide that loop around.

51
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.560
Yes it is.

52
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.380
It's going to be from here to here.

53
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.200
And of course usually we want to avoid Triangle's.

54
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.080
Now once we've done that we can actually make it into a quad by cutting down here.

55
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.760
Now that doesn't look right until you start shifting a couple of the vertices to maybe there and lift

56
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.700
this one up a little on the press G twice to make sure they're going to move it too far away.

57
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.890
There's a lot of refinement that's going to have to be done with all of these vertices.

58
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.400
They're all higgledy piggledy in all over the place.

59
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.270
But now we've done that we should find that we've got an edge loop running around there.

60
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.590
We may have a triangle here.

61
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.730
Do we have trained here we have to sort that out.

62
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.030
We've got this edgeley running around here.

63
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.550
This one running around here which is fine apart from the fact it's a wee bit high.

64
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.270
A little bit high here.

65
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.780
So let's grab these.

66
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.010
Edges here berish G twice and lower than down here.

67
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.730
This is far too close to the mouth loop.

68
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.430
And I'm going to move those down as well.

69
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.460
Look again these can be refined and refined and refined as the face takes shape.

70
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.020
In fact we'll be hopping round and checking it how it looks or I've lost my side profile but I'll be

71
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.500
looking at how it looks and refining in a bit more detail in a few moments.

72
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:12.190
Now the next area we've got here is this mouth and I'm not liking it at the moment and there is what

73
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.800
I want to say a neat trick but since we're actually got a bounding box running around the mouth area

74
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.430
we can very quickly remake the edge loops that would make up the mouth area and then adjust them again

75
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.300
in a bit.

76
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.140
So for instance in order to do that I can go to face select here so I could make the mouth bigger and

77
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.800
fill up the area around.

78
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.360
Or I could just get rid of all of this.

79
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.630
I hope this is going to work.

80
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.180
And this area here.

81
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.490
No just that one there some one to get rid of that I'm going to delete the faces so it leaves a nice

82
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.000
big smile or look at that happy person.

83
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.360
But now I should be able to select the edge loop running around it which I can and then I can fill that

84
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.910
in.

85
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.420
Looking good so far.

86
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.250
Now that I've done that I can insets Now that looks horrible.

87
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.480
It's nice in settings.

88
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.870
Great because it can actually create a nice face loop running around the outside of something.

89
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.200
So that would be perfect for the I think I've just clicked away and ruined was about to show you.

90
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.900
No I haven't.

91
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.310
It's still there but here it's a hmm why need to do here is scroll down on the insets area.

92
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.120
That's just make this a bit bigger.

93
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.900
And turn off the boundary function.

94
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.530
And then on the mirror we can see we've got well we no longer got a problem with it running around the

95
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.770
edge.

96
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.520
In fact it forms the mouth area.

97
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.930
Then I can inset again and once more for good luck.

98
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.230
Let's zoom in and.

99
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.540
Oh.

100
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.520
Something has gone horribly horribly wrong there it's just undo that last one and see what was going

101
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.370
on.

102
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.020
I think just one of these verses is in a very horrible place compared to the others.

103
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.540
Yes.

104
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.930
We see they're stuck in somewhat.

105
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.990
In fact a couple of these are so let's just pull them out all the air that's going to take a bit of

106
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.780
refining to get that source in maybe a smooth virtex on the on the rest of it.

107
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.570
So let's move this in.

108
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.990
And once more but not too much.

109
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.450
Well I'm going to delete that face in the middle.

110
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.540
I'm going to say it the edge loop running around the mouth and extrude it in words.

111
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.460
I think that's the wise direction.

112
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.400
Excellent.

113
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.820
So there we go we've got to kind of lip building up there.

114
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.870
It's a bit awkward round here.

115
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.910
And again we can refine that to our heart's content.

116
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.650
Make it look a bit better.

117
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.310
Now we've started getting all of this and that's going to take a lot more refinement.

118
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:54.550
I probably won't have time for in this particular video but we've got the eyes the eyes could be do

119
00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:03.560
with having some more detail around here and again we select for that and insects and insets again I'm

120
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:10.080
going to delete that middle 5 select the edge loop and extrude backwards.

121
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.070
Then of course I could scale that in or fill it in or whatever.

122
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.280
We don't have eyes.

123
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.840
Let's add some eyes.

124
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:25.180
So in object mode all look this is something that I haven't done yet I haven't hopped back in to object

125
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.030
mode and seen how that modifies being applied.

126
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.320
But we need to do that in a moment when we start shaping things up something to add a yuryi Sphere.

127
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:39.550
Looks groovy as that mirabeau and I'm going to rotate that round on the x axis by 19 that should put

128
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.020
an eye facing forward.

129
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.870
And then it's a matter going to hop into edit mode so I don't have to apply that scale and scale it

130
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.610
down to roughly the right size.

131
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.290
The fact that it bulges out of the head at the moment is not a problem.

132
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.660
I will add a mirror modifier to it.

133
00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:02.980
I will make it to have a a white material for the moment I'm just going and leave it as pure white and

134
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.620
diffuse.

135
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.880
So just stands out.

136
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.520
And we call that eye ball and we can work on the details of the eyeball later.

137
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.640
It needs to be smooth.

138
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.280
Eyes are not faceted like that.

139
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.650
And finally there are two eyes So we've got a mirror and set the mirror object to the head.

140
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.930
That should be fine.

141
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.400
There we go.

142
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.520
It looks a bit like a play model at the moment but trust me this is going to be refined and start looking

143
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.760
really good soon.

144
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:39.460
Speaking of refining one thing we can do here is start flipping around and modifying the mesh now and

145
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.300
starting to make it look more like the rest of the model.

146
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.780
So I've somehow lost my Mikey side profile.

147
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.890
So if I go into the right folder into my assets reference material Myki side.

148
00:09:53.890 --> 00:10:01.080
Now when I go around to the side you can see the effects that the surface subsurface modifier is having

149
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.970
and we can start modifying it.

150
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:11.750
So as go into edit mode and this time turn on showing the modifier whilst were in edit mode.

151
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:18.340
Now I can start going around and tweaking these vertices either with or without proportional editing

152
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.920
turned and a start with it turned on.

153
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:28.330
So when I move one vertex I can use the scroll wheel and move a whole reload of them at once to put

154
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.500
the model in the right place and it will take a while.

155
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.770
And obviously you can see here that's moving some of it is not going to work.

156
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:44.150
I need to move a lot of it here in order to see there's move up.

157
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.370
Has a funny smile.

158
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.840
Okay let's move the mouth up to roughly the right place.

159
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.240
We can go around and do this across the entire model.

160
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.740
Cause sometimes you move too much.

161
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.240
Zoom back in.

162
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.700
Got to watch where the brow is here.

163
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.840
Bridge of the nose etc..

164
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:08.290
And it's not just where that meshes its where the subsurface modifier puts the detail as well.

165
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.450
So if I want to add the bridge of my nose it there's a little bit of a ball.

166
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.920
This bit there so I can do that.

167
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:23.050
I can see here that we've got this virtex Here is far too far in so I can go back round to the side.

168
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.460
Now grab it and move it down to maybe fair.

169
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:33.580
And again we're just watching this move around and my nose is probably far too wide as well so from

170
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.760
the front view I can go in.

171
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:41.480
I can see that wall actually from the front and side view.

172
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.480
Yeah it looks pretty consistent.

173
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.040
What about those nostril level how the nostrils are at different heights.

174
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.620
If you notice so it looks like when I was hit and perhaps tilted my head up so I'm going to have to

175
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.320
adjust for that as well as I go back.

176
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.810
Let's just see how the models coming on now and zoom out and have a look around.

177
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.080
Have we got all the face loops that we need.

178
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.730
Again we can tweak all the details of the face to our heart's content.

179
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.590
If the turn on the cage again so just looks a little bit better.

180
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.050
It's got a couple of loops around.

181
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.040
We've got this one going around there.

182
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.510
We've got a wander around the bridge to the chin.

183
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.050
Who got the ones around the mouth and that does need sorting anchors a very wide mouth at the moment

184
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.940
and we've got the one running around the no so that's coming together nicely now.

185
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:35.800
Don't expect your model to look overly good at this moment in time.

186
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.600
There's a lot more refining that can be done.

187
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.230
And there's a lot more work we can put in with the details around the mouth the eyes etc..

188
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.100
I'd love to see how you guys are getting on.

189
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.620
There's a few final bits that I would want to do this summer are going to do it at the moment.

190
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.130
That triangle stands out as the biggest one and she refined this area around the mouth here but of course

191
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.190
assist me moving verses backwards and forwards.

192
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.300
And how have you guys got on.

193
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.010
Remember to share your work in the discussions.

194
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:12.460
I love seeing what your coming out with this has been the most challenging challenge you've come across

195
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:12.970
so far.

196
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.930
I'm absolutely certain of that.

197
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.610
Trying to route these face loops is not the easiest thing in the world to do but with persistence and

198
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.750
some practice remember to do more than one head.

199
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.350
I know I'm only doing one head here but the more.

200
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.530
And don't worry initially with how it looks.

201
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.860
Even if it looks like an alien great you've made an alien head.

202
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.120
Man that's brilliant.

203
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.110
Okay guys I will see you in the next lecture.

204
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.690
Remember to show your work in the discussions.

205
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.580
See you soon.
