Hello everybody and welcome back to this quick tip where we're gonna do a Boolean operation but this
1

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.480
time without using a modifier.
2

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.290
So we've got our boolean geometry at the moment that's cutting through our bishop.
3

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.270
Now the great thing about using a modifier is it's adjustable so if we wanted to quickly change this
4

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.530
and say well I want this to be a deeper NOTCH OR I want this to be at a different angle we're changing
5

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.160
it straight away so we could have it like that if we wanted to.
6

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.240
And then perhaps move it somewhere else or looks like we've put it inside itself.
7

8
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.720
There we go.
8

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.150
So we can have it cut off like that if we wanted to this loads and loads of options we could scale it
9

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.500
and have a bigger thing.
10

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.200
Who who cares what you want to do.
11

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.890
It gives us the flexibility of being able to edit it and of course we could.
12

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.050
Once we're happy with it.
13

14
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.180
Apply that modifier but that defeats the point of using a modifier in some circumstances because it
14

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.890
is adjustable.
15

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.430
That's the whole point of it.
16

17
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.410
So what else can we do.
17

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.870
Well let's just undo those funny funky changes and what I am going to do is I'm going to select both
18

19
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.950
the bishop and the notch at the same time but I'm going to make sure the bishop is the last to be selected
19

20
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:23.010
and therefore the active element and then good to go control and J and join them into one mesh object.
20

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.830
So they've gone solid again as you can see here.
21

22
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.230
And then what I can do is I can get rid of that boolean modifier and go into edit mode because what
22

23
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.290
we're about to do is done in edit mode.
23

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.560
So we have all of our geometry here.
24

25
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.440
And what we can do is whilst we've got the mesh data that we want to use to make the cuts selected we
25

26
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.250
can go to face and then go to intersect boolean and it will make the cut for us.
26

27
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.500
You can also use the shortcut keys control an F to bring up the face menu and go intersect boolean and
27

28
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.670
it will cut through.
28

29
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.750
Now what you could do if none of those were selected is this particular object here that's been joined
29

30
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.790
will have no linked vertices with the underlying mesh so we can press the L key and it will select all
30

31
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.200
the linked geometry.
31

32
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.710
And then we can go control F and intersects boolean and if that wasn't there at all we could add in
32

33
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.460
a new bits of mesh data scale it down to the appropriate size.
33

34
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.660
Gonna have to do are bits of scaling here can I go G Z lift it up let's scale it's in only on the X axis
34

35
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.720
to make it flat again let's rotate it slightly and of course this is not quite how it would be but
35

36
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.590
something along those lines then we can go control F, intersect boolean and slice through so its an incredibly
36

37
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.400
useful tool obviously by doing this we've created a lots of extra geometry just like applying the boolean
37

38
00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.790
modifier would do as well and they wouldn't necessarily be ideal we might have to go back in here if
38

39
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.660
we had some horrible shading but because this is a rather flat shaded model anyway and it's highly faceted
39

40
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.000
these sharp angles are going to look fine if you're working on a high definition model or at least a
40

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.820
more high definition model and we had let's say smooth shading turned on you can see straight away you're
41

42
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.220
going to end up with some horrible horrible artifact thing around where this cuts has gone through the
42

43
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.380
model itself and this is something to bear in mind with anything that makes massive changes to your
43

44
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.810
geometry without you specifically controlling what's going on because of course you can make the notch
44

45
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.290
manually as well but this is a good start point and for what we're doing that's absolutely fine as
45

46
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.020
well.
46

47
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.110
Hope you find this quick tip helpful.
47

48
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.730
Now I've used this technique on one of your other models or perhaps even in the bishop that you're working
48

49
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.960
on.
49

50
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.870
Please share that work over in the discussions as well.
50

51
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.140
Look forward to seeing it and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
