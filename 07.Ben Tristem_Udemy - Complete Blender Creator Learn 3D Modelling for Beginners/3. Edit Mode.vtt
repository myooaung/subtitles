Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.790
In this lecture we're going to make a simple shape by editing vertices edges and faces of our cube.
2

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.940
Okay so over in Blender here and the first thing we need to do if your screen does not look like this
3

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.950
if you've been playing around we're going to go to file new and general obviously save anything.
4

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.330
If you've been working on something you want to keep.
5

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.870
Now that we've done that how do we go into edit mode.
6

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.800
That's how we're going to start editing our mesh data.
7

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.850
So at the moment we're in object mode and we need to be an edit mode.
8

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.350
So if we go up to the top left of the 3D view where it says object mode one of the options there is
9

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.880
edit mode.
10

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.250
And what we can also do is we can hit the tab key to go in and out of edit mode and you will see that
11

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.000
the screen and the overlays change ever so slightly especially the tool shelf on the left whilst you're
12

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.870
in edit mode.
13

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.230
You can move the position of any vertex edge or face but you need to make sure that you are able to
14

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.300
select it first.
15

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.420
How do we do that.
16

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.130
Well in the top left.
17

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.990
We have next to the edit mode.
18

19
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.510
We have our vertex select, edge select and face select toggles.
19

20
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.440
Now you can hold down shift and toggle them all on and that will enable blender to smart select what
20

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.420
you're actually doing so if you click on an edge you'll select an edge of vertex of vertex and a whole
21

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.840
face.
22

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.270
It will select the face for this whole section you may want to keep those toggled on.
23

24
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.860
So when you're editing something you don't have to keep switching backwards and forwards as your models
24

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.000
get much more dense.
25

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
However it can be very difficult if you don't explicitly tell blender what you're trying to select to
26

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.120
select it which can be very very annoying.
27

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.330
Now just like when we're in object mode we can transform the entire object where we're edit mode we
28

29
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.690
can transform whatever we have selected.
29

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.460
So with this whole face selected I can press the S key to scale and then scale up the entire face.
30

31
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.290
And now if we move around we see we've got a new object one that you cannot create.
31

32
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.350
If you were in object mode it'd be very difficult too.
32

33
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.370
Now I'm going to undo that for the moment and select everything with the A key.
33

34
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.590
When I do that I'm going to scale everything by two and just press enter to confirm that.
34

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.630
Now we have a resize operator panel popped up on the lower left.
35

36
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.970
If you caught that come up.
36

37
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.940
So we can still edit our last operation if we want to.
37

38
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.830
But the one key thing that I want to get in right from the very beginning is that we are editing the
38

39
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.710
mesh data itself.
39

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.080
We are not transforming the Object data.
40

41
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.250
Now that may sound a bit confusing at first but if we go out back into object mode and open up the 3D
41

42
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.390
windows properties we see that with this object selected this cube the scale is still one even though
42

43
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.570
we've scaled the original cube by two.
43

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.640
So that means it really is this size.
44

45
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640
We're not just making something larger in this control panel.
45

46
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.490
It really is that size and this will matter a lot later on when it comes to using modifiers when it
46

47
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.060
comes to the physics engine when it comes to particle systems.
47

48
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.410
And that's why in the last lecture we were talking about applying your transforms the number one tip
48

49
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.430
that I can give you is if you were going to do something like scaling rotating or moving in some cases
49

50
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.890
do it in edit mode.
50

51
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.460
Now the important take home there is basically if you're doing any editing often it's easier to do it
51

52
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.480
in edit mode than you have to remember about applying things afterwards.
52

53
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.820
So I'm going to go ahead and just undo those moves that I've done before and now what we can do is we
53

54
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.460
can think about moving it to logical places so I can go and view this from the side.
54

55
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.640
Now what we can do here is we can make this sits on the ground so we go G Z two that will lift it up.
55

56
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.300
And when I say the ground I mean where Z equals zero.
56

57
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.210
So were the X and Y pass the Z.
57

58
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.240
That is where Z equals zero.
58

59
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.820
So now the bottom of the cube is notionally at the bottom of the world.
59

60
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.690
If it goes any lower than that we could say it's under the ground level of the world or has a negative
60

61
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.210
Z value.
61

62
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.260
What else can we do.
62

63
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.700
Well whilst we've got all of them selected up here we can click an edge and go G Y and move it along
63

64
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.670
and make some really funky shapes.
64

65
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.170
I didn't mean Y there when I selected that edge.
65

66
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.080
I meant X.
66

67
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.920
So let's go to G X and pull it out like that and then we can grab this edge here and go G Z and you can
67

68
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.950
start to make some really unique shapes.
68

69
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.110
Now we're gonna make the operator panel a little smaller since we don't have much screen space anyway
69

70
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.920
and you can select these vertex edge and face select with the one two and three key.
70

71
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.610
Now there is a caveat to that if you happen to have emulate number pad turned on which is on the preferences
71

72
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.910
input emulate number pad.
72

73
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.230
That won't work.
73

74
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.740
You'll need to turn that off if you want to use the 1,2, 3 keys to switch between vertex edge and
74

75
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.840
face select, So now we've played around with moving our faces edges and vertices around it's time
75

76
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.860
to solidify that knowledge and practice it in this quick challenge. Okay so your challenge.
76

77
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.590
I'd like you to create a simple wedge with the following dimensions X 2, Y 4,  Z 2.
77

78
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.360
And with no overlapping vertices.
78

79
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.590
So that means it's gonna be two wide four long and two meters tall and as a bonus sieve can get it like
79

80
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.080
the pictures beneath.
80

81
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.400
So keep the origin at 0 0 0 and then match the following.
81

82
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.830
So that is the tallest part of our wedge is where Y equals zero no part of the wedge is negative Y.
82

83
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.130
And the end of the wedge where it's at its narrowest is where Y equals 4.
83

84
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.950
Pause the video now and give that a go. Okay everybody , Welcome back.
84

85
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.940
Let's go ahead and create our first wedge.
85

86
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.750
Okay so we're back over in Blender and I'm gonna get rid of everything that I've got here i'm just going to
86

87
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.200
start up a new blend file.
87

88
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.580
Okay so I'm gonna hop straight into edit mode.
88

89
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.140
The first thing I want to say before we start moving things around is there's going to be more than
89

90
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.230
one way to do this.
90

91
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.170
Just bear that in mind if you've taken a different route.
91

92
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.250
Don't worry as long as you've got the right shape at the end of it you've succeeded.
92

93
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.710
Now just bear in mind here the positive Y direction we can see by looking at the Gizmo in the top right.
93

94
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.820
This shows the Y direction going to our right which means that's the positive way Z going up and X
94

95
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.970
coming slightly towards us.
95

96
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.980
So we've already got it in the right X position but we just need to move it up by one meter on the Z
96

97
00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:03.850
so I'm gonna go G Z 1, Okay I'm going to select an edge Select and Select this very top edge and pull
97

98
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.780
it forward.
98

99
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:15.070
So G Y by 2 and then G Z minus 2 and we've got our basic shape I'm then going to select everything and
99

100
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.720
I'm going to use the A key for that.
100

101
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.830
Select all and I'm going to go G Y.
101

102
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.370
I think it's just one blender unit which will get us there.
102

103
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:31.000
And there we go we've got everything there and no overlapping vertices and there we go that's the wedge
103

104
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.760
all done.
104

105
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.660
Now there's one comment I want to make straight away and that is unnecessary geometry during the
105

106
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.310
making of this wedge we left this edge just down at the bottom.
106

107
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.530
That was a necessity to make sure that we don't have any duplicate vertices anywhere but it's actually
107

108
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.050
a bit of wasted geometry.
108

109
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.860
And in general you'll want to try to avoid that.
109

110
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.620
In this case since we're just beginning I call that acceptable.
110

111
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.520
And there we go.
111

112
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.280
We'll find out how we can get rid of things like this later on but for the moment I'm happy with how
112

113
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.980
that looks.
113

114
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.130
How did you guys get on.
114

115
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.160
Have you made your straightforward wedge please do share your work.
115

116
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.660
Did you go about it a different way.
116

117
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.040
I'd love to hear your techniques over in the discussions.
117

118
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.770
So share over there and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
