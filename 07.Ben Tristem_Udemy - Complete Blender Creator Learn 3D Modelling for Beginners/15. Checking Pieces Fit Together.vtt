00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.870
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.720
In this lecture what we want to do is start putting our objects together and making sure that their

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.670
Modularity is actually what we think it is.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.350
So this is just going to be very quick and dirty it's not going to be the full building or anything

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.800
along those lines but it is going to be is just a check to see how things go together.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560
Do we need to make any adjustments at this stage.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.670
What you don't want to do is check it after you've made 15 things check it almost each and every time.

8
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.330
One thing that we've not really been paying much detail to is the level of detail of these particular

9
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.160
items.

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.890
So currently we've got a window which if we have everything turned off this basic window here could

11
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.570
quite easily be level of detail.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.610
However when we add some extra bits and bobs to it it becomes level of detail B or even C if you think

13
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.310
that's more than enough detail I'll probably add a couple of other bits around here but that's a good

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.640
level of simple detail and we could start adding materials to it at any points as well.

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.290
But for the moment it's just the modelling that we want to focus on.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.310
Now there are a couple of options we're going to have to do some duplication here and setting things

17
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.090
up but we don't want to ruin our original scene.

18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.240
So at the moment if we have a look at the top right we have an option for scenes and there's a dropdown

19
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.220
on the left where you can select to various scenes and then on the right there is an option to create

20
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.020
a new scene.

21
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.040
We click on that we get four options.

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.470
The first two new and copy settings.

23
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.110
Well when we hover over it it tells us what we do but both of those will be empty with nothing else

24
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.030
in them.

25
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.990
The linked copy in full copy are the ones that we want to have a look at.

26
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.980
Now linked the collections from the current scene kind of a shallow copy or a full copy if we go to

27
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.610
linked copy we now unseen 0 0 1 and just like when you're naming your objects naming your scenes is

28
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.540
also very important so let's call this building test so we know what it is and let's call this one export

29
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.290
file because everything's going to be built around the origin making sure all works.

30
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.750
Export file we'll export seen something like that.

31
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.890
It really doesn't matter what it's called as long as we understand what it is and it's clear what it

32
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.010
is.

33
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.620
So this is the building test.

34
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.200
So if I was to go ahead and let's say grab all of these objects the window breaks the window sill and

35
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.150
the window and just apply the modifiers on them the great thing about applying these modifiers is it

36
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.670
means that it's solidified into a mesh object which means that we can get rid of the curve because it's

37
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.000
no longer necessary and it means that we can grab the window the window breaks and the window sill and

38
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.470
join them altogether.

39
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.870
Now there's some extra problems with this.

40
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
The first one being it's just inherited the active selected its name but we have a looking wireframe

41
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700
we've got a lot of geometry inside our model.

42
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.070
Now that's not necessarily a problem.

43
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.450
A lot of game engines have what's called occlusion so rendering occlusion so it won't render those vertices

44
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.200
that are inside.

45
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.670
But the problem is it still has the calculate not surrender them in the first place.

46
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.720
And on top of that when it comes to texturing later on this is a lot of potentially wasted u v space

47
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.590
which is going to be a lot in this particular case because there's a hell of a lot of geometry inside

48
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.520
this model.

49
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.290
So we don't really want that we just want more faces and a lot of cleanup can be done here relatively

50
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.370
quickly by just selecting all of the faces on this side and deleting them.

51
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.260
However we should try and probably and avoid that in the first place.

52
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.350
But as a first pass this is absolutely fine.

53
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.920
See now our objects is a single mesh object.

54
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.480
It's going to be really easy to duplicate everywhere.

55
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.400
However if I go back to my export scene you can see that the window is actually a copy of that.

56
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.550
So what we have just done is actually destructive.

57
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.910
We can no longer edit this.

58
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.930
Now that may or may not be an issue for you it is an issue for me.

59
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.440
So in this particular case I'm going to go ahead and take a full copy instead and I'm going to go to

60
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.100
file and revert my file back to how it was right at the beginning.

61
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.910
Then I'm going to go ahead and call this export scene because I know that's going to be I'm then going

62
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.020
to go ahead and create a new full copy there we go everything comes in looking good.

63
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.320
OK.

64
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.540
That looks a mess in places as well.

65
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.000
Yeah.

66
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.930
Export season 0 0 1 Nope this is going to be my building's scene so everything has come across including

67
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.600
the things that I had hidden so go ahead and delete that now.

68
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.740
But if I go ahead and do what I did before with the window with its curve and inside there it's got

69
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.980
these obviously they now have unique names that's a clue there that they are unique and they're not

70
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.620
shared data with the other sets and because this is a building scene I do actually want to put them

71
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.640
together just for my own sanity.

72
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.360
Otherwise I'm gonna have to right click and select a hierarchy here to make sure that all of those objects

73
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.350
are selected.

74
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.870
But before we join them we do need to remember to apply any modifiers because if we don't apply modifiers

75
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.430
wherever we join our mesh objects to it will just inherit those modifiers from before.

76
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.050
So I'm going to hold down control to select these extra ones with the end one being window control and

77
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.870
J now have things called Windows 0 0 1 and if I get to my export scene I've not lost any of that detail

78
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.840
from before.

79
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.450
Okay.

80
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.020
So it's going to take me a few moments just to tidy up everything here the wall is absolutely fine the

81
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.940
doorway now the doorway itself.

82
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.370
This is where I can make a decision on style I'm actually going to go with my bricks themselves I like

83
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.290
the way that they work so I'm going to go ahead and apply those and then I can come in here and basically

84
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.130
delete these other bits for the moment because they no longer have an impact on my seeing the door mirror

85
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.800
again that that empty does not have an impact the window curve doesn't have an impact and the archway

86
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.600
bricks and the door wave themselves can now be joined together.

87
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.160
Remember to have your cursor over the 3D window when you do those keyboard shortcuts.

88
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.240
Otherwise they won't work.

89
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.010
Okay.

90
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.840
So we're almost there.

91
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.470
We've got this big slab on the floor that's our image I'm going to hide that's out of the way as well.

92
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.690
And I'm just going to mock up a simple room.

93
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.250
Now we do need a floor.

94
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.620
I want a floor so let's go ahead shift an S cursor to the world origin.

95
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.910
I'm going to add in a plain in edit mode I'm gonna scale it by 2 so it's another four by four grid I'm

96
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:16.890
going to add a modifier which would just be solidify and set that's a point two.

97
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.260
Okay so that's just the floor piece and fortunately is solidified in the right direction so we don't

98
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.560
need to do much else.

99
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.560
Okay.

100
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.340
The origin of this piece and its name its probably just called plain at the moment let's call it a floor

101
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.720
let's put it nested within the building.

102
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.340
That's good.

103
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.870
Okay.

104
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.600
I like that.

105
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:46.070
Let's change the position of the origin for its shift this cursor to selected into object mode sets

106
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.220
origin to the 3d cursor and then we'll move it to 0 0.

107
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.560
Okay.

108
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:57.110
Now one of the things to bear in mind is because we are using the origin as the way of positioning you've

109
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.360
got to imagine everything having a front and a back to it.

110
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:07.490
So here for instance what I can do is on the wall space which is nice and plain and simple and go to

111
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:14.860
my material settings here gets my materials and I'm going to have a back and a front or an in and an

112
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:22.780
out so material another material to materials I'm going to call one out and one in.

113
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.150
Now why am I doing this.

114
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.070
Well it become clear when we actually get to modifying and building our scene.

115
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:37.230
So I'm just gonna make this one here no let's just make it a darker color so outside it's darker inside

116
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.430
is lighter.

117
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.440
Absolutely fine and I can share these materials on everything says go into edit mode select one of the

118
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.110
walls I'm going to call this the in Wall sign.

119
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.900
So this is just the face there.

120
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.610
And then with select the other face of my wall and a sign that the out color.

121
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.420
Okay I'm going to hide the out the way I'm going to select my window and hide the others as well I'm

122
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.790
going to go into edit mode.

123
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:12.630
I'm gonna select these two faces here sign them in with these two faces here and sign them out immaterial

124
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.910
material sign it out.

125
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.120
Make sure you click on a sign.

126
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.830
Those are all assigned.

127
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.830
What else do we need to do.

128
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.020
Well the floor does matter.

129
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.610
There's no in and out for that but just this doorway here says go into edit mode.

130
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.270
So like this face here new material.

131
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.790
Sign it's in and again here.

132
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.060
This face new material a sign it's the outer material.

133
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.190
Click the sign and we should has that been assigned.

134
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.780
Let's just make sure oh who's changed the color of out

135
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.100
here we go dark and light.

136
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.350
Make sure that applies on the other dark and light

137
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.010
dark and light.

138
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.820
Perfect.

139
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.390
Okay.

140
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:11.600
So the reason why of color coded them like that is now we have our simple mesh objects that we can rearrange.

141
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.540
I can start making myself a building.

142
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.600
So let's start with a rough floor plan here.

143
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.130
So in object mode I'm going to select my floor piece here and look at it from the top and I'm just going

144
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.830
to use Alton D so if I make any other

145
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.590
so if I make any other changes to my model I can easily apply them.

146
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:38.550
I can hold down control and snap if I wanted to or I could just turn on snapping and this is where absolute

147
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.890
grids snap may be really useful.

148
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.800
The reason why I've created everything fall by fall.

149
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.680
Well it's certainly snap perfectly within the grid.

150
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.970
And that won't happen unless you have absolute grid snap turned on.

151
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.390
Okay.

152
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:59.090
And I'm going to do the same here on a duplicate scan make it a little bit of a long room maybe wave.

153
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.690
How about the shape of a cross.

154
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.210
That's absolutely fine.

155
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.950
I don't want to do much more than that simply for my own sanity more than anything else.

156
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.920
So then we have a window here.

157
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.720
Remember we had an inside and an outside.

158
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.820
Now look at how overlaps the floor space here.

159
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.230
We don't necessarily want that in fact this floor piece here.

160
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:27.650
I'm going to duplicate one more and pop it on the outside so let's start with this window and just move

161
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.610
it out of the way

162
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:38.990
G why pull it down there for a second if we can pop that right at the very end as well.

163
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:44.130
Notice how that name makes the wall itself.

164
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.250
Notice how that all make the room four by four.

165
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.550
But when it comes to actually snapping.

166
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.660
If I was to duplicate that again and rotate its on its z axis by minus 90.

167
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.100
If it's the room perfectly.

168
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.550
However if I was to duplicate it again and try and plop it in it would kind of match up perfectly here

169
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.210
but it infringes on the room.

170
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:12.760
So once again rotating on the z axis by 180 will enable us to put it in the right location and look

171
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.030
at that.

172
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:19.530
Now the floor is perfect and everything that's on the inside is supposed to be on the inside.

173
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.670
Okay where's all standard wall piece.

174
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.240
Let's have a couple of wall pieces in here as well.

175
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.980
If you're gonna watch me now just going to speed up the video.

176
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.200
Ever so slightly.

177
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.710
I'm just moving things around.

178
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.240
You're not gonna miss much.

179
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.990
So rotate this one by 90 on the z axis.

180
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:51.210
Okay so there we go we can see that I flipped round into a vertical view so I could see my world just

181
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.860
a little bit better.

182
00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.190
Yeah I'm happy for some reason I've forgotten to put in a wall piece just here as well.

183
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.090
Remember in order to see these property you're going to have to be in material.

184
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.620
I think I must've just moved it so duplicate Perfect.

185
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.760
Okay so before we crack on I just need to rotate this around don't I as well.

186
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.040
Before we crack on that one of the things we need to have a brief look at here is the fact that whilst

187
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.270
we've managed to snap everything there and we've got the wrong look we've got the wrong origin point

188
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.980
for this particular model should really be in the corner here and we can see it's misaligned because

189
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.670
of that.

190
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.710
So let's sort that's out now.

191
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.200
That's well actually I'll just sort it out and the main model over here in the export scene.

192
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.040
Otherwise it's gonna be so easy to get.

193
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.840
So with the doorway selected got the lower corner.

194
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:54.190
Oh case of the doorway does have the right origin point by the looks of it it just happens to be that

195
00:13:54.190 --> 00:14:00.120
when we joined everything together it ended up inheriting some other origin point.

196
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.700
Absolutely fine.

197
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.680
Just need something.

198
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.060
Something to watch out for.

199
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.530
Okay so we built our Building up here.

200
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.070
Looks pretty awesome.

201
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:14.500
We could even have a look at it in rendered mode if you really want to see how light and shadow will

202
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.180
change.

203
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:21.970
You know if you know if you went ahead grab this light source here and popped it behind one of the windows

204
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.980
how it the shadows look coming in through the windows lower down as well.

205
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.750
Lots of fun.

206
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:33.340
That can be had here and of course if you're playing with lights like that I would very much recommend

207
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.620
using cycles rather than evey just as the first pass.

208
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:44.710
And of course putting a roof on it so there's no environmental leaking into the scene or indeed if you

209
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:51.250
go to the world properties and turn the color down to black then we are just looking at the lights that's

210
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.470
been produced by this point light source.

211
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:59.380
So in this particular case if we were changing it over to cycles switch over to the GP use uses a bit

212
00:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.890
quicker.

213
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.410
And we could see that that's got a completely different look to it.

214
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.750
In fact one of the things that would be brilliant is switching over to flying mode.

215
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:19.420
If we go to the view menu and go to navigation scroll down here I don't like fly but I do like walk.

216
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:26.600
We can then use the w a SD keys to move around the scene and we can even turn on gravity as well.

217
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:34.040
We'll see that that's the tab key I could fall down and now I can walk around my scene and lets it render.

218
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:40.150
Of course your mileage will vary on how quick that renders as well but we start to get a feel of how

219
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.140
the level might look by just walking around in Blender.

220
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.930
However this is the main crux.

221
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.240
Why have we assembled it like this.

222
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.970
Well now we can start to notice few potential issues because we haven't modeled any corner pieces.

223
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:03.990
When we go ahead and put these together they slot together and overlap in these areas here on the inside

224
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.950
edges.

225
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:11.310
And if it matters which it may not do we end up with these gaps where it doesn't.

226
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.160
And the same is true of the floor.

227
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.350
But remember in a game if you're never seeing the outside of an object you probably find you wouldn't

228
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.380
even have these faces here would just delete them altogether.

229
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.680
But in this particular case we want the option of perhaps looking on the outside so we will have to

230
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.020
model some corner pieces to slot in whether it's on the inside all the outside.

231
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.480
Now just bear in mind when you do that sort of thing.

232
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:44.340
If you do that sort of thing you'll need to bear in mind if you add in a two by two piece that suddenly

233
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.170
your four by four pieces on the floor won't work very well.

234
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.190
Or have the potential to not work as well as they could do.

235
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.940
Now these wall pieces here are very bland at the moment but they consume be spruced up with a couple

236
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.910
of textures which will get texturing really soon but it is really important to test your models out

237
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.700
and make sure things are working as expected.

238
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.990
The big issue that I have currently is these inside walls.

239
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:19.410
These inside walls here you can see the shading this horrible Z fighting that will look horrendous in

240
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.130
a game and you've probably seen it even in triple-A games from time to time.

241
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.820
You just get a bit of geometry intersecting and you have this horrible hashed effect where it can't

242
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.510
decide which one of the surfaces it needs to render.

243
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:40.170
In this particular case this is this really stands out as a good example of what not to do because it's

244
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.750
got it in these four corners here.

245
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.570
This really does accentuated.

246
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:51.480
It won't look so bad in some of the other rendered modes but it could potentially cause you a real headache

247
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.420
when rendering.

248
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:58.410
And the last thing you'd want to do is render out a scene or think your your models are absolutely fine

249
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.280
only to find that later they're not in you've got to make a ton of changes.

250
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.180
Now's the time to catch those issues and solve them.

251
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:11.910
Okay so that's it for this lecture I'm really looking forward to your mock ups your designs seeing how

252
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.560
you're putting things together.

253
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.020
Feel free to play with your design and come up with some new ones.

254
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.810
Really looking forward to seeing your work share in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next

255
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.260
lecture.
