00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.940
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
In this lecture we're going to focus on designing the world that we are about to create and making sure

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.410
as we see here we constrain our scope.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.460
So first of all it's time to map out your scene and what you'd like to include.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.850
So this is a chance for you to go wild and nice and wide with your ideas you don't have to follow along

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.980
with what I'm doing.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.180
In fact I would encourage you to do your own thing and apply what you've learned in the lectures across

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.120
to it.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.250
It's time to dump all of those ideas down what do you want to make.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.000
And I will reiterate myself here.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.560
If you are new to blender keep the projects small if you want to challenge or this is your second time

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.190
round.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.740
Then of course increase the scope of its work.

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.640
Work out what parts you need to have in your scene.

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.590
This is a critical thing here.

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.640
Start thinking about how we're going to build up the room that you're making or the building that you're

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360
making and think carefully about what parts you need to have in your scene.

18
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.010
Recommend a system like trailer for tracking your model's progress as well.

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.210
And we'll have a look at that in more detail as we start using it categorizing your models is always

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.780
a useful thing to do.

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.190
So it's not an exhaustive list and names can vary.

22
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.980
Madness is this is important here at terrain so I like categorizing terrain as all things natural but

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.610
you have things like props which we'll get to in the moment which can be included as terrain props or

24
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.180
structure and architecture props.

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.810
And we'll see how that applies in a moment.

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.660
So structure might be walls might be pillars.

27
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.110
This is the sort of way that we're progressing with our scene at the moment.

28
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
However you might want to situate your your church or whatever you're making within a certain terrain

29
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.970
you've got to think about these things and what you're going to create.

30
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.940
We're not focused on characters in this section so but there is a category that would be characters

31
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.150
vehicles those sorts of things and props.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.650
This is one of the biggest broadest things that you can possibly have.

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.650
Props are basically everything else that clutters up a scene so debris furniture rocks mobile phones

34
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.890
sat in the corner cutlery that wherever you happen to be modeling the props are really what makes the

35
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.300
scene come alive.

36
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.180
So it is important to think about what extra little bits you're going to include in your scene that

37
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.980
really starts to make the scene feel much better there are a few things that you can add to a scene

38
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.590
like let's say lighting so if I want to add some torches or candles to my church that I'm making that's

39
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.170
going to have a much greater impact than if I just added some dirt on the floor for instance.

40
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.670
Now before we go ahead and jump into the challenge I'd like to show you first how to import an image

41
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.990
into blender and then we'll get over into the challenge.

42
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.280
Okay so I've got an empty scene here I'm going to get rid of my default cube and I'm going to go shift

43
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.640
in a to add a new object to the scene and if I go down there's now an option called image.

44
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.270
This is something you used to have to add in days gone by and we've got two options.

45
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.230
It really doesn't matter which one you pick at this stage we're going to use it as a reference.

46
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.810
So references fine background is also found it really doesn't matter which one you pick.

47
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.050
Now you've got a new file explorer built into blender 2.8 one is much easier to navigate than it was

48
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.940
before so I've downloaded a photo that I've taken and I presume that's going to be this one here and

49
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.500
I'm not quite sure which one of these it is in fact it's not in that folder at all so let me go to the

50
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.090
appropriate folder.

51
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.690
Here we go.

52
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.930
So this is the image that I've imported and you can see here it's been added as per the view that we

53
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.350
had when we added it.

54
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.710
So I'm going to go into the properties panel and just sets all of these values here to zero and then

55
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.500
we can start scaling this up to an appropriate size plop a cube down make sure we've got roughly the

56
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.220
right order of size.

57
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.680
Now of course this is a rough sketch so we use it as such we don't use it as gospel.

58
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.080
Haha pardon the pun.

59
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.390
And that's the way we import a image into blender in order to use.

60
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.770
I really want to highlight here how rough and ready this sketches I've done it deliberately like this.

61
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.030
I've got a pen and a sheet of lined paper to really try to inspire you to use different techniques for

62
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.260
sketching down your ideas and never being held back by the fetch.

63
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.490
You might not have the ideal tools in which to create your work.

64
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.720
Okay so let's hop on over to our challenge Okay so your challenge.

65
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.150
I'd like you as you probably guessed to grab a pen and paper and sketch or even block a model out in

66
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.600
idea.

67
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.560
So getting that rough idea down.

68
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.500
I really don't care what tool you use you use the one that you're most comfortable with and perhaps

69
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.020
the quickest one would be getting a pen and paper out but if you want to practice your blender skills

70
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.370
and just do some block modelling in Blender that's absolutely fine as well.

71
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.600
One thing that a sketch perhaps cannot convey that the 3D world does is a sense of depth and space.

72
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.540
So that's one thing I've got my sketch you've seen it.

73
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.220
But how's it gonna look in 3D.

74
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.050
Well that's something we can work on.

75
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.190
Coming up and then go ahead take a scan or a photo of your sketch import that into blender which is

76
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.320
what I've just shown you and import it as a background image or a reference.

77
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.090
It really doesn't matter which one you pick and then share your model list and you'll see an idea I

78
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.650
really want you to hold yourself to account with your fellow students and make sure you keep it realistic

79
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.060
as well so share the models you want to make and you'll see an idea.

80
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.500
And that way the community will be able to come back and say oh that's a brilliant idea or have you

81
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.490
thought about this.

82
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.840
And if you are giving feedback to people don't just say Oh that's awesome.

83
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.620
Tell them why it's awesome or I don't think that's going to work.

84
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.740
But tell them why it's can not work in your mind that's always a great way of giving feedback.

85
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.680
Remember not just the statement of how you feel about it but why.

86
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.290
How do you qualify why it's good bad.

87
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.250
How things could be improved.

88
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.590
Suppose a video now and give us a go.

89
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.990
Hello everybody and welcome back.

90
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.100
How are you guys getting on.

91
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.350
I hope you have shared your model list and seen idea over in the discussions.

92
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.070
I'm looking forward to seeing them.

93
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.520
Remember to comment on others as well.

94
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.740
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
