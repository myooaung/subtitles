Hello everybody and welcome to reference gathering now references are incredibly important without references.

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.020
You're not going to be able to achieve the level that you want to do even if they're are tangential

3
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.010
references.

4
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:27.060
It really helps to have even photos or videos of the thing you're trying to make or similar objects.

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.600
So what I would always say is gather as much data as you can.

6
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.630
Initially you want a breadth of data Google Image Search.

7
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.930
Others work as well.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.430
That's absolutely fine for inspiration.

9
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.320
If you're going for more of a stylized outcome looking at others work can help guide you with that.

10
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.120
Take a look at the large scale at this point in time we really want to focus on the large objects what's

11
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.520
the overall theme of what we're working with.

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.850
And of course there will be detail there.

13
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.960
However at the moment we're focused on the large shapes of the scene and the overall layout as well.

14
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.220
Now take note of the detail but try not to get too bogged down in it later on when we start refining

15
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.610
our models then we'll start looking at the detail.

16
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.350
Now one of the things I would really really recommend is real life.

17
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.080
It's there's no substitute for it.

18
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.920
So going visit places if you have the opportunity.

19
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.560
That's exactly what I've done with this project.

20
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.570
I've gone down the road in Lincolnshire in the UK and they have an absolutely amazing gothic cathedral

21
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.520
in the city of Lincoln.

22
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.570
So I've also included a load of references against this lecture is quite a big download.

23
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.480
I can't apologize for that because it contains a lots of photos but feel free to use those as your own

24
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.550
reference material.

25
00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.340
But one of the great things about getting to a place in real life is you will get a better appreciation

26
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.970
of the project you're working on it also allows you to go around something in its entirety.

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.230
Sometimes you miss things when they're taken as a photo you can't get in there see how things are made

28
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.340
how things are put together how the texture on the surface reacts with the light sometimes a static

29
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.150
photo is not going to convey that.

30
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.020
A video might vote there's always a great idea to take a couple of videos as well while still there.

31
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.990
Now take more photos than you think you might need.

32
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.480
From every angle if possible.

33
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.820
And of course if something moves then using a video to reference it is a great idea.

34
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.300
But the other thing is just mentioned moments ago with video what you can do is see how materials act

35
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.230
depending on light sources and the angles they are to those light sources such as a reflective surface

36
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.720
will be incredibly reflective at a shallow angle.

37
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.840
But the further you look at it until it's perpendicular you suddenly lose a lot of that reflectivity.

38
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.370
Now if you actually take enough photos you may even be able to use photographic memory in your work.

39
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.800
Now photographic memory is simply taking hundreds of photos and reconstructing a three dimensional scene

40
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.510
from it.

41
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.070
Now we're not going to go into details a photograph Mitre is just not possible to do it in Blender itself

42
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.070
but we can certainly imports photograph imagery if we needed to have light.

43
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.010
So at this point jump straight into a challenge.

44
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.420
OK.

45
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.510
So gather the reference material that you need for your project.

46
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.180
Now this may not be Gothic church.

47
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.930
This may be a small industrial park.

48
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.540
It may be a classroom it may be a kitchen.

49
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.760
There's lots of different environments that you could be doing for this project.

50
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.610
Now continue to gather as you progress through.

51
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.690
So this isn't just the challenge for right now but as we go through the project you will find that you

52
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.220
need something else.

53
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.980
And when you do go out there continue to gather it's not just something you do at the very beginning.

54
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.240
It's something that you continuously do and be conscious of conflicting styles and designs.

55
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.360
It's very very tempting as you're covering in all of this material at some point you've got to separate

56
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.910
it out and just throw things away.

57
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.580
Be very critical when it comes to it if you picked up something you don't quite like it's anymore then

58
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.570
by all means get rid of it now.

59
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.640
Now how do you decide to keep all of this reference material.

60
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.220
I will leave that up to you.

61
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.720
Sometimes I've even printed out reference material because I don't have enough screen space.

62
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.770
So that's one of the options as well suppose a video now and give that a go

63
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.120
OK everybody welcome back bright.

64
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.130
I don't want to dive into too much detail of what I've done but what I will do is just go through some

65
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.640
of the information that I've managed to gather.

66
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.970
When I went over to Lincoln Cathedral Okay everybody say as you can see here I've got quite a few photos.

67
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.340
And that was one of the main things going through and just taking hundreds and hundreds of photos.

68
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.420
Now initially you can see here they happened to be of the exterior.

69
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.630
Now I decided to take photos of the exterior even though I was focused on the interior because there's

70
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.430
a lot design cues and of course when you're outside the lighting is much much better now because it's

71
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.630
a bright and sunny day.

72
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.560
There's a lot of direct lighting which unfortunately causes a lot of shadows but it also helps accentuate

73
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.100
any features but it can make other things difficult to see.

74
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.890
I mean one of the great things I think this is a door just here.

75
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.110
Let me bring this up.

76
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.570
Yes.

77
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.460
Look at that detail in this doorway.

78
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.560
Being able to have something like that on reference is absolutely phenomenal.

79
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.810
And each doorway is different.

80
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.700
Now of course if we were modelling this we would just model a simple door.

81
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.740
We would not put the rest of the detail but later on that's something we might start adding.

82
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.520
Let's have a look at some of the interior shots going on here.

83
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.710
So this has the stained glass window now I can tell you some things like this.

84
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.570
They're going to be incredibly difficult to model.

85
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.690
However it being further away and having the image.

86
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.590
Well there's no reason why can't projects that image onto a flat surface and then just put that in my

87
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.280
scene.

88
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.170
Lots and lots of options there.

89
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.030
Of course that zoomed into the detail and we've got some that are just a bit further back.

90
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.820
So there's lots of options that we could do here and some people may consider it a little bit of cheating

91
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.840
but otherwise I don't I see that as a way of forwarding our model.

92
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.550
There was some lovely detailing on the wall things like this.

93
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.680
I'm not really going to be able to focus on this level of detail.

94
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.690
However you can see there's so much intricate detail.

95
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.770
If you were making a photo realistic church in this particular style you can just see that this is probably

96
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.130
going to be a whole day's worth of work just making this one little piece of the church.

97
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.620
So wow there's so much that we could potentially be doing.

98
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.640
Let's have a look at the inside Wow just look at that ceiling.

99
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.460
There's an immense amount of detail now of course the ceiling itself is one of those things that we

100
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.150
may not even consider making if the view that we're using doesn't really focus on the ceiling.

101
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.700
We can keep it quite simple but of course I would want to have some level of detailing.

102
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.910
So it is an arched ceiling here's another example we've got the roof at the top here.

103
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.240
These wonderful multicolored pillars as well.

104
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:53.280
This really is a rich environment of texture of color and the loads of opportunities to make modular

105
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.420
parts.

106
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.430
And here I just want to show you one of the main windows in there.

107
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.950
Of course taking video as well gives you an idea of the scale of this place.

108
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.560
Absolutely phenomenal.

109
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.090
Really looking forward to cracking on with this.

110
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:15.170
If you're doing a similar sort of project as me then please do go ahead and share your work.

111
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.070
I'd love to see other particular styles from around the world if you're able to access things like this.

112
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.130
Be absolutely amazing to see.

113
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.580
Anyway I'm really looking forward to seeing your projects.

114
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.010
How are you constraining it.

115
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.450
I mean with a project like this you could literally spend years developing your models.

116
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.600
We don't have that length of time so how are you constraining it.

117
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.890
How are you keeping your project scope in check.

118
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.970
Share over in the comments and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
