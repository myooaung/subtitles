00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,540
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to talk about version control.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,440
Now we've touched on this very early on in the course when we were talking about save versions within

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,120
blender or even just saving as when you're working on a blend file.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,710
Now we're about to embark on a much larger project than we've had before.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,300
So it's important to try out some version control.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,930
Now you don't have to do this by all means but I've found it a real godsend to being able to do that.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,690
And being able to roll back to a previous version or even decide well I want to try and experiment.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,950
And if I do that I've got to remember that I need to back up all these other files zip them up and do

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,280
loads of other things that are just too onerous.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,330
However if you use a version control system even something like source tree or in this case I'm going

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,840
to have a look at get cracking.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,220
What you'll be able to do is commit a change that you've made and then continue experimenting or continue

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,340
working whether or not that's adding textures trying different things out.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,270
Now I wish I knew about this when I first started because it's it's so powerful and it's enabled me

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,490
to jump back try things without the fear of losing or messing up any of my work.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,020
Especially if you end up moving a file out to another folder or something along those lines.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,000
At least with this system you can roll back to it.

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,470
So it's kind of like a real time or rather when you choose backup of the entire state of your project

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,990
if you so choose.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,770
So we're going to have a look at gitt cracker.

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,240
That is one I favoured.

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,240
You'll see me using source tree in the course itself but since I've recorded those videos I've come

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,420
back and have realized that did happen is much more friendly especially to artists rather than coders.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,580
So let's go ahead and have a look at it Kracken now and just show you around the rough premise of what

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,700
source control is without diving too deep because we only want to use it at the moment to back up our

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,310
work as we go and be able to fall back to a previous version if necessary.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,130
So let's now hop on over onto our web browser in fact not blender.

28
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,240
First of all and go have a look out.

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,000
Em.

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,440
Okay so what I've done here is I've gone to Dubey w w doggett's Kracken dot com.

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,060
Now I must say at this point I'm not endorsing them as in go out and buy them etc..

32
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,330
I've just found personally that this system works for me.

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,720
There are many other version control systems out there that you can go off and do your own research.

34
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,730
If you find this is the sort of thing you actually find helpful.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,060
So I'm going to download this right now it's free which is one of the reasons why I really like it.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,380
And then it'll take a few minutes to download.

37
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,320
It's about 120 megs or so.

38
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,260
And of course they've got a tutorial there to get you a get started.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,140
Do go ahead and watch that as well.

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,060
If you struggle at all it can be quite confusing when you first go ahead and try out source control

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,130
for the first time.

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,700
But once that's downloaded we can go ahead and install that now after you've installed it.

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,900
Launch the program for the first time and I'll see there in a second.

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,390
And then after a few moments you'll be presented with this screen with two signing options for the signing

45
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,290
with haab or create a gift crackin account.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,050
I already have a tub accounts I'll be using that method to sign in.

47
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,340
However if you don't know what that is or this is the first time you've gone to source control just

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,590
go through creating your own get Kracken account and go through that.

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,440
Now I'm going to sign in.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,400
We've got haab and I'll be back in a few moments.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,070
And there we go.

52
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,920
For me that was nice and quick it signed it instantly because I was already signed.

53
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,270
So what do we do from here.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,050
Well the first thing we need to do is create our new repository now repositories basically like a folder

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,560
where you going to store all of your project work.

56
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,190
Now I do recommend not storing all of your blender work in here but just the project you're working

57
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,380
on at the time.

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,120
So in this case I'm going to end it says here quite easy.

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,110
Set your preferences.

60
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,250
I'm fine with where things are at the moment but I'm going to open klown or initialise a repository.

61
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,970
That's the thing we're going to do here.

62
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,290
That's like clicking new.

63
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,950
So initialising a repository someone want to click on the folder here and go down to in it.

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,070
Now I've got a series of other options here which you can use if you were if you already had a repository

65
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,670
on your computer that you wanted to open up clone.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,180
Well we're not going to touch that at the moment.

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,800
That is if you're using gifts online which is a type of version control system.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,770
But we're just going to use it on the computer and that's why we're using local Only as well so we can

69
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,850
bat browse a repository path we can go into here.

70
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,790
And I'm just going to set it to my desktop for the moment and I'm going to put a folder on my desktop

71
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,770
and I'm going to call it repo short for repository test.

72
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm going to select that folder.

73
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,040
Now it is important at this point that the folder is empty.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,330
That is quite standard.

75
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,340
It starts off completely empty.

76
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,100
There are other things here called A Gift ignore and a licence were not going to do that at this point.

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,810
We've got nothing that we want to ignore.

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,680
We want to keep everything and our licence Well that's to do with how you sharing it how people can

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
use it etc..

80
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,030
So go ahead and create a repository a few seconds later.

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,310
It looks like this.

82
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,250
So what do we do now.

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,780
Well let's demonstrate what will happen if you go ahead and start adding things to that folder.

84
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,770
So let's go ahead and open up blender.

85
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,130
And when we open up blender let's say we've got our default cube I'm going to Blender's opened up on

86
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,040
another screens.

87
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,380
Drag it down here.

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,670
Now if we were working on let's say this default Q1 we go ahead and save as an go to our desktop into

89
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:31,080
repo test and call it repo test because that is exactly what we're doing and save now if we go straight

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,080
back in to get Kracken in this case and this would be the same most other source control programs it

91
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
has noticed a change.

92
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,560
And at the top here we can commit that change so I can call this starting cube and I can type in here.

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,100
I can also type it in over on the side as well.

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,210
The commit message so I could in the bottom here I can alter what it says.

95
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,800
So starting QB typed in here in the lower right we can type in starting QB again if we wanted to and

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,470
description this is where we start.

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,020
Now you can also keep a text document alongside what you're working on to put in more detailed notes

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,060
as you go and that's what I did personally.

99
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,350
I have a text document that I update explaining what I'm doing and why.

100
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,160
So once we've done that we have to stage our changes.

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,150
Now in this programming gig Kracken we can see at the top there unstaged files there's only one of them

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,750
and we can go ahead and stage that file and then commit the changes.

103
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:35,200
So now at any point we can roll back to that point in time and recover the information that we had.

104
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,710
But we need some more information on there so let's hop back into a blender and let's go in an edit

105
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,680
part of this queue save our file and then we see or at least get cracking we'll see there's a change

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,610
in that file.

107
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,890
So I could call this and I'm going to do the commit message in the lower right this time stretched corner

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,350
and one vertex moved also something along those lines.

109
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,170
I mean what are you putting your description is obviously up to you because it would be based upon what

110
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,330
you're doing.

111
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,910
So one vertex moved and then I'm going to do one final thing which is stage that change and we can unstaged

112
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,770
if we want or even if we wanted to revert to change that we made so you'd overwritten a particular texture

113
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,250
or something along those lines you know.

114
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,590
That took me ages to render out or something along those lines.

115
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,440
We could unstaged that for a second and we see here we've got a repo test blend I can right click on

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,800
it and discard those changes so we can just reverse one file back to a previous version if I want to.

117
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,030
But let's stage all changes and commit the changes.

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,610
And here we've got is started to build up a history of what we've done.

119
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,270
Final thing here that's hop out and add in a different mesh let's add in a Taurus and plop it over there

120
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,320
and finally save our file.

121
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,340
So we made a lot of edits to here we come in and we go this is our final word or whatever you know there's

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,200
there's lots of things you could do in there.

123
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,920
And I'm just going to commit that you don't always have to put a description in you would only need

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,580
to really put a description in it.

125
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,180
Your description your actual title of your commit your snapshot in time as it were if you wanted to

126
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,760
actually go ahead and use that.

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,020
So how would you go back to STARTING it.

128
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,410
Well if we go ahead and branch from it that is one of the safest ways to do it.

129
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,240
If you go ahead and branch and we're going to call it reverts or something something along those lines

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,350
for the moment as that's what we're testing we will now see over on the left hand side there's a master

131
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,270
and there's a revert.

132
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,160
Now they both look the same at the moment because this is a history if we go back and undo the reverse.

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,180
Right click on starting cube and make sure revert is selected over on the side and then we can reset

134
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,490
revert to this comet and hard.

135
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,870
Now hard will discard as it says there all changes that you've done.

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,010
And that's as if you've undone everything back to that point.

137
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,380
There are other options too.

138
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,420
But if I go hard here you can see that reverse ends up down here.

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,870
And now if I hop into a blender again and go ahead and revert as well.

140
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,430
Up here we can see that this has opened up that same file again if I go ahead and open in a number.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,900
Q.

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,200
Adding another cube and save the file.

143
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:20,770
We've now got two histories which is really useful so that I can call this to keeps or whatever it needs

144
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,110
to be a stage my changes I commit my changes.

145
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,080
I now have two histories.

146
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,760
One was a starting cube to our final work and one was two cubes same project start different end points.

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,550
Now we wanted to continue where we were before say the two cubes experiment was a failure that's fine

148
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,850
we can double click on Master over on the left hand side you can see that the check out was successful.

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,840
And then if we go ahead and open up blender what you see here is the.

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
It's exactly the same.

151
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,740
And by going to file and revert it's the same as re opening that file again.

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,160
And we will see that it goes back to our previous version.

153
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,810
And there we go there's a very brief overview of a version control system there.

154
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,120
And I've used get crack and there are plenty more out there now.

155
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,630
It isn't essential that you go ahead and do something like this.

156
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:18,140
However from personal experience it's saved my bacon so many times when I've been working on a project.

157
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,920
And it's also enabled me to do things that I'd otherwise be worried about doing.

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,460
And it also means that I don't have a hard drive full of different files.

159
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,980
In fact if we go ahead and have a look at that that folder that we had on the desktop I'm just going

160
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,000
to bring it down.

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,950
What we can see is that we have the gift folder.

162
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,690
That's because I've got hidden files turned on you dont touch that we've got the read me and the repo

163
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,930
test and there's no other files in there at all.

164
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,680
So that means doesn't matter how many commits I make on the Repo test or if I had the blender projects

165
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,510
within this project say if it was a part of a building that you're about to make for instance then you

166
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,780
can go ahead and do that so that you fund it doesn't end up cluttered.

167
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,760
If we were to do this in the more traditional save as sense it would be very hard to keep track and

168
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,480
it's very hard for you to stay honest about what is the current usable version.

169
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,150
And if you've got lots of what versions in there you're going to make a mistake at some point and it's

170
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,120
going to be a really painful mistake.

171
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,560
And I can guarantee you will want to avoid that where possible.

172
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,860
Okay so there we go.

173
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,100
If you've got any questions over version control do give us a shout otherwise enjoy using it.

174
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,660
Embrace it because it is going to save your bacon so many times in the future and I will see you all

175
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,120
in the next lecture.
