00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.090
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.080
This is going to be a quick lecture on creating your own shortcuts.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.050
Now we're not going to go as far as doing any python coding but we can very easily if you're constantly

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.560
using the same menu item you can often link it to a keyboard shortcut.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.800
In fact sometimes it may be that your favorite keyboard shortcut has changed.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.090
So for instance earlier on in the last lecture we will go into view navigation scrolling down here walk

7
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.630
navigation and it doesn't have a keyboard shortcut listed next to it it does in fact have a keyboard

8
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.680
shortcut.

9
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.570
How would we know about it.

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.660
Well there is a big long list of these under Edit Preferences.

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.530
If we go to the key map option we have every single keyboard shortcut you can think of in all of these

12
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.550
drop downs.

13
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.020
Now you're probably not gonna go through all of these individually.

14
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.610
However the very top there is a search box and there's a dropdown at the top where you can even go back

15
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.460
to the old style of selection if you wanted so and keyboard shortcuts.

16
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.480
I'm not going to do that though because that will confuse everybody.

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.750
But this search box here is really useful if I type in walk.

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.350
We get a series of options one of which is the view navigation because he hits a keyboard shortcut shift

19
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.310
and what looks like an apostrophe is not as the grave key.

20
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.380
It's on a lot of keyboards next to the one beneath the escape key.

21
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.630
So if I go back to my 3D view here and get a shift in the grave key I now have my first person view

22
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
I can turn on gravity and I can walk around my scene which is pretty awesome.

23
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.250
However if that wasn't an option for you How do you go ahead and create your own.

24
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.150
Well the keyboard shortcut key for this used to be shift and F and I still reach for that to this day

25
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.100
but if we wanted to enable that's again providing it doesn't already do something else which it might

26
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.580
do.

27
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.360
So be careful you can ruin blender doing this or certainly your experience of it if we go to view data

28
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.890
navigation go to where we want in this case the walk navigation in my case anyway and right click we

29
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.980
can assign a shortcut press a key shift and F look at that it even comes up now on that context so I

30
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.020
can now go shift and F and once again my desire to have a shift in F B first person mode.

31
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.900
There we go is there I'm ready.

32
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.490
Now the great thing about first person mode is you can actually press space and jump to locations as

33
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.040
well.

34
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.550
And that's whether or not you have gravity turned on.

35
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.920
Of course you would just fall down with the gravity turned on but it is incredibly useful.

36
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.890
There's nothing really to focus on elsewhere but this gives us a great way of moving around our scene.

37
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.730
As I said in the last lecture and oh

38
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.890
with the spacebar and this we can come back up we can hit TAB fly background and walk through the front

39
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.040
door so we can see that it's very straightforward to assign your own shortcut case.

40
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.320
Now I wouldn't go over the top with assigning them whilst you're new to the program is you really going

41
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.590
to have to start repeating yourself multiple times.

42
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.710
And if you find yourself going into a menu option repeatedly and selecting something.

43
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.750
So for instance adding the default cube Well we can assign a shortcut to that.

44
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.660
Perhaps control out shift and see.

45
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.400
But do be careful because it's very easy to overwrite the existing shortcuts if there is one already

46
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.370
there.

47
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.200
Now you may notice something that's a quick favorites on top.

48
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.320
So if adding a cube is something you do very often we can go and add two quick favorites.

49
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.660
It doesn't seem to do anything at first but now that we've added the cube to our quick favorites we

50
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.440
can just press the kuki and it will say cube.

51
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.210
Now this is incredibly useful.

52
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.080
There are certain things like flipping normals merging vertices and other things like that.

53
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.710
You can just get to really quickly from the Q menu and it's context sensitive as well.

54
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.090
If we're in object mode that menu will come up.

55
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.660
If we're in edit mode then it won't come up because we're talking about edit operations.

56
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.830
So later on when we come to you via unwrapping we can see here edge shortcut for that is control and

57
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.410
a control and he will bring up this menu if you find that opening up one of these all the time perhaps

58
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.070
marking a seam.

59
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.970
So I could go right click Add to quick favorites.

60
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.750
Now I can go.

61
00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.460
Queue marks seem incredibly useful being able to do that type of quick interaction with Blender and

62
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.750
it's going to become more and more important.

63
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.340
Now these things aren't necessary in order to use Blender.

64
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.490
However when it comes to larger projects being able to use keyboard shortcuts will enable you to be

65
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.120
much more productive on those larger projects.

66
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.390
Again there is no right or wrong but B being able to get to a function that you use often is kind to

67
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.080
be a real incentive.

68
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.690
In fact that's what some of the add ons actually end up doing.

69
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.760
They give you options and toggles that are not easily accessible in Blender normally.

70
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.930
Okay that's it for this lecture I hope you find that helpful if you've got any tips that you want to

71
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.020
share with others please go into the discussions and share your favorite keyboard shortcuts but just

72
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.180
the standard ones.

73
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.400
But if you've found that you've got one that's really useful.

74
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.460
Sharing it with the community is bound to help someone else out as well.

75
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.930
I look forward to seeing those keyboard shortcuts.

76
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.380
I may even learn something myself and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
