00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,950
Welcome to mathematics and images.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:10,770
So in this lecture we're going to learn how maths works in images and it can be difficult to comprehend

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,620
at first if maths is not your strong point.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,080
Do not worry we are going to be doing some very basic maths nothing too arduous now.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,330
If you think about how a computer is showing you an image it is a series of values.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,500
Each pixel of an image will have as searson red green and blue.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,030
Value.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,590
Initially we're going to focus on monochrome or grey scale and that is where the red green and blue

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,550
channels.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,520
So colour is generated from those three channels have the same value.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,260
Now if they all have a value of zero then you get a black image.

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,430
They all have a value of one or 100 percent or if the slider goes up to 255.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,850
Then you will have a white image and anything in-between where all the values of the same for red green

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,970
and blue you'll end up with some shade of grey.

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,690
Now each pixel on an image will have its own values.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,180
However to keep things simple we will have one value for all the pixels of our image.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,740
Now basic mathematics is just that.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,880
We're not going to do a deep dive into all the mathematical functions that are available to us.

19
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,920
We're literally going to be adding subtracting dividing and multiplying.

20
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,550
These are all just as you would expect them to be when you combine them together.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,220
So one plus one is two.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
It is as simple as that.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,110
Now you can build things up to make them more complicated or not necessarily more complicated but more

24
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,180
functional.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,990
But they are just simple steppingstones.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:00,550
Now it is important that we understand that values of less than zero or greater than one are still passed

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,840
through the system unless we use a clamping feature.

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,460
We will also see that the colour mix and convert are maths nodes function almost the same.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
However there are different options.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,020
They both got add subtract divide and if you use them you're going to get exactly the same result if

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,930
you leave everything a standard will have a quick look at that.

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,000
But when you're dealing with images it's probably best to use just the mix node.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,330
So let's go play with some basic mathematics now and hop on over in a blender.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,670
Right so over in the default blend file and this is all we need to do our compositing test.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,170
There is one thing I want to do and demonstrate for you and which will be one of the differences between

36
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,660
a mixed node and a maths node and we need to have a bit of colour in our image because if we render

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,590
out that cube it is just grey some going to go and change the diffuse colour of my cube to red or yellow

38
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,180
or pick a colour you like.

39
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,810
Excellent.

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,420
And I'm going to render that out now that's rendered out we can go straight into the compositing set

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,990
up so we can see a 3D view are image which isn't quite going yet and our node editor and because we're

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,950
in the compositing view our node editor has also been switched over to the compositing mode.

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,950
I'm going to put a ticking use notes.

44
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,030
I'm going to put a tick in backdrop which won't do anything at the moment because we don't have the

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,180
appropriate output node and I'm was going to turn on auto render and auto render will do is if we change

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,450
anything in our scene it will automatically re render it.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,270
Now I don't want it taking what however long it's going to take 5 seconds.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,730
Every single time.

49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,850
So I'm going to turn down my samples to one when I hit render And now if I move that cube it updates

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,280
nice and quickly.

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,190
Of course it's not going to be very high def or anything along those lines.

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,810
I'm also going to be a bit pernickity here and turn my lamp to a sunlamp.

53
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,930
This is one of these things that I've lost with the setting of maybe two.

54
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,920
Now nothing's changed nothing's changed in that render and it won't automatically update unless something

55
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,480
else in our scene has changed.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,890
I could move the lamp rotate if I can't do it from this view however.

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,820
So if I go ahead and move the lamp.

58
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,090
Now when I go back to our compositing view it should all be updated he says.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,270
Is it not.

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,330
There we go.

61
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,110
We have to move.

62
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,290
In this case that's all sorted we can by the way instead of moving it like that and actually potentially

63
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,720
destroying your set up you can move it by zero and it will also update worthwhile knowing.

64
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,970
So the final thing here is we can't see what's going on we need another output.

65
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,740
Known So all going to add in an output that's a viewer.

66
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,940
Then when we plug the image into vats as well we can see it in the background so we can see an update

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,110
in two different places.

68
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,630
Now this is a great way of trying out changes or in this case just sampling areas.

69
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,710
I'm going to turn off for the moment so our backgrounds are nice and clear and I'm also going to get

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,130
rid of The View and know just to keep things simple.

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,600
So let's have a look.

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
I'm going to unplug that for the moment so this will go black.

73
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,830
Because nothing is being rendered.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:22,090
And we've got a colour mix so you can get add colour mix or add converter maths.

75
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,490
Let's look at these side by side.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,640
They're very similar in what they do but they have different inputs and different outputs so they both

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,360
have a series of options.

78
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,010
I.e. the function it's going to perform.

79
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,990
And these are more maths orientated and these are more image orientated.

80
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,200
Now the inputs we've both got a clamp here the inputs I'm going to skip the factor for the moment the

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,690
inputs themselves are taking in three values.

82
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,560
That's why they are coloured in yellow.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,850
And the output is going to output three values.

84
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,510
Now the inputs here are just taking in one value and outputting one value.

85
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,250
So if we link all of these together in this order and make sure these are set to multiply and the reason

86
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm going to set them to multiply as an asset to a value of one and the bottom one here is white so

87
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,950
that's also one.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,280
So when we multiply by 1 we get the same output.

89
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:23,420
I'm going to plotly image in to hear the top note there and I'll get a plug the value this image output

90
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,370
of a multiply into here and then finally the view across as well.

91
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,430
And what we should get is a black and white image because it's taking the average of the three outputs

92
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,090
here and then outputting only one.

93
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,990
So that's essentially made this grey scale for us.

94
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:46,280
If we wanted so now for the rest of this particular tutorial I am not going to use the maths node just

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,420
to demonstrate it does exist and if you're just processing a single value.

96
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,820
In fact it would work very well with just greyscale images you can use the maths node.

97
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,750
Otherwise I'd recommend using the mixed node because it's all about mixing images.

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,390
Let's plug that back in and make sure everything's working perfect case so we knew there was something

99
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:11,630
just a little simpler just so we can get the hang of things only get rid of the renda layer inputs and

100
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,500
add in another type of input which is a value and I'm going to duplicate that so I have two of them.

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,610
So now if we have our multiply here if we multiply point five and point five together we get a value

102
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,180
that should be the same and we can test it.

103
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,950
If you keep your eyes down here I'm going to create another value node and set it as point to 5 and

104
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,430
plug that straight in to our image and it should look no different.

105
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,000
Excellent.

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,250
So that's working well.

107
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,400
I'll get rid of the extra value input.

108
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,080
Now let's have a look at what happens if we add one and one together or that's one in 11 minutes had

109
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,040
one and one together and add we get a white image but because we haven't clamped the values coming out

110
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,570
of here are two.

111
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,900
On both the RG and B channels and we can test that by duplicating our mix note.

112
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,950
And this time let's make this nump number larger let's make it nine.

113
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,960
So you've got a total of 10 coming out.

114
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,570
So if we divide 1.

115
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,100
By 10.

116
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,430
We should get.

117
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,870
I'm surprised that came out white.

118
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh we're still having divide.

119
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,790
There we go we get a dark dark grey.

120
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,640
If we clamps that it doesn't matter what these values coming in will be because it will clamp the value

121
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:49,240
at a maximum of one or two hundred fifty five on each of the RG B channels and clamping.

122
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,950
There we go it's gone white.

123
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,790
Excellent.

124
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,780
So we got a good grasp here of our node setups and how the mix node can be used.

125
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,460
There are lots of other options we won't be dealing with them quite at this moment in time.

126
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,930
But you've got your multipliers and as I've already stated if you multiply something by one you get

127
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:14,140
the same thing coming out as worthwhile knowing if you're mixing masks together and we've got the fact

128
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,630
a slider here very important if you want to have 100 percent influence of well let's say we can do this

129
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,700
let's go ahead and add in that render layer again so inputs render layer.

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,230
No it's getting a bit small there size zoom back in.

131
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,290
So we have an image here.

132
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,240
That we can use as a factor.

133
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,410
And at the moment we're adding these two different images together one of nine and one to one which

134
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,880
will both be white if we have let's say we add in point 1 and point five and see if that's made any

135
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,110
difference as it comes through I'm going to get rid of this divide as well so we are just dealing with

136
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,620
the one and now we go we can actually see the cube it's not that strong probably because of the colours

137
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,910
I've picked.

138
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,950
Let's play with these values here so they're being added together.

139
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,460
There we go we can see the image a little better now so we can see that we're using this image here

140
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,450
not the best image as a mask for these two colours coming through.

141
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,240
If we pick one of the other options we get different results.

142
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,080
In fact you can go through and play with these and see what results you get in how it effects an image.

143
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,630
Now obviously at the moment with these two values coming through the output will always be grey until

144
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,800
we get colour coming through and then you would get a different effect.

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,940
Now one of the things to just be aware of is if we have a value of one and a value of nauts let's just

146
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,350
delete the rendle air to make things simple again.

147
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,820
And we set this to mix mixing is the one that's not really explained very well because it's not saying

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,940
average.

149
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,230
But the facts are down here can be very confusing.

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,900
So a factor of 1 means that it's weighted towards this bottom one completely a factor of Zero means

151
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,920
it's weighted towards the top one.

152
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,490
So this can be very confusing if you want a pure average between the two you're going to have to put

153
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,830
in point five.

154
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,800
And then the average of 1 and 0 when you add them together and divide them by the total number you have.

155
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,880
So you will end up with point five.

156
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,440
Now I'm going to test my theory here by making another valley you know putting in point five and just

157
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,310
linking it across and seeing if there's any change in the image.

158
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,950
There's not so that just confirms that a factor of point five when your mixing will average the two

159
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,180
inputs.

160
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,900
Excellent.

161
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,410
Now we've got a handle on using image a maths together.

162
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,510
It's time for a challenge and our challenge is what is the output value.

163
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,470
Now this is going to be quite straightforward mathematics.

164
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,690
If your experience with mathematics you may even find this a real doddle.

165
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:03,140
But what I'd also like you to do as well as giving the answer is what the Shade of Grey will be.

166
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,240
Or whether it'll be black or white and do compare that over in blender as well and make sure what you

167
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,210
think the answer results in is what happens.

168
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,200
So what happens if you add point five and point five together.

169
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,940
What happens if you subtract one from point five.

170
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,250
Clamped.

171
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,180
What does adding point five and one result in.

172
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,520
What happens if you multiply point five and point five.

173
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,590
What happens if you multiply 0 by 1.

174
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,010
What happens if you divide point 5 by 1.

175
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,830
And what happens if you divide point five by point five.

176
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,150
Pause a video now go through those.

177
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,340
Answer them and do check over in blender.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,530
If the colour output that you thought would happen is what happens.

179
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,090
Okay Welcome back let's go have a look at the answers so giving an answer and what the Shade of Grey

180
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,840
will be.

181
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,930
Or of course if it's black or white.

182
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,650
So what happens when you add point five and point five when you get one which will turn out to be white.

183
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:19,310
What happens when you subtract one from point five you get minus point five which is black because we've

184
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,340
gone to zero and we can't really go beyond it.

185
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,930
If clamped.

186
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:31,130
What does adding point five and one equal or that equals one because it's clamped so it can't go any

187
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,820
higher than one.

188
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,410
If you added a million and one together you would still get the answer one.

189
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,010
And that would also be white.

190
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:46,730
Now what does a multiplying point five point five together you'll get a point twenty five together which

191
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,570
will be a darker grey than you had initially.

192
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:58,000
What does multiplying zero by 1 while multiplying anything by zero is always zero.

193
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,810
They do have to be cautious about this because if you got something in your scene that is zero and you're

194
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:09,780
not using it as a mask it will cancel out colours especially when multiplying and will result in black.

195
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,950
And of course as we've experienced in the past nothing in the real world except maybe a black hole is

196
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,300
truly black.

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:24,440
So do be very cautious if you ever end up multiplying something by zero unless it's a mask.

198
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,330
Now dividing north point five by one well you get point five which is a mid level grey.

199
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,700
And then finally point five by point five.

200
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,780
If you divide them you get a value of one which is white.

201
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,980
How did you guys get on.

202
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,450
Did you find this straightforward.

203
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,820
It is pretty basic maths but when you think about how it relates to colours sometimes that can be a

204
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,210
little confusing.

205
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,780
Remember to play with the sliders see if you can get a bit of an intuition for it.

206
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,690
Share your work in discussions in anything you've discovered over on the forum and I will see you guys

207
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,270
in the next lecture.
