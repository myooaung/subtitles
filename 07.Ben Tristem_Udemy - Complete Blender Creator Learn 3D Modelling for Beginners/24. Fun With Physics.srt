00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,670
Hello and welcome to this bonus lecture in the bowling section.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,970
In this lecture, we're going to be animating our bowling scene using physics and the animation timeline

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,140
to produce a result much like this one.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,880
Boom.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,500
And with that in mind, let's get started.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,910
Welcome back.

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,710
When I collect this pen and focus on it with the number pad zero.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,870
So we've got a tumble round point case where all of these other pens are completely out of place and

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,060
no good for what we want.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,070
We're going to select Paul, who's been using left click and shift a press, delete key and remove all

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,850
of those pens.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,500
So we're gonna do a ball at the moment because it's in the way here.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,720
So I'm just going to let the ball.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,290
And the first thing I want to do is set origin to 3D caster.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,700
Now select.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,180
Geometry to origin.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,650
There we go.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,070
Back up a little bit, so.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,160
We're not in the floor there.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,530
Maybe go Doudou and move along the G.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,110
Why access to get out of the way for now?

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,940
Well, some first thing we're going to do as well with a pen is something very similar.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,090
If I can just select the pen.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,800
Never go set.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,100
Origins of the 3D cursor and then set origin.

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,110
To geometry, to origin.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,550
And we've got to set that up a little bit.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,540
There we go.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,880
And if we go to three on the side view with an iPad, we can pull this up a little bit.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,070
On notices when Mikey's made the pins, then look quite flat on the bottom.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,370
So we have to go into edit mode using the tap.

32
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,820
Okay.

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,530
Press the number one key on the number line to change the vertex select and a pair.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm going to go into X-ray mode and change the viewport shading to wireframe the zoom in a little bit

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,100
and send to my day.

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,620
There we go.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm just going to box select from here.

38
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,630
This line here downward.

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,930
There we go.

40
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,810
Now press the X key and delete the vertices.

41
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,270
And because we had the x ray in transparent node on, we were able to select vertices all the way through

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,720
the model.

43
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,070
This pointing a press olt unless kleck to select that edge loop.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,380
Press F to fill the face.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,640
And just because it looks a little out there, I'm gonna scale it ever so slightly.

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,720
There we go.

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,430
I'm gonna go back into object mode and go g and sex and the origin point comes with us.

48
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,810
There we go.

49
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,600
Maybe just a bit more to get that closer to that line, which is actually our plane.

50
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,870
And you can hold shift down to make it smaller increments to make it a bit more easy to place.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,650
Excellent.

52
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,490
Let's go back into solid mode and we can turn off the x ray mode to get our pin and then we have a single

53
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,850
pin.

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,140
Brilliant.

55
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,620
That's right, click.

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,480
Put the origins, the center mass volume, just to make sure everything's working okay.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,840
And that's our PIN, almost set up, ready to go for the moment.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,090
I want to take a look at the bowling ball and our alley because we need to get our bowling ball down

59
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,720
to appends.

60
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:09,900
So.

61
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,000
So that bowling ball.

62
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,420
Gee, why move it back bit further as well?

63
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,640
Now, I'm going to pull this line up here and expose the timeline for you.

64
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,350
We haven't encountered the timeline and will account for it again in the animated lamp section after

65
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,550
the next chess section.

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,840
But I wanted to introduce it here to show the timeline and what we can do with it, with some with the

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,700
bow selected.

68
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,040
We're gonna select the physics properties here, which is just under the particle properties and two

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,260
down from the modifiers which you will remember from previous sections.

70
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,930
So let's click on this and add a rigid body.

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,120
And if you done game engine work, you'll know what a rigid body is.

72
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,020
It's an object that's directly controlled by simulation.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,980
So let's add one.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,400
Now, we wanted to be active because we wanted to move.

75
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,370
So we wanted to be controlled by the simulation results.

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,640
And one kilogram is pretty light for a ball.

77
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,990
So let's give it 10 kilograms.

78
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,030
Let's just play it, see what happens.

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,560
Odia.

80
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,110
The ball fell straight through the floor.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,710
And the reason being is Brender has no idea of the moment that the plane is supposed to interact with

82
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,160
the ball.

83
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,200
So that's other ruddy rigid body.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,190
And instead of being active because we don't want it to move, we want wanted to be passive so that

85
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,630
we'll just sit there and interact with the physical objects in the world.

86
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,850
It will naturally move, repress, play.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,820
Now you find the ball just kind of rolls off the plane, but it doesn't feel free because it's interacting

88
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:44,960
with the physics body, physics, rigid body, sorry, on the plane, which is our coming out bowling

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,170
alley.

90
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,670
So let's go back to our first keyframe here.

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,560
On one hand selectable again.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,460
And what we want is to give up all some momentum, so that actually moves down those high down the bowling

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:58,760
alley.

94
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,430
So let's click the animated button.

95
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,600
This allows us to control the ball by the animation system.

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,200
And what we want to do here is we want to, first of all, press.

97
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,530
And this will insert a key frame to our timeline.

98
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,340
What we do is we can set a key frame for location, rotation and scale and pull that up a bit just a

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,930
bit further.

100
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,750
And you can see this four points here on the timeline and that designates that at this point.

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,310
This ball is here.

102
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,650
What we're gonna do is we're also going to hover over the animated checkbox to make sure it's on press

103
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,050
eye.

104
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:42,380
This tells the timeline because we're using the animation timeline system now that at this point we

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,880
want the ball to follow the animation system and not the physics system.

106
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,600
So we're going to move this timeline forward now to about frame 10.

107
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,730
I can do this by dragging there or I can clicking here and change this to whichever frame I want.

108
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,520
And at this frame, I'm going to key.

109
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:10,490
Why why move the ball forward to probably about here to get some really good momentum and we're going

110
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,030
to I keyframe location, rotation and scale.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,900
And then we're going to turn off the animated checkbox and keyframe it there.

112
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,540
Now last week, because it's gone back to the beginning.

113
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,880
But if we go back, it will run the animation and we will get everything we expect.

114
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,510
So let's just play both.

115
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,540
There goes the ball.

116
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,390
But what happens at the other end?

117
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,560
It's got back to the beginning of the animation and you'll notice when I chase the pen down here.

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,280
If I can selective about selecting the camera, the time line is gone.

119
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,320
This is because each object has its own timeline.

120
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,790
So when we press play, what happens?

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,420
Wow.

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,560
Ball comes down.

123
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,400
It disappears straight past the pin boom gone.

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,960
That's because, again, we have no roof physics, rigid body on our pin.

125
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,290
So let's add one.

126
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,900
We can't keep active.

127
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,360
And what we want to do now is watch the pendants.

128
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,400
We press play.

129
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,640
We are going to animate it or anything.

130
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,140
We're just going to give it some physics.

131
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,430
Both call.

132
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
That happened quite quickly.

133
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
So a pin hit it.

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,570
But normally what you would see is a better jittering here and it's probably going to be better to see

135
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,000
it when we've got more pins on the board.

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,460
But for now, what we want to do is checkbox the animated box, animated box again and press IJA keyframe

137
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,320
it, because we're going to have this only be animated.

138
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,210
At the beginning, so it doesn't move.

139
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,210
It just stays there.

140
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,040
And then when the ball comes in, we're going to run the timeline forward.

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,240
And here comes the ball.

142
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,690
And just at the point, just for his.

143
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,310
I think it's about 17.

144
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,460
I turn off the animated system and press eye to keyframe that it's off.

145
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,010
And then the physics system will take over for the pin.

146
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,550
So let's get back to the beginning again by hitting one.

147
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:19,820
Well, by hitting that button and then press play and boom, it knocks the pin flying.

148
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,720
So now we can set up our scene and what we can do is go through the top to you, the number Pad seven

149
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,120
K.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,320
A reminder, we're looking down a bowling alley.

151
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:40,420
So we want to I'm going to place these rather roughly to shift day to duplicate place that roughly about

152
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,680
their shift day and on the X-axis.

153
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,030
Bring that over a little bit.

154
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,370
Now, these are probably too close, but you can measure the dimensions like we did in the previous

155
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:51,820
lectures.

156
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:59,050
I'm just doing this to show you quickly and control easy and undo that because he has managed to select

157
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,440
the.

158
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,600
Bowling alley, as well as the pennant deeper case, a shift day, that's better.

159
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,950
We've only got the bowling pins now.

160
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,400
It's going to grab that middle one and shift.

161
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,620
They move it across again.

162
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,510
Again, this is very rough and ready just to show you that his existence 50 over there and you'll notice

163
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,430
we've caught that plane again, bane of my existence, catching the plane when I'm clicking.

164
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,670
What's actually happening is it's copying the animation data over.

165
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:38,270
So anything that has been on this first pin will be duplicated and all of the pins will react the same

166
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,010
at the same point in time.

167
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,860
So let's get that one done.

168
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,520
Click this.

169
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,820
And I think that's tenpin.

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:45,980
Yep.

171
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,810
That's 10 p.m. and we don't need another line.

172
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,920
So let's just get that in position roughly where we want it.

173
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:52,960
Brilliant.

174
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,590
Let's tumble around.

175
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,500
And that we're all set up, so let's press play and see what happens.

176
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,080
Boom.

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,550
We have a strike.

178
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Brilliant.

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,750
You noticed the pins are just rolling around and we really don't need an animation this long.

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,920
So let's have a look.

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,480
Most of the animation is done by about a hundred frames.

182
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,370
What we do also want to do.

183
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:26,760
Is to good times of frames, because everything seems to be about finished their.

184
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,950
Again, if you are in trouble in title number in here, or you can use the arrows to change that.

185
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,790
And also we want to change the end of the animation to be a 100, which will become important later

186
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,370
when we render to make sure that we are actually only rendering frames one to one hundred.

187
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,880
And so that's all set up.

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,970
OK.

189
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,110
So with that done, what we wanted to do now is we want to check our render settings to Pagode to here

190
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,730
and our output properties.

191
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,120
You'll notice I've deliberately left the frame right at 24 seconds, 24 frames, four seconds.

192
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,590
We press play.

193
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,450
I'll say now animation plays.

194
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,480
But what happens if we change it to the 30 frames per second?

195
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,200
Pressplay.

196
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,140
It does speed up higher animation a little for this purpose.

197
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,150
It really doesn't matter.

198
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,980
But for most animations, you'd want this to be 30 frames per second.

199
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,220
Now, if you need to adjust it, you can remap the timing so you can adjust it so that it's a it's a

200
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,010
bit better with the speed.

201
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,760
But we won't go into that in this lecture.

202
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,010
Maybe we'll cover that in a later lecture.

203
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,810
So how do we run out?

204
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,370
Well, if we scroll down from our render options here.

205
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,270
We can say that we have an output folder now currently is set to the tent folder.

206
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,710
I really want the tent folder.

207
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,920
Let's go put it in documents for a minute.

208
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:11,610
We just put it in documents there, except now what I recommend you do is you can go and use the compositor

209
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,990
and render out two images and you can go into the compositor up here and then put it into a timeline.

210
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,080
We're not going to do that with the modern technologies we have today.

211
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,890
Mostly, you're not going to crash doing a video.

212
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,740
So we don't change this Panji down to a FSR MPEG video.

213
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,860
And it's as it's the most common one everybody has.

214
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,610
We're going to leave this alone as a MKC file.

215
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,560
I did try earlier to do other versions, but it didn't work for me.

216
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,900
I think it's possibly because it's a driver's issue.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,890
So when we're encoding, we want to encode a video in.

218
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,090
It'll go straight out to this soda.

219
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,820
And all we simply do is we've checked our Framestore is one frame and is one hundred, which matches

220
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,270
our animation and the frame rate is 30 frames per second.

221
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,860
And what we do is we go to the rendering tab just so we're in the rendering tab.

222
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,150
We go render and we want to render the animation like that.

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,190
And that will start to render your animation out to a video frame by frame.

224
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,350
Now, I'm going to leave this to play for a moment and I'll pop back when it's done.

225
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,430
Okay, so welcome back.

226
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,830
The animation has finished running just pop open blender here so you can actually see that.

227
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,010
There we go.

228
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,540
I've got it set to a different frame as I was checking something.

229
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,630
So let's ask about to frame one again.

230
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,810
Can enter one there.

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,660
Let's just press play.

232
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,190
Everything works perfectly fine in blender.

233
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,660
So stop that and come back to my file system and double click the output of the video.

234
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,020
And there we go.

235
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,890
Boom.

236
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,870
We have a strike.

237
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,770
Awesome.

238
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,500
I'd love to see what you have created.

239
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,040
Don't forget to share in the discussions on the community forums.

240
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,790
I'll see you in another lecture.
