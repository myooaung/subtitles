1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,640
Welcome to the cell fracture add on.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,950
So this is going to be all about fracturing objects.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,970
In fact the next couple of lectures are also going to be about fracturing objects.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,270
Using this tool.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,350
So we're going to go ahead and turn on the cell fracture add on.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,260
It's not enabled by default.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,800
We'll just turn it on so we can use it.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,150
We're going to have an overview of that Aadhar add on as well.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,890
We're going to look at the various ways of fracturing our model and how to prevent random explosions

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,040
when you start applying physics.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,770
We're going to break apart the model only use in the object itself.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,590
There are a couple of other options and we'll deal with the manual fracturing using these other options

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,710
in following lectures.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,730
So let's go start fracturing things and hop on over in a blender.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,500
Okay so I've opened up blender fresh with our default cube in the scene that we can play with.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,180
I'm actually going to lift that up on the z axis by one.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,400
And yeah I'm going to say fats because I'd prefer if I'm going to start with a cue that it starts on

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,550
some of the same my start up.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,180
Now you may also notice that the rest of my settings changed ever so slightly I had a bit of a computer

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,050
hiccup but I needed to restore everything.

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,330
So there may be some add ons that I need to re-enable etc..

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,710
But back to basically the standard default layouts here.

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,840
Now speaking of add ons we need to go to our user preferences and enable the cell fracture.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,270
So once you're in the user preferences go to the add ons tab along the top in the search field on the

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,290
top left there of which typing cell.

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,540
We will have the option here object cell fracture puts a tick in the little check box then I recommend

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,900
you press Save user settings so that this particular add on comes on every time you start blender.

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,930
Okay.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,370
Now how do you access it.

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,230
Well there are a couple of ways it should now be added to the tool shelf.

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,800
If we scroll down there's a button that says cell fracture with an object selected or objects you can

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,220
just hit cell fracture and it will come up.

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,060
Now I'm not going to do it that way.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,130
I am going to skate to get rid of it.

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm going to use the space menu for searching in the 3D editor and type in cell and there it is.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,690
And that will enable me because blender remembers what you searched for last to come out changed the

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,050
settings and literally press space and enter and bring this back up every time.

38
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,140
Now it does pop up kind of in the way does it pop up whether 3D cursor is by any chance.

39
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,880
Might do might come up on the edge.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,470
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,100
But either way there we go.

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,980
That's up.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,850
And oh my word there are a lot of options here.

44
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,600
What did they all mean.

45
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,860
We'll go through them individually kind of as we're going through would be a bit jumpy up and down this

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,430
list and we'll reveal things as they become more important.

47
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:56,490
First of all let's have a play or let's have a look at what options we've got along the top here.

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,650
We've got a point source of this tells blender where my fracturing from.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,430
What am I using.

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:11,290
So we've got the option of own verses which are the verses that are of that object we've got child vertices.

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:19,130
Okay so if this object has any children will be using the vertices of that chip or of those children.

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,860
There are more than one next.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,670
We have own particles and charged particles.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,020
As you can probably tell they are to do with the particle system that it has or any of its children

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,660
have.

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,080
Now we're not going to use those in this particular ammit discussion on the cell fracture as we've already

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,150
played with the particle system.

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,530
Feel free to play with that yourselves.

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:47,290
We also have the grease pencil as well so we can actually draw and help guide this tool where we wanted

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,610
to fracture.

61
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,740
So let's actually start fracturing something.

62
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,500
What happens if we go to Owen Virts because that's the only real option we've got at the moment and

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,390
we're going to leave recursive alone.

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,170
And in general if you're running a physics simulation recursive can cause you a lot of problems especially

65
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,230
when it comes to things spontaneously exploding.

66
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:14,460
We don't want that meshed data we may need to tweak this Slider here.

67
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,710
This value which if we hover over it says the gaps for fracture.

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,080
So occasioning you need to make the gaps bigger.

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,670
And as it says there to give more stable physics that's how you really avoid things exploding if you

70
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,490
start cutting them up into smaller amounts.

71
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,960
Now physics and volu Well that's absolutely fine.

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,570
It's going to give all the bits that it breaks into a mass of one.

73
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,880
Now that can be problematic if you got small pieces that weigh the same amount as larger pieces it's

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,680
going to look pretty odd especially if you've broken up one object because all of a sudden you've got

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,890
a small piece that weighs as much as potentially the whole object to begin with.

76
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,850
That's going to look very odd.

77
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,200
Now when you break things up into individual mesh objects they're all going to have origins and this

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,350
make sure this setting that's already tic's recentre make sure that the actual origins are all at the

79
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,580
centre point of all of those objects and will look at making the weights more logical as well in a few

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,330
moments.

81
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,210
The scene now this is important.

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,370
This next layer thing is through me the first time I started using cell fracture it means that when

83
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,040
we actually run the operation which will do momentarily it puts the way that it's broken it up it puts

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,800
all of those objects onto another layer.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,090
In fact it puts them on the next layer.

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,420
So in this case we're on layer 1.

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,150
They would appear on late too and finally show progress.

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,210
I like having the show progress on because it basically means you can see where the blender has crashed

89
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,810
or not.

90
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,650
And this is one of these operations that can either crash or you get a value wrong and it blows everything

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,280
to pieces which we don't want and I don't mean blow it to pieces as in the physics engine it shatters

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,170
all over the place.

93
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,410
I literally mean I made a mistake earlier whilst recording one of these videos.

94
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,530
And ah.

95
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,890
It would have taken about six hours to actually do the calculations it hadn't locked up blender but

96
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,480
it was going to take quite a while to do and event dealt with something like 2 million polygons in my

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,330
scene which is just obscene for a basic cube.

98
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay so let's go ahead and just click okay and see what happens.

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay so let's go to the second layer and let's have a look at the outline as well.

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,490
So we've got the cube cell all the way down to seven but it starts at zero here.

101
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,930
So that means we've got eight chunks and we had eight vertices to begin with.

102
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,180
Okay that kind of makes sense.

103
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,320
And now let's just add physics to this without gravity so that's going to save my scene in a second

104
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,610
no gravity and going to apply physics.

105
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,600
Going to make sure selects everything to give us something to add and active to the mall and a save

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,050
that in my Am I in my prototypes.

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,850
Yes I am.

108
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:05,950
And I'm going to call this what I call and I call it cell fracture basic cube just so I know what's

109
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,800
going on.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,370
Okay.

111
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,370
So let's run this.

112
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,000
This animation and it doesn't fly apart.

113
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,900
That is something that you should check early on.

114
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,520
If you've made something too detailed or perhaps use recursion.

115
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,750
You may end up with your model flying parts.

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,450
Okay so that's a good start.

117
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,640
It's not self destructing on us.

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,400
And indeed if we were to lift it up slightly and add a ground plane.

119
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,120
And scale that up and give that passive what we should find is a return gravity back on and just run

120
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,630
that we didn't move it on frame one.

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,320
There we go.

122
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,420
It's broken into its various pieces.

123
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,980
Brilliant.

124
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,290
But that's not a very convincing break and yes it was.

125
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,740
I was going to say a Rubik's Cube a Rubik's Cube has more parts than that.

126
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,720
So let's start playing with how many pieces it breaks into.

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,760
So I'm just going to reset I'm not going to play anything.

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,040
One of the things I do recommend is you pause and rewind right back to the beginning if you start altering

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,700
anything.

130
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,190
In fact in this case I'm literally just going to hit the UNDO key several times until we get rid of

131
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,120
all of this lot so back to our basic cube function to redo there.

132
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,140
So I'm back to this position.

133
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay space and end so bring up my mesh tools here my fracture tools.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,010
So we've got this source limit here that controls how many pieces it's going to break into.

135
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:35,800
So if I set that down to six or even let's say five let's go for five pieces.

136
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,430
I when I click okay here I'd expect to see here we go zero to four.

137
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Perfect.

138
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,350
And of course when we have a closer look at the object we can see it's been broken into different shaped

139
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,640
pieces.

140
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,110
Actually I quite like that.

141
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,480
So you can play with that and get some decent breakages.

142
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,650
Now there are some other options that you can do around here so let's just undo that back to before.

143
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,570
There we go.

144
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm going to hit space and enter again.

145
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,620
Let's have a look at the other options.

146
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,420
We can do so we can actually include recursion and I'll show you what that does.

147
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,430
Now one of my favourite bits with this is you can set it around the cursor for instance and I'm going

148
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,010
to turn up recursion to maybe four or five.

149
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,410
Don't go nuts with this.

150
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,020
If you do it will take ages to calculate.

151
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,090
And here we have the like likelihood of recursion so we can up that a little as well if you want.

152
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,900
Now there is a clamp here.

153
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,540
So it does stop at a certain point because here we go.

154
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,810
It prevents it reaching an s silly amount so won't recur go back down its chain basically more than

155
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,040
a 250 times in this case.

156
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,800
So let's just click okay and we can see that it breaks apart and it goes into each beer and breaks those

157
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,270
apart individually.

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,730
Now blender can take a while to do this and I would recommend just being careful when you do do it.

159
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,630
So let's go to Layer 2 and see what's happened.

160
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,330
Okay so it's broken a lot around the base and less around the top.

161
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Brilliant.

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,150
So what that means now is that it will smash up into smaller pieces around it.

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,250
Let's have a look at the settings I have because I had it set cursor here closer to the cursor means

164
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,740
that because the cursor was on the very bottom where it actually doesn't matter where the cursor was.

165
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,450
Just close once of a cursor get broken up into smaller pieces.

166
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,370
I could have gone for random small big or far away from the cursor and the press Escape.

167
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:36,940
Never Press.

168
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,600
Okay if you've already got a lot of objects easy and I'm gonna add active to all of these pieces while

169
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,620
I've got them Selecta them asking to turn off gravity and see if it's going to blow itself apart.

170
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,500
Hey it looks like it's not going to that's great.

171
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,430
I'm now going to reset the animation pull it up and actually add in that ground plane that we had before

172
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,730
scaled that up hit passive on that so it's got something to impact under the term gravity back on.

173
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,410
And now we'll see when it hits the ground it breaks into lots of small pieces.

174
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,640
How cool is that.

175
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,960
I absolutely love playing with this tool.

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,520
And of course it was the animations playing let's say we turn gravity off and rewind.

177
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,700
We can grab a piece and start knocking it apart so you can get in sort of a feeling of how this is going

178
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,320
to work.

179
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,700
And if you let it ah missed it.

180
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,070
I'm not sure I can impact from here.

181
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,180
That's one of the dangers.

182
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,930
By the way of annamay moving it whilst it's animating I've accidentally moved this particular sub part

183
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,210
of it to another location so I'm just going to have to undo until it's back into the right place and

184
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,730
hopefully there we go.

185
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,610
Unfortunately you can't wave something about when it's there when it's not being animated so we just

186
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,540
press play here.

187
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,300
It looks like in this case recursion has not caused it to blow itself apart.

188
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,020
Occasionally it does.

189
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,460
Do be careful when you're using it.

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,570
Okay.

191
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:11,750
Now that's got us all set up now ready for a challenge and your challenge is exploding bricks.

192
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:19,100
So in your wall animation have some of your brick work break into much smaller pieces and ideally they

193
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,240
should break up when the projectile hits the wall.

194
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,970
Pause a video now and give that a go.

195
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,510
Okay guys welcome back.

196
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,150
Let's go explodes and bricks into some much smaller pieces.

197
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,410
Over in blender.

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,840
Okay so I've gone ahead here and opened up my wall and let's just make sure it's still behaving as would

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,330
expect it to boom straight through.

200
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay.

201
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,780
Some scan of these select everything here.

202
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,820
Go back to the very beginning frame and whizzed round to the front and do some selecting.

203
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,130
Now you do need to be careful in selecting because we can actually see this object for projectile through

204
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,940
the wall.

205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,130
What we don't want to accidentally do is end up grabbing that as well and do whatever we want to do

206
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,710
to fracturing this wall so that by accident.

207
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,240
So I'm going to hide my projectile for the moment completely from the scene.

208
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm going to hold down control as I do that to hide the forcefield that's attached to it as well.

209
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,930
Now one of the things that I noticed when I was round is one of these bricks is a bit awkwardly placed.

210
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,950
I must have moved it when running a physics simulation.

211
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:30,180
Someone is going to pop it roughly back in the right place and on and from here start selecting my objects.

212
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,870
So as the projectile comes in is going to knock several of these.

213
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,840
I am absolutely flying.

214
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:44,400
I'll have to keep it particularly simple I don't want to get to air exaggerated at this point.

215
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,180
I want to see proof of concept if you will a one to make sure it works before going crazy with it.

216
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,440
So the first thing I need to do is fracture those and I'm going to do a simple fracture I'm not going

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,970
to do any recursive or anything along those lines.

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,340
So I want to make sure the whole process works.

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,050
So I'm going to go ahead of select the ones I want to break into multiple bits.

220
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,290
And I'm going to click okay and that should give us absolutely loads of little bits.

221
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,750
Just wait for it to go through and once it's finished doing that's what I'll do is I'll apply all of

222
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,070
those which should now be on lyoto.

223
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,310
Perfect and select them all these select to reselect that make sure that anything else that's selected.

224
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,990
In fact we have still got something selected on another layer.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,180
So let's just make sure there's nothing selected there and just these are selected.

226
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm going to click to put air the 3D cursor near here and found an ego shift in S and cursed selected

227
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,370
to put it smack bang in the middle.

228
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,390
And I'm going to add an empty.

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,760
Doesn't matter what type of intimate's come to use a plain sison and a name that's broken bricks.

230
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,250
So I have some control broken bridges.

231
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,190
Okay.

232
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,010
That's how I feel some titans.

233
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,560
Okay broken bricks.

234
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,750
And finally I'm going to select everything broken bricks should now be the active.

235
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,420
Yes is control and pay.

236
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,440
We're going to parents all of these broken bricks and that also means I can select them quickly as well.

237
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,170
Now we're going to be applying physics Savvis we might as well borrow the physics we've already got

238
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:23,590
set up so I'm going to select one of the other bricks and go to the physics selection and just go to.

239
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,980
Let's see what we've got here.

240
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,210
Copy from active that's why once and now they got physics applied to them.

241
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,190
Let's just run this animation and see what happens.

242
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,730
Okay.

243
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,550
They blow each other apart.

244
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,430
The main reason for that is we've still got bricks inside bricks.

245
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,660
So all of these extra bricks that we have are inside the original bricks causing this problem.

246
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,900
So we need to go through and literally delete the ones we don't want anymore.

247
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,930
So looking at what we've got here I'm just going to skip between the two with the one and two keys.

248
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,250
And I think I'm just going to have to manually select.

249
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,770
Hoover as well.

250
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,580
So there we go those are those ones gone I hope I haven't deleted anything else which should mean now

251
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,430
we can rebuild the wall.

252
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,790
Excellent.

253
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,210
And going to unhide that projectile and just see how it's working.

254
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,700
This is being lean about it this is making sure that the actual scene itself is working at each individual

255
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,630
stage.

256
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,920
Okay so that is working it's not all the forcefield apply to it at the moment but that's fine.

257
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,340
We can add it in by moving them to the other layer and we can do that straight away.

258
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,250
But it is falling apart so that one problem at a time it's not being affected by the forcefield.

259
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,190
We can do later on but it falling apart straight away.

260
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,170
To be expected of course is not that great so we want it to fall apart on our command.

261
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,720
So we need to keep that in some select one of these objects and just make sure it works with one of

262
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,760
them to begin with.

263
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,600
So we want to in the rigid body toggle animation on and off much work like we did with the projectile.

264
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,910
So I'm going to toggle the animated here.

265
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:08,210
We want it on initially at frayne's 0 saying turn it on and press won over the animated a lot of go

266
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:16,760
surfing it was frame 20 so were impax am going to go to 22 and actually key in the factor that's turned

267
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,760
off.

268
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,270
And what we should get there is this bit staying still and then being knocked out at 20 to perfect.

269
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,890
That's exactly what I want.

270
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,550
Now we need a copy that's everything else something to select everything else with the a key.

271
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,830
And now we need to make links to the animation data so controlled an L animation data and what we should

272
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,920
find is that now stay still and then it gets knocked through and crumbles.

273
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,690
Perfect is not the best looking at the moment.

274
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,680
So the final thing here I say final There's always another thing to be done afterwards.

275
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,290
The penultimate perhaps I don't know.

276
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,470
So we're going to move all of those to layer 1.

277
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,090
Now that they're on layer 1 they should also be affected by that forcefield.

278
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,190
So let's rewind press play.

279
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh but something weird is happening there.

280
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,710
I'm just gonna save my work and reload my screen reverts.

281
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,620
I don't know.

282
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,350
There we go.

283
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,720
Boom.

284
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,110
Excellent.

285
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,650
That's it.

286
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,340
There were I couldn't have asked for anything better there perhaps a smaller explosion since there.

287
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,220
If we imagine where the camera's going to be most of those bricks.

288
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,800
Well at disappearing off.

289
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,430
So again a little bit of refinement at this stage just to get more or less what you want.

290
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,930
A couple of bricks that seem to be staying still and they stay completely still.

291
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:46,100
There are a couple of bricks here that seem to have completely given up with being part of our world.

292
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,240
Let's just watch this.

293
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,520
Boom it's coming in.

294
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,220
So we just need to go into that forcefield and the animation for the forcefield and perhaps not have

295
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,730
it here it goes from zero to 5000 back down to zero.

296
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,690
Sorry 50000.

297
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,270
So let's lower that down to 20000.

298
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,700
Remember to keep it in other ways it won't work and just test it.

299
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,770
And again do little things at a time.

300
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,420
And that is much better.

301
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,800
You gather up as it goes apart yes these broken bricks aren't the best looking in the world.

302
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,780
I'm going to increase the frame count here to 100 to watch everything collapse and I'm going to sort

303
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,060
out these other bricks in my own time.

304
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,450
You get the gist of it.

305
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,250
How are you.

306
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,840
How are you guys getting on with your explosive walls and bits breaking into various pieces.

307
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,590
We'll be having fun with this I'm having lots of fun.

308
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,210
Please do.

309
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,920
Share your work over on the forum I love seeing what you guys come up with.

310
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,660
And I will see you in the next lecture.
