Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,890
In this quick tip I'd like to show you how to add in key frames automatically.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,190
That sounds like a great thing to do.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,530
Unfortunately I've been caught out by it so it comes with a warning.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,070
It's very straightforward to do.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,520
Let's go and head back into our main interface.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,060
Let's pause the video and in this selection of control these playback controls here there's this circle

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,230
automatic key frame insertion for objects and bones.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,390
So it's not going to add in as it used to previously add an extra bits and bobs.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,050
This is specifically for bones and objects what does it do.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,910
Well if we have a look at the moment we're on frame 122.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,250
So let's pull this back and hold down the middle mouse button.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,680
There's no key frame currently at 122.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,040
If I press record nothing happens at the moment.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,180
So let's say we did want to do something so let's turn on our overlays grab the control bone here and

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,020
really hide the other one so far.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,270
I'm not risking move selecting them or moving them and I rotate this around the z axis to there.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:23,110
Suddenly some key frames get put in and if we have a look at the sidebar properties under the item we

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,020
can see that all of this has been keyed in including scale which is odd because we didn't scale anything

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:38,250
but it's automatically keyed in location rotation scale and similarly at the top here we'll go and grab

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,960
this and move it around.

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,080
We see that it automatically keeps it in.

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,960
Now this can be a real nightmare if you didn't realize that you were doing it and perhaps you were playing

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:58,320
it back and you thought oh maybe I'll you know move it around whilst it's playing back which at first

25
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,620
glance looks like a great idea.

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,150
But then when we look at it being played back afterwards you see that you've ended up with a very fidgety

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,830
lamp let's put it that way.

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,830
And that's not what we want.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,460
And I've been caught out so many.

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,840
He looks like he's trying to pull himself along there.

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,090
I've been caught out so many times when it comes to having this on I prefer being explicit telling blender

32
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,710
Yes I want this to have a key frame in it.

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,070
Some people will get on fine with this I'm forgetful I'm going to forget to turn that off and it's going

34
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,330
to cause me this sort of mess.

35
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,160
Now if you did accidentally create these sorts of mess and didn't realize you might be square out of

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,650
luck that might be impossible to fix especially if you'd saved your file and opened it up enough day

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,410
and with your undo you can see.

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,970
Yes you can get it there and undo it back again.

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,830
In fact I'm going to keep undoing for the moment so that we get rid of everything that we had there

40
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,990
previously and yes there we go we started off putting key frames on 122 is not there anymore.

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,180
I'm going to save my work.

42
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,320
Make sure I've got everything as I want it and that's it for this lecture.

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,760
This is an incredibly useful tool but I'm going to turn off and save it.

44
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,620
That's what I meant to do there.

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,200
But use it with caution.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,600
That's the main thing to take away from this lecture.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,790
Of course you might also have one of those happy accidents where actually using the auto key frame ended

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,810
up in a brilliant result.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,490
If you do share it with us over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
