Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we are going to put together our first piece of the
1

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060
puzzle our chess board.
2

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.200
So by the end of this lecture we will be in a position where we've got a lovely chess board like this.
3

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.090
Let's find out more.
4

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.020
Hello everybody and welcome.
5

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.180
So in this lecture first of all we're going to talk about the difference between a mesh object and mesh
6

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.170
data itself.
7

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.210
We've explored a little about it.
8

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.560
Let's get a bit more formal.
9

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.400
So at the moment we have an object in front of us our sacred
10

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.010
default cube if we have a look in the outliner we can see it's named cube.
11

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.270
If we have a look at the object's properties we can see that it's called cube.
12

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.270
And if we go down to this upside down triangle we can see it's called cube and in the outliner itself
13

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.130
if we go ahead and click the little dropdown next to cube we see that it's got an upside down triangle
14

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.640
with cube next to it and that has materials assigned to it a default material.
15

16
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.000
Okay.
16

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.730
So we can see there that the material is linked to mesh data which is linked to a mesh object.
17

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.860
What does that mean.
18

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.260
What whilst we're in the default cube if I was to press tab to go and edit that default cube we're now
19

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.850
editing the mesh data.
20

21
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.550
If I was to go and add in a ooh key another cube and move it over here or if i was to go in and 
21

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.950
add an ico  sphere and move it over here.
22

23
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.040
This is additional mesh data within our mesh object.
23

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.750
If we tab back out into object mode we can perform objects level operations on it which is really useful.
24

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.710
That's where our modifiers will come in.
25

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.470
They affect the objects not the data within have scales and transforms they affect the objects.
26

27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.820
And once again not the data within well those are things to watch out for there's a distinct separation
27

28
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.680
between the two.
28

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.040
And there will be times where for instance we can go into a mesh object by pressing tab and then highlighting
29

30
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280
everything and deleting it.
30

31
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.860
So now we have a mesh object that has mesh data in it.
31

32
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.000
There isn't actually any data within that mesh data and it also has a material assigned to it as well.
32

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.820
So what can we do when we're in this position.
33

34
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.550
Well we could add a new bit of mesh data and we could go shift in A and add in a grid and a grid is
34

35
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.550
going gonna be quite useful for what we're about to do with a chessboard.
35

36
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.400
So that zoom in slightly into here.
36

37
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.820
Now we can see before we do anything else by the way and click away.
37

38
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.710
You may lose your operator panel if you've done that.
38

39
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.410
If you have just delete it and re add a grid we'll see that this is a 10 by 10 grid.
39

40
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.020
But when we count it would be nine by nine squares.
40

41
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.900
So we're talking about the vertices along the edge.
41

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.190
So to make a chessboard we could highlight this and change it to nine by nine and that will give us
42

43
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.660
eight by eight
43

44
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.160
grid perfect.
44

45
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.650
Now comes the arduous process of selecting individual faces and setting the material appropriately to
45

46
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.870
something else.
46

47
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.710
But there are a couple of ways of doing this.
47

48
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.150
I want to firstly show you one way which would be checker 
48

49
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.790
deselect this is incredibly useful when it comes to selecting alternating faces.
49

50
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.030
So how do we use that.
50

51
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.440
So we can get to it two ways.
51

52
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.330
You can either press F3 and search for it or it's under the select menu itself under checker
52

53
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.530
deselect.
53

54
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.400
Now you may notice it selected ooh checker deselect and selected alternating vertices because we
54

55
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.240
had it on vertex select we switch it to face mode select all the faces and do exactly the same again.
55

56
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.470
It will select the individual faces.
56

57
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.240
Now that might not be an option based upon your geometry that you're working on.
57

58
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.840
So we may have to approach it in a different way.
58

59
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.190
So how would we do that.
59

60
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.340
Well for instance we need to look at what's the repeating pattern is now depending on the underlying
60

61
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.050
geometry this selection method might not actually be that useful.
61

62
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.750
Checker deselect might not get you to this end point.
62

63
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.790
So how can we minimize the amount of changes we would need to do if we wanted to change let say the
63

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.580
material assignment on our model.
64

65
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.170
Well how many repeating patterns do we have here.
65

66
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.990
And how can we narrow it down.
66

67
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.740
Well the the smallest repeating pattern that we can have is this small group of four squares.
67

68
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.620
So let's go back and think about that logically.
68

69
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.590
I'm going to highlight everything and delete it once more and add in a another grid.
69

70
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.630
And this time think about the size of my grid as well as I'm going to have the accurate  as per
70

71
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.200
my specifications.
71

72
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.440
I would want to have this eight by six centimeters.
72

73
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.480
It's eight lots of six centimetre grids.
73

74
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.020
So that's one way of getting the board the right scale.
74

75
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.820
And then you could use the checker deselect.
75

76
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.920
But really here we want a three by three.
76

77
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.530
So it's just our standard for squares.
77

78
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.250
And then the size of it will be just two squares across.
78

79
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.210
In this case that's going to be twelve centimeters.
79

80
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.190
And there we go.
80

81
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.360
Those are all squares.
81

82
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.610
Ready to work with.
82

83
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.930
And at this point we can come in and select some individual faces and then go ahead to the materials
83

84
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.840
properties and ooh.
84

85
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.910
So there's a base material already on there.
85

86
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.610
I'm going to call that white squares for the moment and we're going to add a new material slot.
86

87
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.250
We're going to call the new material black squares.
87

88
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.990
We don't need to inherit any of the previous properties we haven't set any of these up before.
88

89
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.140
This is literally going to be the color of the squares and the keen eyed amongst you will have spotted
89

90
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.480
the spelling mistake that's totally deliberate.
90

91
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.110
Right.
91

92
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.360
We've got black and white squares that scroll down here and just set the base color nearly to black.
92

93
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.910
The reason why I say nearly to black is because black is a color that doesn't really exist unless you're
93

94
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.430
making a black hole.
94

95
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.750
Everything generally reflects light.
95

96
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.670
OK.
96

97
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.330
Well let's assign it and the first thing you'll be doing is why I can't see what's going on what's going
97

98
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.860
on.
98

99
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.510
Well remember we need to change the rendering view type some of the set it's to lookdev mode.
99

100
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.130
We can see our individually colored squares and I can go to my white squares and just test that's working
100

101
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.620
by setting them to something a bit more colorful.
101

102
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.950
And of course I can set it's a white and if you do want to set something to white really really easily
102

103
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.740
one of the ways of doing it is to make sure that all of the RGB values are set to one or under the
103

104
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.870
hue saturation and value.
104

105
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.340
We don't have any hue.
105

106
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.110
The hue doesn't matter when it comes to white but the saturation has to be zero.
106

107
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.770
And the value of one.
107

108
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.730
So we have a pure white square there.
108

109
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.880
So you've got this gray and white square this grid that we've created.
109

110
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.030
Now comes the matter of replicating and reproducing it lots and I'm sure you will agree with me if this
110

111
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.250
happened to be a repeating pattern that wasn't the grid that we've got it's far easier to change four
111

112
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.490
squares than it is 64 squares.
112

113
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.210
That would be a nightmare to have to do every time you change your mind.
113

114
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.480
So what do we do in this case how can we go ahead and repeat this.
114

115
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.180
And to answer that it's time for your challenge. Okay so your challenge is to create a white and the
115

116
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.990
black material.
116

117
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.640
If you haven't done already apply the materials to the board again.
117

118
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:27.670
If you haven't done that already and I'd like you to create the board using 2 array modifiers to create
118

119
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.990
the rest of it.
119

120
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.420
Now I'd like you in this case to apply the array modifiers and in the challenge solution will discuss
120

121
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.280
some of the pros and cons about applying modifiers.
121

122
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.910
In this case I'd like to think carefully about where you might want to apply a modifier vs. when it
122

123
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.750
would be best if it weren't applied.
123

124
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.890
And this will help you during the future.
124

125
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.690
Just thinking about it is the first step and we'll go through in this case why we're applying them now.
125

126
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.940
Don't worry about the board not being centered around the sce,e we're going to sort that's out in the
126

127
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.360
next lecture and I'd like you to also name your mesh object.
127

128
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.220
That is something I see no end.
128

129
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.760
People forget to name things and you end up with hundreds and hundreds of objects named cube or plane
129

130
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.010
or sphere and it just doesn't make sense when you get back to the project later on it becomes a real
130

131
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.380
mess to try and work with it and also consider naming the mesh data as well.
131

132
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.930
Pause video now and give that a go.
132

133
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.680
Hello everybody and welcome back.
133

134
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:36.560
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and finish off our chessboard OK everybody welcome back.
134

135
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.410
So let's go ahead.
135

136
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.270
The first thing I'm going to do here is name my mesh object.
136

137
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.710
I've gone to the object tab in the properties window.
137

138
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.380
I could also go ahead over here and rename it in the outliner.
138

139
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:53.280
Sometimes I find the outliner can be a bit for finickity when trying to type things in and double clicking
139

140
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.540
so I can call this chessboard.
140

141
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.210
I did think about calling it board but chess board is much more appropriate.
141

142
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.430
And if we open up that we see our cube so I can go ahead there and call that chess board as well.
142

143
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.730
And again if you need to you can change that down in the mesh data properties down here of the object
143

144
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.880
data properties and this is the objects.
144

145
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.350
If we hover over it and this is the object data of course that changes depending on what type of object
145

146
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.250
it is.
146

147
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.970
Let's go to our modifiers tab and add in an array modifier.
147

148
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.920
So we need to repeat this four times in the x direction.
148

149
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.720
Great.
149

150
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.220
Now I can apply that straight away or I can double it up.
150

151
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.020
So I'm going to double its up to begin with.
151

152
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:41.100
And then just discuss why we want to make sure that we apply the modifiers in this case rather than
152

153
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.320
keeping them there.
153

154
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.880
So it's going to be zero on the X axis for our relative offset and one on the Y axis.
154

155
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.270
There we go.
155

156
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.640
I'm going to save my work right.
156

157
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.480
So do we apply or do we not apply.
157

158
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.840
What are the pros and cons here.
158

159
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.140
What did
159

160
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.060
you guys decide when you were going through about applying a modifier.
160

161
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:04.650
Now I know it's early days but it's great to have a little bit of a mental exercise to think about why,
161

162
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.340
when and where you may want to apply vs. leaving your modifiers turned on.
162

163
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.550
So in this particular case I know the project inside out.
163

164
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.610
So I know we need to apply it.
164

165
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.380
But what if you didn't.
165

166
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.920
Okay so at this point we can say that we've made the grid now how many times are we going to go back
166

167
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.620
and edit that mesh.
167

168
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.480
I'm probably not going to edit it that much if at all.
168

169
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.730
We've got our basic grid, it's the right size.
169

170
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.450
I don't think we need to do anything else in this particular case.
170

171
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.320
Mm hmm.
171

172
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.580
Now what about the origin of our object at the moment the object that exists it's just thes four squares,
172

173
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.370
these four squares in the top not the rest of it.
173

174
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.780
So I'm going to have to take that into account and move the origin outside of the objects.
174

175
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.830
This may have an impact with physics or something else within blender at this particular point.
175

176
00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.320
It's a question of how much pain it's going to be if we applied this.
176

177
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:08.400
We don't need to worry about materials in this particular case because if we go to our materials properties
177

178
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.260
those materials will be there and assigned to these squares no matter what.
178

179
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:18.650
If we need to reassign all of these 64 squares to different materials that's a different question.
179

180
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.500
But for the moment we can stick with white squares and black squares.
180

181
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.420
So in this particular case we can go back to our modifiers themselves and apply them.
181

182
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.560
You can't apply them in edit mode you may have already discovered that.
182

183
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.300
So let's apply them.
183

184
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.030
Okay.
184

185
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.690
So there we go.
185

186
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.640
Everything's done and dusted.
186

187
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.960
I'm really looking forward to seeing how your boards are coming along so do share them over in the discussions
187

188
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.090
and any issues or tips and tricks that you've come across as you've been modelling and I'll see you
188

189
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.860
all in the next lecture.
