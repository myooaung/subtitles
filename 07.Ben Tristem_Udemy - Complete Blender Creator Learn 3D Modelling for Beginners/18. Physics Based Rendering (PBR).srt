1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to a physics based rendering or often shortened to just p.b. are.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,720
So this is all about chasing realism getting those materials as close to reality as possible.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,180
Now what we're talking about here is render time PBR rather than real time.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,180
PBR in the viewport So we'll be talking about what is necessary for creating anything realistic.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:32,090
When you go ahead and hit that F 12 key for a full time round or in fact if you've just got the viewport

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,520
on rendered mode as well.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,060
We're going to get something looking like it does in the real world and that is critical for a lot of

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,600
work now.

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,850
When you focus on something that's physically based.

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:54,890
We're talking about how objects really are in the real world cycles itself is almost there but it does

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,530
miss a few points.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,970
So you can't expect it to do perfect thing straight away.

13
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,170
You need to guide it along its way.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,130
It doesn't calculate for now automatically of certain materials unless you tell it to and roughness

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,360
can be tweaked a little to make it a bit more usable.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,880
And I have a look at those two things shortly correct but not always right.

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,550
Now this may sound a bit like an oxymoron but getting something physically accurate will mean it looks

18
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,410
correct.

19
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:36,140
It might mean however that it doesn't look right and that sounds like a very odd thing to say.

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,680
But if you've got something a vision that you want to create it might not be possible to create it in

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,320
the physical real world.

22
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,380
I mean that's the great thing about CGI.

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,510
And certainly if you or making a space ship they don't really exist at the moment or if you're making

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:00,690
an alien so making something look physically correct might not be the impact you want to create.

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,970
But it's a great starting point.

26
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:10,850
One sure at this stage whether it's modelling to get it looking physically accurate or materials it's

27
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:18,500
better to get to that stage first and then become more stylized rather than trying to jump to the stylized

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,000
whether it's over overexaggerated jawlines or an annamay style.

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,630
If you're talking about the modelling or whether you're talking about skin that glows or something along

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,200
those lines it's better to have a realistic first and then become more stylized because you're starting

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,060
from an accurate point.

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:47,000
So what is done and when it is very important when you render something it comes out perfect every time

33
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,060
the real world is not perfect.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,440
Our eyes camera lenses etc are not perfect.

35
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,980
A small they have little imperfections in them which make well make life a little bit more interesting

36
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:09,050
and that's why sometimes when you're really stretching for that extra bit of photorealism having some

37
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,680
imperfections in the scene add a lot to it.

38
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:23,470
Things like depth and field focus glare lens flare are all added after the scene has been rendered and

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,430
this stage is called post production.

40
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,780
Or sometimes post processing.

41
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,220
Okay so what is wrong with roughness.

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,000
Well there is a massive drop off in sharpness between a value of zero and zero point one and then it's

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,220
much slower in terms of how it's changing after that so as not linear it drops off very quickly and

44
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:56,690
being non-linear it makes it very difficult to use because a small adjustment low down is going to make

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,300
a big difference.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,260
We aren't going to use the maths node to try and correct this and will go home to learn a couple of

47
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,040
new node commands as well.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,360
Now before we go in do that we just want to see here.

49
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Default vs. adjusted so we have a ball a sphere that's in an environmental texture which is the photo

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,880
I have taken and we can see that with the roughness values the jump between 0 and 1 is quite extreme

51
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,390
but as we go along to just point five we can see that it changes very slowly.

52
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:44,330
Now using the maths node we can see a just how those values account collated with the slider and we

53
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,690
get a complete different effect.

54
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,350
And this is going to make it much easier to control and not.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,010
You don't have to just apply this to roughness of course.

56
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,640
We're just using this as an example of how we can manipulate how something is working with something

57
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,770
like a maths node.

58
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,710
So let's go explore the maths node now and hop on over into a blender.

59
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,760
Okay so now we're over in blender.

60
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,050
I'm not gonna do this with a keyboard could do with a Q but I know I'm going to do a sphere.

61
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,890
Spheres look better in cubes.

62
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,450
Don't obsess Cubists a space.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,160
So there we go.

64
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,460
Let's add a newbie sorry I'm going to make it smooth.

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,050
I'm also going to go to the subdivision's surface modifier and under the render settings just turn that

66
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,930
up to six.

67
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,410
Then it's going to be super smooth and want to look and have any horrible artefacts when it comes to

68
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,110
rendering.

69
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:42,320
I will add a material to its already and I'm going to set it to be a glossy shade up that's fine so

70
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,170
the only other thing were missing is if we hop over into rendered mode.

71
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,720
We don't really get much.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,580
We get a grey ball because it's reflate in the grey environment.

73
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,590
So let's go ahead into the world tab.

74
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,470
Use nodes and of colour options.

75
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm going to click the little dot to the right load in an environmental texture.

76
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,530
Now this isn't actually an environmental texture of I'm going to load in as such is just a picture of

77
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,610
I've taken.

78
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,610
If you've got other textures that you want to load em by all means do that.

79
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,840
Otherwise go to U.S. assets.

80
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,220
You should find two panoramas that you can pick from.

81
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:26,690
I'm going to pick this one here and I'm going to whiz over to the camera feed to see which view we've

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,610
got cayla.

83
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,100
So now they're really like that song going to go into first person moving mode.

84
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,930
Now you can see here this isn't a perfect wraparound text or anything like that is little she just panorama

85
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,730
taken.

86
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,720
So the world has ended there and started again.

87
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:51,070
So we want to be able to see some mountains and I quite like the look of that.

88
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,650
And then a heif 12 quickly just to see how that renders out.

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,070
Again this is important that you check your work often.

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,280
That looks absolutely fine to me now because it's lovely and smooth because of the six subdivisions.

91
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,990
We get a nice crisp border going round.

92
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,680
Okay so now we've got that.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,220
Let's change this little box this outline up top.

94
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,520
Well I'm going to remove the lamp for a start.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm going to delete that from our scene completely and go change this to the 3D view and change it to

96
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,260
rended mode and view it from the camera.

97
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,480
So we get an idea of what's going on life now that we've done that there's an awful lot of black in

98
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,670
the scene so the know how that's going to pan out.

99
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,330
Hopefully not too bad but now we've got this.

100
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,210
In the scene we can switch this big area over to the node editor and trust me to get rid of the outliner

101
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,770
when I don't think we've actually got this sphere selected someone to go back to 3D view select the

102
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,730
sphere.

103
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,710
Now we've got it selected when we go to the node of to the node setup will be there.

104
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,880
Okay so there's a couple of things that we're going to have to add to our node setup.

105
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,020
One is a maths node and that can be found on the menu and go down to.

106
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,800
Converter maths and we'll plot that.

107
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,740
And that's the value output is going to go into the roughnecks.

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,350
That's what controlling.

109
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,820
Of course we lose the ability to control the roughness here because it's now being controlled by this

110
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,510
node we can change the type here so we can do loads of different options.

111
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:36,110
And the final thing that we need to do is have a way of controlling these values here.

112
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:45,610
So I'm going to add in another node a very useful node is in inputs because it's giving input I suppose

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,570
nice and straightforward and it's just value is a slider.

114
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,540
And from things like this we can join the.

115
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,420
It's to both of these for instance and then control them both at the same time now at the moment.

116
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,100
We can see if I said that point one.

117
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,380
It goes all fuzzy so that's not quite right.

118
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,850
I think we need to play around with this maths though and find the right selection of what's grouser

119
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,490
we're adding here so this is going to add point one to point five.

120
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,770
And what we want to do is I'm going to link these back up against us almost as if this is not here.

121
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,340
Incidentally you can also do that by hits selecting it and hit me M key for mute.

122
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,230
Ill undo that all together and then we're literally bypassing it.

123
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,330
And this value is now controlling the roughness directly.

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,400
So we want really the value here.

125
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,750
By the time you've gone up to point five it's pretty obscure We can see.

126
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,760
So to get an actual reflection we're doing things like oh point.

127
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,220
1 and No points nauts to an open or three etc..

128
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,180
Quite low value is where would be quite nice to be able to have them higher up.

129
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,090
So whatever we do with the maths node has got to lower this value.

130
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,250
And with that comes a challenge.

131
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,300
I would like you to go ahead and smooth the roughness.

132
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,910
Play with the maths node and its options.

133
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,180
Can you figure out a way of smoothing the sudden change where one moment the image is reflective and

134
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,770
then all of a sudden blurred out.

135
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,830
There is no right answer here because there are going to be a couple of solutions that work for what

136
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:35,930
we want to do play with it think carefully if you if you combine numbers how do you get a lower number.

137
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,190
Think about it.

138
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,400
And please do remember to save your results.

139
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,480
We aren't going to use it again shortly possibly an hour and give that a go.

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,120
Okay guys.

141
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,350
Welcome back.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,100
Let's go smooth out the rough ness and play with that maths note.

143
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,580
Okay so back over him blend.

144
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,400
I'm going to unmuted the maths node.

145
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,340
Okay.

146
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,270
So if we how do we get lower values we can subtract.

147
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,390
McKay what happens if we do that so.

148
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,850
Is there a subtracts.

149
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,850
Yes there is a subtract and.

150
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,940
Subtract the value of that's going to clampett low so it's going to be zero essentially cause you can't

151
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,340
get less than zero with the roughness.

152
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,740
So it doesn't matter what this number is when it goes to point five.

153
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:35,160
It'll then be zero and then so that's just offsetting the problem that's not going to solve that's all

154
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,560
multiplying.

155
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,670
Mm okay.

156
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,710
So if we multiply it by itself.

157
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,260
So point 1 if you Times point by point 1 you get point nought one.

158
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,190
Now that's lower the value.

159
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,620
Okay let's see what happens then.

160
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,590
So we go to a point.

161
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,600
One are but looking a bit better.

162
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,940
I presume as we step up.

163
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,870
Yes that's looking much better.

164
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,540
So there we go.

165
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,420
There is one option.

166
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,820
We can multiply.

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,780
But that does give us not quite the flexibility I would like.

168
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,660
That does give us the a right answer in this case but there's something else we can do here as well.

169
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,240
So let's have a look at some other options.

170
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,840
Power.

171
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:32,180
So what we've done here by timing it by itself so point one times point 1 we've squared it so that's

172
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,140
the power of tippoo.

173
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,870
So if we go ahead and change this to power and we don't want it to the power of its self because it'll

174
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,780
get tiny butts.

175
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:51,920
If we set the value here to two we've got point one to the power of two and then it comes out here.

176
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,620
Oh case let's just test that again sir.

177
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,640
Point One Point Two.

178
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Point Three.

179
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,800
Excellent.

180
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,240
That is working of course one.

181
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,630
So the power of two is still one.

182
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,940
In fact one to the power of anything is still one see you do get the hundred percent roughness as well.

183
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,330
If we go all the way up.

184
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,620
Of course one times one if you've got the power there.

185
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,680
So this gives us the other option of increasing this so we could do to the power of five.

186
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,100
Now I'm not quite sure what that's going to do.

187
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,670
Let's have a quick look at what a hold down Shift here so I can Mike remove this as we go across and

188
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,360
we can see that it really starts getting blurry much later on.

189
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:42,040
And this gives us much more fine control over those reflections or rather the roughness of that surface.

190
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,590
I think five is a little too high because that's going to start making it difficult the other way where

191
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,730
you can't really get it's where it's bunched up.

192
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,850
The other end if we do that.

193
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,320
So right after experimenting ifes I'm kind of settled if we go to point to here and we can compare it

194
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,430
bourges muting this.

195
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,160
No.

196
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,470
This power node here we can have a look in the top there.

197
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,970
And when we mutate we consumed it was like all it now is like.

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,490
So 2.5.

199
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,940
And we can go backwards and forwards.

200
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,620
I think a value somewhere between two and three works out really well.

201
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,720
Remember to show your work in the discussions.

202
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,040
Did you come up with a similar node setup to this.

203
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,680
If so brilliant if you came up with something different I'd love to hear your thinking how you worked

204
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,910
out how to teach maths know to use.

205
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,170
Did you approach it from a completely different way.

206
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,950
I've tried to talk through roughly my thinking there.

207
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,330
Obviously I've been playing with it for a while so I've got some preconceived ideas of what was going

208
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:49,480
on.

209
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,800
But if you're completely new to this.

210
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,330
I'd love to hear your thought process on how you came about completing this challenge.

211
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,470
And as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
