Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,250
In this lecture we're going to focus on the camera position in our scene.
2

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,120
Now you may already have the camera pointing directly at the objects and all you need to do is render
3

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,640
out.
4

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,080
But as we can see here there are a couple of issues.
5

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,660
It's firstly badly lit and secondly it's not even in frame we can't really work out what it is.
6

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,030
So there's a couple of things that we need to do first with the camera to make sure that we can render
7

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,800
something out successfully.
8

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Let's go have a look now and hop on over to the camera settings in Blender.
9

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,790
Hello everybody and welcome back.
10

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,230
Right.
11

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,340
Let's get rid of our cube and press the X key and delete it.
12

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,580
I'm going to add in Suzanne, Suzanne the monkey because we need to make sure that we've got a direction
13

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,040
to our objects just to demonstrate that we are in fact moving around it.
14

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,270
Okay so now that we've done that let's have a look through our camera.
15

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,060
How do we do that.
16

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,220
Well we can go to the View menu cameras active camera or numberpad zero.
17

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,810
Now at this particular point you may say Yeah that's absolutely fine.
18

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,180
But look how little Suzanne is taking up of our frame.
19

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,310
You can see here that when we're in camera mode you can zoom in and out.
20

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,610
But the framing does not change at all.
21

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,470
So how do we change that.
22

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,300
Well there are a couple of ways of doing it.
23

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,710
If we go to our outline and left click on camera we will select the camera.
24

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,860
You can see the camera now has an orange border.
25

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,550
This means we can go ahead and either transform its location or indeed we can open up the properties panel
26

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:42,670
of the 3D view and change its location X will move it along the X axis Y along the Y.
27

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,330
Of course Z on the Z axis.
28

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,520
Now when it comes to X Y and Z with rotation it can be a bit more confusing because you think well that's
29

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,190
not rotating the way I thought it was going to.
30

31
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,820
And that's because it's just pointing a different way.
31

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,030
If we scroll down this what we can also do is lock the camera to view which means that as we move the
32

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,970
view around the camera moves along with it.
33

34
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,130
I do not like this personally and I don't use it a lot of people love it but I don't because I always
34

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,080
forget to untick it and I go and rotate around my view expecting to come out of camera mode and I
35

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,960
end up moving the camera and sometimes it can be a real pain because you've set up the camera deliberately
36

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,620
in this in a very very special position let's say we're here and we move it's along the Y axis it gets
37

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,800
closer.
38

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh let's make sure pick the right one.
39

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,590
Once he gets his hand there we move it round we go yeah that's perfect and then I go and think oh I
40

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,990
need to do something else in the scene boom and I've ruined it and you can't just do undo all the time
41

42
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,390
and get back to where you were before we can see it's taken us back to some point but not exactly where
42

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,140
we were.
43

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,460
However my favourite way of navigating around in blender in general and especially with the camera is
44

45
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,090
going to first person mode.
45

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,110
Now you can do that with shift and the character next to the one on your keyboard if you don't have
46

47
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,930
access to that and they won't come up on my screen capture my keys you can go to the view menu and go
47

48
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,390
to navigation and I'm gonna have to scroll down a little there's walk navigation there if you want to
48

49
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,990
set it's your own shortcut key you can right click and assign a shortcut I'm not going to do that at
49

50
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,420
the moment or you can add it to your quick favourites which is probably a better idea I am going to add
50

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,120
it to my quick favourites and we'll get to those quick favourites later on so I'm gonna go shift in the 
51

52
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,090
number next to the also the key next to the one key and now I can move around as if I was in a first
52

53
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:54,800
person shooter so I can press W to go forward S to go backwards A and D to strafe Q and E to go up and
53

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,960
down, Thats really quick at the moment I'm gonna use the scroll wheel to calm it down a little there you
54

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:08,180
go this is a very easy way to manipulate are seen to get it looking exactly how we want it to.
55

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,980
There are a series of other options whilst in first person mode and you'll notice at the very bottom
56

57
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,970
of the screen there are some shortcut keys that show so you can press the space bar to zoom into a certain
57

58
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,420
area of your model very useful you can turn gravity on and off as well which is always an interesting
58

59
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,610
one I'm going to do at the moment because all I will do is fall because there's no ground underneath
59

60
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,610
but it does give you the ability to walk around buildings if you do that which is quite cool I'm happy
60

61
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:45,110
with that view of Suzanne and now if I go ahead and press F 12 to render we notice that we've got her
61

62
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,890
looking pretty swell and not cut off now before we move onto a challenge you can also go into the camera
62

63
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,890
view by just clicking this camera icon at the top right to the 3D window I sometimes forget that's there
63

64
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,660
because it's brand new but that's another way of getting in if all of these controls have said this
64

65
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,820
before are brilliant if you're on a laptop because you don't always have the control that you do when
65

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:14,060
you're at a full desktop with a full blown mouse with a scroll wheel and a full size keyboard.
66

67
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,480
Okay now it's time for your challenge.
67

68
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Okay so your challenge I'd like you to go ahead and position the camera so that it frames your model
68

69
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,460
or scene.
69

70
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,320
Well now don't worry about getting absolutely perfect at this stage just make sure you can see what
70

71
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,510
you want to see of your model.
71

72
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,860
Secondly feel free to alter your model or your scene.
72

73
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,330
If they aren't quite right yet I know that I'm gonna go ahead and alter my scene and make the ground
73

74
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,840
plane a bit larger.
74

75
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,330
But if you do spot something with your new framing of course go ahead and alter it.
75

76
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,770
And finally remember you can move it again later so we're not setting a final position here.
76

77
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,910
We're just setting it up ready for our first render.
77

78
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,450
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go.
78

79
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
Okay everybody Welcome back.
79

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Let's go and hop on over into blender and sets up our camera okay.
80

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,670
Everybody welcome back.
81

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,360
Right.
82

83
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,460
The first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and open up my file.
83

84
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,320
I want to work with.
84

85
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,780
Okay.
85

86
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,850
So now that that's there I'm going to press the zero key to see what we can see go into first person
86

87
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,690
mode.
87

88
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:25,730
And I'm going to come around this side probably a little lower down could make it look a bit wider and
88

89
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,710
the position over here that's looking pretty good so far.
89

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm liking that now.
90

91
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,680
The ground itself.
91

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,470
I wanted to go out of frame so I'm literally just going to scale it up.
92

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,860
Instead it forms horizon in the distance.
93

94
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,140
That's house that you find in this case.
94

95
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,590
Now I can think about carefully where it positioned the camera in relation to the horizon because that
95

96
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,060
does change things slightly because obviously if the horizon is there that gives a completely different
96

97
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,530
look to it than if it's up here.
97

98
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,070
In fact this is a great way of testing a view for a game if you think about it if you've got the viewport
98

99
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,170
set up well is it a top down game like this.
99

100
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,600
Is this the scale of your model.
100

101
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,980
If it is the probably wasted your time with all the detail that you can't see.
101

102
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,420
However in this case I'm going to fly back round Oops.
102

103
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,880
Make sure you're in the camera mode when you start flying.
103

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Otherwise you'd just literally flying around the screen.
104

105
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,240
Okay.
105

106
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,260
I was trying to use a shortcut there from an old version of blender but there we go on the sets top
106

107
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,320
like that.
107

108
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,300
I think that's a relatively good framing of my model.
108

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,810
It sets up on one side we can see the detail underneath the detail on top.
109

110
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,980
I quite like that.
110

111
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,750
I hope you've managed to frame your subject really well and in the next lecture we'll learn how to light
111

112
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,880
our subjects.
112

113
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,420
Just a basic three point light setup and I'll see you in the next one.
