00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,860
Hello everybody and welcome back to this quick tip with reflection so this won't take long and it will

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,860
really help solidify what screen space reflections really means.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,840
And of course expose its limitations and why if you're using a scene that had reflections in it you'd

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
want to use cycles.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,950
So let's turn on the rendering to begin with this is where we said stuff before.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,680
That's actually fine.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,050
I'm going to go to look Dave mode for the moment just oh no let's go back to solid shading.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,570
OK so the first thing I want to do here is grab of my block.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,790
I've still got overlays turned off to show things off.

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,220
Okay.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,580
So let's leave that back on our block itself.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,180
Let's go ahead and give it some material that we know will be highly reflective.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,980
So we're gonna click on new material we're going to call this reflection.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,690
And what are we going to do.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,710
Well we're going to make the base color quite dark.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,150
We know the dark something is the easier it's going to be to see a reflection.

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,480
We've we've done it in the past and the roughness.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,550
Well I'm going to set that at zero.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,060
This is going to be a highly reflective surface.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,210
If we go into render mode we will probably start to see the lamp.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,600
Almost.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,210
Let's give the floor this as well just to really make things super shiny.

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,760
Look at that full reflections everywhere.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Let's grab our block that we've made reflective and just scale it up for the moment.

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,820
So it acts like a mirror and there we go.

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,150
So what is the difference.

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,590
Well let's hop on over into eevee and see what it looks like there.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,980
Let's go to Evy.

29
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,950
Well you need to first of all of course turn on screen space reflections.

30
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,100
Let's do that.

31
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,490
Let's look a bit faint.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
But oh there we go.

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,220
They're starting to reflect and it disappears again.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,420
OK.

35
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,430
So it looks like all we need to do to get it to work properly is medal around with the screen space

36
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,390
reflections settings.

37
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,740
Well let's turn off half rares trace that will improve the quality of it.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,410
Okay.

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,500
Let's turn on refraction so if there's any refraction in last scene it's also applied.

40
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,040
OK.

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,290
What happens if we turn up the thickness.

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,690
I'm going to help us at all in this case.

43
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,970
So we don't want to do that edge fading.

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,650
Let's make sure there's no fading at all.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,020
Well that makes it look worse.

46
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,810
Let's include the edge fading clamping.

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,690
Does that help.

48
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,890
No it's nothing.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,780
He's really bringing this back in at so we can turn up the trace decision.

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,770
It doesn't really matter.

51
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,180
We've still got a reflection there though.

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,230
So what is going on.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,070
Well let's make this full screen and watch what happens as I have the reflection on my screen and slightly

54
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,450
pan my scenes.

55
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,050
The left

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,490
Oh where's my lamp gone.

57
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,200
Did you see that.

58
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,160
Disappeared.

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,460
Let's just put part of the lamp on the screen are you getting it.

60
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,520
Yes.

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,150
Screen space reflections require the items that are being reflected to be on the screen.

62
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,380
It's an optimization.

63
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,820
It's it's a gotcha.

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,400
In this case with our scene here if we wanted it to look like that the moment our object just disappears

65
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,740
out of our view whether that's from a camera or our viewport it is no longer reflected.

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
And that's why things appear to fade in and out from certain angles.

67
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,710
So how do we sort this out with eevee because Watch this.

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,360
If we turn this over to cycles it's being reflected so much better it's still being reflected still

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,470
being reflected.

70
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,050
It doesn't matter where we are in our scene providing the lights reaches the viewer i.e. us.

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,700
It's being reflected and you can see here it's reflecting the reflection that was on the floor.

72
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,250
That's how good cycles is.

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,710
Evey I almost feel like going Hello eevee.

74
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,770
Hello.

75
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,190
But there is so how do we get this to work in TV.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
Well it is possible by adding what's called a reflection probe.

77
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,560
So let's go ahead and add one of those to see what it looks like.

78
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,340
I'm going to add a cursor to our wall.

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm going to go to a light probe and add a reflection plain.

80
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,220
Here we go.

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,400
Let's rotate that round on the x axis fortunately these all align and look at that.

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,260
Let's make here it's minus 90 and just looking at the top right there is the angle it's required.

83
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,540
Lift that up only on the z axis and it's going to have to be pulled slightly forward.

84
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,770
I'm going to scale that up as well just such big and then g y and only a little.

85
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,400
And there we go.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,460
We've now got a reflection that works off the screen of course.

87
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,340
Now we've got an extra bit of calculation to be done.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,790
So you will end up finding that if you wanted this to look very much like cycles does you start to increase

89
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,450
the render times quite a bit by adding all of these extra things every time you add something.

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,700
It adds a cost a time costs for rendering.

91
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,140
Now I've not actually tried this.

92
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,420
If we duplicate this again so we've got another reflection plane and rotate it around again the access

93
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,970
x axis by 90 and place this on the floor.

94
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,400
Okay so we're still as we can see here we still have a limitation is not reflecting the reflection.

95
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,550
So in this particular example we can't even get near to the cycles reflection of a reflection.

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,650
And if we put a reflective cube behind I really want to try this one.

97
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,220
So we'll grab this cube and stick it behind our lamp.

98
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,590
So duplicate it.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,270
Gee why pull it back now if we put ourselves in between.

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,510
And I'm going to go shift and the grave key to move forward.

101
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,730
There we go we've got a reflection of the back of the lamp and if we let this reflect backwards and

102
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,180
forwards for long enough we would eventually end up with a course just an infinite mirror scenario.

103
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,620
But here we've got a reflection of the reflection in the ground and a reflection of the reflection behind

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,830
me.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,430
So this really does bring it all together and really does demonstrate that the fundamental differences

106
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,980
between the cycles and evey rendering engine you could just imagine a wet puddle on the ground in a

107
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,220
city that you're creating and you want it to reflect off of the reflect that not only the buildings

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,150
but also the reflection that's in the windows of the buildings.

109
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,550
And this is where the cycles rendering engine just takes off and escapes Evey.

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,660
Now of course that doesn't come free of charge cycles takes longer to render and that's one of the fundamental

111
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,240
reasons it does everything by default.

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,670
And you have to turn things off with cycles whereas with evil you have to remember to turn them on as

113
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,190
there we saw right at the very beginning that if you don't have screen space reflections turned on something

114
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,150
that should look really shiny fails to do so.

115
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,230
So I'm going to go ahead now and just need to add up my scene after I've been playing with it like that.

116
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm going to get rid of my reflection planes.

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,490
I'm not going to use those.

118
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,760
So I'm going to get rid of this extra block and scale this one back down I might have to recreate it

119
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,760
later on anyway.

120
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,760
Doesn't matter.

121
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,360
Let's save that and also make the shall I keep the ground like that.

122
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm going to keep the ground like that for the moment I think it's pretty cool but I'm not going to

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,770
make the ground and the block quite as shiny so I'm going to go to my material settings and perhaps

124
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,250
set it's a bit rough for maybe point one five.

125
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,740
There we go.

126
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a bit better.

127
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,400
Okay.

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,090
That's it for this lecture I hope you've learnt quite a bit about why we're focusing on cycles so much

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,740
in this section as you can see it really is fundamentally different to Evey and I'll see you all in

130
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,490
the next lecture.
