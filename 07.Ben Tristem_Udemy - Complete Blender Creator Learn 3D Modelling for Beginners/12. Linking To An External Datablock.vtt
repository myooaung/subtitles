00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.280
Welcome to.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.180
Linking to an external data block.

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.050
In this video you'll learn more about linking to another blend file We'll be linking to an object data

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.120
block understand that there is a data block hierarchy and how that impacts your linking and how to keep

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.170
an eye out for when you might lose data.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.670
That's quite important because it can end up being very frustrating not going to lose it is in it it

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.580
disappears off your hard drive but you could lose it in your new blend file the one you're linking to.

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.560
So let's have a look at this data block hierarchy and in front of us we have the outline that you would

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.830
see if he just opened up a typical default blend file the one with the basic cube in it and a camera

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.780
and a lamp in the scene.

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.720
Now you can see this is a great example of a hierarchy with the scene having render layers world the

12
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.230
camera object the cube mesh object and the lamp object.

13
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.180
Now beneath each one of those three we also have more details each of which is a data block.

14
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.000
So the camera will contain the camera properties beneath it and the lamp would contain the lamp properties

15
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.830
beneath it and looking at the cube.

16
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.220
There's a data block which holds the mesh information which is the greyed out Triangle.

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.370
We've got the material information that's another data block and then beneath that there's a texture

18
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.490
information that's applied to that material.

19
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.480
And the important thing here is if we import let's say the mesh cube the mesh objects the cube object

20
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.040
we will automatically get the data the material and the texture straightaway.

21
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.020
Now if we just in ported the material we would get that.

22
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.400
And the texture applied to that material.

23
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.090
If we only import the texture then we'd only get that.

24
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.960
So if we decide to import something that's got a hierarchy beneath it that's beneath hierarchy will

25
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.540
also come through.

26
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.760
That's important so you don't ever flood your scene with something or miss something.

27
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
So let's go have a look now at where we might accidentally start losing information and to do that we're

28
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.370
going to have to hop on over into a blender.

29
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.010
Okay so back over in blender I've got my test room that we've been working on is looking pretty good

30
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.790
so far and I've got this whopping great big hierarchy here so let's go ahead and just experience what

31
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.880
happens when or potentially where we might lose information.

32
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.930
Now hopefully this won't happen to you but it is always possible.

33
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.190
So I'd like to go to file go down to link and I'm in where I'm in at the moment.

34
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.970
I'm in my mind pyramid's scene.

35
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.310
That's not going to be any gates.

36
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.750
And I go to my game asset pack and I'm going to go actually upper level and see the other projects that

37
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.550
I've worked on and go ahead and find something.

38
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.730
I'm going to go back one to the fluffy bunny because I know I played with materials in there.

39
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.700
I'm going to go to fluffy bunny.

40
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.700
Blend open that up.

41
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.140
I'm going to go into material and I've got all of these materials the time made and let's say that I

42
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.590
wanted to I really like the colour of the soil I don't know how but I'm going to pick the soil as the

43
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.520
material and link it.

44
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.510
It does mean that if I change that material over on the fluffy bunny it will automatically be applied

45
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.960
here as well so that's important to know that link exists.

46
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.280
But at the moment this material is not applied to anything so it's going to have zero next to it in

47
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.610
the data block.

48
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.500
So if I go ahead and select this doorway for instance and then go to the materials property.

49
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.540
Now there aren't any materials assigned to it at the moment.

50
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.920
If I click this drop down I can see that I've got an L and the L means that it's a linked up.

51
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.930
In this case a linked data block a linked material and it's got a zero next to it which means it's got

52
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.370
no users.

53
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.660
That does mean that if I go ahead and save this file right now an exit without applying that to anything

54
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.490
or giving it a fake user that will result in it disappearing from this scene.

55
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.500
So you can't just go and grab a load of materials from another blend file without giving them a fake

56
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.740
user or assigning them to an object.

57
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.520
Otherwise the next time you open up your scene they would have vanished.

58
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.370
And that goes for several other things as well.

59
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.630
The mesh data.

60
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.630
So if we hop over here to them the data data block Evis here if we were to import law let's do it let's

61
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.380
go and go firewood link and let's go up a level and where is our mesh so we got mesh here.

62
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.910
Got all of these data blocks here and then go for leaves and link from a library.

63
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.460
And again if I use this drop down here we see that it's linked it's got no users and it's called leaves.

64
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.780
So we've got an inherent problem here that if we don't apply it straight away to something there's a

65
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.600
good chance we will accidentally lose it if we left this blend file.

66
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.500
Of course we can give it a fake user or assign it to something.

67
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:29.520
Now that doesn't happen if you go and do a an object because that actually brings it into the scene

68
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.950
fully.

69
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.430
So if we go and give that a go now and go a link and this time I am going to go back to my game assets

70
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.510
pack go to meshes and under here I'm going to pick the door again so I'm going to go to door going to

71
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.880
go to the object.

72
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.190
And here we go s.a.m..

73
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.400
Wall door and then the size of its link from library and it looks like it's there now I'm not going

74
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.500
to be able to move it.

75
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.430
And we'll go in more detail about that at the moment.

76
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.490
But it's now in my scene.

77
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.180
I'm just going to move it to a different loughmiller press m here and just move it to.

78
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.990
I like calling that sublayer one I don't know which letter actually applies to Tumblr are they on the

79
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.040
lay beneath.

80
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.430
Just so I can move attack the way quickly.

81
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.790
OK it's another thing I've done that if we go and have a look in the object area we will see oh we've

82
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.610
got a lot in here at the moment.

83
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.410
We're going to have the linked s.a.m. wall door and it's called the L next to it to make sure we know

84
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.690
that it is linked.

85
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.800
There's no zero there.

86
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.820
It's in the scene.

87
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.220
If we go to the data properties here and we drop down here we can see says L. verte Okay it's not named

88
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.830
properly in this case I'll need to go back to the original file and sort that out amongst a few other

89
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.280
things I've got planned to do here.

90
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.580
But it's there and it has an assigned user because the object is a real object it exists in our scene.

91
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.210
The mesh data the materials and the textures etc are just properties that can be applied to an object.

92
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.950
So if they don't have a user they can disappear if they haven't been used or given a fake user.

93
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.100
Okay guys.

94
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.020
Now I've got a small challenge for you.

95
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.140
I would like you to link your building blocks.

96
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.020
Now do check your pieces for any issues.

97
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.120
He's probably going to be naming one.

98
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:26.560
If anything fix and make any new pieces as necessary link the major pieces into your scene and store

99
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.430
them on a separate layer.

100
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.420
Remember to name the layer appropriately.

101
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.590
Now don't worry about moving them for the moment when you bring them in as a linked object.

102
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.260
They will be highlighted blue and you won't be able to do anything with them in terms of transforming

103
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.680
them so you won't be able to move them scale them or rotate them so pause a video now and give that

104
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.490
a go.

105
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.150
Okay guys.

106
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.310
Welcome back.

107
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.610
Let's go link building blocks over in blender.

108
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.930
Right before we hop into a blender I just want to show you what I've done in the background so you guys

109
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.280
are not shell shocked when it changes from a simple room to more of a church style.

110
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:16.040
I've gone in repeated these sorts of basic building blocks of tut my basic building blocks away in a

111
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.210
basic room fold up and underneath the meshes.

112
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.480
And I've gone for some church style assets.

113
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.260
So let's have a more detailed look.

114
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:32.420
I've got a floor of three different sizes and I've done that for the simple reason that even though

115
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.660
I can scale my objects when a texture is applied to that it will scale the texture as well so I want

116
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.870
as much flexibility as possible especially with the floor because I want large pieces and I might want

117
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.660
small pieces to flesh out little alcoves or corner pieces.

118
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.180
I've also made a church corner which is very useful.

119
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.950
It's one blend the unit by one blender unit by four blender units high all of these.

120
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.720
Now for high because it's a church.

121
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.300
It's a lot bigger in structure.

122
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.280
I've got a front door that I've made the vaults.

123
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.680
Now that was one of the most challenging ones to make.

124
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.710
But it's perfectly possible using all the skills we've got already have a quick look of that in a moment

125
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.420
and a plain old wall which has four by four where nought point two.

126
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.750
That's the other change I've made.

127
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.190
I made the thickness point two.

128
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.650
So when I'm moving in tenths of a blender unit I can actually match it up.

129
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.660
And the church window so there's an archway window in there as well so let's just have a quick look

130
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:37.310
at the vault and explain how this was put together because it was more of a challenge than the simple

131
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.090
building blocks that we've got.

132
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.590
Now I realize that I'm in my designer there about eight blender units apart where the pillars are going

133
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.830
to go that come up to this Voltz.

134
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.650
I had to look up what the vault was called it's the ceiling bits that looks like this in a church.

135
00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:02.990
Okay so I produced an archway just a series of edges join together to make an arch and I mirrored that

136
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.490
around one of the axes.

137
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.060
I then duplicated that around the other way but keeping the mirror modifier actually applied.

138
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:18.830
Now when I preformed a Boolean operation to produce a union between the two I ended up with a hole just

139
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.220
where I wanted it.

140
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.080
So I then use that mirrored it again rotated again.

141
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:30.800
And there we go I ended up with this object which then I use the solidify modify which I think is still

142
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.330
applied.

143
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.950
Yes it is still active.

144
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.960
It's not a ply jets.

145
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.580
Just in case I need to change the thickness so I've made it then solid so it's just very thin before

146
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.400
and would cause some artefacts when rendering.

147
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.630
So that's looking pretty good now.

148
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.380
And so I now need to append all of these into the scene and turn on smooth shading.

149
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.840
To make that look a bit prettier.

150
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.870
Excellent.

151
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.040
So let's go.

152
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.940
I don't need to do anything there.

153
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.090
I'm going to create a new blender file and just spend them all in because all of my old assets.

154
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:09.370
Well it's just going to be a absolute pain to try and use them again in any way whatsoever.

155
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:17.120
So let's go ahead monomer used the shortcut keys control altes and oh now I need to go to my assets

156
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.860
folder.

157
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.940
Meshes and literally go through and add all of these to the scene.

158
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.660
Okay so the final piece is now coming in the church window as select the objects and bring that into

159
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.470
our scene so that everything there and I'm going to move it to a working layer.

160
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.250
So let's select all of those.

161
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.090
I don't want to select the camera or the other bits.

162
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.290
The lamp itself.

163
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:53.170
Someone to select them in the outliner instead because that's a bit easier in this case since they're

164
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.110
on top of that.

165
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.960
I've got all of those selected.

166
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.860
I'm going to move them to this layer here.

167
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:06.610
I'm going to go into my layers into my layer management and just make sure that that is named.

168
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.490
In fact I'm just going to put them on layer 2.

169
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.520
That would make far more sense here.

170
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.480
So moved to layer two and then if necessary to move them later.

171
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.460
So let's give that a name and let's call that parts layer.

172
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.950
Brilliant.

173
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.910
So the final thing here to do is because I've created a new file.

174
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:33.360
I'm going to save as I'm going to come out o into the scenes using our building blocks tested.

175
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:39.480
Well now I have moved my files that's actually dead so I can delete that because I've done this hierarchy

176
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.200
here where in the meshes wherever I move them to basic room it's broken a lot of the links so let's

177
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.880
just remember that for future.

178
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.110
So that's okay because it's a test scene.

179
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:55.040
So I'm going to go into scenes and I'm going to call it Gothic church.

180
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.480
Excellent.

181
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.960
The final thing to do is go to my source straight.

182
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.730
Have I got everything in here.

183
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.070
Let's check and see what assets have changed meshes.

184
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.760
It's got all of my data there ready to go.

185
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.100
I just need to make a commit message.

186
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.980
I've updated my remey far so I know it's all about.

187
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:26.150
Unknown to commit and this is the 14th lecture so I'm going to call it game asit pack 14 linking to

188
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:33.040
an external data block and then I make sure that I've stage those which I have done and click commit.

189
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.550
Brilliant.

190
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.220
How did you guys get on please share your work in the discussions.

191
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.150
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
