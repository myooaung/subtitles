Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,160
In this lecture we are going to add the notch to our bishop or rather his hat and we're going to use
2

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
the boolean modifier to do that really quickly.
3

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's find out more.
4

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,010
OK.
5

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,870
So we're going to start with the default cube in front of us and we're going to add another mesh object
6

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,470
because the boolean modifier requires two mesh objects to work with.
7

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,360
So let's go ahead and move this UV sphere just to one side.
8

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,920
So we have our cube and we have a UV sphere.
9

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,370
Let's go ahead and select the cube and apply the boolean modifier to this mesh object.
10

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,130
I'm going to scroll down on the properties window here to go to the wrench or spanner add in a modifier
11

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,510
and we are creating new geometry so we're going to generate using the boolean modifier.
12

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,050
Now this is really cool.
13

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,600
And what's I'm going to do just to help us out visually is I'm going to select my  UV sphere before
14

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,640
I do anything else scroll down to its object properties or up depending on where you are and change
15

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,200
how it's displayed to a wireframe and we can use this to infer that this object is not going to be in
16

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,110
the final render but is used in some other way.
17

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,050
Now that we've got that's in wireframe we can see what's going on when we start intersecting these two
18

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,170
using the boolean modifier.
19

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's go back to the modifiers tab and let's select the objects that is going to do the operation
20

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,400
as the sphere.
21

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,670
So you've got the boolean modifier applied to the cube and its operation is difference and we're using
22

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,600
the sphere.
23

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,680
Let's see what happens.
24

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,140
It's grab our sphere and go G and just move it into the intersects the cube.
25

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,550
How awesome is that says literally cutting a hole.
26

27
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,580
That's the same shape as our sphere out of the cube.
27

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,170
Now as you can probably guess already the possibilities here are literally endless when it comes to
28

29
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,440
what you could use this for.
29

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,870
Okay.
30

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,000
What are the other two options.
31

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,940
Well we have two other options we have intersect which as you can see does something completely different
32

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:23,020
it only keeps what's inside the object which can have some really useful effects as if you were cutting
33

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,180
through an object is a great way if you've built a structure and you want to see inside.
34

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,520
You can use just this to cut through and show parts of your model.
35

36
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,340
Very useful doing that.
36

37
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,910
And the other one and the final one here that's make sure we still got the cube selected is a union
37

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,050
and the union as you can see here will create a new object if that's the combination of the two.
38

39
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,950
And the great thing about this is you end up with solid geometry afterwards so if I was to go ahead
39

40
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,920
and apply this and then just hide the sphere out the way.
40

41
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,770
If we have a look at this in wireframe we see that it's perfect.
41

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,110
There's no mesh inside another and that can be incredibly useful if you're trying to 3D print something
42

43
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,710
that's made up of multiple parts.
43

44
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,410
And he just can't get two parts to sits without them intersecting one another using the boolean modifier
44

45
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:22,210
with the union operation is exactly how you do that of course in this case I have applied the modifier
45

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,420
in order to get that final result to show you.
46

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,370
But don't have to and that is of course one of the reasons why you use modifiers it allows you to have
47

48
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,150
a stack of operations that are independent of modelling themselves and that means that you can quickly
48

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,250
change them if you don't like the results.
49

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,780
So there we go there's the boolean modifier in a nutshell and now it's time for your challenge. Okay
50

51
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,260
so your challenge create the notch in the top of your bishop and at the moment do not apply the boolean
51

52
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,610
modifier. Pause video now and give that a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back let's go ahead now and create
52

53
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,100
the notch in the top of our bishop.
53

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,140
Okay so with our bishop loaded up I'm going to add in a cube and use that cube, I'm going to scale
54

55
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,610
it by maybe point 1 Okay.
55

56
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:18,840
It's going to have to be a lot lot smaller about there Okay let's scale this on its X axis to make it
56

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,430
narrower and go G Z and lift it up I am going to apply the scale of the object you can have some very
57

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,630
weird things happening otherwise, I'm going to scale that in just a little bit more and apply the scale again
58

59
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:44,140
and then go G X and move its cross rotate it slightly on the Y axis and then rotate on the X as well.
59

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,960
And then I'm probably going to have to move it across a little.
60

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,470
Okay I'm.
61

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,310
I think I like where that intersects.
62

63
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:58,600
But just to make sure and turn the cube object the cutting object from textured to wireframe so I can
63

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,120
see through my object.
64

65
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,670
I'm gonna call this object a notch so I know what it's being used for.
65

66
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,840
And then I can go to my bishop, scroll down, modifiers, add a modifier, boolean.
66

67
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,180
Use the notch.
67

68
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,690
Okay.
68

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,580
This is looking good.
69

70
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,590
Oh and it's already cut straight in.
70

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,070
So let's have a quick look.
71

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,960
Now the beauty of having this wireframe here of course is we can grab it really easily and just move
72

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,380
it back in so I can move it closer to this central point and start cutting through the very top of the
73

74
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,890
hats.
74

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,090
If I wanted to I want to do that.
75

76
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,420
I want to be very close.
76

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,720
I think if I go G Z that will look quite nice if I have a bigger notch.
77

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,590
One side yes.
78

79
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,110
Excellent.
79

80
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,260
I'm happy with that.
80

81
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,890
So the final thing I'm going to do here so I can't see it is I'm going to hide that mesh object that we're
81

82
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,000
using to cut the notch out of our scene so that we have something really nice to look at.
82

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,340
Brilliant.
83

84
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,330
I'm going to save my work there.
84

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,850
How did you guys get on.
85

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,840
Did you start off with a cube to make your notch and scale it down.
86

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,590
Did you make it in a different way.
87

88
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,730
I'd love to see your construction methods how you're not just looking.
88

89
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,170
Please share them over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
