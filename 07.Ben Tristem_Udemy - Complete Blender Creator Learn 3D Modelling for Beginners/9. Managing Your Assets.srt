00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,110
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:13,220
So by now you've got a big long list of assets that you want to make and you're probably a bit inundated

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,910
and don't know where to start.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,900
So in this lecture I'd like to focus on how we can help you make those critical decisions on what models

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,640
you're actually making and what ones would be nice to make.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,440
So working out the main ones that you'll need is key.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,500
And then I'd recommend taking a look at something like trailer for organizing and if you've got other

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,840
suggestions once I've shown you what cello is if you don't know what it is then please to let everybody

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,560
know in the discussions what you use for organizing your artwork and your direction and your workflow

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,350
in general.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,040
Because cello might not gel with everybody.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,740
So let's take a look at cello for the moment and what I've done in terms of organizing and then I will

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,950
let you guys organize your work as well.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,660
OK.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,040
So over in cello This is a project management and it's very awesome the way that you can click and drag

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,850
things across.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,880
So I've got a level of detail a sarcophagus.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,770
I'm not going to put it any higher than that.

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,570
Well let's put it as B for the moment.

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,690
I've made one of those just as an example.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,990
So you can click and drag and move things around and that's phenomenal and most project management software

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,320
allows you to do things like this but this is a very visual way.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,980
So what I've done is I've listed everything that I can think of immediately down on my asset list.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,250
All of these things I could create and some examples as well from the photos that I've taken.

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,020
Remember you've got access to those photos as well in the lecture that we talked about them over in

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,840
the resources.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,740
OK.

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,590
So you can go and collect your own reference photos and drag them and you can have more than one where

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,990
do I have more than one in here this doorway for instance if I click into it I can see I've got two

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,740
different types of doorway.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,350
It gives me an option of how I want to focus on it.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,340
And of course it's called A Doorway.

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,470
I'm focusing on not only the door itself which is obviously the prominent feature but look all the extra

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,950
detail we have going around this particular door.

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,980
Not only that but the detail on it as well phenomenal.

36
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:17,630
So I've then dragged any of the assets that I think are needed over into my needed assets.

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,030
This is the key area that I'm going to be focusing on the last thing I want to do is focus on a rug

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,320
and not get to the main building done.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,670
So there are a couple of things that are absolutely necessary.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,150
The sarcophagus was a nice to have now anything that's nice to have leave on the assets list because

41
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,820
by nature if it's not needed it is a just a nice to have.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,960
So doorways that's going to be important from our viewpoint it may not be that critical but I think

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,800
adding an extra element to the wall section i.e. a door is going to bring the whole building into what

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,230
looks like a lived in or in this case a used environment a large stained glass window.

45
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm afraid I can't make a church without one of those going in there.

46
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,390
And later on in the section you can see that we don't have to model all of that.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,830
It's great if you want to but we can also get around by using it in a different manner.

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,300
We'll talk about different techniques that you could use here.

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,570
A window is going to be really important not only a stained glass window but we can have some open windows

50
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,080
as well just may be playing glass in them or something about the roof.

51
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,750
Now the roof I was I was personally I was coming and asking about whether or not to include a roof.

52
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,100
It would depend on last seen and if we ever looked up.

53
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,100
Now if you were designing a game where you were looking down on your character all the time the roof

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,480
would be an absolute waste you wouldn't really need to make it the floor tiles.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,040
I think having a pattern on the floor of some descriptions and test lighting tiles is really going to

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,410
help bring the whole thing to life.

57
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,330
A pillar is going to need that definitely for the archways which leads us onto the archways.

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,020
We're going to need some blank wall pieces as well.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,760
Now a couple of things that I've left behind here I've not included a vault in this I don't think oh

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,130
yes it's right at the very top so I've not included a vault in there currently but I think I am going

61
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,220
to need that because when we get to the top of the archways and the arches there it's going to look

62
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,170
odd if we don't if we have just a plain roof without that vaulting there so I'm going to move my vault

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,910
across into my needed assets I'm going to put it down here now.

64
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,180
I don't really have an order of precedence at the moment and I think that's important as well.

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,050
Otherwise you can end up modelling things in an order where you can't put them together logically.

66
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,940
So I'm going to go off and reorganize these into a logical manner and now it's time for your challenge

67
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,340
and your challenge is to organize your Model S.

68
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,580
I want you to be very clear on what you're making and what you might leave to a later point.

69
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,020
So separate out the models you need from the ones you want.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,180
And I would recommend something like Tarullo or any other organisational software in order to do that.

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,520
The nature of being able to click and drag and move things around is a lot easier.

72
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,370
You could also if you'd like a pen and paper in the past I've written this down on post it notes or

73
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,110
little bits of paper that scraps of paper that I've got and then I can organize it like that pin it

74
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,520
up on a board if you prefer that way of doing it.

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,650
Brilliant take a photo of that and share it with us as well supposedly.

76
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,940
Now and give us a go

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,010
Okay everybody Welcome back.

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,990
Let's go ahead and I'm going to dive back over into travel quickly and organize those models and a bit

79
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:35,110
more of a logical how I'm gonna go ahead and construct them order OK so back over in Charlotte.

80
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,050
So at the moment I got my doorway up here we could start with a doorway.

81
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,070
That would be absolutely fine.

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,360
Launch window.

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,210
That's probably going to come after sit doorways windows roof.

84
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,900
I'm going to link a vault.

85
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,150
I'm going to rename that.

86
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,690
Because I've decided that it's not just gonna be a plain old roof.

87
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:59,290
Now I think we might have some plain old roofs in there so I'm going to call this a plane roof and this

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,610
a vaulted roof and we can focus on the vaulted roof later on as well.

89
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,030
There is an mirroring techniques we can use to really speed up the process of making a vaulted roof

90
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,890
floor tiles so yes floor.

91
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,930
It Be good to get that done early.

92
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:24,250
The pillar so from floor to pillar the large stained window we can leave to much later on the vaulted

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,840
roof that would come up here off the pillars and archways first.

94
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,690
So you can see here how thinking about how we construct in the building already is inform our decision

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,710
of how and which models we make first.

96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,950
And a blank wall well a blank wall was so easy to make.

97
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,110
It's gonna be our base model that we base everything off almost like a blank template that we can build

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,950
our scene from and you'll see as we progress that the size of your items is critical for it being a

99
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,870
modular construction.

100
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,950
Now this large window down at the bottom.

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,500
I just want to throw in there.

102
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,260
I've knocked it all the way down to the bottom of my list which I think's fine because it's going to

103
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,480
be the the focal point at the end but you could also argue because it's one of the main focal points

104
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
of the scene.

105
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,470
It's potentially more important that we get in there sooner but I'm going to let my design language

106
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,480
of the rest of the building and then later on focus on the large stained glass window I'm going to put

107
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,600
right at the back of the wall.

108
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,590
Okay.

109
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,200
I hope that helps you guys out when it comes to organizing your work and making sure that you can remain

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,510
focused on the assets that you need really critical if you've got to make several assets being able

111
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,850
to put them in a priority order knowing which will take precedence over everything else.

112
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,370
Some of these extra ones over here I can see already a prop they're going to really help making a scene

113
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,920
feel more convincing however they're not essential for getting the overall feel of the scene.

114
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,000
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
