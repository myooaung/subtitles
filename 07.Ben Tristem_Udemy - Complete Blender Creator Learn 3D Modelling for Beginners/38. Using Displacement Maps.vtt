00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.490
Welcome to using displacement maps in this video you will create real detail using a texture.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.650
So we're going to take this texture and use it to actually modify geometry.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.550
So we're going to use a displacement map to alter geometry.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.630
You'll understand that you need geometry first in order to modify of it's not there.

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900
Then there is nothing to modify.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.410
We use the displacement influence in blender render and will also use the displacement modifier in a

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.930
similar manner as well with see how you can do that render time.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.280
And we'll see how you can do in reality as well.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.290
Now talking about reality there is an important reality and that's the fact that going back to the point

10
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.640
that in order to do this you need geometry in order to modify.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.160
So it's not suitable for certain things.

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.190
So it's not really suitable for generating a final brick wall for instance it would be quite tempting

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.820
to use a black and white chequered image so to speak to produce a brick wall.

14
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.960
But at a very high poly count is required.

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.350
Now that's fine if your computer can handle it.

16
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.260
Mine can't.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.460
For doing hey you're going to have a supercomputer.

18
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.790
In fact you end up with a brick wall.

19
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.130
Being a silly silly high polygon count when it's completely unnecessary.

20
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.910
What would be better is combining a low polygon bumping map so it's almost the right shape but not quite.

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.220
With a nother displacement map or even a normal map and will get onto those shortly in order to fake

22
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.350
some additional geometry as well where we can't really have too many polygons.

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.990
Now they are useful for applying details.

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.570
For example scales on a lizard fish or Dragon how or if you don't have a bump map yet we can use a generated

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.670
one to create geometry and then bake that back or come onto baking very soon.

26
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.420
We can bake that back down into a texture and then reapply that so there's lots of techniques we can

27
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.020
use going backwards forwards.

28
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.230
Now talking about creating geometry.

29
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.860
It they are great for creating or generating geometry and then of course optimizing so not leaving that

30
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.790
is your final model leaving it as a halfway point to get used to certain positions much more quickly

31
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.610
than it would be possible to do otherwise.

32
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.430
And they're great for larger items like touraine where fine detail is not required.

33
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.660
With a large train you can make it Bumpy very quickly by using displacement maps.

34
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.540
So let's go play with displacement maps now and applying them and hop over into blender.

35
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.580
Okay so we're over in blender and there are a couple of things to show you the first way of doing this

36
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.930
displacement is only going to happen at render time.

37
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.380
So that's either when you're in the rended view of your view ports your 3D view poor or when you go

38
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.050
hit F 12 or go to render and render image.

39
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.360
Okay so we'll start off with Blender render so we need to switch our rendering engine to a render and

40
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.490
once we've done that we've got to keep in front of us.

41
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.090
Let's go create a texture.

42
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.250
In order to use now I'm going to be really quick about this and I'm going to use a generated texture

43
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.210
tone and go to our textures tab and go new.

44
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.070
I'm going to go to where it is type and change that to valeri Noise.

45
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.120
Now I've chosen or annoy simply because I know it exists on cycles as well so I can show you something

46
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.890
that's very similar.

47
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.260
Now that we've done that we need to go to the OR.

48
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.230
Sorry you need to scroll down have the material.

49
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.300
Yes we got the material so we can scroll down.

50
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.470
No need to go to material first for this lot to appear and I'm going to unstick colour because I don't

51
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.740
want it to affect the colour and unrealistic displace and turn the display up as much as possible.

52
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.670
And again we dont see anything at the moment we need to switch in surrendered mode.

53
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.700
And that is not looking too great at the moment.

54
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.010
Its had zero effect on our model.

55
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.760
We look up and down weve got text here type none.

56
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.110
That's why that's changed back to boring.

57
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.520
There we go it's doing the displacement.

58
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.560
That's I wanted it to do and it's only moved some.

59
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.870
Oh yes we've only got eight vertices in total to move so it can only move eight vertices even at render

60
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.530
time.

61
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.550
So what will need to do here is give it some more vertices to actually start moving about.

62
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.940
Now of course when we're dealing with a cube there are several ways to add more geometry to the model.

63
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.960
We could go in and just add more geometry.

64
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.570
I could subdivide that's one quick way but I'm going to use a subdivision surface modifier that is going

65
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.960
to change this cube into more of a ball shape.

66
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.910
But we will see that this is the effect we get I'm going to zoom in and have a look at almost set the

67
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.320
shading to smooth.

68
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.670
That is a pretty cool affect and very quick.

69
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.330
I haven't done anything to set this up other than those few quick settings.

70
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.450
Now do bear in mind this is at render time so we switch the viewport to solid mode.

71
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.960
It still looks like that board.

72
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.940
If we go back to rendered mode you'll notice that this is what it looks like in the viewport.

73
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.200
But when we go and render it it kind of looks horrible.

74
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.020
And the reason for that is in the subsurface modifier settings the render settings are only set to two

75
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.560
subdivisions.

76
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.140
If I set that back at six and hit the render it looks the same as it does in the viewport.

77
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.150
So there's something to watch out for there.

78
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.840
So let's have a quick look now at the cycle's variant of this.

79
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.800
Now this is an experimental feature so we're only going to go over it very quickly and I suggest that

80
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.970
after turning your experimental features on you turn them off again after we've played with it.

81
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.560
So I'm going to have a 3D view open and I'm going to have a node editor open.

82
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.450
So the first thing to do is on the feature sets on your render properties change it from supported to

83
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.460
experimental and be warned from here.

84
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.280
Dragons may approach and destroy everything.

85
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.600
Not really but it does enable some features that may crash blend so used with caution.

86
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:23.530
Okay so now we've done that's what we need to do is go in Apply the texture to displacement.

87
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.370
So first of all we need to make sure we've got a material on a go ahead and click use notes and in the

88
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.130
node editor we can see we have a material output and this diffuse.

89
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.940
That's fine.

90
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.290
We need to go ahead and add ourselves a texture.

91
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.190
And here we go we have four annoying again and I'm going to plug the factor onto the colour and just

92
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.210
check what it looks like.

93
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.480
That's what it looks like.

94
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.270
You can see there that this is a bit larger than it was before some of the increase to this scale.

95
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.690
There we go.

96
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.950
That's about right.

97
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.840
So now I'm going to take this factor and plug it into displacement instead.

98
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:02.360
Now this will initially give us like a bump map rather than actually changing the geometry at render

99
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.960
time.

100
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.660
However if we go to the meche Data properties here and scroll down there's this new area here where

101
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.550
we can see displacement.

102
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.970
Now I am just going to do a quick tweak and on our lamp settings make it use the sun so it's just a

103
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.200
bit brighter and a bit more uniform light across that says Click on our object.

104
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.500
Again go to the data property scroll all the way down and displacement and as you can see at the moment

105
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.570
it is set to.

106
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.300
If we change that to true we can see it's actually changing the underlying geometry.

107
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.470
But once again it does require geometry in order to work so items subdivisions down you can see that

108
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.660
eventually it ends up back at a cube again and not this wonderful shape.

109
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.010
Now in fact if you have both turned on.

110
00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:00.990
So if we go back to the meche data here and go to displacement go to method and do both.

111
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.210
We get a a much crisper and cleaner appearance.

112
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.940
I'm not sure which one I actually like the best.

113
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.470
I think I do like this one but both obviously have their places.

114
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.840
Now bear in mind once again this only appears at render time.

115
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.130
Not when you're looking at the model and working in solid mode.

116
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:24.820
Not when you're working in text mode or even material mode so that's worthwhile bearing in mind.

117
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:31.640
Now let's go in and use these subdivision surface modifier to give us some geometry and actually displacement

118
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.050
modify as well so we can see what's going on in the viewport.

119
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.300
So I'm going to unplug this of Laura I texture.

120
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:45.560
I'm going to get rid of it and I am also going to go to my render propertys and change the feature set

121
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.060
back to support it because I don't want blender crashing on me.

122
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.350
That's quite disastrous when that happens.

123
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.570
So I'm going to move this window up and get rid of it.

124
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.270
And there we go back to our ball and we are in material mode at the moment some just going to switch

125
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.420
back to solid.

126
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.640
So now we're in here.

127
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.720
We can go to our modifiers tab and add in a displacement modifier and the displacement modifier is under

128
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.550
the deform column.

129
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.890
It's the fifth one down there displace.

130
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.590
Now you see it just gets slightly larger to begin with and that is simply because it is just displacing

131
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.790
everything as if it had a uniform texture applied to it.

132
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.950
Now bear in mind you can do you rhône textures if you'd like.

133
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.730
In this case I'm going to use another generated one.

134
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.000
So in the texture's area of the display some of them are hit.

135
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.980
Or is it already stored.

136
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.010
That's the first things that are put in generating another one.

137
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.530
So let's go to news this thing.

138
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.040
I think there looks like a paracetamol pill or something but I click on that little icon there and he's

139
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.180
actually taken this over to the texture's tab and under this dropdown we can see we've got displace

140
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.010
brush and brush mask.

141
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.810
At this point we do want to make sure it's only affecting the display.

142
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.490
I wanna click on this drop down here and see there's already two in memory and the techs I think that's

143
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.020
what we were using with the blunderingly so we can click on that and there we go we've got the vore

144
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.770
annoy texture again and we've got some ways of altering it.

145
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.470
So now we've actually got a texture modifying.

146
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:19.370
Ah geometry we can tweak it's a bit more by going to the modifiers tab and just playing about with them

147
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.710
that the moment we can see what texture it's using the direction so you can actually have all of these

148
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:31.040
modify in the y direction and you get this kind of I don't know what to describe that as.

149
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.880
But I'll leave.

150
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.070
I'll leave you guys.

151
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:39.520
No generally discussions if what you think that looks like windswept I think I'm thinking of going to

152
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.690
leave it to normal so it goes out sort of evenly across the entire model text record.

153
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:52.880
Well if it was a mapped you v texture with very specific displacements i.e. very specific colours we

154
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.430
could go in here and switch this from local to u v and use a u v map.

155
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.900
This group is very powerful it allows us to control what parts of our model are affected by this particular

156
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.790
modifier.

157
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.400
And we've got mid level and we can see that by moving that changes where the modifier is taking place

158
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.760
and the strength of course changes the actual impact that this is making on our model.

159
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:25.270
So if it's set really low we get a nice simple defective it's set really high.

160
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.610
We get a more explosive effect.

161
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:34.300
Of course if you go into the negative numbers instead of a V blacks representing low points they start

162
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.630
to represent high points.

163
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.600
Then you get a completely different effect.

164
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.140
In fact I think that when you move it out like that it looks like one of those flowers.

165
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.160
Is it a hyacinthe.

166
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.170
I don't know I don't know my flowers at all so I'm probably completely wrong there.

167
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:54.190
So there's lots you can do and it's very quick you can see how quickly we've managed to actually get

168
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.770
to this point with very little modification of the geometry in fact still underneath remember it is

169
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.550
a cube.

170
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.800
Now what you can do is in the modifiers tab itself.

171
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.460
There's a little thing that looks like a cube with four dots on it and that will display the modifier

172
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.290
in edit mode.

173
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.500
And that's kind of fun because when you're in edit mode that does mean now you can grab the C's and

174
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.620
move them about and change the underlying shape that these modifiers are being applied to and obviously

175
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.290
generates new shapes coming from there.

176
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.550
So the other thing we can do here is just try a couple of different textures so we can go into the textures

177
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:35.180
tab and from vore and I choose noise and wow that looks a mess.

178
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.450
Which isn't surprising.

179
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.290
And we can go into the modifiers tab go down to the displacement.

180
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.900
Having it this way around have it set that way round.

181
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:52.690
And while we've got ourselves a ball rush or or spiky Caterpillar or something and we can look at this

182
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.310
in render mode as well.

183
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.740
Oh I've lost it for a moment.

184
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.580
There we go.

185
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.690
So we're looking at it in rendered mode and if we go ahead and render that bar that's quite cool.

186
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.080
So that is like a ball rush on the end of a ball rush.

187
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.110
There's that one thing you know I'm thinking of a thistle or something on those lines.

188
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.740
I don't know.

189
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.210
I'm rambling on now.

190
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.050
And of course that usually means it's time for a challenge.

191
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.430
I'd like you to go ahead and make your ground more interesting.

192
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.980
So what I mean by that I would like you to use the displacement map and the displacement modifier to

193
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:32.590
create a not so flat ground around your model is just going to create a bit more of a natural feel and

194
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.440
a make it a bit more interesting basically.

195
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.510
And I want you to combine that with something I want you to use vertex grouping to isolate where the

196
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:46.420
building sits from the bumpy ground and that's going to prevent the inside of the building from getting

197
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.770
bumpiness inside it.

198
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:53.890
I'm not sure that's technically the right language to use but we don't want undulations underneath the

199
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.490
building itself that needs to be nice and flat just like you would build a real building.

200
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.790
So balsa video now and give that a go.

201
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.650
Okay guys welcome back.

202
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.080
Let's go make some ground more interesting and hop over into a blender.

203
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.890
So I'm going to say goodbye to my fossil for the moment and go and open up my Gothic church that I've

204
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.860
been working on.

205
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.160
So go to the 3-d view and have a look.

206
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.980
How's it coming along pretty well.

207
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.970
I have decided by the way and I might do this on camera or off camera.

208
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:36.230
I haven't decided yet but this top part at the top here I've actually looked at some reference material

209
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:43.160
and most of them don't have such fancy tops of them on the actual bell tower itself so that I'll probably

210
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.230
go but the rest of these lovely arch ways will actually remain.

211
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.820
So let's work on this ground sir.

212
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.320
I'm going to click on the ground and it doesn't have any thing and any geometry at the moment now.

213
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.790
A couple of options.

214
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:05.300
What I want to do first of all is just see if adding a subdivision surface modifier is going to shrink

215
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.600
it too much to with a level of six.

216
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.760
So let's go to the rendered mode and note that looks absolutely fine for the moment.

217
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.120
I may have to adjust the scale of it slightly and bring it out.

218
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.210
There we go.

219
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.680
I'm just doing that by nothink reference.

220
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.100
Really.

221
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.350
So that is looking pretty good.

222
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.050
Let's go and start modifying it.

223
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.190
Let's add a displacement modifier as well.

224
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.200
Hasso is lifted all the way off the ground that's not too great but we'll deal with that in a bit.

225
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.060
Let's add a.

226
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.810
Or is there a texture in memory I can use.

227
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.800
I'm going to use the displacement we've already got linked in.

228
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.330
Wow okay check that out.

229
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.010
It's my church in a mountain range.

230
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:52.100
I don't think we want the strength quite that high so let's lower it down to maybe point to kibbitz

231
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.480
slightly more realistic.

232
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.870
But what we're missing in here is as you can see it's modifying the ground and doing for church.

233
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.600
Not only does that make it Bumpy inside of that's no good.

234
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.870
Looks like a landslide or something has happened.

235
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.050
But it also means that the church is floating in places as well.

236
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.830
That's no good so we can do this in any order.

237
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.710
But I've chosen to do it around this way simply so I can show you the impact.

238
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.010
If you haven't done it.

239
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:25.110
So let's go ahead now in order to use virtex Grouping we aren't going to have to apply this modifier.

240
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.740
I don't believe we're going to be able to do any virtex selecting because the only real vertices of

241
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.800
these four on the outside of this plane the i've got so we're going to have to apply that's come apply

242
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.460
in edit mode.

243
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.430
Fair enough.

244
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.550
Apply that.

245
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.690
So now I've got some actual geometry that I can work with a hoppin to edit mode and we can see all the

246
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:50.820
little squares and I'm simply going to draw around them and remove them so I'm going to go to circles

247
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.140
select and holding down my middle mouse button.

248
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.100
Of course you could select any number of ways.

249
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.680
I'm just going to remove some of the ground around my church or rather some of these verses now.

250
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.370
I don't want it to close because this one gets pulled up.

251
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.360
Remember that it will.

252
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:14.200
And it is selective the moment remember where virtex Grouping this particular verse sees here.

253
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:21.200
If that gets pulled up then it's gone to pull up anything connected to it to actually want to make sure

254
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.860
that it's actually going to be quite wide around here.

255
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.120
So this one gets balled up.

256
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.950
It won't affect if this one gets pulled up it will affect So we want to remove those as well in order

257
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.770
to make this work properly.

258
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.290
And that should be okay would do that.

259
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.160
I'm going to go over to my mesh data.

260
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.880
I'm going to scroll down to virtex groups and add a vertical group and I'm going to call it bumb Paean

261
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.070
ground.

262
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:47.950
Why not.

263
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:53.910
That is what it's applied to and I'm going to assign sort of an a d select everything and just select

264
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.060
Yeah that's absolutely great.

265
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.840
So now we've got that Verts group assigned we can go to our modifiers.

266
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.420
Virtex group and Bumby ground and there we go.

267
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:09.990
Now on we hop out of edit mode the actual ground itself around the church should be flat which it is.

268
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:16.350
Now we can see at this point there is some sheer drops around it but that's okay because it means that

269
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:22.920
the ground inside and that it's placed on is absolutely fine of course now we can go round and tweak

270
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.250
a load of stuff so we make the church sit down or we can make the church sit up and we can see here

271
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:36.270
a bit more clearly what the mid level does if it's set in the middle of them it's going to oscillate

272
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.040
either side of this midpoints that's the area that's flat essentially at the moment.

273
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.820
And obviously the strength.

274
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.860
I think point two is a little high I am going to go for point one not just round that quickly and see

275
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.060
what we've got.

276
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.120
Well maybe points to.

277
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.030
Yeah I quite like that.

278
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:03.950
But I am obviously not going for that low poly look song I'm going to open up my tool shelf and all

279
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:10.370
the operator panels go is self very large that small are going to turn on smooth shading that is looking

280
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.060
pretty good.

281
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.670
How did you guys get on.

282
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.940
Did you try this technique on any of perhaps the block work in your building as well where you could

283
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.900
start adding detail to individual areas and making it a bit more unique as well.

284
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:27.500
Make sure you show your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
