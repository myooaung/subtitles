1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,330
Welcome to Hue saturation and value.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,460
Also abbreviated to hsp so we might have seen this already as we've been playing about when we're mixing

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,440
colours together.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,700
BORGER to go into a bit more depth of what it means and how we can use it to our advantage.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,060
So in this video we'll get to grips with what Hugh saturation value really mean.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,750
An h s v value is a cylindrical representation severe imagine a cylinder in front of you.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,540
Other points in RG be colour space.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,820
So we'll go into more details on that at the moment.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,790
Simply put Hugh simply means the colour or shade is it red is it green.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,170
Is it blue or whatever the saturation is how much of there is that colour.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,480
And finally value can be considered like a brightness with a value of zero being black and the value

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,650
of one being white.

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,550
And that's kind of all mixed together to make a shade.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,560
So let's go and hop on over into blender and play with the hsp values.

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,790
Okay so we're over in my new default file here and let's go play with colours some going to turn my

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,530
cube here.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,220
I'm going to go to it we've got a material already apply to it some would go to material mode so we

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,410
can see what's going on.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,730
Not going to bother rendering and seeing what's going on in that point I'm just going to leave it on

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,890
material mode.

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:31,160
Okay so let's go to the diffused colour option on ma material and swish it over not to r.g. be but a

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,210
huge saturation and value so we can see what goes on here.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,570
So let's first of all have a look we've got a colour wheel in front of us and this slide are going up

24
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:51,170
and down so if you see that as the top here of a s a cylinder and as we go down the cylinder it gets

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,460
darker and darker.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,540
Obviously it's quite hard to represent a 3D shape in to the space but oh I've lost it there but it is

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,620
possible to do with these two sliders.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,440
So Hugh were Hugh basically means where it is along this circle with a value of zero being red and the

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:20,550
value of one also being read as a little bit confusing but see it as 0 to 360 degrees around that circle

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,950
when she travelled 360 degrees back at the same point.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,540
So a value of 1 or zero is red now.

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,630
Green and Blue are exactly a third of the way around this so if we set this to one over three will see

33
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,630
that the colour will turn green every set it's 2 over 3.

34
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,360
We will see that it turns blue so that's pretty much now.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,840
Now what the hue means it's literally what colour it is.

36
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:56,200
Saturation is going to move this little dots this point inwards towards white so as saturation of zero

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,050
is always going to place it in the middle.

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,050
Of course then it doesn't matter what the hue is because there's none of that colour.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,020
It means no colour at all.

40
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,080
Look I keep disappearing off of air.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,600
Finally the value is this Slider here.

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,630
So if we turn that down we can make something darker.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,650
So we still got a hue and a saturation of zero here and we've got ourselves a grey.

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,720
If we turn the hue up because we got a saturation of zero none of that he was being applied.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,520
If I set this to well let's go for a green So that's go for one over three.

46
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,090
So I know it's going to be about a third So it's going to move from the centre point here towards the

47
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:47,200
outer edge and if we turn up the saturation we can see it slowly moving and our object getting more

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,630
and more green.

49
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,980
Now we want a lighter shade of green.

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,220
We can increase the value as well here.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,290
The final channel channel that you can see here is the alpha channel.

52
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,390
So how opaque or visible it is not we're not going to play with that at the moment.

53
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:12,190
So what we can also do is if we hop into the node Ed is there is a node that's called Hugh saturation

54
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,490
and value as well.

55
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,880
So I'm going to ungroup this lot here so we can play with what's inside.

56
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,700
There we go.

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,770
I think I'm going to have a vertical workspace instead.

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,980
So let's move everything around.

59
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't need much in here to see what colour things are changing so let's zoom in a little and give

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
myself as much space as I possibly can so you guys can see what's going on.

61
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:46,540
Okay so we've got this colour here so what we can do here is we can add in inputs and RG be value so

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,450
we add an analogy B value that's like having that control available to us so we can control the colour

63
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,270
without clicking on colour first and going in.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,010
So now we've got that we can go to colour and go to Hue and saturation.

65
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,400
Plug this in so that we're changing the colour.

66
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,750
Also we've got some control.

67
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,250
Some extra control to highlight the point.

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,720
Having trouble connecting those two things because they're too close to their region.

69
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:25,230
So if I set this as green so a value of point five on the huge saturation and value node of hsp node

70
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,680
we can see that this Slider here starts at point five.

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,060
And what that means is we can go halfway around the circle one way or half way round the circle the

72
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,090
other totalling 360 degrees.

73
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,090
So if I decide to go to 0 I should imagine it'll come out a pink colour or a magenta.

74
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,810
There we go.

75
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:53,700
If I wanted to go to MIT to make this blue instead of green we can change this here too.

76
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,730
Or was that going to be that's going to be a quarter of the way around the circle so point seventy five.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,310
There we go a blue in colour.

78
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,800
Obviously we can tweak those to get the actual blue that you wanted a logo.

79
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,490
So it's more light.

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,260
Point eight.

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,890
To get to the darker blue from this point on the circle.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,850
Now of course you'll be thinking at this point in time.

83
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,890
Well Mike White has plugged the colour in that I want.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,510
Well sometimes you don't have the ability to just pick on a colour where you might be dealing with a

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,690
chair texture itself that you need to make a slightly different colour and that's going to come in useful.

86
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:36,360
If you want to change the colour of a text to solms given you or even how dark the texture is or even

87
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:44,220
how saturated it is as well so you can use this node itself to change the actual incoming colour.

88
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,020
And finally we've got a factor as well so we can change the amount that that's being applied.

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,200
So I've put in a value of point eight there so goes to a blue.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,550
Now I'm good.

91
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:04,220
If I wanted a lighter blue I'm going to decrease the amount that it's gone to impact the image.

92
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,640
So you need to make more subtle changes you can use the factor to shift things with a lot more finesse.

93
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,290
And now it's time for a challenge.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,210
That's right we're finally going to hop back to our main project here and now we've got some more materials

95
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,890
experience and actually apply it to a simple model to begin with.

96
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,360
We learn to make a human eye.

97
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,320
So use all of the knowledge you have gained to this point to create a realistic eyes so we're going

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,050
to be focussed more on getting things physically accurate summation you got your reference material

99
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,840
to focus on.

100
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,820
Now I have included an iris texture in the section resources or of course you can make or use your own.

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,170
And this Iris texture is a blue.

102
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,310
So if you wanted a different colour you might want to use a hue saturation node to change that around.

103
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,520
Now consider the whites of the eye as well.

104
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,260
This is one thing that a lot of people forget about they put lots of detail into the iris because it's

105
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,010
quite prominent part of the eye.

106
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,970
Well the eyeball itself.

107
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,420
The rest of it is not going to be a single colour equally.

108
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,010
Don't spend too much working on the back of the eicas you're very unlikely to see that bull's video

109
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,160
now and give that a go.

110
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,300
Okay guys.

111
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Welcome back.

112
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,400
Let's hop back over into blender and make a realistic human eye.

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,010
Okay so over on our head here and I'm.

114
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:40,120
Well it's a bit mis aligned at the moment so we can sort that out but I'm going to focus on the eyes

115
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,150
for the moment.

116
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,910
Make sure they're roughly in the right position.

117
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:49,960
Before we go ahead and work on them so we can see here as we zoom in that the centre of the eye itself

118
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,200
isn't lined up with the centre of the eye in the image.

119
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,710
Now my head slightly twisted in this shots is not a great example but this eye does need moving.

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,910
So I'm going to go into edit mode and literally.

121
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,340
Make sure of the right things selected and which you can move the eye itself.

122
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,540
So that it is in the right place.

123
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,830
Now materne snapping off.

124
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,750
That's what's making it behave a little bizarrely.

125
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,160
Now I'm going to whiz around to the side view as well and check it out there.

126
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,580
Okay so we've got our pupal just here and we've got our here so I can see it's a bit low.

127
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,190
So in this case I'm going to move it only upwards.

128
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,970
And check again.

129
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,900
Okay.

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,230
That looks pretty good.

131
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,750
Maybe up a little more.

132
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,740
Okay so this was background the front and see how it's looking there.

133
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,200
Obviously it's going to look odd with the head.

134
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,110
So I'm happy with the people being in the right place.

135
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,920
But the reference image is still a little low in this case.

136
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,410
So I am going to shift the reference image up and I'm going to move it about to help me out more than

137
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,940
anything else.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
So let's go in.

139
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,270
There we go.

140
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,600
It didn't need to be moved that far at all.

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,630
It is helping me out now.

142
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm going to have to Reese or even sculpt I could go into the sculped methodology or just move that

143
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,080
up the vertices around Sachi.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,300
Maybe I'd look a bit less odd because well my eyes don't look like that.

145
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,630
In fact I think the whole face is a bit narrow looking at it and the jawlines not quite strong enough.

146
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,720
But anyway let's go ahead and hide everything else.

147
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,960
We shift and H.

148
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,480
So we can work on just the eyes.

149
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,510
And now we've got just the eyes in the scene let's focus on them and turn look on them from the front.

150
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,840
Let's zoom in on just one of them and see how the mesh is lined up.

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,290
Okay so that's a happy coincidence if nothing else.

152
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,860
This whole section here two of the biggest circle selects all but that whole section there is basically

153
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,020
the iris.

154
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:06,090
Now I find interesting because after last time working on an eye which is back on the bunny.

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,470
We didn't really care about realism or anything along those lines.

156
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,000
But if we now have a look at how much of that's actually selected that's a tiny bit of the overall eyeball

157
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,360
is going to be the iris.

158
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,710
Not I I thought you know again not using reference material that the iris would be bigger than it really

159
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,070
is.

160
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,950
So it is kind of important to remember to use reference material.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,770
Otherwise you end up with non realistic items.

162
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,240
So that's going to be the iris there and I'm going to do some modelling now to make the eye more eye

163
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,160
shaped and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

164
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,020
Okay to show you where I'm at at the moment with the modelling stage.

165
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,630
I've got my slightly elongated spheres here representing the eyes and I'd match that up to my eye on

166
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,340
the head as well.

167
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,470
And then inside of that I've made an iris.

168
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,580
So whereas before we made a cap to do the lens this time I'm going to use textures to make sure that

169
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,700
the lens is glass or that effect and the iris is an inside.

170
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,610
And if we can view the Iris which we can't without it being in wireframe moak as it's inside there's

171
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,230
the iris just there when looking at that that's actually slightly too large so I'm glad that I've shown

172
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,840
that at this point so I can go in and change it and move it about.

173
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,480
But that basically just needs to be moved a little bit further forward.

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,010
I think that's yeah.

175
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,870
It's that circle there that's going to have the iris texture on it.

176
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,750
Okay.

177
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,860
Let's go apply those textures.

178
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,160
I'll be back in a few moments.

179
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:47,730
Okay so we've unwrapped the actual mesh and applied texture of we whiz over here we've got this texture

180
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,220
that I've got here and we've got a basic node set up we've got a text tricorn to tell blender how to

181
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,760
map the image.

182
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,540
Now we've got colour coming out for the moment just for a diff use colour.

183
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,930
Now the one thing that I do want to be able to do is change the colour of the eyes.

184
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:11,130
I don't have blue eyes I have brown eyes and we can do that with a colour huge saturation plop that

185
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,900
in there.

186
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,160
And literally I can move the hue and saturation backwards and forwards and see what we get.

187
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,940
Now I'm going to change this to a 3D view so we can actually see what's going on.

188
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,570
So here's our new Iris and let's move along.

189
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,910
Or do I want purple eyes that's moving along with a bit o green Greens very nice and well.

190
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,380
They're almost there.

191
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,230
Value will that boost it up a little so I can get a deeper red.

192
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,500
Let's make it a bit Browner.

193
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,590
There we go.

194
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,100
Well I'm not quite sure I like that they're almost there.

195
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,460
They were get unhappy with that for the moment so we can tinker about with that to our heart's content

196
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,300
obviously.

197
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:58,440
Now let's get on with the rest of the eye of the eyes getting a bit of colour applied to it now I have

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,810
marked a seam around the equator of the eye there and I've unwrapped the eye as we can see over all.

199
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:13,210
Wherever I hid in it and I've unwrapped it I've created a new image called I base in a safe.

200
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,440
And this is in the resources as well as if you want to use this particular one if you've not got the

201
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,650
time to go in and paint it manually.

202
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,880
So I've got the back of the eye here in the front of me.

203
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:31,350
I hear an I've gone in and just literally started smoothing it out at the moment to add a bit of paint

204
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,290
to it's a bit more colour.

205
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,400
So I would continue doing that's going to take a few minutes to do and I shall see back in a few moments.

206
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,530
Okay so I'm getting to the point where I want some blood vessels on my eye.

207
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,270
Now it can be very difficult to make these.

208
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,330
However what I've gone and done is I've gone on to my painting area.

209
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:58,080
So arm in the texture paint the 3D editor and I've scrolled down to texture mask.

210
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,680
Now I can't select anything until we've got a texture of air.

211
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:09,210
So I've gone across to the textures tab and at the top here changed it to a brush mask with texture.

212
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:15,390
And after playing for a bit with the marble effect I found out that I needed to invert it.

213
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,180
Otherwise it was putting more blood in it then.

214
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,060
Here we go.

215
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,530
Here's an example here.

216
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,890
It's leaving sort of white lanes free rather than all the blood vessels non red.

217
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,000
And I didn't want that I want it the other way round so there we go.

218
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,880
We end up with this black and white.

219
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,960
And after playing with all of the settings I've managed to find something first in my mind looks relatively

220
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:48,270
close to blood vessels so I can go in and blender does lock up if I try and use it too much or too on

221
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,030
too large a scale.

222
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:57,360
But there we go we've got blood vessels very easily a bit randomly Of course.

223
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,970
But I think that's a pretty good effect.

224
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,450
The question is of course how much is this.

225
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,310
To be seen.

226
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,740
I don't and I also don't want to have a blood shot I say let's not go too over the top with it.

227
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,790
All that's going right.

228
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,630
Well let's see how that looks I can always come back and play with my texture later on.

229
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,900
And in fact I can also come in here and perhaps smear this middle area or even not on here maybe on

230
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,110
the image itself.

231
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,370
Oh blenders thinking.

232
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,050
Here we go.

233
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:36,310
Maybe even on here limited it's and perhaps even smear it out in this centre area.

234
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,440
Okay so the other map that I've made is basically a mask map where we have just a black dot telling

235
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,160
us where the people and Iris could be effectively creating the lens for us and we look at how that's

236
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,320
going to be working in a few moments.

237
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,530
So first of all let's go and have a look at the node set up that's creating this I so we whiz back over

238
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,230
here first of all we start off with the fact we're telling blender with a test to coordinate that we're

239
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,370
mapping these textures with you V.

240
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,500
Now let's have a look at the two textures themselves.

241
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,100
We've got this one which just masks out the pupil and iris area and then we've got the base itself and

242
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,700
we see here we've not got any think over the actual eye itself it's completely ignored because we deal

243
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,080
with that later on.

244
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,070
So we've got a diffuse smap which is well with that base colour applied across the entire model and

245
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:40,690
we've got glossiness okay and they're mixed together again using a friend now node with the factor so

246
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,290
we get a nice level of glossen we can see our three point lighting coming into effect here.

247
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,380
Okay.

248
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,860
The final thing here is the glass shader.

249
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,990
So the glass shader is only being applied to the people.

250
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,670
And the reason why it's only being applied to the pupil is because of this Mark shader here we're simply

251
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,600
saying that anything that's a value of zero i.e. black will be this first or top so I could move those

252
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,390
around a bit to try and be a bit neater.

253
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,860
But I've tried to keep things just in order.

254
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,980
And so we go to that final layer and combine everything together and we get a lovely eye.

255
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,350
The final thing to do of course is let's go to an outline so we can turn back on my head.

256
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,830
There we go.

257
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,920
There's the head what should be appearing momentarily.

258
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,820
There we go.

259
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,870
Now this isn't going to be great at the moment because we still need to modify the mesh of the head

260
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,670
itself and it's certainly taking a lot longer now to render than it's done before because the materials

261
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,960
are getting more complex but we can see here it's roughly in the right place.

262
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,330
We just now need to start modifying the head as well.

263
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,860
Now how did you guys get on.

264
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,850
Did you go through a similar creation process with the eye.

265
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,660
Did you go about it a different way.

266
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,910
I love seeing you guys work in the method you used to get there.

267
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,370
So remember to show your work and methods in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
