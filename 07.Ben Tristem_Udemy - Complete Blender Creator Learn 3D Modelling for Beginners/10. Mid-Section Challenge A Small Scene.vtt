00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.030
Hello everybody and welcome to the midsection challenge.

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.340
So this is where you're going to use the skills gained so far to make either a simple object that has

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.720
a few different parts or you can create a simple scene with a few objects.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.000
It's entirely up to you which way you go.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.700
Have materials on them.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.810
Have fun.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.820
Pick something straightforward and simple rather than something complex you can get to the complex stuff

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.770
later on and I'd just like to show you what I will be going for in this particular lecture.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.170
I'm gonna make a very low poly farm as you can see I'm not worried about windows or doors just the rough

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.130
outline to get an impression of the models themselves.

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.950
So this is what I'm going to be going for really excited to see what you guys do as well.

12
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.760
Suppose a video now and give us a go okay.

13
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.570
Everybody welcome back.

14
00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.420
Let's go and have a look now how I created these low poly buildings and hop on over in splendor.

15
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.870
Okay everybody Welcome back.

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.710
What we are going to do here doesn't have a right or wrong way of doing it.

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.350
I am going to build up something along the lines of a basic low poly farm.

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.010
That's what I've got in my mind.

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.730
So let's go ahead and just start doing something and see what happens.

20
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm going to go into edit mode here go GZ 1 and lift it up.

21
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:29.270
Now this is gonna be my barn I think so I'm going to select the face at the back and go g y and move

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.140
it along.

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.930
I'm going to move along by 2.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.860
I think that's a good starting point.

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.080
Now this top of the building here I don't worry about real scales at the moment as long as everything

26
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.200
is relatively.

27
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.340
Next to one another and roughly the right size then I can scale it up later.

28
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.900
I'm going to extrude here and scale in on the x axis extrude again and scale into nothing on the x axis.

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050
I'm going to go with that face selected at the top I'm going to go G.

30
00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.950
Bring it down.

31
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.600
And if you remember we're going to have double vertices at the top so I'm going to go vertex and remove

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.550
doubles and we can see I've removed two vertices there which does mean if I select this edge on top

33
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.910
I can move around freely.

34
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.750
Okay so that's a basic bond to begin with.

35
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.570
I think that's going to be a basic bond.

36
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.800
I might make it a little wider overall.

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.670
Yes I'm gonna make it slightly wider.

38
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:33.660
I'm gonna select this edge and this edge scale on the x axis by one point five maybe two one point five

39
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.890
makes sense.

40
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.960
Yes that looks much better and I'm gonna do the same with these edges so I'm gonna select that edge

41
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.350
and this edge and scale on the x axis just to bring out.

42
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.570
So it's more of a shape.

43
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.530
I can't remember what that roof shape is called.

44
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.520
Yeah that's absolutely fine.

45
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000
Now what I am gonna do whilst I'm here.

46
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.340
I'm gonna give myself a little bit of a lean to.

47
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.610
That's what that's called a lean to.

48
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.800
From the top here.

49
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.220
Now I'm gonna bring both of these edges down so we'll go GZ.

50
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.870
There we go.

51
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.010
That's the shape I was looking for here.

52
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.410
And that can come in slightly now as well.

53
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.610
So GZ bring that down and go Scale X spring that's that's about right.

54
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.720
Yeah that looks good.

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.930
Now here I'm going to extrude an edge pretty quick.

56
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.030
I can then lock it to the x axis bring it out slightly I was not paying attention to where that was

57
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.970
going.

58
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.390
Bring it down as well.

59
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.550
And we've got ourselves a lean to now I don't have any support posts at the moment and this isn't a

60
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.400
3D shape it's just a face stuck out so it's I'm going to do here I'm going to cite that face and extrude

61
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.850
it slightly down.

62
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.240
Now we're going to have intersecting geometry and look because we've extruded negatively it looks more

63
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.000
like a tray.

64
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.930
So I'm going to undo that and I'm gonna extrude upwards instead.

65
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.390
Now that will do then it looks like a little bit of a gutter and the next thing I need to do is add

66
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.820
in a couple of posts.

67
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.810
So let's go ahead cube and the scale that on every direction but the Z by point two point one.

68
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.160
Yeah.

69
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.810
There we go.

70
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.420
I can see it getting smaller and I'll go g x move it out now it's just a matter of making sure it's

71
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.410
the right height as well.

72
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.380
So I'm a whiz round the side.

73
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.400
There we go.

74
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.840
In this case the front view and I'm going to first of all select that top face it go back round to the

75
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.800
side and go g to move it down lock it to the z axis when I do that and then I'm going to rotate it so

76
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.270
it fits within the roof space looking good and I'm going to go round to the side and I'm just going

77
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.250
to duplicate and put these along here every so often I think it's gonna be something like that.

78
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.920
There we go.

79
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.070
Now let's have a look at our bond boom our bond done so now it's just a matter of assigning a couple

80
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.700
of base materials here a theme for our bond if you will.

81
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.540
So I've got a roof piece here I've got also a roof going up and over here and I've got the main barn

82
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.590
itself.

83
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.950
So let's go to our materials and select red farm or farm red.

84
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.440
I'm going to add another material I'm going to call it roof.

85
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.480
Then everything can share this and I'm gonna add another one in and I'm going to call it white paints

86
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.970
because I think these posts are gonna be white so let's make sure we've got some separate colors in

87
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.090
here as well so I'm going to go for a red type building not bright bright red but somewhere in between

88
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.080
I will select everything and just a sign that base color and go to look there.

89
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.150
So I can see what it looks like.

90
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.570
Perfect.

91
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.800
Now these objects along here that we have made because they are separated mesh data we can go along

92
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.130
and press the LDP to select all of those and then we can select our white paint and assign.

93
00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.190
Now I can't do the same thing here because it is connected to the rest of the building but what I can

94
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.650
do is I can go along the top here and select those roof pieces because that's not too much of a pain

95
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.010
and assign them roof.

96
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.890
And I'm going to give a darker gray appearance so we know what's going on.

97
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.270
I think I want some white paint around this edge as well so I'm going to select those edges and assign

98
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.630
white paint.

99
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.180
I'm going to make it white as well.

100
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.380
It's nice and bright.

101
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.540
So there we go there's my first building.

102
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.060
Pretty impressive how you can build something up so quickly.

103
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.770
I'm gonna add one final building to my ceiling.

104
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.650
I'm gonna hide this one for now this is gonna be called the barn.

105
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.930
Click the little icon to hide his house on the way whilst I build a cylinder and I'm going to adjust

106
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.920
that cylinder so it's only 16 that sees you may recognize what we've been doing here.

107
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.660
I'm going to go GZ one that's up select this top face good GZ one to lift it up once more I'm going

108
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.150
to extrude it by points.

109
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.270
That'll give me a nice area to select just here and then I'm going to put my dome on top it's going

110
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:18.290
to be like a silo so let's go ahead create a u v sphere go 16 an eight and I'm going to go g z and lift

111
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.410
that up so hopefully the appropriate place we can move it around and a bit more detail in a moment I'm

112
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:30.390
going to view it transparent of course you could do this in wireframe as well that's box select these

113
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:40.540
bottom bits and go X vertices then we can shift this down on top select all of this area with C4 is

114
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:48.270
still turned on remember and then go vertex all No actually I don't I'm going to re select all of this

115
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:58.880
slot here there we go and scale it up not on the z axis it's going to add a slight lip around the top.

116
00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.890
Okay.

117
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.160
I like that.

118
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:10.150
Okay so this area at the very top we can select that and assign that a roof color we can then add another

119
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.470
material slot select this lot in the middle.

120
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.760
Now remember because I've got the transparency turned on it's selecting everything.

121
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.050
When we do that the whole lots around.

122
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.670
So just bear that in mind.

123
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:27.940
I'm going to sign that's the white paint I never really created a new material there so I'm going to

124
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.740
go ahead and that will go.

125
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.940
That's why the zero exists.

126
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.400
If you accidentally create material you don't need you know know how to remove it.

127
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.650
So the white paint I'm going to make sure it's assigned because I didn't see it change color and then

128
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.940
this bottom bit here is gonna be the bond red.

129
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.790
Here we go and make sure you assign it perfect and go back into object mode.

130
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.060
I'm gonna go g x and place this over there and bring my bond back and I'm going to call this I believe

131
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.210
these are called silos.

132
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.790
There we go.

133
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.980
We've now got a silo.

134
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.100
Is that a bit big.

135
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.800
I'm starting to wonder gee X.

136
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.880
Maybe they're How about that my barn is starting to come together really well now I'm going to whiz

137
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.310
off and make a few extra buildings and I'll be back in a moment okay.

138
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.860
So I'm just finishing up here.

139
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.000
I'm happy with my rough layout.

140
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.970
I'm going to go ahead and move the camera around so I can render this out.

141
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.860
So roughly there I've not looked at the lighting in the scene at the moment.

142
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:35.720
So let's go ahead and switch to rendered mode that lights there doesn't make much sense so I'm gonna

143
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:42.590
switch it to a sun lamp that looks much better I'm gonna go g y and move it over here and then rotate

144
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:49.400
it round into like at roughly the right look I'm going for Yeah that's the one thing to watch out for

145
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.230
with the camera.

146
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.750
It can be very confusing which way something is facing.

147
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.110
Here we go.

148
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.540
So I want my long shadows.

149
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:04.380
They're going off into the distance and I'm just going to rotate it a little bit more brilliant.

150
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.820
I really like how that looks.

151
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:12.550
I'm going to stick a plane further further back so that we can fake the sky back there.

152
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:19.750
So I don't use the 3d cursor placement is just place it over their mesh plain scale it's really big

153
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:28.190
rotates it on the x axis by 90 and rotated on the z axis by 45.

154
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.180
And hopefully it will be in the frame.

155
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.870
There we go.

156
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.520
And then I'm going to call that sky.

157
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:35.510
Perfect.

158
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.590
Let's go ahead and render that.

159
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.610
And there we go.

160
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.040
