00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.510
Welcome to walking and flying around your model in this video.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.050
You see how our scene looks and feels by walking around it using the fly and walk mode.

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.310
Show you how to see the scene in unity.

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.820
Understand that I am only using unity to keep the iterations quick and simple at this early stage.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.440
And that unity is optional.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.600
Anything external to blend that we do.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.500
You can watch to see how it works and how it is coming across.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.740
You can see the impact of what's going on.

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.440
You'll gain a better understanding of external programs when doing this and Occasionally you may want

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.800
to work with external programs whether it be art packages or other 3D modelling packages.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.350
Now join in if you have unity installed and are interested in learning more about this particular prototyping

12
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.370
method.

13
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.200
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.990
Right now that we're back in our church in the moment we've been manipulating this by simply using the

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.010
mouse scrolling up and down holding down shift and panning across.

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.780
But that has its limitations.

17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.990
For example it's very easy as we've all experienced already to run out as zoom when you can't go any

18
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.750
further and you have to refocus what you're looking at and we can get around that by hitting shift in

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.470
F that enables flight mode and we can start using the W A S and deed keys.

20
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.520
If you've ever played any first person shooters to move around our scene so we can strafe like panning

21
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.240
out with a Andy w moves forward and s moves back.

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.500
Now this looks like a painfully slow speed that we're moving at at the moment.

23
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.610
But you can speed that up with your scroll wheel or page up page down and we can see that as I am on

24
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.890
a macheath SOME scrolling down I can pick up speed and whiz around the model.

25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.710
Of course we've got my little mannequin Hindi here for scale it helps to really set the scene and I

26
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.340
can see that walking around I can adjust this so I get a much better feel and well that's looking pretty

27
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.100
good.

28
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.720
Okay what else can we do here where we can turn gravity on and off by hitting the tab key which enables

29
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.990
us to walk on the surface of our model.

30
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.220
And when you hit the spot.

31
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.010
Oh there we go.

32
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.490
I've fallen away so that's why one of the reasons why you wouldn't necessarily want to.

33
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.470
But gravity.

34
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.810
I just use the scroll to back up here.

35
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.420
But wait a minute there's a quicker way of a whizzing about.

36
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.090
See that little cross hair in the middle.

37
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.590
Well if I put that on a particular part of my model and then press the space bar we what hop to that

38
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.250
part of the model so it's very easy to quickly hop around if I target my mannequin and go bang straight

39
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.920
there.

40
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.390
Very powerful for skipping around large models and we can see there are further controls on the bottom

41
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.240
of the screen.

42
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.190
Now when you come out of our flying mode it with the right mouse button it goes back to the previous.

43
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.350
Viewpoint before you started flying around.

44
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.460
Now you may of course want to fly into your model and to a particular place in the model to have a look

45
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.040
at it and keep that we can do that with the left mouse button enter as well.

46
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.700
And there we go.

47
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.050
We've got that viewpoint.

48
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.170
It's incredibly powerful for moving about a model especially one that's getting quite large and potentially

49
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.910
quite complex.

50
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.150
And of course we can hit shift in F again and pressed space to move to the tower and go up to the top

51
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.120
of a tower and look down a lord over everybody beneath us.

52
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.220
Brilliant.

53
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.980
Okay so I don't want this viewpoint so I'm going to right click to go back to my previous one which

54
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.910
is a much better viewpoint of the rest of the church and the Ancients way over there.

55
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.560
And let's go have a look at what this looks like in an external package.

56
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.110
I'm going to be using unity for this example.

57
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.670
Now a quick side note here.

58
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.690
Unity does support opening up blend files.

59
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.810
How ever what it's really doing is in the background it's opening up a blender is exporting the model

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.300
as an F X and then and only then is it opening it up.

61
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.490
So it's quite a clean way of doing it.

62
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:22.300
But if your model starts to get complex that can really bog down unity and I've had it spend at 15 to

63
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.790
20 minutes trying to open up every time and that's just unmannered manageable.

64
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.240
We can't wait minutes and minutes and minutes just to open up a program that's there's nothing lean

65
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.440
about that.

66
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.200
So what I'm going to do in this case and one of the other things to make sure that we do is if we ever

67
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.100
export our model at the moment if we just export as an FBI X we'll get all of the parts as well.

68
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.740
So we turned on the second layer here as well we'll end up with whatever we get these other additional

69
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.810
parts and the extra manequin they're coming across as well.

70
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.890
So we need to make sure that we're only exporting the bits that we want to export so we can select individual

71
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.970
items or the entire lot.

72
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.480
In this case I'm going to import the entire lot and walk around it.

73
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.220
Although you may wish to reconstruct this in an external package as well in which case you just export

74
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.160
the parts and then give full control to the level designer or whoever to put all the parts together

75
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.380
how they deem fit.

76
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.390
Because obviously if I give someone a big model like this it can be quite annoying to have to deconstruct

77
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.220
it first to reconstruct it how you like but this is a great example about how all those pieces fit together

78
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.740
a bit like when you buy some Lego you get a picture of what you should be making and then a quiz you

79
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.060
ignore that and go and make some other coarse stuff.

80
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.510
So now what we can do is just make sure that the things we want selected are the ones that we're going

81
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.030
to export some of the totally ignore the parts bits but select all of the other empties.

82
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.600
But going to select these empties whilst holding down control so it selects all of the meshes underneath

83
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.930
as well.

84
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.550
So I'm going to want to select that.

85
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.200
And then I'm going to hold down Shift.

86
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.590
Add to that selection and select the other bits in our scene some skin to go down here and select those.

87
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.250
I don't need the lampl camera.

88
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.990
They are completely irrelevant.

89
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.270
Whenever I'm exporting cars they are controlled and have settings really only in blender.

90
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.230
So now that I've done that I can go to file an export and go to FBI X. That's a standard one for most

91
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.860
packages if you're doing 3D printers then it'll be S T L as a standard one.

92
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.760
And obviously there are some other ones that you'll notice here if you're working with Sketchup colada

93
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.180
is the one it supports doesn't support sbx and this of course natively supports 3D.

94
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.890
S Max as well.

95
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.080
Someone to click on FP X and it's almost ready to save you can see I've already saved it in the past

96
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.450
but one of the important things here and pretty much all we need to do at this moment is put a tick

97
00:06:52.450 --> 00:07:00.670
in the selected objects box and then we know when we export in a few seconds time will only get those

98
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.350
selected object and not everything that's in our scene.

99
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.640
Now we're going to go ahead and click on export now a word of warning.

100
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.850
It doesn't ask you Are you sure if you want to overwrite it will just overwrite the file.

101
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.540
It's got the same file name or you've accidentally clicked on something else.

102
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.890
So do bear that in mind.

103
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.110
There is no going back now.

104
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.380
I've overwritten that file that was No.

105
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.380
Are you sure which is odd.

106
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.240
Was so used to.

107
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.450
Are you sure as an undoing.

108
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.270
And the computer guiding us along but it doesn't do that.

109
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.530
So let's go have a look at how this opens up over in unity.

110
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.610
Okay so I have set up my scene over in unity of imported the Gothic church and I've imported some standard

111
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:49.270
stuff so I can have the first person androzani going to go ahead and hit play and then I should be able

112
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.500
to walk around my scene.

113
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:56.290
So going to make this bigger for your you guys area go and this gives a much better impression of the

114
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.900
actual scene as we walk around it.

115
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.130
Hello mannikin.

116
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.680
Now these yellow patches here don't worry about those are just reflecting the ground man.

117
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.200
It's directly parallel with the ground it's going to do see is happening there and to some extent under

118
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.890
the arches.

119
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.590
I don't have an oar I've actually walked to have a door that was very good.

120
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:17.060
I was going to say I dont have any colliders So while I do on the floor so I dont fall through by there

121
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.010
on the walls or anything like that at the moment so I can go in and out of the model.

122
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.380
This is really good for seeing how its going to work so I can already see some problems and its good

123
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.410
that I can see problems at the moment.

124
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.850
Big cars.

125
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.660
Well I can fix them sooner rather than later.

126
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.260
And here we see this one's working and that's because it's a solid model so I've also identified at

127
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:47.680
this point that when I moved these into the scene and indeed all of these volts the ceiling pieces the

128
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:53.830
modifier the solidify modifier did not link as well so I'll need to set that up again on them all.

129
00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.880
I can also see around here whereas this bit here it looks like there's a piece misaligned idea bad construction

130
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.020
there.

131
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.150
Or is it a secret panel to a secret area of the church.

132
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.210
Who knows but we can start to see here that this this is feeling right it's feeling pretty epic it's

133
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.640
feeling big is not feeling too big.

134
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.090
This is a one point six meter mannequin.

135
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.920
It's actually a very handsome chap it's modelled on myself hergé.

136
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.600
So this is great because we get to experience how it is looking and how it feels.

137
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.070
By just walking around it now obviously because these are made out of modular parts.

138
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.470
The game designer or yourself if you're wearing multiple hats can now start filling about with the layout

139
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.730
inside the game engine or wherever else you're working with straightaway.

140
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.550
Okay quick challenge for you guys.

141
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:49.610
I'd like you to explore your model move around your model and get fit I have a better feel for the space

142
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.380
that you are creating.

143
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.500
Remember to make any alterations immediately working lean and walk around again and test those alterations.

144
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.600
Now optional for those with unity or another game engine or another external package import your model

145
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.760
and walk around it or fly around it there too.

146
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.650
If the airport has problems remember that is a good thing.

147
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:15.860
Were being lean about this and taking it to one of the N stages that we want very quickly to make sure

148
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.290
that there aren't any glaring problems so balls a video now give that a go.

149
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.790
I've already identified some problems with my model so I'm going to go and fix that.

150
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.950
But I will see you guys in the next lecture.
