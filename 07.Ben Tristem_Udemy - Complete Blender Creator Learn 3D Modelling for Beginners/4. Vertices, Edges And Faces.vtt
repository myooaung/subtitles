Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.880
In this lecture we're going to learn how to manipulate our vertices, edges and faces even more by deleting
2

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.830
dissolving and filling.
3

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.700
So let's start off by going back out of edit mode and into object mode.
4

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.750
If we have our objects selected and hit the X key it gives us one option which is to delete it.
5

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.760
Fair enough.
6

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.520
What happens if we do the same thing with everything selected in edit mode.
7

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
Oh we get a lot more options.
8

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.530
Now we're going to deal with vertices, edges, faces, only edges and faces, only faces, dissolving our edges
9

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.710
and faces as well.
10

11
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.130
So we've got quite a bit to cover but as you see as we go down some of them are pretty self-explanatory
11

12
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.060
once we've learned a couple of them.
12

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.950
So let's start off with deleting vertices with everything selected.
13

14
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.990
If we were to do that it would just disappear.
14

15
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.350
However if with Vertex select on we select one individual vertex and we can see that it's selected with
15

16
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.580
the orange slowly fading out from the vertex along these edges.
16

17
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.550
Now if we go ahead and hit X and delete that vertex you'll see that it leaves us almost with a corner
17

18
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.360
of a room.
18

19
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.030
And this is how some people set up a corner of a room ready to go ahead and put some other objects inside
19

20
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.540
it.
20

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.330
This is obviously a very small room.
21

22
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.890
It's two meters by two meters.
22

23
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.520
Now the other thing to notice here is not only has that vertex gone but the edges that were made because
23

24
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.250
that vertex existed has also gone and the faces that those edges made have also gone as well.
24

25
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.260
And with that in mind if we switch the edge select, select this edge along the edge here go X and to
25

26
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.340
the edges.
26

27
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.040
Now whereas if we had removed this vertex both edges would have gone because we've only deleted the
27

28
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.960
edge, it's left the vertex alone and the edge above it.
28

29
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.190
However the face that was there has gone.
29

30
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.850
Now what we can do to repair that is we can click this top hedge hold down shift and click this bottom
30

31
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.330
edge and press the F key and that will fill that back in and we can fill the top in to some extent as
31

32
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.780
well if we were to select those two top edges and then press the F key.
32

33
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.090
It will fill that in accordingly.
33

34
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.760
Now it's not quite the square that it once was on top and there's no way of directly remaking that from
34

35
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.310
here.
35

36
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.310
Without that additional vertex.
36

37
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.830
But you can see that filling in is a great way of repairing your model if you accidentally delete something
37

38
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.660
you didn't intend to.
38

39
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.390
Now the other thing that you can do is this top face here for instance if you were to go in and go X
39

40
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.740
whilst it's selected and do faces it would delete that face in its entirety but it will leave the edge
40

41
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.120
alone underneath.
41

42
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.870
And that's really useful because if I undo that and we went X and vertices would only be left with the
42

43
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.550
plane down at the bottom this square, I'm going to undo that again and get back to here.
43

44
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.800
Now dissolving vertices is a different matter altogether.
44

45
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.030
There's nothing on here I can really show you to do that.
45

46
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.790
However if we go to the file menu and go to open recent and I go to my challenge my wedge that I've got
46

47
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.050
here I can actually show you a dissolve in action.
47

48
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.520
So this is where we assessed that we've got unnecessary geometry along here.
48

49
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140
So how do we go ahead and sort that out.
49

50
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.940
Well these two vertices are superfluous.
50

51
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.900
We do not need them.
51

52
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.800
They do not add anything to this particular shape.
52

53
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.320
Sure.
53

54
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.080
If we had a different shape then they're important but whilst they're flat along the bottom they have
54

55
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.150
no relevance to this model.
55

56
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.460
Now you might think at this point you would go ahead and go X and dissolve vertices.
56

57
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.840
However we do that it starts to look a little weird.
57

58
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.830
It doesn't seem to have an edge anymore along the bottom here.
58

59
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.260
In fact if we go into wireframe mode we see that is in fact the case we've got a kind of hollow shell
59

60
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.780
that we once had.
60

61
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.200
Now unfortunately what we should have done is have only one selected if we were doing that and because
61

62
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.420
we actually had an edge that we wanted to make magically disappear.
62

63
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:27.440
What we should have done is gone X and dissolve edges and there we go we've now got our shape back to
63

64
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.810
how it was before.
64

65
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.220
And we've gotten rid of any superfluous geometry and there we go.
65

66
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.900
We've got a perfect wedge and now it's time to practice those skills with a quick challenge and your
66

67
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.540
challenge is to make the same wedge as before.
67

68
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.530
Now this is so you're familiar with the object and we start making different things soon.
68

69
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.810
Don't worry about that.
69

70
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.180
So we're sticking with the same dimensions as it was before but this time use any mixture of deleting
70

71
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.060
dissolving and filling to make the wedge.
71

72
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.620
And of course you'll probably have to do some moving scaling and rotation as well.
72

73
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.190
Go ahead pause video now and give that a go.
73

74
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.720
Okay everybody Welcome back.
74

75
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.580
Let's go ahead and make a wedge.
75

76
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.270
But this time using deleting and dissolving to make it okay.
76

77
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.630
So the smart ones out there may have just loaded up their previous challenge gone into it selected the
77

78
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.270
edge along the bottom.
78

79
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.340
Just like we did in the example and dissolved edges.
79

80
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.020
If you have done that I'll give you a point.
80

81
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.310
Don't worry but let's go back to the very beginning and see what we can create from there because that
81

82
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.570
doesn't really practice the skills of the lesson.
82

83
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.880
So what we can do here is go into edit mode and just move everything into the appropriate starting location.
83

84
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.240
It was before.
84

85
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.530
So we've moved it up by one unit and across by one unit.
85

86
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.590
This edge at the top here and we can select an edge by also selecting the vertices that make that edge.
86

87
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.550
And I'm just going to delete that and gets it out of the way so I'm going to delete the vertices.
87

88
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.020
I'm going to select this bottom edge so I'm going to go into edge select mode and move it along the
88

89
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.790
y axis by 2.
89

90
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:16.080
And now it's simply a matter of selecting the edges pressing f selecting the edges and pressing F and
90

91
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.530
then finally this top one.
91

92
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.690
Now you don't have to select all four of the edges here it will automatically fill in and there we go
92

93
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.040
we've got our wedge back again.
93

94
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.860
Now whether or not the first way or the second way is the best way of making the wedge.
94

95
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.850
What you will find that you'd go through playing with Blender is the best way of doing something is
95

96
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.440
often contextual rather than an absolute.
96

97
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.250
So depending on the model you're making and what your end goal actually is you may find yourself using
97

98
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.550
different techniques at different points in time depending on the circumstance.
98

99
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.260
And there we go.
99

100
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.940
That's my wedge done.
100

101
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.580
How did you go about sets.
101

102
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.030
I'm very interested in knowing and you sharing in the discussions.
102

103
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.270
What technique you used and that's a good way of learning analyzing your own technique.
103

104
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.830
Having a look at each others as well so go hop over to the forum and have a look at how other people
104

105
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.560
have done it as well because that will give you a good insights.
105

106
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.230
You'll remember those points and later on through the course you'll go.
106

107
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.970
Ah I remember John he he did it that way and Mike did it that way and later on recalling that might
107

108
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.530
be incredibly useful.
108

109
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.080
So go ahead share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
