00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome to realistic lighting.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.360
All fake it in this video you will see that there is a fine balance between choosing realistic lighting

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:17.430
and faking it and the time required is often a major factor in working out the path you wish to take.

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.050
So all one hand we have realistic lighting just getting everything hyper realistic now.

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:31.050
The issue with that is it can take an incredible amount of time to render and sometimes you get a rubbish

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.890
result at the very end.

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.420
And of course because it takes a very long time to render.

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.070
You may not notice there's a problem with it.

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.830
He spent a very long time doing it.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.470
But there are other ways around this issue where we can fake the look we're going for and we're going

11
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.370
to go explore that now and hop on over in a blender.

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.190
So I've opened up a brand new blender file and the first thing that we're going to do is literally just

13
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.550
make a a just a quick room out of this cube so got a cube here.

14
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.620
I'm going to go to edit mode.

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.130
Subdivide it a couple of times.

16
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.400
Going to edit mode.

17
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.660
I'm going to subdivide it.

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.050
Going to bring up the specials menu with W and it go to subdivide and then adjust the number of cuts

19
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.970
in there.

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.050
That's about right.

21
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.310
And then I'm going to face select select these six here so we've got some light coming in but I'm not

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.770
going to just delete them I thought I was going to what I'm going to do is actually separate them into

23
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.540
a separate object and we can use that to demonstrate what we're trying to do.

24
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.870
Now in this case I'm going to have to move my camera into my box so I'm going to do that now.

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.240
Grab it's now going to have to move it not in the z direction just push it in there.

26
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.780
Let's see how that looks.

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.140
That's absolutely fine.

28
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.330
I'm going to go for a bit double wide angle similar Go see the camera properties and go to the focal

29
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.750
length and make it twenty four Yeah that should do absolutely fine.

30
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.590
So at the moment and we've not got any lights coming in our scene we've got a lamp outside I'm going

31
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.890
to change that to a sunlamp.

32
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.050
And turn the strength flaps on in a click use nodes at certain strength up to five.

33
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.700
And if we switch over to a rendered married it's going to be black because we are inside that cube.

34
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.810
If we were to go in hide the Q One which I'm going to name now windows so I don't get too confused with

35
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.050
anything.

36
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.980
And make that a bit bigger there.

37
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.450
There we go.

38
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.240
So now we render it we've got like coming into the room I'm not going to bother setting up a light portal

39
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.220
at the moment we shoot obviously make it a bit less noisy.

40
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.800
So we've got the light coming into the room Now that's absolutely fine.

41
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.220
Now if we were going to have glass in the way we would have this window would actually make it a material

42
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.960
change.

43
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.650
So I'm going to see unique material first of all and change that to glass otherwise I've been modifying

44
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.930
the original material there which is something I wouldn't want to do.

45
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.640
I'm going to use notes here and change this to glass.

46
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.000
Now when we go ahead and go around there and scan to render in the viewport we see that it's taking

47
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.760
absolute ages to actually put any light into the room.

48
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.540
It will eventually get there we're on three out of 10 cycles but you can probably guess we're going

49
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.750
to need a lot and lots of samples to get here.

50
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.850
Now this is all in preparation for a stained glass window in a few moments that Im going to be making.

51
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.320
However you can see actually going along the lines of having a realistic room with them in the windows.

52
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.440
It may actually cause you more problems than you think its going to happen.

53
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.190
You want it realistic but at the same time you dont want to wait in the e.on.

54
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.830
So after 10 samples this is what weve got not very good.

55
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.470
However what we can do and this applies to textures is well if we put a texture on to that plane it

56
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.560
all it would be doing is emitting the colour of that plane.

57
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.480
Thats all a basic texture would be doing.

58
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.520
We can change the surface to a emission.

59
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.250
And now that is lighting up the room.

60
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.610
Now depending on what youre going for that could be all you need in order to get the right view.

61
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.630
So we're in this render this out now see how it looks.

62
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560
Its going to take a while to go through.

63
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.150
And of course this is just a basic room so that is absolutely fine in terms of filling the room up with

64
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.870
lights.

65
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.900
I'm not sure how many samples of gone this render Lets go have a look at 50 in total sense whizzing

66
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
around there and thats absolutely fine.

67
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.580
Now of course if I change the material colour and had its red then it would be ziv of the room or the

68
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.680
glass was tinted red.

69
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.680
Now the downside of doing it this way is you cant see through the window which means if theres something

70
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.320
you want to see outside through that window this wont be the best way of doing it you may be able to

71
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.090
find a mix of shaders that sorts that out perhaps putting in a a transparent shader as well as something

72
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.130
else to try and a minute or mimic the see through ability or the transparency of glass.

73
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.930
I was about to make up a word there dangerous thing to do.

74
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.210
So now we've had this preparation.

75
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.450
I've got a small challenge for you.

76
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.730
I would like you to go ahead and create a missive surface so I'm going to be using an image of a stained

77
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.340
glass window and using it's a fake light coming through into my church that I'm making.

78
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.900
Now in your scene perhaps you have a coloured lamp or a TV screen computer screen or a laptop screen

79
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.810
in your scene.

80
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.200
There are lots of different options that you can go for create in the missive surface and see how he

81
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.980
gets on pause a video now and give that a go.

82
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.000
Okay guys.

83
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.100
Welcome back.

84
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.900
Let's go ahead and add in a missive surface over in blender.

85
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.210
Okay so we're back over in blender here and I'm going to go ahead and open up my Gothic church scene

86
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.630
and I'm going to import an images as a plane.

87
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.790
That's how I'm going to bring my texture in.

88
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.220
Now I want to make sure it's roughly in the right place.

89
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.690
I'm going to pop it on the back window here.

90
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.860
So I'm just going to click to but the 3D cursor roughly in the right place.

91
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.280
I can move it to my heart's content in a moment.

92
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.430
I'm going to go and add a mesh images planes or lots of choices here.

93
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.030
Or I can see this stained glass window.

94
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.340
Case I'm going to go in to.

95
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.630
Is it textured mode I want here.

96
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.160
There we go I can see what's going on.

97
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.700
I'm going to rotate round on the y axis.

98
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.830
By the looks of it.

99
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.070
No no no no.

100
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.510
X axis by 90 degrees.

101
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.400
I think so.

102
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.440
Let's move that up.

103
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.770
And make that a bit bigger.

104
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.010
I'm not seeing anything in the moment and just switch over into rendered mode.

105
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.450
OK.

106
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.080
So that gives me an idea of what's going on there and I'm literally just going to stretch this image

107
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.670
up for the moment.

108
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.170
So let's scale it on the z axis.

109
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.160
That's looking good.

110
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.110
Now move it only on the z axis until it fills up the area.

111
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.930
I want it to go it's looking pretty good.

112
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.340
I might actually be able to scale that back down again but I'll leave it like that for the moment.

113
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.330
Now I know there's a few issues around the top here with you in the church from outside of the building

114
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.140
from outside but that's not a problem because my camera view is from the inside.

115
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.680
So let's have a look at what's going here and I can see that it's actually a little bit too high.

116
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.440
So that's crowd that move that back down ever so slightly.

117
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.270
Okay.

118
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.090
Now I'm going to.

119
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.120
It's already.

120
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.050
It's already brought in a lot of the properties.

121
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.740
We've got an image texture here but it's currently set up as a diffuse b s.

122
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.990
So if you shade up I'm going to go ahead now and switch that to a mission if I can see it.

123
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.920
There it is.

124
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.660
And there we go I can already see that that's already pumping out light into our scene.

125
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.540
Now we can play with the strange some going to go to five and perhaps that's a little bit too bright

126
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.450
so drop it back down to four.

127
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.260
And just getting a feel of it here.

128
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.060
And of course the best thing to do.

129
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.390
Is to probably just click render and see how it's looking so we will go ahead and render the image.

130
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.150
Now that might take a while to do I'm just going to check my settings before I go with mine.

131
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.690
There we go.

132
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:48.870
I don't need to run it at a full 10 ATP or any stupidly high like that's just going to run a very very

133
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.860
low rez version because it's just a spot check how things are looking.

134
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.950
Is lights coming into the scene.

135
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.140
I mean that's looking pretty good so far I'm liking what I'm seeing.

136
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.100
Now of course I can adjust this.

137
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.790
It doesn't look like it's actually filling up the entire window like I expected to.

138
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.710
But again those are all adjustments that I can make.

139
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.190
But that is definitely letting light in and looking much better than it looked before.

140
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.310
It does look like I need to adjust these or indeed get an image that matches my window or make my window

141
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.630
match the image a bit better.

142
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.420
Lots of options there but that is coming along pretty well.

143
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:32.370
How did you guys get on what did you add into your scene as in a missive surface please post in the

144
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.190
discussions.

145
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.800
I'd love to see them and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
