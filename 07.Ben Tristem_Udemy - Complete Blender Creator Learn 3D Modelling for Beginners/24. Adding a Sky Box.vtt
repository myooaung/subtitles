00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.720
Welcome to adding a sky box in this video you will add a sky box to our scene.

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.670
Use that sky box as the primary light source for the whole scene.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.780
So just as in this example we have Suzanne the monkey sat on a plane here lit by one lamp.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.390
Now the moment we add a sky box to that it becomes a much more vibrant image and much more interesting

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.270
and the whole lighting in the scene is done by that Sky Box.

6
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.350
Plus the original amp that was in the scene.

7
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.170
So now we got an idea of what we're going to do.

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.770
Let's hop straight on over in a blender.

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.460
Okay so now we're over in blender.

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
The first thing I'm going to make sure that I do so I'm not sure I've done it yet is saved my file.

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.210
Excellent.

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.660
Going to Go go ahead and open up a new farson go file a new and reload start up file because we're about

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.260
to play with some stuff and I don't want us to break our bunny at this point in time.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.710
So we've got our default cube here we use that as the object in the last seen them skin to lift it up

15
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.500
a little and finally create a mesh plain underneath some skin to add a plate and scale it up.

16
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.360
Excellence is nice and big and perhaps going to grab that and just lower it down ever so slightly and

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.270
let's just quickly render that to see how that's looking so far in cycles render for this one by the

18
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.460
way just to make sure you're aware that's going to position the camera so we can see a bit more off

19
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.610
the sky.

20
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.780
So in the outline I know it's a big cramped on my screen here in the outline and been to select the

21
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.190
camera in the.

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.370
3D view I'm going to open up the properties pane with the n key and scroll down here too.

23
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.350
Oh I need to be in the camera views of view camera and then I'm going to lock camera to view.

24
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.250
That's just going to allow me to move about quite freely and position the camera where I want it to

25
00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.550
be.

26
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.910
And I do want to see a bit of the background as well.

27
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.290
ALAN going to render that again.

28
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.090
Excellent so you've got all of this lot going on here now in order to add a sky box there are a couple

29
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.220
of ways of doing this.

30
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.120
By the way we're going to do it is actually add an image to the world around.

31
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.860
So looking at the fact we're looking at something called the welte so only propertys tab over here is

32
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.680
a picture of a little world.

33
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.000
And if we click on that it gives us a series of options.

34
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.290
Now at the moment we're focussed primarily on where it says surface and at the moment it's got a colour

35
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.790
that is grey.

36
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.040
Now if you change the colour of that nothing will happen here because this is a rendered view.

37
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.090
But I'm going to hop over here.

38
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.340
Not lock for cameras for the viewing to assume in ever so slightly and just switch to render to see

39
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.260
what's happening.

40
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.780
So this colour here actually changes the colour of the world the entire background everything apart

41
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.710
from the plane is going to be this orange colour.

42
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.670
So what we can do is replace that colour with an image.

43
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.970
And there are two types of images that make it very good for backgrounds like the one we're going to

44
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.310
use.

45
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.060
There's an angular image and I remember the other one.

46
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.800
Equatorial no iqua were Find out in a few moments.

47
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.190
Okay so I'm going to click on News Notes there and it needs to be a background which is grey and on

48
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.730
colour I'm going to click the little dots to the right here.

49
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.880
And loads of options here an environment texture is the one that we want.

50
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.020
Now when you select environment it is going to go that horrible pink which means there's not texture

51
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.280
applied yet.

52
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.470
And here we go.

53
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.090
It Quy rectangular.

54
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.810
That's the word I was thinking of every rectangular mirror ball or angular projection angle view.

55
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.700
There's loads of different names for them.

56
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.480
You'll notice the difference between the two of them one essentially is a large stretch out slightly

57
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.060
distorted rectangle and one looks like a sphere.

58
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.530
And where have a look at both of these and see over time.

59
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.010
So let's start with Mirrorball and in your set pack.

60
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.710
If you've not downloaded it please hop back to the assets lecture now and go grab your asset pack and

61
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.970
I'm going to go to open and I'm going to go find my assets.

62
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.980
They'll be slightly different to where you guys store yours and section assets and we have angular map

63
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.710
so we're going to select angular map 24 J pecc.

64
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.400
Excellent.

65
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.850
Now you see straightaway the scene has changed completely and in fact looks a lot more natural.

66
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.810
Now one thing to bear in mind here is because the light is coming from the scene around us.

67
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.570
It's going to be a bit noisier than just from a simple lamp so you will have to increase your samples

68
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.320
when using this type of lighting to get a comparatively smooth image compared to using a lamp.

69
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:11.310
Now this is a mirror ball and as you can see if I hop out of the camera here and well anywhere will

70
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.990
do so just move round.

71
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.560
We've now got a world around us.

72
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.050
It looks a bit weird on certain areas there seems to be a hole or a point here.

73
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.960
Now this will depend on the quality of your image that you're using these are quite basic images.

74
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.130
And it works pretty well providing you are not looking that way.

75
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.690
That looks very ominous.

76
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.600
If we change Mirrorball to Quee rectangular you can see it doesn't look right at all.

77
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.860
You end up with oh I'm looking through my plane at the moment.

78
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.680
Zoom away.

79
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.980
We've got vats in there and that they're now if we go and open and actually select this item here on

80
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.500
the file menu here.

81
00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.360
Well what's this one called a forgotten file browser on this far browser header.

82
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.370
You've got these four pages next to one another but show us images and this is a great way of seeing

83
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.500
that the angular map is this kind of spherical thing and that's the Mirrorball selection and the equally

84
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.390
rectangular ones are the sky moonscape here and Sky photo.

85
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.660
Now let's go ahead and apply one of those.

86
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.810
Wow that looks pretty awesome.

87
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.350
And if we zoom back in to our object we see that the colour has changed because it's primarily blue.

88
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.650
We've actually got ourselves a blue light cast on the rest of our scene.

89
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.800
Now if we scroll down a little further in the properties I'm going to make this window a little bit

90
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.150
bigger for us.

91
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.220
You've got this strength here so you can actually make the light coming from that background.

92
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.240
Stronger or weaker.

93
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.590
So this night time scene for instance obviously we said it to zero.

94
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.820
There is no background no light emitted but obviously with a nice house in it.

95
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.510
From Well I say it wouldn't.

96
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.020
It probably wouldn't be that bright.

97
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.870
So we can play with the figures here and lower it down to maybe not point not one that's probably too

98
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.140
low.

99
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.340
Let's try not point north 5.

100
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.500
You can tinker with these two hearts in lights.

101
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.240
In fact there's a moon there so be quite cool to have the light coming from that direction.

102
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.820
How awesome is that right.

103
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.200
I feel a challenge for you guys coming up.

104
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.500
Okay I'd like you to add a sky box to our scene so add a sky box to our bunny.

105
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.600
Now there are a couple of options to choose from.

106
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.700
Supplied in the asset pack.

107
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.420
Now please feel free to try your own photos or other sky maps.

108
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.910
You have to just give you an idea what I'm shooting for.

109
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.580
I'm going to be shooting for something along these lines.

110
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.520
Have a grey murky day.

111
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.010
Pretty typical day in England anyway.

112
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.670
Both the video now and give that a go.

113
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.280
OK guys welcome back.

114
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.080
Let's go ahead and create our skybox.

115
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.340
Okay so let's go and open up our bunny.

116
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.240
Now once this is open obviously the last thing we rendered here was the eye.

117
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.430
It doesn't show any image.

118
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.830
Someone might pop into my 3-d view.

119
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:16.010
Oh man we've got the eye there and the unhide everything for the moment just so I can see what's going

120
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.090
on on the larger picture.

121
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.270
We're going to have to switch around to a different camera rather than just the camera.

122
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.550
We're still moving the I can turn off that's him.

123
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:34.250
Let's see if this camera will do the 30 of the 80 mill one is probably the one that I want.

124
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.040
So I'm going to.

125
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.960
Cameras and set the cameras to objects.

126
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.030
Yes there's a good bit of the background in there.

127
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.460
That's what we want to see.

128
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:43.550
I am just going.

129
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.690
I'm not going to end this at the moment because I've done this particular view before and that's going

130
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.930
to take a few moments to render.

131
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:56.180
But what I am going to do is go straight to the world settings and I'm going to add something to click

132
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.130
on News Notes.

133
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.430
It is a background that's absolutely fine but cover up.

134
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.100
Well I'm going to select an environment texture.

135
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.920
I'm going to do the equip rectangular one which is fine I'm going to open that up.

136
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.560
Go to my section assets and I've got one called Sky photos three and I'm going to pick that one.

137
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.770
I'm just gonna hop here in to rended mode in the viewport shading and see how that looks.

138
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.960
And we've got some clouds coming out there that's looking pretty good.

139
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.320
Let's just move away from here and see how it's how it's mapped out that's fine.

140
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.480
It's like a typical British day actually it looks quite stormy.

141
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.580
I'm quite happy with that.

142
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.020
Excellent.

143
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.290
How did you guys get on.

144
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.990
Of course the final thing to do here is render it of course.

145
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:49.030
Let's go and hit the render button and let's make this window a little bit bigger so I can see what's

146
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.210
going on now.

147
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.170
I'd love to see what you guys have come up with.

148
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.950
Really look forward to seeing how your rabbits are turning out.

149
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.980
I'm really interested in how this one's going to turn out.

150
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:08.260
Well we can already see straightaway that the fur itself has taken on a much brighter more vibrant appearance.

151
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:14.650
This is great bit of lighting because the lighting is now coming from all around our by me rather than

152
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.630
just a one lamp that was in the scene before.

153
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.800
So do render out your bunny.

154
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.180
Please share it in the discussion so I can see how you guys are getting on.

155
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.580
And I will see you in the next lecture.
