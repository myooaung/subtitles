00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.950
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.580
This is going to be a quick tip lecture on blenders preferences.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.920
Now the preferences section you may have already been to under edits and preferences now blenders Preferences

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.920
window is also an editor type.

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.680
You can notice it's there at the very end under the Data column.

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.810
I'm going to open it up in its own window which is under edit and preferences.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.260
There we go.

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.450
We've got our own little window that sits on top.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.050
Now sometimes if that's already open it will open up behind everything else and that can be well the

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.670
easiest way to say is annoying because you click on blended preferences and it doesn't open.

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.400
So a couple of key blender preferences here we've already gone through a few of them.

12
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.210
So under the General tab we'll start there because that's where it's opened.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.520
I would make sure that you've got cycles compute device and have a look to see whether or not you can

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.780
use graphic card acceleration will go into much more detail in that later in the course if you can do

15
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.980
a couple of tests.

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.460
Now if you have an integrated graphics card you may find that even though you've got a graphics card

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.240
selected it isn't any better than your CPA.

18
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.930
In fact there are some CPE uses that will outperform a graphics card.

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.690
It doesn't make sense if you think for a graphics card is to do graphics with but that's just how it

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.690
is some CPE use are more powerful this way round it's fine with me I need my processor to record the

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.760
screen and do other things at the same time.

22
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.610
So I've got it set to my internal graphics card.

23
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.360
The next system tab files.

24
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.540
Now one of the things that you may have noticed if we go and open up where you're saving your files

25
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.440
is you end up with these dot blend one files sitting everywhere.

26
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.840
Well what are they.

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.480
Well they're blenders own versioning systems so if I go ahead and I've missed it.

28
00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.900
There we go.

29
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.420
Blender Preferences window and go down to save and load and open up that's why I scroll down we see

30
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.330
it says save versions one so keeps an older version of the blend farm that you're working on and you

31
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.460
can increase that all the way up to 32 if you wanted to I wouldn't manage my files like that in fact

32
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.510
at this point now I've pointed it out unless I set it to zero because I manage the versioning of my

33
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.930
files completely differently.

34
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.450
So this this setting may not be for everyone.

35
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.750
It basically means if you hit save you can go back one save if you want to and I'm going to save my

36
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.190
preferences so that every new blender FAVA I open will have that setting which is really useful when

37
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.380
I open up auto save auto save temporary in temporary files.

38
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.270
Yep time every two minutes.

39
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.840
That's absolutely fine for me and I'm sure blender will crash at some point and we'll have to use it

40
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.940
in anger.

41
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.530
Right.

42
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.050
The other thing to just show you with the Save versions is how to open up a prior version.

43
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.610
So if we go to file and open your dot blend ones do not exist in this list.

44
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.430
We have to go up to the top right.

45
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.670
We can see that the filter button has been pressed and we're filtering for any folders and blend files.

46
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.120
Well the next one along is dot blend.

47
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.750
One two three etc files so if we turn that's on we can see our other files that we can open up in Blender

48
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.460
if we need to.

49
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.820
Because that's the only way we're going to be able to do it with the exception of going into see your

50
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.430
file manager and renaming the file.

51
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.610
I'm going to cancel that for the moment.

52
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.840
So I don't want to open up.

53
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.040
Let's go back to our preferences and go over a few others.

54
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.480
Let's go from the top interface resolution scale.

55
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.800
I find really important because I'm trying to show you guys what's on my screen.

56
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.300
However if your eyesight is really good you can make that smallest of the interfaces out of your way

57
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.810
or you can make it really big if your eyesight is not that good.

58
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.890
I'm gonna send it back to one point two five.

59
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.300
I'm not going to go through all of the preferences and details just the ones that I find are important

60
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.490
to get on the about themes.

61
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.640
This is where you can go ahead and select to have a blender lights or blender dark or indeed install

62
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.960
a different theme.

63
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.590
Now the difference between blend the lights and blend the dark.

64
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.490
Well if we switch the blender light now you can see it's a lot brighter.

65
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.380
Now personally I use this one on my laptop because I often use my laptop in lights environments and

66
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.450
having it sets dark makes things very difficult to read sometimes.

67
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:41.060
If we go down to inputs these are key if you want to use Blender efficiently on a laptop you can emulate

68
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.970
your num pad you put a tick in that box.

69
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.580
It means the numbers across the top of the keyboard rather than a dedicated num pad will now function

70
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.800
exactly like a number pad does.

71
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.040
And you can emulate a three button mouse with out and left mouse that can be really useful if for some

72
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.000
reason you don't have a three button mouse or indeed you're using a trackpad on a laptop whilst we're

73
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:14.580
in the input tab I'm going to go to view manipulation Orbitz and pan now personally what I like is when

74
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.600
I'm orbiting I wants to be able to orbit around what I have selected some kind of person tick in orbit

75
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.030
around selection.

76
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.920
This simply means that when I've got something selected blenders not going to rotate around that object

77
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.590
in some arbitrary manner.

78
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.750
It's going to rotate literally around whatever selected auto perspective we're going to lever on it

79
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.960
simply means that when you go into one of the side front top bottom views it automatically goes to awful

80
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.350
graphic perspective.

81
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.770
Zoom.

82
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:54.780
Occasionally I turn on zoom to mouse position that generally is when I'm working with a sculpt or if

83
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.400
I'm working on something.

84
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.220
What I do have to zoom in and out lots of a larger object.

85
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.680
Now in general I will leave it off it's not necessary but later on especially when we get to the sculpting

86
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.150
or more complex objects you may see me turn that on in order to do that.

87
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.520
And again that's the great thing about blender.

88
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.730
If you turn things on you can turn them off again.

89
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.010
It really is customizable to whatever you want.

90
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.210
Now to skip off of this now and go to add ons add ons add ons islands we will use add ons as we go through

91
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.090
the course I'm not going to turn any on at the moment I'll introduce you to them as we go now add ons

92
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:44.760
are brilliant they enable additional functionality or workflow improvements within blender and often

93
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.640
they can be free because they're developed by the community for the community there are also some amazing

94
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.830
paid for add ons as well and I will show you a couple of those as we go through the course where they

95
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.950
do genuinely help speed things along flip fluids is a great one but I'm not sure if it's ready for 2.8

96
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.380
just yet and that's the other thing.

97
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.610
These are all dependent on being upgraded so if you're used to seeing something in this list that you

98
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:18.660
had before and doesn't work now well that's because the developer of that particular add on hasn't updated

99
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.740
it to work fully in 2.8.

100
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.970
Now before I shut down blender preferences I'm going to save my preferences and close that window.

101
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.100
Now one thing to bear in mind is that if you do screw something up in blender you can reset it back

102
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.380
to factory settings.

103
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:41.340
It's something that I'd only ever advise if you really needed to but that option is under file and load

104
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.000
factory settings.

105
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.450
So I've done that when I started teaching this course because I had saved the load of my other preferences

106
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.210
from playing around with it and I wanted to make sure it was vanilla as possible.

107
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.410
When you guys joined me on this learning journey.

108
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:03.680
Finally if you do set up a different type of start file you can go ahead and save startup file.

109
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.590
Now that's typically used where you've got let's say you're constantly modelling humanoid figures so

110
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.060
you put instead of a cube put a base mesh that's roughly human shape and then you just go at it from

111
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.810
there rather than having to import it all the time.

112
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.920
And of course once again you can change that depending on what your workflow is doing.

113
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.210
The other thing that you can do is if you start building up a collection of materials that you've made

114
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:33.420
you can save them in your startup file which means that every time you load up blender your materials

115
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.210
are there and ready for you rather than having to create them every time you open up blender Well that's

116
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.500
it for the user preferences.

117
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.620
Lots of customization I should now be able to orbit around objects I have selected rather than just

118
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.710
the center of the viewport which is really useful.

119
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.560
That's what I wanted to do.

120
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.140
Perfect.

121
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.770
And I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
