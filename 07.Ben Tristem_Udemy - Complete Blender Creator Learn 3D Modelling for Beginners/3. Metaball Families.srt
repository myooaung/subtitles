00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,340
In this lecture we're talking about metal bowl families I'm going to use some eyeballs to illustrate

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,450
my point and we're going to play around with a little bit of the naming of the medal so becomes very

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,910
clear how mutable families work.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,830
Why do we have medieval families.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,350
Well it allows us to say that these particular medals are within in essence within the same object and

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,290
they can influence each other.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,510
So it's a medal O three.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,960
If I move that around you can see that is influencing the other medals around it.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,130
So we're saying yes there is a relationship there.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,570
The structure is that the first medal we've put in is just called bowl and then the other medals in

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,050
the family have the same first part of the name.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,320
This is the family name if you will amble and then dot 0 0 1 0 2 that is the identifier for each of

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,270
the individual children within there.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,810
Now if we make any changes to one of these metal bowls if we click on medal or medal 0 0 3 for example

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,660
we go down into our properties when we change for example the resolution that would change the resolution

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,940
for the entirety of our object.

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,440
So some of the documentation says you need to click on the parent amble to do that but in reality you

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,440
can see that when you click on the individuals it is modifying the resolution or the influence threshold

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,580
for all of the objects in the family.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,010
Some of the properties you can't get away from that once you're in the family you're in the family it

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,530
sounds like a good gangster movie doesn't it.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,130
If I was to click on materials create myself a new material we'll call it let's say I just call it green

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:38,990
maybe green OK and then we'll change green to be actually be green jump up into my material preview

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,300
and you can see everything here is green.

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,560
If I say hang on a minute.

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,140
But I want this one here to be a different sort of green.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,620
I'm currently selected on that let's make it a different sort of green.

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,000
I can not because it's all part of the family like saying once you're in the family you're in the family.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,990
So if you wanted to create your metal ball object and to have some different properties between them

30
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,080
or if you wanted to say you know I want to add something for example and I that doesn't influence the

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,000
rest of my object then I need to create a new metal bowl family to do that.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,660
I'm going to just shift a metal bowl click on the bowl.

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,190
You can see by default it is going to call it made a bowl or two.

34
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,620
Now if I want it to not be part of the family I just need a change.

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,560
The first part of this so I will call this for example I metal bowl.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,510
There we go.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm in a bowl and let's see if we can find it's right at the very top.

38
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,360
Now as I move this around it's a different color it hasn't got the same material hasn't got the green

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,970
material and you can see it's not influencing it it's not causing things to change around so I'm going

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,850
to just very quickly make myself and I plop plop plop plop scale it down move it across drop it into

41
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,980
place and you can see that's just sitting on top of my object some other things I wanna show you just

42
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,890
briefly if I was to go and change the name of any bowl that is the parent of my might be green caterpillar

43
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:09,150
here too for example cat pillar if I do that everything disappears it goes crazy it's yelling at me.

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,970
The one original metal bowl that was the very first one we dropped into our scene is staying there it's

45
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,530
happy it knows what's going on but everything else says I no longer have a parent I've become orphaned

46
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,800
if I go to m bowl 0 one and change that to cat to pillow.

47
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,290
I'm spelling that correctly dot Oh wow I'm sure someone will let me know if I'm not one then it says

48
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,670
Oh okay that's my parent right there I know who I am I know what's going on now I'm not gonna go through

49
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,960
and do all that rename me I'm just going to undo that and of course if I go and create a second I met

50
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,920
a ball by duplicating that okay you can see that I've got I met a ball Oh one.

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,930
Okay now these two medals obviously will cause an influence upon one another if I click on say I am

52
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,870
miserable oh one moved over there you can see there's a relationship so those two will obviously affect

53
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,640
each other but they're not affecting the caterpillar the original metabolic and if you want some more

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,980
specifics on this then jump to the blender document that I've linked to you against this lecture that

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,230
gives you just a little bit more information about how medical families work and at this point I have

56
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,780
a challenge for you add or modify your creation by using a second metal bowl family as I have done just

57
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,100
now here's different materials and it's one of those different colors for you different metabolic families

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,010
just so you can see what belongs to what so it doesn't need to be complex it can just be eyeballs as

59
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,690
I've done but it be cool if you add something else just to play around with that second object the medical

60
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,170
family so take on that challenge and I'll see you back here when you're done.

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,270
So to conclude my process I'm just going to click on.

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,520
I met a ball.

63
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:49,250
I will give me new material this material I'm going to call eyeball and I'll make it yellow.

64
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,570
There we go.

65
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,620
Little bit of a cute yellowy metabolic Caterpillar guide going on there.

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,340
And like I said before I could put a lot more love into these eyeballs I could dig out a hole in there

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,830
by using a meadow bowl in the original M bowl family.

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,760
But for now and I'll leave it as is I think I've made my point about how all this works.

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,220
The final point I'll make is just be careful with your naming and your renaming sometimes things go

70
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,740
a little bit crazy.

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,030
So for example if I was to take one of my original metal balls from the caterpillar and say you know

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,200
what let's find let's use this kind of antenna.

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,820
Oh actually I want that to be part of a different family.

74
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,330
I could go into this and change from any bowl I could change it to and 10 eyes eyes but I'm just gonna

75
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,390
go and because I'm not sure I'm spelling it right and remove the 0 0 1 8 because this is now going to

76
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,240
be the parent of the family.

77
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,060
Click on that.

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,260
It now loses its properties but scroll all the way up there.

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,940
Not a problem.

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,590
It's separate.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,160
There's no relationship between this kind of circular bit and the stem that is coming from it which

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,460
is good.

83
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,560
That might be exactly what I want to do but sometimes you might have some issues doing this particularly

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,900
if you accidentally name this and dot whatever it was before 0 2 2.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,610
It's going to disappear because it's saying okay you literally just changed me from M ball dot 0 2 2

86
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,600
I think was our T2 into and or 0 to 2 but I don't have an ant as the parent for me so make sure there's

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,620
always a parent.

88
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,000
If you've got any of the dots you could solve that a couple of ways you just put this back to Ed or

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,710
we could click on one of the other ones and I could say this one here.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,950
Where are we.

91
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,810
Is M. bowl 0 17.

92
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,980
I'm going to make this tree and drink.

93
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,220
And now those two know that there is a relationship between the two of them because this one is now

94
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,260
called and the other one's called Aunt dot.

95
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Oh two.

96
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,780
And they're happy because they're now part of a family again they were kicked out of one family but

97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,560
they found each other they maybe they're husband and wife.

98
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,600
The blobs on top of the antenna are gonna undo that.

99
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,900
So I leave them as green in the original family they will go.

100
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,660
Just wanted to illustrate that last point.

101
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,270
Make sure you're careful with your naming.

102
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,240
So as always I'd love to see what you've come up with.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,460
From this lecture and I will see you in the next lecture.
