Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.240
In this lecture we're going to add multiple cameras to our scene.
2

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.630
The great benefit of having that is you can set up multiple shots and later on we'll learn how to set
3

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.830
up different camera properties as well.
4

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.370
So the shots really do look distinctive as you can see here.
5

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.750
I'm just flicking between two separate renders that I've done and before what we've just simply done
6

7
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.230
is move the camera to a new position and done another render.
7

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.640
But sometimes you'll want the cameras in a very specific location.
8

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.730
And with that in mind let's find out more.
9

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.040
OK so we shall start off here with a default blend scene nice and simple we can see the three objects
10

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.470
in it.
11

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.930
If we press the number pad zero that will move round so we can actually see the view of our active camera.
12

13
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.360
Now we do only have one camera in our scene at the moment.
13

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.480
Now you've probably noticed when we've been adding objects into our scene that one of the objects you
14

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.000
can add is a camera.
15

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.490
Of course you can duplicate one that already exists.
16

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.600
If you want to inherit some properties and if we add another camera into our scene we can see this is
17

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.880
camera 0 0 1 in the outliner.
18

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.430
Now of course we will want to rename those cameras at some point something more appropriate.
19

20
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.060
But for the moment let's whiz out and see where the cameras have been placed.
20

21
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.710
Okay.
21

22
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.330
So it's kind of in the same position as before but facing within our cube.
22

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.540
Now of course we can move that around like any other camera.
23

24
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.500
However if we press the numpad zero we're not looking through that camera.
24

25
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.970
How do we do that.
25

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Well what we do is we go to the View menu and with a camera selected that we want to be the active camera
26

27
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.670
go down to cameras and set active objects as camera.
27

28
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.270
There we go.
28

29
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.430
We're now looking through that second camera only you shift and the grave key to just move around to
29

30
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.830
a different position on our cube and what we can now do is go ahead and render from that of a position.
30

31
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.660
Now I'm going to add something else to the scene.
31

32
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.240
Otherwise it's going to be pretty difficult to work out which side we're looking at our model from.
32

33
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.470
There we go.
33

34
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.460
Now if we press F12 to do  a render it will look like that.
34

35
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.330
And if we switch slots from slot 1 to slot to close my render window then select the other camera.
35

36
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.820
And this time just go control and zero.
36

37
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.490
We should set that as the active camera and then we can press F12 again and we'll get another render
37

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.240
and then we can switch between those two renders with the one and two keys on the top of the keyboard.
38

39
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.120
Pretty useful.
39

40
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.490
So now we can review multiple angles of our model very very quickly.
40

41
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.690
Now another thing that you might be doing is looking at your scene from a slightly different angle.
41

42
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.540
Let's say you're looking at it from over here and you want to move the camera from where it currently
42

43
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.750
is to exactly where you are.
43

44
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.990
And you can do that with control, Alt and the numpad zero.
44

45
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.110
And we can see that the cameras removed from all the way over there to here.
45

46
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.560
And then of course because we're now looking through the camera we may have to tweak its ever so slightly
46

47
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.270
because it won't have the same properties as the viewport itself.
47

48
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.730
That would change dramatically as we move forward.
48

49
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.590
Now we can render out from multiple cameras at the same time.
49

50
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.860
However that's a little bit more involved and we won't be covering that in this section but armed with
50

51
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.080
that knowledge it's time for your challenge okay.
51

52
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.360
So your challenge is to set up three cameras in your chess scene render out to multiple slots on the
52

53
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.650
render view and then finally share your views with the rest of us.
53

54
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.200
Pause the video now and give it a go OK everybody welcome back.
54

55
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.090
Let's go ahead now and set up three cameras and render those views so the first thing to do of course
55

56
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.130
is go to our chess scene with that's open.
56

57
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.130
I'm going to simply need it.
57

58
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.580
Well I'd say simply my camera is hidden at the moment so let's go ahead and turn that on.
58

59
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.860
I'm going to duplicate my camera and I'm going to turn snapping off for the moment and duplicate it
59

60
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.220
again.
60

61
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.360
So I have camera camera 001 and cameras 002
61

62
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.320
So I'm going to go near and far as my two camera types.
62

63
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.070
So I'm gonna make sure I've got the near camera selected.
63

64
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.880
I'm going to need to turn it on and then switch to it being the active camera.
64

65
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.550
So if it's selected control and zero and then we can move it's about.
65

66
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.390
Now this is not going to be the near one.
66

67
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.660
So let's move in.
67

68
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.570
Well that's quite quite vicious the way that's moving.
68

69
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.050
Move it in a little further.
69

70
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.060
Now going to have to dial down the movement speed.
70

71
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060
There we go.
71

72
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.570
So perhaps something like that.
72

73
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.950
And what I am going to do here is I'm going to get my king rotate him on the Z axis slightly so it just
73

74
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.500
looks a bit better.
74

75
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.350
The same here with the knight rotate Z.
75

76
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.270
That just adds a bit more interests of the scene if you can actually see parts of the model Oh and I
76

77
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.570
think I've just found an issue with the bishop rotating that round.
77

78
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.000
I think I've left his notch behind.
78

79
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.800
So if we move him I'm going to look from awful graphic back here.
79

80
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.030
Yes he is being sliced.
80

81
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.830
We can see that.
81

82
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.900
So that this is now the time to really solidify that so let's put him back into the appropriate position
82

83
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.770
and focus on him.
83

84
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.220
Yes.
84

85
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.670
Here we go.
85

86
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.100
So with it moved back into position we can see that the notch is there we just need to make sure as
86

87
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.340
parented correctly I'm not going to apply it at the moment I still want to be able to adjust that if
87

88
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.730
I want to later also need to find my bishop and also the notch the notches aren't part of the bishops
88

89
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:50.320
themselves so going to make the notches visible again select this notch here, I can see it's notch 001 okay
89

90
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:59.950
and this is the bishop to so notch  0 0 1 I'm gonna drag on top of the bishop black and now it's a parent
90

91
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:07.630
and I need to remember to probably keep the transform as well so let's just go back select each one
91

92
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.290
the parent and I'm going to keep the transform in the menu and I want to do the same over here parent
92

93
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.920
keep transform.
93

94
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.770
Okay now I can hide those notches once again and I can move this piece back to where it was before which
94

95
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.190
I can't remember I think it was just in this one here let's look through the camera again and yes we
95

96
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.640
got a notch in the scene.
96

97
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.500
Perfect.
97

98
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.830
I'm going to do that round slightly so it's not exactly the same as if it had been picked up Okay I'm
98

99
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.600
liking the look of that camera view.
99

100
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:47.710
Okay let's have a look now at the far view so i'm going to set that as the active camera control and 0
100

101
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.580
to do so because it would be the same as the other one for the moment and I can lift that up to about
101

102
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.040
here I think.
102

103
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.050
Perfect.
103

104
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.890
So now with a three cameras set up and I think I'm probably going to have to do similar sorts of thing
104

105
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.460
to this bishop here.
105

106
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.230
Yes.
106

107
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.250
I can't apply at the moment either because it's a multi user data we'll get to that later on.
107

108
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.400
So let's move him back to where he was previously and now you can see hiding your cameras can be useful.
108

109
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.700
I've got them all set up I can just hide them out of view for the moment.
109

110
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.060
There we go.
110

111
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.110
Our notch is back.
111

112
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:31.590
So we need to find those other notches and unhide them do a tiny bit of parenting and hide them back
112

113
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.540
away again.
113

114
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.360
Perfect.
114

115
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.700
Final thing move this back to its previous position which I think was there.
115

116
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.670
Okay let's go back to the camera view.
116

117
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.900
Perfect.
117

118
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.110
OK.
118

119
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.120
So I'm going to render the near one out first since it's currently there so i'm just going to press F12
119

120
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.820
when I go back to my scene and let's have a look the other camera.
120

121
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.890
So we've done far let's do near next.
121

122
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.000
So I'm gonna select it and turn it on so I can easily select it.
122

123
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.990
There we go.
123

124
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.240
Control and zero as active and render.
124

125
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.190
So I forgot to switch slots there very easy mistake to make.
125

126
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.170
Let's go to slots.
126

127
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:16.660
So before we do anything else you're back to camera fast that is active render.
127

128
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.730
Now if the render window doesn't pop up that's because I didn't shut it down previously and there we
128

129
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:21.900
go.
129

130
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:30.440
We've got vats and also Slot Three and if I come back now I can go ahead go to our original camera control
130

131
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.670
and zero and F12 to render and there we go.
131

132
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.790
Now one thing to bear in mind is you can change how the rendering is happening at the moment under display
132

133
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.500
mode.
133

134
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.330
We can have full screen image editor new window or keep the user interface.
134

135
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
I prefer it coming up in the new window.
135

136
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.860
I'm not on a multi monitor setup at the moment but typically I would be and that would just come up
136

137
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.640
on the other window on the other screen which is always very useful.
137

138
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.240
Full screen is also another valid one but I find it just gets in the way with my usual workflow.
138

139
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.040
Okay.
139

140
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.130
So now we've got all three of those ready and we can go through them with the one two and three key.
140

141
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.020
Perfect.
141

142
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.640
So I'm finally just going to save these in my renders folder and there we go.
142

143
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.790
All saved and ready to share.
143

144
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.360
I'm really looking forward to seeing how your renders have come on in the next lecture we start playing
144

145
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.000
with the cameras themselves to give them a bit more interest especially if you're close up or far away
145

146
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.500
you can actually change the overall feel by adjusting some of the camera's properties and I'll see you
