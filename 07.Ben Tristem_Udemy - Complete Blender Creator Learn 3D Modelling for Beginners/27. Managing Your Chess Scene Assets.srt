00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,570
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,460
In this lecture we're going to talk about managing our chess scene assets at the moment.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,410
I feel like things are getting a bit skewed and things are getting a bit messy as well.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,180
I think we're fine within the blend file itself however outside I think it's not looking as good as

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,480
it could be.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,810
And let me explain why.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,690
First of all we've got our texture.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,210
Let's have a look at this half figured Rosewood pixel 128 Tiff.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,380
Okay.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,560
You may have a pinky if you've loaded from the resources themselves.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's have a look at the file system.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
So we're within my file system at the moment into the chess set models.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,460
OK.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,990
Let's go into models and we've got these extra things here.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,230
The arm parts of the models and also where is that texture.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,910
So this is an issue that you'll run into lots especially with a bigger projects.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,450
You download a texture from the Web you apply it to your model and two years later or three days later

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,630
you come back to your model and it can no longer be found and you end up with a pink model and you don't

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,400
know why.

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,020
Or it could just be one really important texture in a scene and that can be incredibly frustrating especially

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,120
if you're working between multiple computers as well.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,630
It can just fall apart at that point.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,950
So with our models I'm going to also have textures.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,360
So let's go ahead create a new folder called textures and we need to think about our pieces and scenes.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,680
That's what I'm going to go for here.

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,070
Let's zoom back out.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,680
We've got our reference images models and I'm going to also add a folder at this level called render

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,180
or perhaps even renders would be better.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,750
So we've got some well that we can put this chest scene that we've rendered out so I'm going to cut

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,610
that and put it into renders he probably get what I'm going at here.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,380
Things aren't really organized particularly well at the moment.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,630
In fact at this point we could probably put everything else in a pieces and even get rid of the mapping

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,590
and test piece potentially as well because they are just archive bits and bobs up as a name for our

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,240
folder isn't it archive.

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,080
So these are the folders that I would recommend at the moment.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,780
Of course it would depend on what type of projects you're working on.

37
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm going to move my mapping and test PS into the archive.

38
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm going to have another folder called pieces and textures is always going to be at this top level

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,840
at the moment.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
So what I'd like you to do is your small micro challenge for this particular lecture is to go ahead

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,340
and organize your folder.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,140
I'd also like you to put your texture that you're using for your board into that textures folder.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,790
Make sure it's named something appropriately and then go back into a blender and reeling kits at that

44
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,830
particular folder that you're working on Paul's video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome

45
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,010
back.

46
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,500
So this is pretty straightforward for me to start doing.

47
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,310
I'm going to not open them all up.

48
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,030
Okay so the pawns can end up in the piece is the bishop.

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,230
The board is now an archive piece because we're working on the board directly in the chess scene.

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,840
And then the chess piece base can go in the pieces as well.

51
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,730
Okay so that's starting to look pretty good.

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm going to go in to my blender folder now and pull out the appropriate texture.

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,430
I'm going to just split the screen here.

54
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,920
I think that's the easiest way of doing that.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,340
Here we go.

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,410
So within that folder itself and the piece of wood I've got is this one here.

57
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,960
Figured Rosewood now I could drag the other two across at the same time but we're simply not using them

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,490
at the moment.

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,180
So that would be a waste to do that.

60
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,540
So let's put it into textures.

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,200
I don't want to take it out because this is my other repository so textures that's absolutely fine.

62
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,720
And I'm going to load back up blender going to my chest scene go to figured rosewood and this time.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,470
Go ahead and open and go to the other place that we're working on.

64
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:29,430
So I know I'm going to get there quickly going through this way model's textures figured Rosewood.

65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,760
Okay.

66
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,160
And then finally we do need to check it's working don't just assume it is.

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,140
And there we go.

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,370
Everything's all back up and running.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,940
Got to make sure I save my work and we're done.

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,410
Brilliant.

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,710
How did you guys get some have you gone for a different folder structure.

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,630
Remember at this point there's no right or wrong.

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,340
This is one I've come up with at this point in the course.

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,780
You may find that later on if you start let's say exporting these models into unity or unreal or Godot

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,320
you may want a different hierarchy.

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:10,240
The most important thing is being able to be flexible and being able to adapt to changing requirements.

77
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,850
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all over in the next one.
