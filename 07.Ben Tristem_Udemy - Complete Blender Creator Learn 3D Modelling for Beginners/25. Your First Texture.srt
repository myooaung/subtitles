Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:11,200
In this lecture we're going to create the surround for our chess board and apply our first textures
2

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,570
really exciting because this is the start of making our objects look so much better than they've done
3

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,180
before.
4

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,160
Let's go find out more.
5

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,360
Okay so we're going to start off with a much more simple scene than just having the chessboard here
6

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,190
and we've got some construction to do.
7

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,860
And I want to dive straight into these materials.
8

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,160
So we're gonna go ahead and create a new blend file just the default cube but we're going to make a couple
9

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,460
of modifications to that cube I'm going to add a couple of loop cuts around it and then perhaps scale
10

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,430
it out.
11

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,790
So it's a bit more ornate than it would be before.
12

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,240
And the reason for doing that is our chess board is going to be very much like that it's not going to
13

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,670
be a default cube.
14

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,710
So here we go we've got a I suppose a small Mayan pyramid whatever you want to call it but that's the
15

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,170
object we're going to texture and I suggest that you also do something similar.
16

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,080
Rather than sticking with a default cube the next thing we need to do here is go ahead and add a material
17

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,440
to this.
18

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,740
Now it will already have a material assigned.
19

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,580
I'm going to call it wood.
20

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,460
And now that we've got that they are going to click the assigned button and make sure is in fact assigned.
21

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,600
It won't be assigned to anything in particular at the moment because we don't have anything selected.
22

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,020
There we go the entire object now has that material assigned to it.
23

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,460
And if I go to our base color I can change that and we should see it change making sure that we're in
24

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,840
the appropriate view mode.
25

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,990
I'm going to change it to look Dev.
26

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,740
There we go it's gone green I'm going to come out of edit mode for the moment and we can just change
27

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,540
it once more.
28

29
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,070
There we go.
29

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,170
Definitely confirmed that the base color is pink or thereabouts.
30

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,590
OK.
31

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,890
So we need to define the base color using a texture rather than a single color.
32

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,470
We can do that with the little circle next to base color and then we can select on the second column
33

34
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,280
itself.
34

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,220
Image texture.
35

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,780
When we do that the color will disappear for the moment.
36

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,270
In fact it will end up going black color but later on we'll start applying a texture to that and it
37

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,640
will change again.
38

39
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,150
So let's go ahead and click open.
39

40
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,730
You may not see this saying open so let's make this a little wider so we can see what's here.
40

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,750
I'm going to click on open and navigate to the wood textures.
41

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,510
That's a part of this lectures resources.
42

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,120
Let me go ahead.
43

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,070
There you'll see we've got lots of different types of maps in here.
44

45
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,490
And I'm going to focus on these color ones.
45

46
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,880
There's heights maps and normal maps as well.
46

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,840
And we're not going to deal with these particular types of textures in this lecture.
47

48
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm just going to focus on the color itself.
48

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,320
Now for the actual board itself I'm going to probably pick something dark like this Brazilian rosewood.
49

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,590
But for the moment I any of these will do.
50

51
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,950
So I'm going to pick the American cherry at the top and hopefully Yep.
51

52
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,830
Here we go we've got some textures applied.
52

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,470
And this is what I was hoping to see by changing the model we've got this vertical stripes coming down
53

54
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,770
here.
54

55
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,510
Why is this happening.
55

56
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,630
Well there are a couple of reasons why.
56

57
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,090
First of all if we scroll down a little we've got this area here where currently it says flat.
57

58
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,430
And this is the type of projection that this texture is being applied to this model via.
58

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,530
So flat basically is like we're looking from above.
59

60
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,070
The texture is being projected down onto our model from both sides.
60

61
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,760
So we should end up with a good texture of this side and a good texture this side.
61

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,400
But when it comes to any surface that's completely vertical like this straight edge here we get these
62

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,180
vertical lines and that can end up looking horrible.
63

64
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,840
We can get around that by changing flat to a different type of projection.
64

65
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,870
Now as you're doing this you may find blender at the moment may crash in fact for anything to do with textures
65

66
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,070
and rendering that can happen and has done plenty of times in the past.
66

67
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:00,850
So what I'd recommend is as you're working on this particular model you save your work in this play case
67

68
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm just going to call it a test piece it could be whatever you want to call it.
68

69
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,200
And I'm going to save my blender file and then before I make a change I'm going to make sure I save.
69

70
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,130
And that's just a good thing to do in general.
70

71
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,980
See here if I change it from flat to box.
71

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:23,200
Now its as if the object itself has a box around it and you may be now looking at it and going
72

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,890
oh Mike it looks worse.
73

74
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,250
Why is that.
74

75
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,890
Why is flat working and box has gone worse in theory should be better because these textures are being
75

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,330
projected from all angles at this point so we shouldn't end up with these vertical lines.
76

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,160
So we need to have a look at this area here where it says vector.
77

78
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,150
At the moment it's set to default which is why this is looking pretty horrible.
78

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,670
However if we click on that we get lots and lots of options.
79

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,920
And we can also make it disappear the ones that we're looking for are under texture coordinate we are
80

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,820
telling the texture which coordinates it maps to.
81

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,460
Now later on in the course we'll cover UV unwrapping and mapping and that's what you can say precisely
82

83
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,860
where the texture will appear on a model for the moment though we don't need to worry about that we
83

84
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,990
can even use generated or objects both of them tend to work really well.
84

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,630
Let's try.
85

86
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,980
Object first and we can see here the texture is repeating itself a lot as we go through that doesn't
86

87
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,160
look ideal does it it is repeating the texture lots and not in an ideal way so let's see what generated
87

88
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,080
it ends up looking like.
88

89
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,690
In this particular case generated is going to look a lot better.
89

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,200
Excellent.
90

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,440
And we could see here that it's mapped it as if it was being projected from multiple angles which is really
91

92
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,890
really useful.
92

93
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,510
Now if you do find that it's not making much sense what you can do is increase this blend level and
93

94
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,870
then when you have two separate areas and that's this slope here it's a mixture of the front and the
94

95
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,680
side you can increase the blend there to try and blend between the two different projections and that
95

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,020
can make things look a lot better.
96

97
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,040
I think in this particular model it's not going to make too much difference.
97

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,130
And there we go.
98

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,060
That is our first texture applied to our model in a very very simple way.
99

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,470
And now it's time for you to apply your texture to your model in the form of a challenge Okay so your
100

101
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,120
challenge will come in two parts.
101

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,970
Firstly I'd like you to go ahead and make a surround for your chessboard at the moment.
102

103
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:34,170
It's just a 64 squares we really want something around it and we can to apply a texture to it.
103

104
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,830
So go ahead pick a texture from the provided wood pack so you'll find that over in the lecture resources
104

105
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,160
and then apply the texture to the board using what we've learned in this lecture pause video now and
105

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,900
give that a go
106

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,430
Hello everybody and welcome back.
107

108
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:59,160
Let's go ahead now hop into blender and make our surround and apply the texture to it okay everybody
108

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,880
welcome back.
109

110
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,800
The first thing that I'm going to do here is go in and edit my chessboard.
110

111
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,540
So let's go ahead.
111

112
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,270
I'm going to tab in and I've been playing with this and you may want to check this yourself as well.
112

113
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,850
When we're in face select mode.
113

114
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,980
If you select one of your faces.
114

115
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,630
Look at that it detaches from the other.
115

116
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,260
In fact if I press the L key to see what's linked it happens to be groups of four.
116

117
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:33,120
So the first thing I'm going to do here is select everything and press F3 and search for all doubles
117

118
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,730
and remove them.
118

119
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,480
And here we go.
119

120
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,680
We've removed 63 vertices and we should now find that the whole match is linked together.
120

121
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,170
Excellent.
121

122
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,260
The next thing is about this perimeter here another a couple of ways of working on that.
122

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,780
The first one is to actually duplicate the board and then just leave the perimeter around the edge dissolving
123

124
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,500
the multiple edges that you would have in between in order to get there.
124

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,640
Now I'm not gonna take that step because I know the dimensions of all of these squares.
125

126
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:11,640
So all I need to do is go shift and S moving the cursor back to the world origin and add in another
126

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,280
bit of mesh data a plane.
127

128
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,180
And I believe it's going to be forty eight centimeters across.
128

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
Boom straight away.
129

130
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,770
Now we've got this horrible effect going on.
130

131
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,400
And this is something that catches a lot of people out.
131

132
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,940
This is called Z fighting.
132

133
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,220
This is where two things are trying to display at the same time because they're literally on top of
133

134
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,700
each other.
134

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,750
They're occupying the same space.
135

136
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:41,070
If I was to press the Z key and go into lookDev mode we can see it looks absolutely horrible.
136

137
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,250
And sometimes this happens if you do have a place holder in place and an actual model and especially
137

138
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:54,180
if you forget to turn off the rendering option over in the outline itself that can cause these type
138

139
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,970
of issues.
139

140
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,310
But for the moment with that surface selected I'm going to go G Z minus one centimeter and because I've
140

141
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,730
got the scene sets up in centimeters that's all sorted.
141

142
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,570
I can now extrude just the edges up.
142

143
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,390
I don't want the face selected I just want the edges.
143

144
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,070
This is go round to the bottom.
144

145
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,870
And this is a bit awkward having to work around this board on top.
145

146
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,440
So what I can do is just clear all selections and I'm gonna go ahead and pressing the L key select all
146

147
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,490
linked surfaces on the top and just like before where we could hide an object.
147

148
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,570
Well you can hide faces as well as the H key that saves us a lot of time because now what I can do is I
148

149
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,680
can select these edges very quickly.
149

150
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm going to extrude them up on the Z axis by one centimeter and then I'm going to delete the face that's
150

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,250
there by deleting that face I can now select the edge loop very quickly I'm going to extrude it by nothing
151

152
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,310
and then scale it outwards.
152

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,130
Now at this point you can completely ad lib what you're doing.
153

154
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,180
Again I'm going to extrude by nothing, scaling outwards and then move it down on the Z axis.
154

155
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,640
Then I'm going to extrude on the z axis by maybe minus two centimeters minus three.
155

156
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,010
Yeah.
156

157
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,870
And then fill in the face with the F key so we've got all basic board we can now go round and add a bit
157

158
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,910
of detailing in if you wanted to do that you could do that would loop cuts this bottom face by the way
158

159
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,750
I want to move down so I'm gonna go G Z and just move it down a little bit further because then I can
159

160
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,770
add in some decent loop cuts around the edge.
160

161
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,300
I didn't want to add one in there, Let's undo that let's add in two.
161

162
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,300
Excellent.
162

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,990
With the S key we're going to scale in.
163

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,310
Okay that's fine.
164

165
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,940
I'm going to set this face loop running around the edge extrude by nothing and then scale that in, Of course
165

166
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,510
we could scale that out if we want it as well and it's up to you how you embellish this and then we
166

167
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,060
go Alt and H and make sure that we can see the board as well and how it looks all.
167

168
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,660
Now I think that's probably alright.
168

169
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,310
I'm going to lower this edge here just a little to select the edge the running round and go G,G and
169

170
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,930
bring that down looks good.
170

171
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,370
Longer run a little edge loop around here and lift that back up again.
171

172
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,040
Perfect.
172

173
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,840
Okay.
173

174
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,870
The other thing that I want to do here is make sure there's a little bit of a recess around the board
174

175
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,290
itself.
175

176
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,970
So once again I'm going to clear my selection press the L key and hide the board itself and grab this
176

177
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,100
and scale it out ever so slightly not by much.
177

178
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,600
Then I'm going to go alt and H and see how that's looking.
178

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,370
I think that's about right.
179

180
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,710
If we go into rendered mode we should see that gap in full effect.
180

181
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,210
Yes I can see the gap running around the edge.
181

182
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,520
So the final thing to do here is extrude the board itself down.
182

183
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,240
So going to make sure I've only got the board selected and then extrude down.
183

184
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,350
Now you remember we extruded by just a centimeter before so minus one and
184

185
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,200
there we go.
185

186
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,300
We've got the board itself extruded down so not going to end up with some horrible floating artifact
186

187
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,700
around the edge here.
187

188
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,290
So there we go we've got the base layer all sorted.
188

189
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,040
The next thing we need to do is add an appropriate material.
189

190
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,070
Let's make this a bit wider here and bring this bit up.
190

191
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,460
So we've currently got the material white squares that looks like what the surround is made from.
191

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,240
I can just press the L key and select all of that.
192

193
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Now I didn't clear my selection first.
193

194
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,530
I don't trust that I've actually got everything selected that I wanted selected I'm going to add a new
194

195
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:39,120
material called it wood I'm going to assign that and then just quickly check with the base color that
195

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
that is in fact right.
196

197
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,370
Okay.
197

198
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,780
So we've got those bits all done and I'm just looking around my model and this extra loop cut that we've
198

199
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,440
added in isn't adding anything to our model at this point.
199

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,190
So I'm going to go G.G. and move it down slightly and then scale this out.
200

201
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,290
There we go.
201

202
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,400
So I think that's probably a bit big as well so I'm going to hop into wireframe mode from the side so
202

203
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:11,350
I can select everything and I'm going to select all of this and scale it up on the Z axis and then move
203

204
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,040
this all up on the Z axis as well.
204

205
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,490
And that should look a bit more in proportion now than it did before.
205

206
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,690
Yes I'm liking that.
206

207
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,370
OK.
207

208
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,170
So our base colour we need to replace with an image.
208

209
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,810
I'm going to go into my images I'm going to open up the Brazilian rosewood I think that's what I'm going
209

210
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,770
to pick.
210

211
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,260
So make sure I've gone to my recent folders here kind of go to thumbnails so I can see what's going
211

212
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,500
on this Brazilian rosewood is really dark all the other Rosewood here is quite nice as well.
212

213
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,940
Mm hmm.
213

214
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,900
Lots of choice.
214

215
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,250
I'm going to stick.
215

216
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,730
I'm going to go for the figured rosewood with this time round.
216

217
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:55,270
So we've got our texture applied before I do anything else I'm going to save my work I should have saved
217

218
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,360
it before I did that.
218

219
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,660
So that could a crash blender the next thing I'm going to go and do is go to my vector and set it is
219

220
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,080
generated for the moment and just see how that's looking.
220

221
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,260
Okay.
221

222
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,130
Textures looking a bit large on the board itself but we'll find out how to sort that's out in the bit.
222

223
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,120
We've got the straight lines going down here so I'm going to go from flat to boxed and then we should
223

224
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,160
get it flowing better around the model.
224

225
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,990
Now I know objects didn't work before on our simple objects but let's see how it looks.
225

226
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,720
On this board itself that looks a bit better how it's flowing the texture around.
226

227
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's just go back to generate it so it doesn't flow as well on generated as it does on objects.
227

228
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,730
This does flow around the model much much better awesome.
228

229
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,550
So I'm pretty happy with how that's works out as I say this textures is a bit big we can learn about
229

230
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:52,790
mapping in the next lecture where we can start changing the size of our wood texture and finally what
230

231
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,040
we can do here is quickly turn on our pieces and see how it looks now.
231

232
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,690
I did pick the dark wood so you could see reflections and that is what we should be able to see if we
232

233
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:10,130
just go to our roughness tab and there we go it's going to need to be quite low maybe point 1 or so.
233

234
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,070
And there we go we can see the reflections in the wood itself.
234

235
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,150
Perfect.
235

236
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,140
How are your boards coming along.
236

237
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,750
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
