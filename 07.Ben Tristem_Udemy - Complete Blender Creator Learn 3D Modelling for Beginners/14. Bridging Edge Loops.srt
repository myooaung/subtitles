Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,410
In this lecture we're going to discuss bridging edge loops.
2

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,370
Now the pawn you see in front of you is not the same pawn we've been working on.
3

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,940
I just went in and very quickly used a tool called bridging edge loops to make such a porn from a single
4

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,040
circle.
5

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:27,100
So this is another way of creating our models and it has the benefits of where two objects before we're
6

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
joined together.
7

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,370
There is now no intersecting geometry.
8

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:37,400
This does not pass inside itself but we can repair other models as well so that doesn't happen.
9

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,510
Let us dive into a default blend file and find out more.
10

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,230
Okay so wit our default cube in front of us here.
11

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:51,490
If I go into edit mode because bridging edge loops is an edit mode operation and duplicate my cube and
12

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:58,870
just move it over here what we can do is we can select a series of edges that we want to join together
13

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,720
so we can select this edge here and let's say this top one here.
14

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,800
Now I've been deliberate on selecting edges of course we could have just selected these two faces as
15

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,920
well because when you select all of the edges that make up a face you naturally select the face as well.
16

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,760
So now that we've got these two faces selected I'm going to press F3 and search for bridging edge loops
17

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,330
or bridge edge loops.
18

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,130
When I press enter you can see they join straight away.
19

20
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,800
That's pretty awesome.
20

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,830
Now what else can we do.
21

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,030
Well we can open up the operator panel and we can see here we've got a couple of options.
22

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,770
We can merge them together.
23

24
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,970
That's kind of cool isn't it.
24

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,390
That makes a much different object but it also distorts the very top.
25

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,160
But what we can do there is we can add a series of cuts into smooth that out.
26

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,990
We can change the blend path as well so we can make it linear with more cuts throughout it like it was
27

28
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,920
before we can do a blend path.
28

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,250
We can do a blend surface it tries to smooth out the surface itself and of course we can change the
29

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,160
profile as it goes through as well.
30

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,350
And the profile shape.
31

32
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,600
That's pretty awesome for making some ducting or pipe work between two sections.
32

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,130
Very very useful.
33

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,890
The other thing that we can do here is we can add a slight twist if you want to.
34

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,390
Now you can see there it changes quite dramatically because we're on a low poly state so twisting it
35

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,960
around makes a huge difference.
36

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,470
So is perhaps not what we're looking for here but the other thing bridging edge loops can do is not
37

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:37,720
only join two surfaces like this but say we had inset this surface here and this surface over here.
38

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,140
If we select both of those sets of edges and bridge edge loops we can actually make a hole through something.
39

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,750
So that's again really really useful if you need to do that through an object.
40

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,090
If you put two circles either side you can punch through a hole in your model that is pretty awesome.
41

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,130
This is coming together to quite a nice little exercise here right.
42

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,620
The next thing that I wanted to discuss with bridging loops is how they can help you overcome intersecting
43

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,700
geometry.
44

45
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,280
So first of all what is intersecting geometry.
45

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,570
So let's go ahead.
46

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,730
Whilst in one object so it can be with multiple mesh objects.
47

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:23,770
But if we just take a single mesh object as an example and add in a cylinder and let's move it up here.
48

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,000
This geometry is intersecting with itself.
49

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,340
So if we go into wireframe mode and have a look through our model we can see that this geometry goes
50

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,040
inside another bit of geometry.
51

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,890
Now depending on what you're doing that will leave a matter or it will not.
52

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,130
And it can matter for two distinct reasons.
53

54
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,700
The firstly is this would break something.
54

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,540
So if we wanted to 3D printing the model that you can see in front of us here it wouldn't work it would
55

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,630
fail.
56

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,710
It's a non manifold object.
57

58
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,510
It has bits inside of itself.
58

59
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,930
And in general that's the main reason why you'd want to watch out for intersecting geometry is that
59

60
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,610
it means that you will not be able to,
60

61
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:13,330
Let's say in this case 3D print this model, you may also be unable to do certain physics calculations
61

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,720
or particle effects.
62

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,300
If your models are actually within each other.
63

64
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,760
So that's something to bear in mind.
64

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,820
Now you could use a boolean operation to make these things stick together as one whole object that is
65

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,800
always one option but that also creates a ton of extra geometry as well.
66

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,020
But these are separate at the moment we kept them as separate so I can just go ahead and delete that
67

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,310
extra bit of geometry and I wanted to just come in here select these two faces, inset them and bridge
68

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,730
loops and there you go we've got another hole in the top perhaps a vent remember you can inset multiple
69

70
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:56,290
faces at the same time with the top and bottom selected I'm going to inset and then I'm going to bridge
70

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,860
edge loops and we get a nice hole through and of course if you then selected these faces and these inner
71

72
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:10,320
faces and did a similar operation here we should find that it puts a box through the middle.
72

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,880
That's pretty awesome.
73

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,900
There's lots of fun to be had with bridging edge loops.
74

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,640
So the final example I want to show you is when you do have something that is intersecting what can
75

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,570
you do.
76

77
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,360
Well let's add in another cube because when you're bridging edge loops you have to have a similar set
77

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,470
of edges to bridge.
78

79
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,380
So let's go ahead shift this up ever so slightly.
79

80
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,170
Now there is intersecting and we can see that's the case.
80

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,270
I'm going to scale it down and still place it roughly inside the other model.
81

82
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,090
So what can we do here to make sure that these end up being bridged together you get real geometry from
82

83
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,230
the results.
83

84
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,720
So the first thing is going into wireframe mode to see if there's any intersecting geometry and there
84

85
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,170
is in this case we've got this face.
85

86
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,410
Can I select it.
86

87
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,600
Hopefully I'll be able to select it.
87

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,500
There we go.
88

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,420
And this face of a ones that really need bridging.
89

90
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,780
So if I come out into solid shade, hold down shift and I can select that edge.
90

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,290
So those are the two that really need bridging together.
91

92
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,580
Now it's not coming to a point so we don't need to delete any extra information but when it's like that,
92

93
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,440
what we can then do is think carefully about where we want to join.
93

94
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,150
So with both of those faces selected what we can then do is press F3 search for bridge edge loops.
94

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,820
And there we go.
95

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,120
They are now joined together and we can check that by placing your cursor over a bit of geometry and
96

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
pressing the L key we can now see that they are linked.
97

98
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,820
If I was to undo that and press the L key you can see they're still separated.
98

99
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:47,370
So having one contiguous mesh like that is a good sign that you haven't got geometry inside of itself
99

100
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,760
is not certain but it's a good test right.
100

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,960
So we've played with the three dimensional objects and joining those together.
101

102
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,320
There is one final way that you can use this to your advantage.
102

103
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,970
I'm just going to get rid of all the vertex data that we've got there and I'm going to add in instead
103

104
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,270
of a anything else I'm going to add in a circle.
104

105
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,940
Now circle doesn't have any faces on it.
105

106
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,180
So this is going to be a pure edge loop, I'm going to make it eight.
106

107
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,560
Much like our pieces are and you can see from this.
107

108
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,740
This is how you could potentially whilst in edit mode duplicate.
108

109
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,440
Lift up, scale in, duplicate.
109

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:31,110
Lift up, scale out, duplicate, lift up, scale in, if we select all of those edges and bridge edge loops.
110

111
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,400
We get ourselves a shape really quickly.
111

112
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,520
So this is one construction method if you chose to use it that you could make your models with, pretty
112

113
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,220
awesome how we managed to get that far.
113

114
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,500
But what you can also do with things like this is very much like the box scenario earlier I can duplicate
114

115
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,020
that.
115

116
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,910
I've got a new set of edges I'm going to lift them up I can rotate them on the X axis by 45 degrees.
116

117
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,820
I can then duplicate it move it over on the Y axis for instance and rotate it on the X axis by 45 degrees
117

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,810
just to make a 90 degree turn and then of course I can adjust them accordingly to make sure it flows
118

119
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,760
round as you'd expect it to.
119

120
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,790
And then I can select all of those edge loops and then bridge them, So bridge edge loops.
120

121
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,300
There we go.
121

122
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,030
Now I might want to turn up the number of cuts and this is starting to look like a bit of industrial
122

123
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,960
pipe work.
123

124
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,900
And remember you can change with the profile factor as it goes round if you want a more higgledy piggledy
124

125
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,510
look.
125

126
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,090
And of course you can play with some of the other options like the profile shape if you keep it linear,
126

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,110
if you make it a route, if you make it smooth throughout.
127

128
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,410
Of course if you introduce more and more cuts you can get a much smoother profile but just bear in mind
128

129
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,470
it really should match the rest of your model.
129

130
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:57,210
So in this case I would say about three two or three cuts matches the base level of geometry.
130

131
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,580
You run the risk of course if you had too much geometry up here it makes the whole model uneven and
131

132
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,100
it doesn't look the same.
132

133
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,670
That's a pretty awesome shape.
133

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,220
So now that we've covered bridging loops it's time for your challenge. Okay.
134

135
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,230
So your challenge I'd like you to first of all finish off the pawn.
135

136
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,770
Now some of you might be saying well Mike is finished off isn't there.
136

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:24,070
It looks like it but there were a couple of things that I want to make sure that this pawn has additional
137

138
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,450
specifications as it were.
138

139
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,640
And this will apply to all of the other pieces as well.
139

140
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,660
Make sure the model is a contiguous mesh.
140

141
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,490
I don't want different parts of the model to be selectable.
141

142
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,310
I want it to be one continuous mesh throughout.
142

143
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,340
And finally no intersecting geometry.
143

144
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,900
This will make sure that if later on we decide to 3D print our models we have that sorted.
144

145
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,890
If you've got geometry inside itself it will just fail.
145

146
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,240
Suppose a video now and finish off your pawn
146

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,760
Okay everybody, Welcome back.
147

148
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,680
Let's go ahead now and finish off the pawn.
148

149
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,190
Okay so we've got on my funky it reminds me a bit of a gramophone actually if I scale this one out.
149

150
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,640
Anyway right.
150

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,170
So let's save that as a gramophone.
151

152
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,060
But elsewhere I'll just pop it in my documents.
152

153
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,310
OK.
153

154
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,820
So back to the pawn that we've been working on.
154

155
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,380
I'm liking the look of it so far.
155

156
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,990
Problem of course is it does have intersecting geometry but this is one of those bits of intersecting
156

157
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,290
and geometry that we're going to have to remove something from first.
157

158
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,590
So I'm going to remove this vertex at the bottom.
158

159
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,850
That will leave us a separated mesh that then we can join together.
159

160
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,650
So let's go ahead and do that make change making sure we select the right edge loops.
160

161
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,420
There we go.
161

162
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,960
F3 bridge edge loops.
162

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,070
Now you probably noticed that blender remembers what you searched for last.
163

164
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,450
Which is incredibly useful.
164

165
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:02,330
And let's just have a look at the overall shape and feel of our model turn back on my image and I'm
165

166
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,640
going to pop my model into wireframe so I can see, now you can't do it by just changing the rendering
166

167
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,400
of the viewport it's an object property. So let's scroll down viewport display and display as a wire.
167

168
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,540
Oh and switch this to lookdev so I can see my texture and then I get an appreciation of how this
168

169
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,600
object to the top is working.
169

170
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,740
Now of course I can't select individually anymore.
170

171
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,670
So actually the way that I've done things there the order in which I've done things has meant that I
171

172
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,770
cannot do the quick change that I wanted to do by just selecting all linked geometry.
172

173
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,620
So what's I'm going to do instead is select the top vertex and just hold down control and the numpad
173

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,530
plus you can also use select and select more and less if you wanted to.
174

175
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm going to go control and plus plus plus plus plus and that one there and I'm just going to scale
175

176
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:01,480
that down ever so slightly and then go G Z and bring it down as well, Then i'm going to turn the display back off to
176

177
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,940
see textured so I can see it again.
177

178
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,730
And there we go.
178

179
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,690
Now I think I also need to bring down this edge slightly so I am going to do that and probably scale
179

180
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,330
it in at the same time, In fact if I scale into around there.
180

181
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,020
That means the edge is superfluous.
181

182
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,770
I don't need it anymore if it's in line.
182

183
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,560
Mm hmm.
183

184
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:27,430
Now there is an option for me what I'm gonna do instead is I'm going to scale that in even further and
184

185
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,220
then just lift it up a little bit more.
185

186
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,780
There we go.
186

187
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,060
And then alter this edge loop here just a little by shifting up okay.
187

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,180
Let's come out.
188

189
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,250
Hide my image at the back into object mode and have a look around my model.
189

190
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,470
Now of course when you're looking around your model do remember you've got different shading options.
190

191
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,840
If we turn back to solid we also have the option of MatCap which is really useful it really helps
191

192
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,390
bring out the shape of your objects and we can click this little sphere here to pick different objects
192

193
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,190
you will often see people in their sculpting using this one here which is a clay type.
193

194
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,580
It's a very matt color but it helps you see the form and shape of your objects.
194

195
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,420
And of course you could pick something else here if you wanted a bit more funky or glossy but that won't
195

196
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,730
affect the end result when we render.
196

197
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,180
That's just how we're looking at it now in the viewport almost like my standard one just here.
197

198
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,850
I'm pretty happy with that.
198

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,570
Okay.
199

200
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,780
How are you guys getting on.
200

201
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,090
Have you managed to make your object completely sealed as one mesh with no intersecting geometry.
201

202
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,000
Did you struggle to do that.
202

203
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,760
Let us know in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
