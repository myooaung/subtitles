00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to extracting image data.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.070
So can we extract this shadow.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.300
There are a couple ways that come to the top of my mind that we could do.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.250
This is a rather arduous one we could take the background image and map it to an object that is visible

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.950
in the render.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.610
But that can cause no end of issues especially if we're animating things can change rather rapidly and

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.330
you'd have to remap every frame no good there would be a better way of doing that now because we have

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.430
all of the 3D data to make a comparison scene.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.460
We can go about and do that we can create another render layer for comparison without the object and

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.220
therefore without the shadow as well.

11
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.090
Now we can create just the shadow on its own however that can cause issues where the shadow appears

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.340
on top of our plane rather than underneath it.

13
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.520
And finally we do need to consider the order of these layers and by layers I'm not specifically talking

14
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.830
about the render layers but we are going to have our background image the render layer with everything

15
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.370
on and the render layer for comparison.

16
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
So we've got those three layers if we combine them in the wrong way.

17
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.110
Now there's not going to be too many permutations with three of them but if we combine the wrong way

18
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.890
you're not going to get the desired result and we'll play with that and see what we get.

19
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.820
So let's see if we can go extract that shadow and hop on over in a blender.

20
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.630
Right so we have our f 22 on top of the runway here.

21
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.640
And that's looking pretty good apart from the fact it doesn't really have any presence with there being

22
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.810
no shadow.

23
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.630
Now how are we going to go about doing this.

24
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.120
Well first of all let's think very carefully about how we've currently got this set up and what is really

25
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.320
happening.

26
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.180
So we have this image of the plane on the rim with a shadow and it's being masked out by just the plane.

27
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.570
We have a look at that's on the backdrop.

28
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.700
We see that it's just an alpha we anything that's just this plane will show through when we mix them

29
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.360
together and the black would mean anything.

30
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.130
That's not this plane.

31
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.770
It's part of this background image will show an order does matter.

32
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.900
Some going to get rid of the viewer there for the moment and turn off the backdrop if we mix these up

33
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.310
the wrong way you end up offering out the background and leaving the rest of the image.

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.470
So it does make a difference the way order these.

35
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.910
Now when you have other mixed nose We also have an issue with the ordering not only of the inputs to

36
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.880
any mix no but also which makes node comes first now because we're literally dropping this plane on

37
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.480
last.

38
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.910
Was saying this is the last thing to go on.

39
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.590
Stamp.

40
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.700
We put it on top.

41
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.930
That's also going to be the last thing we do later on that nothing passing in front of it.

42
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.100
So we're okay to do that.

43
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.220
So let's go ahead and work on the shadow.

44
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.760
So we're going to need a comparison layer.

45
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.630
And in order to do that we're going to have to go over to the render layers tab and sort that out by

46
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.880
the way I've just moved the background image down because this is the last thing to be going on.

47
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.550
I can just move it up and out of the way.

48
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.160
And I'm going to zoom in a little there so we can see what's going on now.

49
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.430
This is also a great thing to do with multi monitors.

50
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.920
You are not going to be able to show you a multi monitor setup.

51
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.750
You won't be able to see it on a normal screen.

52
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.820
It would look crazy but if you do have a multi monitor set up I would advise going window duplicate

53
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:39.530
window and setting your node editor to a different window and perhaps your this whole area here could

54
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.220
be the picture viewer with a properties panel on the side here.

55
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.250
But we need to create another Rendell air for comparison.

56
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.800
So we've got one render layer and I'm going to call this complete scene because that is what it is it's

57
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.040
not just a render layer it is a complete scene.

58
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.310
I'm going to add a nother render layer which you're going to use for a comparison and I'm going to call

59
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.520
this only ground because that is what I need to compare it with.

60
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.230
Now there are a couple of ways of making this work we could duplicate everything to another layer including

61
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.270
the lamp and completely forget about the plane.

62
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.190
But we don't need to do but what we can do is shift the plane over to another layer like Layer 2.

63
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.190
So with the plane selected I'm going to go to the object properties here and shift it over to layer

64
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.420
to it will disappear from here because in the render Tab we're not including both layers.

65
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.810
I'm going to hold down Shift and select layer.

66
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.930
So so now we can see everything again and we're working on a Only ground just to make sure that is selected.

67
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:48.500
So we've got only ground here but we want to exclude in this one we want to exclude the plane itself

68
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.790
the aeroplane not the plane on the ground how we want to exclude that so when we render them out now

69
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.680
we go render and render we won't see any difference down here just yet.

70
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.420
But now we can have we if we have a look in this red layer we've got this and the complete scene is

71
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.230
only the ground.

72
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.570
And we got only the ground there perfect.

73
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.180
So we will go back to complete scene.

74
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.290
The other thing that we need to make sure is well do we need to pass through an object index.

75
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.480
I don't think we do so will leave unchecked for the moment if we need to do something with the objects

76
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.930
ground and removing that from the scene.

77
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.830
We can do.

78
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.200
But I think we'll be okay.

79
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.220
So we've got and we're going to have to use this render layer here and the other render layer make a

80
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.760
comparison between them in order to do this I could link this down and drag it down and plug it into

81
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.080
a mix.

82
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.520
No but conceptually I'm going to keep that as a completely separate entity so I'm going to introduce

83
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.200
a new input a a layer and I'm going to duplicate that render layer and then set one of them to complete

84
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.560
scene.

85
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.600
And one of them to only the ground.

86
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.230
Now I'm not sure if this is going to be the appropriate order so that we don't have crossed wires.

87
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.020
Does that matter.

88
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.810
Not really.

89
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.030
I'm going to turn on the back drop so I can see what's going on that's what we were looking at last.

90
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.150
And I'm going to add in a colour mix node and I'm going to plug these two entities in.

91
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:14.670
Now if we're looking for a difference between these two layers we can do several things to without the

92
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.730
first thing I thought was a subtract and then we would see the difference between one layer and another.

93
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.650
But what would be nice is if this itself created some sort of mask this does create a mask that's kind

94
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.980
of inverted but it also lightens things.

95
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.950
It lightens the shadow quite considerably.

96
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.400
There's also a difference.

97
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.620
So let's click on difference and it looks exactly the same.

98
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.910
That is the definition of subtracts After all it's the difference between two.

99
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:49.680
After playing for ifit dividing and with these round beat other way gave me a nice shabot and it gave

100
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.990
me a plane that the plane itself doesn't really matter.

101
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.340
The reason why it doesn't matter is because we're going to put a stamp essentially over the top but

102
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.050
in fact because there's a gap underneath the shadow.

103
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.000
My whole argument about not just rendering the shadow out is now null and void because of the position

104
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.070
of the light and everything else.

105
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.830
So in order to make it not meyler Void I'm going to actually place my plane on the ground.

106
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.290
So there is some of the shadow which we can't see.

107
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.070
It's underneath that plane literally underneath.

108
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.810
We've also got these lines going across.

109
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.420
Let's just move this up away so you can focus on the picture we've got a line scooting across here.

110
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:33.330
That is where that plane i.e. the ground plane exists.

111
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.620
And that may cause us a problem that's why I was thinking earlier about we might need to use an object

112
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.120
eidy just for that plane itself to remove it.

113
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.370
But I don't know if I think we can get away with not having it.

114
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.990
So we've divided these together and we get this image coming out looking good so far.

115
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.900
We now need to put all of this back together now before we actually blend anything else together.

116
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.310
We need to blend this background image into this new mix now.

117
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:07.680
So were going to come out of here and into here with another mix now so let's add that in so it's ready

118
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.430
to go and I was going to plop them together.

119
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.640
There we go.

120
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.500
And it's not working at the moment.

121
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.750
That's fine we've got all the mixed nodes we need in place but we need to do some re ordering.

122
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.910
No we don't need to do any reordering that's all ready to go.

123
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.950
Of course now it's time for a challenge.

124
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:32.880
It's time for the final image composite so finish off the notes set up to show the background with the

125
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.260
object placed on it and the shadow of the object.

126
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.150
Consider adding more light if your object is to shadowed.

127
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.110
So you may be like me with the light.

128
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:50.970
The original lighting source in the scene is low on the horizon as it were and so the front is quite

129
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.380
shadowed and I'm going to add inner light as if it was.

130
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.410
Perhaps it's a flash photography or something along those lines.

131
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.660
Now you may need to create another eidy mask for the ground.

132
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.290
Do give it a different pass.

133
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:03.480
None.

134
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.270
If you do sometimes it works apsey fine.

135
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.020
Sometimes you will need that extra I.D. mask.

136
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.520
Complete the final composition and share it with us.

137
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.770
I love seeing you guys work and everybody else like seeing your work too so please make sure you share

138
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.870
your work over on the forum.

139
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.350
Pause a video now and give that a go.

140
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.220
Okay guys welcome back.

141
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.600
Let's go complete our final image composition.

142
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.430
So one thing at a time here let's compartmentalize what we've got going on.

143
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.830
So we've got this this and this all acting together.

144
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.160
I'm going to put them inside a frame and they're creating our shadow.

145
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.830
Then we've got the background image which is all by itself.

146
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.040
And then we're mixing the background image and our newly formed shadow.

147
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.210
And let's see what we get.

148
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.040
I'm going to remove that viewer and remove the backdrop so I can see my nodes more clearly.

149
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.730
So obviously mixing them together is not helping in this respect.

150
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:09.280
And if I move them backwards and forwards Oh are you expected that I would not cross plug in either.

151
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.730
Silly me.

152
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.890
Let's plug it in so we can see what's going on.

153
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.540
So we mix between these will just get a blend between them and that's no good.

154
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.350
That's not what we want.

155
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.050
We want to see all of this on top of this.

156
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.190
Now we have a look at this particular image that's coming out of here.

157
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.580
Just move the factor along.

158
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.370
We've got a lot of white if you remember earlier I was talking about if you've got white that's a value

159
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.390
of one.

160
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:40.010
So if you go ahead and multiply by one you'll get the same background image coming out.

161
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.280
So let's go ahead and do that now.

162
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.920
Ah I'm going to test it in a moment.

163
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.630
But I also think of any values of coming out of here greater than one.

164
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.990
So this pixel here that you can't really see any of these white pixels if they're actually greater than

165
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.140
one in their value you'd be dividing and making the image darker.

166
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.460
Let's see if that makes any difference.

167
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.480
So we need a multiply.

168
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.450
So were multiplied here.

169
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.570
And again it doesn't matter if we can see through our plane at the moment because we have a stamp our

170
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.810
plane back on.

171
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.200
Okay so a multiply next clamp this divide.

172
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.010
KS not making any difference in this particular instance but do bear in mind whenever you are doing

173
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:22.370
a division if a value coming through turns out greater than one it would cause you a problem.

174
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.170
It's not in this case so we're fine.

175
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.620
I'm going to leave it clamped just force.

176
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.530
Just so it's it's right so to speak even though it doesn't seem to be making any difference.

177
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.970
Okay now we need to stamp this on top so let's go ahead and link these two up and plug it in.

178
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.780
Is that done.

179
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.730
I think it might be.

180
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.800
Let's swap these around.

181
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.180
Yeah it's definitely done.

182
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.290
And let's just make sure we can't see through that wing.

183
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.030
We can't.

184
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.330
Okay.

185
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.920
But it's still a bit dark on the front here so what can we do.

186
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.210
I'm going to click on my plane itself and literally add a lamp into the scene and because we're rendering

187
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.690
both scenes it doesn't matter.

188
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:03.640
Well it doesn't need to be on the same layer as our plane ideally otherwise it won't be rendered.

189
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.930
There we go lamp add in a lamp.

190
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.210
Just the point lamp and well that's remenda and see what that comes out as that's probably a little

191
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.380
too close to our plane.

192
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.730
So I'm going to scoot round to the top view.

193
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.920
There's our plane.

194
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.430
And with this again multi monitors here would help massively.

195
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.230
I'm just going to move the lamp.

196
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.840
So it's a way from the plane ever so slightly.

197
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.420
And there we go.

198
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.540
Also render is now kicked back in.

199
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:38.350
And I'm going to turn up the intensity just a little so we're on the lamp we've got it selected it's

200
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.450
in emissions strength 100 less stress strength four thousand.

201
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.780
And that has not updated anything.

202
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.150
So again I'm going to move the lamp by nothing.

203
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.040
And there we go.

204
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.580
That's better it's highlighted the front of our plane.

205
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.360
And of course you can move into different positions to give it a different lighting effects.

206
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.690
I'm going to move it slightly over to the side so we've got more lights coming in from the side just

207
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.220
highlighting those edges.

208
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.290
And then we've got a nice shadow around the edge there.

209
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.410
I'm liking that.

210
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.700
Let's do something funky inside our plane.

211
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.560
You don't have to do anything like this of course I'm going to have a look there select the plane and

212
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.870
use PAD zero and go into perspective mode.

213
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.420
I'm just going to select inside the air intake and add another lamp.

214
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.230
This is just for fun.

215
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.090
I'm going to set that lamp to have.

216
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.030
I don't know a blue colour.

217
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.720
There's that.

218
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.490
That's right render it does that work call.

219
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.200
It doesn't need to have a strength of that maybe a little less.

220
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.380
That's re render.

221
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.120
Let's go a little less once again.

222
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.690
Shame that doesn't auto render at this point there is a little bit annoying.

223
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.550
Let's just try strength for five.

224
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.380
There we go a nice blue glow coming from it.

225
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.470
Realistic no.

226
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.920
Cool.

227
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.600
Yeah.

228
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.000
Why not let's do orange that see how orange comes out.

229
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.100
Yeah that's probably a little metal or better.

230
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.850
Okay this is really noisy at the moment and we are.

231
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:06.140
We need to be careful of is we don't override our blooming shadows that we had here before.

232
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.080
Let's go ahead now and turn up the render details.

233
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.280
I'm not going to bother with it being super high resolution in fact I'm going to make it lower.

234
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.540
I am going to turn up my samples now and turn them up to 50 and re render.

235
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.620
So I've got a shudder there and combined that's very subtle but does have a sort of shudder.

236
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.530
I don't think the shadow itself is strong enough.

237
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.350
In this case I really don't.

238
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.830
So a couple of options we can do there because I dont want to lose the highlighting on my plane.

239
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.390
The first thing I can do is try moving that way perhaps so the light is highlighting the plane isn't

240
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.550
so close.

241
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.200
Maybe it's too close to the ground.

242
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.800
Where is our spot like let's lift that up a little.

243
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.300
Okay that's that's still not doing exactly what I wanted.

244
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.560
Let's go to our sunlamp and increase its intensity because it's at five at the moment it's just try

245
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.460
50 and once again I'm going to move this by zero.

246
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.330
I could have hit 12 as well.

247
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.320
Interesting we've now got a highlight round our plane.

248
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.200
That's not very nice.

249
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.370
So I'm going to turn that back down to 5.

250
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.550
I don't like that at all.

251
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.790
And I'm going to re render.

252
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.100
So there's some fun to be had here we have got a shadow over the back here.

253
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.210
I don't think the shadow I need to move this around I believe or make it weaker and closer.

254
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.320
So we'll go a hundred and move around again.

255
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.720
This is now playing with the scene.

256
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.340
There we go.

257
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.540
That's a bit better.

258
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.540
I'm happy with that.

259
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.700
And it's time to render that out in full and see what it looks like.

260
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.850
In fact I'm going to also go ahead and add some materials to this plane so it doesn't look so dull.

261
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.610
And I'll see you guys back in a moment with the full render.

262
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:55.820
Okay so as I was playing about here with V F 22 I just added a glass cockpit or was about so and I was

263
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.490
just literally playing about how I added a transparent which round the top here and I render that out

264
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.690
and all of a sudden it went like this.

265
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.500
So it does look like we need to exclude the.

266
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.330
Ground plane in our renders.

267
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.690
So we need to go ahead.

268
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.220
That's hop out here.

269
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:18.260
So it's our ground plane and give it an index pass different to our plane and go in and add it into

270
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.610
the appropriate place.

271
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.160
So it's going to be coming out of this in jet in Im there.

272
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.870
But menteith back in index Oh beep.

273
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.900
And I'm going to add that in.

274
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:35.560
Convert her I.D. mask of a pop that in there and there we go but soon so going to take this out.

275
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.190
And now we've not got all of this set up quite yet.

276
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.390
We do need to render.

277
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:48.280
In fact we need to make sure only the ground has the object index because thats the one we once x then.

278
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.470
Now we just need a rerun.

279
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.040
Before we do anything else.

280
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.840
So weve got an owl fillet here lets just check and see what that looks like.

281
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.520
Excellent.

282
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.600
So we need to plug that in.

283
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.970
Where it goes wonky does it go wonky here.

284
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.080
Maybe does a go wonky here.

285
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.320
I think it does.

286
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.610
So we plug that into the factor and then swap these round all this.

287
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.600
This is an odd one here.

288
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.060
Now if not get the indexed pass set to 2.

289
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.410
K. And how that is looking much better now.

290
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.100
Excellent.

291
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.380
I hate it when I forget to flick four index mask to the right value.

292
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.280
Excellent.

293
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:25.770
Thats me.

294
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.060
Done.

295
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.650
Im going to render this out now as my final scenes are going to turn up.

296
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.040
I'm only gonna render it 10 ATP and I'm also going to turn up the render the render samples here to

297
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.510
200 and then just hit render and wait for a bit.

298
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.790
It will take a while to render out.

299
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.060
And there we go.

300
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.600
Excellent.

301
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.400
This has turned out much better than I thought it was going to do from Brasilia.

302
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.270
When that happens.

303
00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.540
How did ewell's come out.

304
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.860
Did you use the same scene and plane as me or did you do something else.

305
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.780
I'd love to see your work and so would everybody else so please make sure you share your work over on

306
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.540
the forum and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
