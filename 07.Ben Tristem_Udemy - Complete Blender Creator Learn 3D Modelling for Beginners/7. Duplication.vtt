00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.700
Now whether you're making a very simple spiral staircase like this or perhaps something a bit more extravagant

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.160
like this well duplication is key to being able to make these things very very quickly.

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.920
Let's go find out some more now before we get going.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.750
I want to go into this well in a little bit more detail because I know some of you will be thinking

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.110
how are we going to make that with what we've learned so far.

7
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.540
Well if we have a closer look and I've left it like this deliberately I don't want to see anybody's

8
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.660
work like this.

9
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.410
We have a look over in the outline.

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.980
Even though is grouped into these separate collections which we'll deal with later on you see here as

11
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.510
well.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.610
If we open up that everything is a cube.

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.590
I think literally everything is a cube if I scroll down here.

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.590
Take this tile for example it is a cube that's been squished down this piece of wood.

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.940
This support again is something that started in originated as a cube and there's lots of detail in here.

16
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.770
There's slats holding up the tiles on the roof.

17
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.370
The tiles are all slightly higgledy piggledy.

18
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.500
I'll show you how to do that as we go through this lecture.

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.690
But the other thing to bear in mind is I'm going to be caught out with this several times I'm sure.

20
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.290
But we need to sorts out on naming right from the very beginning.

21
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.050
If these were called something else like if I click on the tile here if it was actually called tile

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.390
rather than cube dot 1 0 6 I would be able to search for it.

23
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.730
And that would have been really useful because I really wanted to show all of these colored in but I

24
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.290
can't do that now I really can't be bothered going through and selecting each one individually.

25
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.310
Now take a long time to do anyway without any further ado let's hop on over and into a brand new blend

26
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.660
default.

27
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.290
Okay.

28
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.490
So welcome to the default blend seen now in front of us here we've got our cube we've got a camera and

29
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.900
a lamp all of these objects can be duplicated.

30
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.970
You can do this under the object menu.

31
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.720
So with the cube selected we're going to go to objects and we can see we've got two types of duplication.

32
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.660
We can duplicate them or we can linked duplicate them.

33
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.500
The main difference between this is if you link something it means you can change the properties of

34
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.640
the object and all of the other ones that are linked will inherit it's.

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.740
We'll use those more later on but for the moment we're going to use duplicate objects.

36
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.370
Now if I just go ahead and click on that you see we get a nother cube straight away.

37
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.970
Now we can place that's all we can be more precise.

38
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.690
We can lock it to the x axis and move it along slightly.

39
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.760
So there we go we've got two objects next to one another and cube 0 0 1 is a duplicate of this one here

40
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.870
the original cube.

41
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.050
And of course if we duplicate I'm going to you shift and D this time to duplicate this will be called

42
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.960
cube 0 0 2.

43
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.730
Now you can name these over in the outline itself.

44
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.310
We can just click on this and call it a cube or whatever.

45
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.990
They must have unique names that is important.

46
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.620
But generally I like to name them over here in the objects properties we see here also says cube.

47
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.280
We can click in here and let's call it a stair.

48
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.500
And there are going to be multiple stairs.

49
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.280
Okay.

50
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
So might be worthwhile now we find it's there getting rid of these other two cubes.

51
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.610
Now I'm going to hold down shift select both of them and I'm going to press the delete key on my keyboard

52
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.930
just to get rid of them.

53
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.960
They're out of the way now without any confirmation.

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.760
That's one of the differences if I'd use the x key we get this of confirmation box up.

55
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.640
Okay.

56
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.510
So now that I've done that we've got this stair here and that's not exactly a stair yet but we can go

57
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.410
ahead scale on the z axis by maybe point 1 to get it really flat and let's scale it on the x axis by

58
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.380
point five to get it more like a slab.

59
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.790
Okay.

60
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.740
That's looking pretty good.

61
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.600
We're going to look at it exactly from the side.

62
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.100
So I'm going to go over to my little gimbal over on the top right.

63
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.120
I'm going to click the X..

64
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.640
I could have also press the number pad 3 if I wanted to.

65
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.240
And now I can zoom in.

66
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.440
Go GZ and just lift it up.

67
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.490
So it's roughly sitting where z equals zero.

68
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.650
Now I've done that.

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.990
I can go around to the top view and zoom out slightly and the reason why I'm on the top view here is

70
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.580
I can duplicates is gonna be called stare dot 0 0 1 in this case.

71
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.270
I'm fine with them being appended 0 0 1 0 0 2 et.

72
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.940
And I'm going to move this across ever so slightly and then going to rotate it.

73
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.390
Now I could rotate it by an arbitrary amount or I could be really precise about it and work out how

74
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.850
many stairs I need going round.

75
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.270
In this case I'm going to rotate it on the z axis I am going to Lockett's which should be off from this

76
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.600
view.

77
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.620
But just to be nice about it and I'm going to rotate it by 30 degrees.

78
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.450
Now we can see it's rotated the wrong 30 degrees it's gone counter clockwise so I'm gonna press the

79
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.790
minus key and that will make it rotate minus 30 and then your press return and I'm going to move it's

80
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.410
roughly the right position.

81
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.710
It's not ideal maybe a little shallower in future but longer it's just whizz round to the side view

82
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.700
and go GZ and lift it up.

83
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.220
So here we go we've got the first couple of steps coming together now you can just continue that.

84
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.080
So we can go so we can go shift in D and duplicate lift that one up ever so slightly sets the right

85
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.980
high was round to the top rotate it by another minus 30 and then go g and move it roughly into the right

86
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.750
place and then we go we can start building these steps up.

87
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.820
Now one of the things that you may immediately figure out is hang on a minute can I just select all

88
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.520
three and then duplicate all of them.

89
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.930
You're right you can.

90
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.120
And then we can whiz round to the side.

91
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.070
Lift it up to roughly the right height.

92
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.920
Go round to the top and move it around.

93
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.300
And here we're going to have to rotate it by I think 90.

94
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.380
There we go.

95
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.430
We've got a much tighter spiral staircase than I had in the preview.

96
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.370
Why don't we go ahead and add into here another mesh object a cylinder perhaps and scale that down and

97
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.700
then scale it on the z axis and just make that's a bit bigger than whiz round to the top and place it

98
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.720
in the center of all of these.

99
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.770
Oh we shall be roughly there on the sky.

100
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.520
It's up again.

101
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.570
And there we go.

102
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.390
We've got a spiral staircase going around this pillar.

103
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.960
Now that is a bit tall so we go scale set and just make it a bit smaller again.

104
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:54.830
Mango GZ and lift it's up and the final thing I might want to do here is go ahead and add in a ground

105
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.370
plane.

106
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.200
So I'm going to go shift in a and add in another mesh type which is a plane I'm just going to scale

107
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.710
that up.

108
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.960
Now you may notice that I've not applied any of my transforms at the moment and that's because I'm just

109
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.070
playing as we're going along normally.

110
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.730
I would suggest applying transforms especially if you've scaled things as we've gone.

111
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:24.350
So here for instance if I had gone control an A and applied this rotation and scale immediately then

112
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.530
the next time we go through I could do that or I could select everything and also apply the rotation

113
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.570
scale and then we should find if we have a look over in the transform whenever we select any of these

114
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:43.010
objects we can see that the rotation is 0 and the scale is one which means that those have been applied.

115
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:49.070
Finally this plane here I did digress a little while so I can do is go straight over to its properties

116
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.790
and name it ground you know something useful right from the very beginning.

117
00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.590
If you carry on and make a real mess of things is very hard because now in the outline a I can search

118
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.930
for stair and there we go.

119
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:11.480
I can select by holding down shift all of the stairs very quickly if you had many many stairs that would

120
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.710
be a real pain as well.

121
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.840
So how about we group these stairs in their own collection.

122
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:25.310
Well with them selected what else we can do is press the M key over in the 3D Ed window and create a

123
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.230
new collection and we can call that collection stairs.

124
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:36.410
Once we've done that we need to click okay and then we can see we've got a scene collection of which

125
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.720
there is one collection called stairs.

126
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.570
And if I minimize that down I'm going to clear my search first.

127
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:49.270
We can see that the stairs themselves all of those mesh objects are grouped in their own collection.

128
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.130
And that really does help manage your objects especially when you're going to have hundreds and hundreds

129
00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:01.400
in more complex models being able to group them into those collections is really important for managing

130
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.880
your scene.

131
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:10.400
So we've got the organization and the naming very very important and with that it's time for your challenge

132
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:18.650
Okay everybody see your challenge for this lecture is to make a simple objects or scene with primitives.

133
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.830
Now remember you can rotate scale and move your pieces around once you place them in your scene.

134
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.330
And of course repeated items you can just duplicate again and again very useful.

135
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.770
Remember you can also select multiple things at once to duplicate them.

136
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.140
If it's part of a larger object.

137
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.480
Now if you complete a simple object with ease why do you try something else more challenging.

138
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.800
Straightaway it's important to dive in straightaway and continue those skills.

139
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.570
Well like the well I showed you earlier on would be a great example.

140
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.170
Something with more objects in a bit more difficult to manage.

141
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:59.240
Or you can block out a more complex scene whether that's an interior or exterior scene perhaps one that

142
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.880
you want to work on more as you develop your skills throughout the course Paul's video now and give

143
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.460
that a go Hello everybody and welcome back.

144
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.230
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you've come up with.

145
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.370
I'm going to go ahead now and hop on over into blender and create my well scene again.

146
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.950
Okay everybody this is going to be really quick.

147
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.530
I hope to go and do this.

148
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.010
I'm going to make the well that we saw earlier.

149
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:31.150
So I'm going to start off with my cube here and scale on the second the z axis pi point one ans or I

150
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.490
could have.

151
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.610
Now I'm going to scale it.

152
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.620
Everything everywhere.

153
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.720
By point 1 and scale it on the y axis by 2 so it's more like a brick.

154
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.620
I'm going to zoom into that brick and go Gee Z.

155
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.370
Point nought five because then I think no no it's not.

156
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:53.510
So I thought that would have been on the ground perfectly but it's not going to lift up to around there.

157
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.210
And that's good starts.

158
00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:00.850
Now I'm going to go and look at this brick from the very top and I'm literally going to duplicate it

159
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.510
rotate it by 30.

160
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.550
Lift it up to roughly here and I'm going to continue doing that but I'm going to select the second one

161
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:17.080
duplicate that rotate those by 60 and then puts it in roughly the right position that's almost there

162
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:24.100
now we're going to duplicate again rotates by a hundred and five.

163
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.140
No no no no no.

164
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.100
120 height by 120.

165
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.900
Now that I've know where these have disappeared off to they're all the way over there.

166
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.640
Let's bring them back in so rotate by 1 20.

167
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.130
There we go.

168
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.680
And then we can plot that roughly in the right place.

169
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:49.140
I'm just going to duplicate those again because I think if we go ahead I'm gonna save my file as we

170
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.640
go as well and I'm going to call it.

171
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.940
Well save.

172
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.290
Okay so rotate by 120 and I think I might be wrong.

173
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.520
I think we're done.

174
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.340
Excellent.

175
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.920
So that's the basis for the well at the bottom looking good so far.

176
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.520
I'm just going to click and box select everything.

177
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.670
Now there is some intersection here.

178
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.950
That's something we do need to concern ourselves with but not really at this stage.

179
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.570
But what we can now do is whiz round the side duplicates.

180
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.660
Lift it up.

181
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.270
I'm not going to be exact with my placement.

182
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.040
You will notice that things in the real world are not precise.

183
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.220
So it's important that we're not precise here either get a hold down shift and select multiple areas

184
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.130
and rotate them on the z axis.

185
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.570
And I don't have to be precise there because I'm going to get straight back in and rotate ever so slightly

186
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.110
so that none of these breaks line up with one another.

187
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.800
That's that's not going to be convincing and you might argue that this is a little over the top.

188
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:58.650
And you know what you might be right but in this case that now looks much much better.

189
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.150
Now again we've got a little bits of intersecting going on here.

190
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.830
I'm not going to worry about that for the moment.

191
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.200
There are ways around it but again it's it's just the basics here.

192
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.810
Now the first thing that I've done and I can slap my wrist for is everything is called cube.

193
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.970
So I'm going to slap my wrist there.

194
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.140
But before I do anything else I'm going to highlight all of these confirm that they're all selected

195
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.350
and move them to their own collection and call it Rick.

196
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.750
Well at least then I'll be able to select all of these individually because they're all grouped together.

197
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:40.160
Now the next thing that I might want to do is go mesh cube skate it's everywhere.

198
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.540
But the z axis.

199
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.360
It's nice and so I'm going to look at it from the side and lift it up to roughly the right place and

200
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.540
I'm going to git all before duplicate it.

201
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:56.070
I'm going to cool this wooden supports or wooden frame I'm going to call it the frame.

202
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.750
So this is going to be the originating piece and then everything else was actually come from this.

203
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:07.740
So I can duplicate that and I'm going to pop it I'll make sure it's selected duplicate and pop it roughly

204
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:14.010
over the other side in the right place and put duplicates again rotate this around.

205
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.950
Now I'm gonna be precise and go 90 degrees and then scale this up and then we look around and we see

206
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.950
we've got something like that looking pretty good so far.

207
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.480
So that's again.

208
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.860
Look at it from this side duplicates rotate 90.

209
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.890
Lift it up to about here.

210
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.750
And I'm gonna scale that's on the y axis only so it's gonna make it longer than it was round to.

211
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:45.370
I'm gonna duplicate that and you can see here that we just repeat this over and over again.

212
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:51.100
So I'm gonna disappear for a few minutes whilst I do that and I'll just speed up the video and I'll

213
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.790
see you back again shortly.

214
00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.380
And there we go.

215
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.900
I'm pretty happy with how that's turned out.

216
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.220
I don't know what you've done with yours but I'm really looking forward to seeing what you've made.

217
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.980
I can see a few things here that I tweak and improve but overall this is a really good example of how

218
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:18.820
you can really rapidly produce objects in your world by just duplicating and doing no actual modelling.

219
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.780
How cool is that.

220
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.580
Well anyway that's the solution for my challenge on this lecture.

221
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.660
It doesn't matter whether you've kept it basic or you've gone to this level or even beyond.

222
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.590
I can't wait to see what you've produced.

223
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.640
So please do save your files and keep them because we're going to get them ready to present soon so

224
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.750
you can share your work with both me and your fellow students.

225
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.360
Until then I'll see you in the next lecture.
