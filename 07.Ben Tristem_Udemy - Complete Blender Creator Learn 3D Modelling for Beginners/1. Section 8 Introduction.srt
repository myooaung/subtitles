Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,500
Welcome to this section.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,060
And we're going to be focussing on two main topics here.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,370
We're going to be first of all focussing on getting the mesh really nailed right.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,990
Good message topology right from the very beginning starting with a very low detail model and then adding

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,240
detail as we go.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,080
And we will the second stage is actually making sure the materials are right.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,940
It's all very well having an ultra realistic mesh but it's a bit lifeless and we can make that come

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,000
to life with excellent material use.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:39,380
So we'll go through how to apply multiple layers of materials that make up our skin or human skin or

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,380
a dragon skin or a grape skin there's lots of applications that you can take from this entire section

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,300
and will also be playing with the cloth physics as well which would be great fun.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,540
So of course before you crack on just a couple of notes of course the lecture notes themselves if you

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,330
want to follow along with the lecture notes they actually attached against this lecture and any assets

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,760
that you will need during this whole section are also against this particular lecture.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,360
So have a look if you want to download them please do so right now.

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,390
And of course I will see you guys on the course in the next lecture.
