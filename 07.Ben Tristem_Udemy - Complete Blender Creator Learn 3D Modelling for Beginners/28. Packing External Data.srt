00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,740
Welcome to packing external data in this video you will learn how to embed images into the blend file

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,910
both individually and collectively.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,550
Understand this is essential when sharing a blend file with anyone else.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,130
Now no it can create a bloated file if the external data becomes obsolete.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,090
And I'll show you how to remove external data.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,040
So let's operate on over into blender.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay so back over in blender.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,370
I must been some.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,140
No I'm not in solid modem selling textured mode.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,560
Gonta matea OKAY IF YOU EVER good citizens tabel you rendering something and it comes out this magenta

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,710
this bright pink It means you've done something to them.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,560
Basically to hide your pictures your textures from Blender.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,960
I know exactly what I've done.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,760
I've inadvertently moved my texture's folder that I was working from from my downloads into the work

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,300
pack.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,290
First time currently working on into that person working folder the fluffy bunny folder and that's broken

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,320
these textures.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,330
So there's a couple of ways I can go about fixing this.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,610
I can move the folder back but that defeats the point of having my work folder so I don't want to do

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,230
that.

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,180
I could re reference them all.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,440
And there's only three in this case that would be acceptable although if your project was much bigger

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,110
this would that would be an absolute nightmare renat renaming or relinking hundreds of files even tens

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,620
of files is going to be an absolute pain to do so we don't want to do that either.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,720
So first of all in order so you can experience some of this pain.

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,050
I've got a short challenge for you.

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,030
I would quite simply like you to rename your asit pack folder.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,180
So pause a video.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,560
Now go and find it and rename it put a one on the end or something like that so it just changes what

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
the folders called.

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,630
Okay guys.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,870
Welcome back.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,660
Right.

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,690
I have already essentially done that.

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,640
In fact I've moved my folder that's another thing you can do but renaming it is probably the simplest

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,950
thing you could do.

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,360
So let's go ahead here and make sure that it's not working.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,550
So if you go over to file and open recent you can open up your file again and just make sure that you've

39
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,920
now essentially broken your texture's.

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,590
If you go to the viewport shading and select material you should see it being bright pink.

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Brilliant.

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,210
Well okay not exactly brilliant but it is.

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,390
To do this exercise of course.

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,880
So now we've got these three images no longer existing blender does not know where they are or what

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,510
they do.

46
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,890
Of course you could rename your file and they all come back again removing that one from the end or

47
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,620
however you rename them.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,150
However if they're not what you can do is simply re link them.

49
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,400
So if evil is so you move the impeaches to several locations on the hard drive perhaps you created your

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,440
own nature back and wanted all the grass in one folder and then realized that you'd broken some other

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,850
blend files and you couldn't just move one folder back.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,870
Then you'd have to relink them.

53
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,570
So in order to do that you can do it in the text to tab itself.

54
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,040
We've got here grass blade 10 P N G.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:33,240
And if we open up this file here we can navigate to the appropriate folder and I'm going to go here.

56
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,530
OK what's a shortcut for it.

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,950
Your section assets nature texture's now want some here.

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,250
I only defined it again because the name is already pre populated.

59
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,630
I can just click open image and we should see that coming back.

60
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,950
Brilliant.

61
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,220
Now this image here what I'm going to do to get this one back is I'm going to switch to the image editor.

62
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,760
In fact I'm just going to make my screen a bit more comfortable for me by getting rid of the tall shelf.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,780
I'm going to split the insoo and just open up the image editor here so I don't have to keep flicking

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,280
between screens and the properties panel here.

65
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,630
I'm just going to remove that and I'm going to go to on the head by here.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,760
There's a picture next to where it says render results on my screen and I can go ahead and look what's

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,680
going on.

68
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,260
So you've got a zero next to the grass blade 10 that means next time we open up this file after saving

69
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,070
it.

70
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,580
That graph is going to disappear.

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,860
That's what that was sorted.

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,340
But it also produces 0 0 1 at the end and that's because blender essentially has two files within its

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,060
database that are have the same name so scrolling down a little Lets do the grass seed which is the

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,470
middle one I believe and what we can do here is if we open up the properties tab again is actually got

75
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,610
a reference path at the top here we got the the image itself and a source path here.

76
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,660
If we click refresh.

77
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,800
Nothing happens because it's it's not refreshing anything is refreshing an empty file something that

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,700
doesn't exist.

79
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:13,270
However if I go to open I can also go and find the file I want so I'll go and do that now.

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,200
In my next nature texture's pack and I can just click Accept and that should come back.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,640
Now the benefits of doing it that way is it.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:31,370
Now we look on our items in our scene our pictures here in the movie image editor.

83
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,660
We haven't produced another one of these zeros zero ones.

84
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,130
But this time round we've not so it helps prevent this from happening by going into the image editor

85
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,490
sgo into the image that does work and adding it back in.

86
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:54,530
Now once we've done that we can go ahead and select the grass seed let's say so were in that now and

87
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:01,080
we can go to image and pack the image and that will pack it into the blend file.

88
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,590
Brilliant.

89
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:11,180
Now I don't know if you noticed that on the screen but this source file here is no longer highlighted.

90
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,410
It's essentially linked within the blend file.

91
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,340
Now fortunately for us if you ever need to link it to an external file again you can do that.

92
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,300
There's a little button here.

93
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,130
This is save an image into the pack blend files to disk and this one here is to unpack for file.

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,310
So that will then.

95
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,010
So we've got a couple of options here use far in the original location create when necessary will put

96
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,720
it back exactly where it was before.

97
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,960
And then we've got a source file again that we can use.

98
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,580
So there's lots of options going backwards and forwards there's a pack button here as well pack and

99
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,980
unpack are both there and we can remove the pack here.

100
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,940
We can create some data on our hard disk as well.

101
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,210
There's lots of options but in general you want to keep this with in your blend file and then it won't

102
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
go astray.

103
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:13,660
Now as one final option here and that is under the file menu if we go down right towards the bottom

104
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,360
there's external data and there's an option here to pack all into blend.

105
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,610
Now this will pack absolutely all the external data that you referenced into the one blend file.

106
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,210
Now we use this with caution depending on what are doing.

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,550
Now we can also turn on automatically pack into the blend file as well which again has to be used with

108
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,150
caution.

109
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,100
If you're working with external material on a regular basis you're working with an artist who's great

110
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,290
at doing textures and they put their say their textures into a Dropbox file that you then reference

111
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,010
the downside of bringing in a blender is if they do an update for you you that won't automatically update

112
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,940
your blender file when you open up the the blend file again.

113
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,010
That can be a disadvantage.

114
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,200
Now if we are only working by ourself and we're only working with small images then it doesn't matter.

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,060
It's not going to bloat the file that much.

116
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,440
But if you've imported a movie and you go and pack that into your blend file your blend file is going

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,880
to get huge all of a sudden which may cause the ability issues.

118
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,000
Now one of the great things about blender is very customizable.

119
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,450
So what you could do if you wanted to safeguard any work that you are working on if you if you like

120
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,890
reorganizing your computer lots.

121
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,640
Or perhaps you've got someone in your family uses your computer relights organizing it for you.

122
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,120
And argle one of those.

123
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:43,390
And we we can actually go to here take that and then save the start-up file as well.

124
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,920
But you do that on a brand new file so I'm just going to save the work I'm working on at the moment.

125
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:58,420
Go in to a new file and you go to automatically pack into blend and save your start-up file and then

126
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,210
that setting would exist in every single one you opened up.

127
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,550
But bear in mind you may have to undo that depending on what you're working on.

128
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:15,910
So one final thing when you have your file saved like this and we have automatic turned on you may get

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,740
errors.

130
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:23,100
So the first error here is that my final pink square is still missing.

131
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,430
Who would have to sort that out the iris final PRNG is not found so I've obviously moved that during

132
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,720
one of my clean ups.

133
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,800
You probably don't have that one missing and you may have a rabbit reference image missing as well if

134
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,450
you're using the ones in the reference pack.

135
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,190
So of course I've got a challenge for you.

136
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,320
I would like you to go ahead and read link missing files series link any missing files and switch on

137
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,950
automatically pack just for this blend file.

138
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,240
Now an optional things turn this option on and save it to your start-up file itself.

139
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,060
And I'm going to do that myself.

140
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,660
It's entirely up to you whether you do that yourself.

141
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,040
Paul's video now and relink your missing files.

142
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,520
Okay guys.

143
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,660
Welcome back.

144
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,050
Let's get straight on over into blender.

145
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,800
Right so I'm going to first of all focus on my pink image here.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,900
So it was the grass blade.

147
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,680
So luckily in the outliner it gives me a clue.

148
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,890
So I'm going to go to my source up the top here and open and go along to.

149
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:44,620
That was in the properties of the U V editor and go ahead and open up the correct file in the nature

150
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,830
textures.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,980
And except I should open it up.

152
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:56,020
Brilliant that's brought that one back so I'm going to go ahead and automatically pack into blend file

153
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,920
a case I've got my iris and I've also got a rabbit reference that isn't working.

154
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,330
So rabbit reference is a background image I used earlier on.

155
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,910
Now arguably whether or not that's important to keep I don't know at this stage I don't think I'm going

156
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,260
to use it again so I could delete it.

157
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,810
That would also solve the problem.

158
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,990
But in this case I am literally just going to remove its incorrect reference.

159
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,030
I've got a similar option here.

160
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,780
I'm just going to probably just get rid of that bit over there so I can see what's going on.

161
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,020
I just want to go ahead and open up the correct one and what happened there was that it was a different

162
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,300
named folder.

163
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,800
Had read in the folder of course and there's the rabbit reference re.

164
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,300
So I can just click set and I'm going to go file and say yes and I've got one final thing which is my

165
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,400
iris.

166
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,820
Okay so that is a texture we have applied to the eyes.

167
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm going to have to go hunt that one down.

168
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,280
So eyes is it's on their image texture.

169
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:11,470
Iris final I think this is the one and I've put that in my supporting docs open image long ago file

170
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,210
and save.

171
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,460
Are there any more errors.

172
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,760
Iris final Iris final are because I've done that.

173
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,300
It's actually renamed it.

174
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,700
There.

175
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,770
So let's just see if we can bring in the appropriate one.

176
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,880
In fact let's see.

177
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,310
First of all if it's got a zero next to it so euv image editor and let's open it up.

178
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:44,000
So Iris final It's not got a zero next to it yet so we can remove that with the cross just here.

179
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,450
And as it says it's under link it.

180
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,290
We need to use the shift key at the same time.

181
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,030
So I'm going to do that now.

182
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,390
And when I press that we should have forced a zero next to the iris final.

183
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,560
I didn't have the open.

184
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,510
Let's try again.

185
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,510
Iris final so I'm going to go ahead and save my file it will come up with an error.

186
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:17,470
However hopefully when I reopen it and save it's sorted now because I've done a lot of work on something

187
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,000
that I can't see lets go and make sure that it is done before continuing forward.

188
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,070
Now again you might not have any of these issues on your rabbits.

189
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,210
I'm just going to make sure I don't have on mine.

190
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,270
So let's just zoom in.

191
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,120
It looks like you've got the right texture there.

192
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,710
It looks good.

193
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,840
As it renders out Yep I'm happy with that that the iris has been applied.

194
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,860
Brilliant.

195
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,560
How did you guys get on.

196
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,270
I hope you recovered all of your images we've got no more magenta squares and I will see you guys in

197
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,310
the next lecture.
