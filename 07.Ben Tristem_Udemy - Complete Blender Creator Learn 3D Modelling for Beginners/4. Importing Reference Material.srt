00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,150
Hello everybody and welcome to importing your reference material.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,870
By the end of this lecture you'll be able to input your pen as you can see here in a position where

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,410
is not only transparent but you can see the objects behind it as well.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,040
Really useful for any reference material.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,460
Let's find out more.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:22,820
Okay.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,340
So as you've guessed it there's more than one way that we're going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,810
The first wave I'm going to show you is to simply go to your file manager find your reference and drag

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,210
and drop it in.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:42,540
This will generate an empty with our image attached to the empty and we can move it around we can move

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,750
around in the scene and you notice that is aligned with the view.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,340
So as soon as we've added that into the scene is aligned with the view itself.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,500
And that can cause problems because if you weren't expecting that or not quite in the right view you

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,740
have to undo and go backwards and forwards again.

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,300
But that's a really quick way of getting us to the position of having an empty with an image associated

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,890
with it.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,460
I'm going to highlight that and delete it out of the way because the next way I'm going to show you

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,870
is a bit more controlled.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,780
We're going to go to edits and preferences and under your add ons tab.

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,090
So if you're not there go onto the add ons tap on the left hand side and start typing in the search

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790
box image and you'll see an option hits.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,360
Import export import images as planes.

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,100
Make sure you've got a tick in that box.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,950
And if you want it to happen every time you open up a brand new plan to file from now on make sure you

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,460
click on Save preferences.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,110
Once you've done that you can go ahead and close that down.

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,980
Now what will happen is when you go ahead to add a new object into the scene we've got this new image

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,570
option and we've got three options reference background and images as planes.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,110
We'll start with images as planes.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,040
This is the one that it's it seems to be indicating that we want straight to wait and see we've got

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,080
a load of options down here as to how it's going to import.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,660
Okay I'm going to scroll down here it's not apparent by the way that you can lift this up and down this

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,930
catches a lots of people out that you've got things hidden behind this invisible area.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,440
So I want to go to my bowling ball and pins folder my pin reference which is what I downloaded in the

35
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,130
previous lecture and we're gonna open that up.

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey where's it gone.

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,870
What I'm going to go ahead and hide my cube is imported a plane with the right aspect ratio with the

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,020
texture of that pin applied to it.

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,360
So we won't see it until we're either in look there mode.

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,530
There we go.

41
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,020
Or we're in shaded mode.

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,350
Now of course the issue with this is it's not very good as a reference image but it is very good as

43
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,380
maybe a background image if you wanted to see some trees in the background of a scene that you're working

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,010
on very similar to how we introduced just having a billboard in the back a bright blue one or an orange

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,450
one.

46
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,440
If you cast your mind back to the first ever lectures that we did where we were we just want a blue

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,370
sky Well it's just a big blue thing behind the camera.

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,620
So we don't see anything else beyond that.

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,750
This is how you can do that but with an image let's have a look at the other options.

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,950
So let's go ahead delete that and add in an image as background and this time if we go into the pin

51
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:31,440
reference we can see that it's added in just as we had before just as if we dropped it in so we can

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,400
see here that it's aligned perfectly with the view as it was.

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,750
And then of course we can move around the scene that's got these grab handles that we can grab on and

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,540
you can see that it locks to the aspect ratio of the objects.

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,180
So that's another way of getting to the same point that we were on before.

56
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,160
However the key one the important one for us is a reference.

57
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,160
So once again if we add in reference it will align to your view.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,810
So that's the first thing to bear in mind.

59
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,190
So before we do any of this what we need to do is make sure we're on the right view.

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,360
So either the right or the front of the graphic projection I'm going to go ahead and add in an image

61
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,950
reference and I'm going to go pin reference now with this here.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,290
I'm not going to worry about scaling at the moment.

63
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,420
We'll talk about that later on but for the moment we just need to make sure that we can see it and it's

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,400
properly aligned with our mesh objects.

65
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,830
So the Bring Back our cube.

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,540
So the first thing you'll see here were in shaded mode.

67
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,030
I'm going to go back to solid.

68
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,110
We cannot see our image when there's an object in the way it's just buried in between.

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,290
So let's go round to the front.

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,010
What can we do.

71
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,380
Well only the empties properties.

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,590
If we scroll down on the object properties to where we've got all viewport display.

73
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,650
If we open that up and scroll down we've got a couple of options.

74
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,260
The first one that you may find very useful is having it in front.

75
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,120
Hey guys.

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,840
Mark Hare the update for you as blender seems to Earth either broken something or updated something.

77
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,020
So this no longer works it's cast your eyes over to the right under the viewport display of the object

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,310
data.

79
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,730
Sorry.

80
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,640
Object properties panel if you click in front you'll find that the image will no longer appear in the

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,730
front.

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,560
Also if you try and change the outcome from this panel that no longer works either.

83
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,850
The only thing you can do to see from this way round is to select the cube itself and then change the

84
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,130
display as to why if remote

85
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:42,870
if we switched back to solid mode for a moment what we can do is if we switched back to the image go

86
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,560
to the image properties we can come to the depth and change it to front.

87
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,920
I'd also like to draw your attention to the use Alpha checkbox just as a reminder you can use this slider

88
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,030
to change the opacity.

89
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,450
And with that in mind.

90
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:07,700
Back to Mike now that is incredibly useful as then we can see our image no matter where.

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,660
But the problem there of course is well we can't say our object which puts us in a bit of a conundrum

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,190
is better if this image was slightly transparent.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,120
Well we can do that if we go to our color options.

94
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:28,250
Not only can we color this if we wanted to send it back to normal but at the bottom here we have an

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,060
A.

96
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:37,700
Now we've got RG B A H S V A and A hex value here if you wanted the RG B's red green blue this is hue

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,810
saturation and value but the H stands for Alpha on all of these.

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:50,570
If we turn that down our image becomes see through which means that we can see both the image and the

99
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,850
object behind and that's what we all want to make sure that we have when it comes to actually doing

100
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,180
anything with our image in Blender.

101
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,400
As a reference image.

102
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,240
So there we go multiple ways of importing an image into blender.

103
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,410
And now it's time for you to give it a go in the form of a challenge okay.

104
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,270
So your challenge is to set your view to even the front or a side or a graphic view.

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:24,000
Once you've done that import your pin reference image in the blender then set the image to be in front

106
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,100
of everything else in the viewport and make sure your image is exactly nought point four on the viewport

107
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,810
alpha channel.

108
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,310
We may change the later I just want to make sure you're comfortable with actually tweaking one of those

109
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,770
settings as well.

110
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,870
Paul's video now and give us a go OK.

111
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,720
Everybody welcome back.

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,430
Let's go ahead and impulse hop in reference.

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,660
OK so welcome back over in supply and I'm going to press one on my number pad to whiz round to the front

114
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,160
view and I'm going to go shift an eight add in and because I made sure that I've saved my user preferences

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,820
I have these options every time I started either half those after creating a new blender file or perhaps

116
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,520
coming back to blender later on remember that in your preferences if you don't save your preferences

117
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,800
it will only apply to the blender file you're working on which is sometimes beneficial by this point

118
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,140
we want it to apply to everything that's really useful one to have turned on if I want to make sure

119
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,040
I close my user preferences down as well.

120
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,060
Okay so we're in the front view I'm going to add in a reference image I'm going to go and find fortunately

121
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,750
I've already bookmarked it but I'll also be in my recent as well.

122
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:41,100
Remember this little hidden area here bowling ball and pins pin references the one I wants to import

123
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,920
now I have included this against this lecture as well if you want to use exactly the same reference

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,290
material that I have of course I would always encourage you to use your own reference material so you

125
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,370
can really tweak and so you're not just doing monkey see monkey do work as we go forward.

126
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,060
Okay now that's imported.

127
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,890
I can scroll down here whilst I mean my empties properties the object data properties I'm gonna go to

128
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,040
viewport display open that's up and I'm going to say that it's in front of everything.

129
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,340
That's exactly what I want.

130
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,250
Now the color I'm going to go to Alpha I'm just going to tie pin point four and there we go.

131
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,710
Everything sorted.

132
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,870
It looks like it's probably a little large at the moment but we'll get sorting that out in a bit.

133
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,420
Okay.

134
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,230
There we go.

135
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,640
Hope you found that's pretty straightforward to do if you did struggle a little let us know where you

136
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,410
struggled over in the discussions or of course if you'd found a different way of doing this I'd love

137
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,430
to hear about it as well and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
