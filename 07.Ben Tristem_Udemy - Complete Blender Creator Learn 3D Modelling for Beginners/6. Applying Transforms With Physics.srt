00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,620
Hello everybody and welcome to this reminder video it's been a while since we've had one of these.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,420
Now when it comes to applying a transforms and physics it is incredibly important if we don't apply

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,910
our transforms to the physics engine will think something is smaller or larger or weighs more or less

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,190
than it should do compared to its volume.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,520
So you end up adjusting the density of something without even realizing.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,010
And obviously if you're trying to mimic brakes as we're going to do in this section then you're going

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,620
to end up with something not acting as you would expect it to.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,430
So that is really important.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,230
So let's learn a bit more about applying transforms and how they're going to affect you in physics by

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,640
hopping straight on over in a blender.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,150
Okay so we're back over in blender and we have two things in front of us.

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:52,500
We've got three balls on each of these ramps these ramps are slightly downwards as you can see here

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,150
they do have a slope to them.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,020
I've already set out the physics and will learn a lot more about that at the moment.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,710
We just need to focus on what happens if we don't apply it transforms.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,410
So the three balls on the left here and the ramp are a duplicate of these three balls on the right.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,410
The only difference is they they always the same.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,410
They all have the same friction and all the other set ups.

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,740
But the difference between these two the one on the left.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,390
All of these have a scale factor of one.

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,490
Now these ones on the right have a slightly different scale factor rubbering.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,990
Open the properties tab.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,480
If I select the one on the right here we can see it's got a scale of point one.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,200
This has a scale of one in the middle and then the one on the left has a scale of 10.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,550
So they will behave slightly differently depending on what they are.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,190
So in reality the one on the far left of this group of three is much smaller.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,010
And on the right is much larger by a factor of 10 both ways.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,890
So let's without any further do let's go ahead now and play the animation and see what happens.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,980
So the balls dropped down a little bit of a bounce to them and we see and there will be some randomness

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,210
here that's just part of the physics engine itself.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,920
But we see that these three balls are pretty much going at the same speed down this ramp.

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,050
And the smallest ball is going quicker than the medium ball.

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,480
And then this one's barely moving it.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,860
I mean it is moving.

35
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,020
You know they dropped off the end there.

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,210
So this one here is slowly moving down but it's not behaving as you would expect it to.

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,940
And this is something that will throw you a lot.

38
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,280
When it comes to your animations especially if you're using the physics engine in it if you've not applied

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,910
the scale it's not going to act as you would expect it to.

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,360
And that could be obviously very annoying if you then go and tweak loader parameters and then realize

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,360
I only had remembered to apply my scale.

42
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,160
Now there are a couple of other things.

43
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,450
Sometimes if you inadvertently apply the wrong location you can get some really weird results as well.

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,640
And we had that warning in right back if you remember when we were doing the Skittles.

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,840
If you've got the centre of mass or the origin of the object in the wrong place you'll end up doing

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,790
weird things as well.

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,170
In this case the origin of all of these objects of course is in the middle of them so we stop it here

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,020
and let's go back to the normal default view that we'd have and we've got the origins right smack bang

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,260
in the middle of each of these balls which is where it should be.

50
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,900
That's where the centre of masses.

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,480
If we decided to have a bit of fun of course and move that centre of mass slightly to one edge that's

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,780
the centre of mass on top of this ball solona left click on the very top of the ball.

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,060
I've run out of zoom.

54
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,940
This happens so often you select it so we can zoom right in and put 3-d cursor on the top and in the

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,690
tool shelf itself under the Tools Options set the origin to the 3D cursor.

56
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,220
So now all of the mass of this ball is distributed on the very top.

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,020
And I'm going to do the same on this one but this time on its side and then we're just going to laugh

58
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,990
as it ends up Mexican being down the entire ramp this origins of 3-d cursor.

59
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,760
So let's see what happens if we go ahead and do that because we've moved where the masses and we can

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,890
see that these things are moving in a very weird way in fact I don't think the slope is big enough.

61
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,860
But they're tending to go towards where that weight is.

62
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,840
Perhaps I've been a bit too extreme on that mascara's distribution but there we go.

63
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:30,620
So in this case this would be a case of in here going apply the location and then see what happens after

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,610
that.

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,120
Oh it's gone really weird.

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,550
Now look at it go.

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,560
I wonder how those amazing So if we go ahead and inadvertently have plied the location that's move the

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,250
origin all the way over here.

69
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,460
I've seen that happen so many times.

70
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,650
So the origin is well back in the whole origin of the entire world at zero zero zero.

71
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,990
The ball of course is nowhere near that so often in these cases if you've inadvertently done that's

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,320
very easy to do you can go to set origin after the object is selected and move it to the centre of mass

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,100
either by the surface or in this case of unadilla volume.

74
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,600
And I can do the same here with this next one set origin to the centre of mass and we'll learn a lot

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,230
more about that in the next lecture.

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,860
But let's just make sure these are now going down as we would expect them to.

77
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,190
Yes they are working.

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,250
And let's just fix these here so we.

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,360
If I select this one here and apply the scale and on the end apply the scale as well.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,110
Now we should see that they behave very much like each other.

81
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,330
Of course there will be some randomness but we can see they're all falling at an appropriate rate for

82
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,620
what they're doing and they should all reach the end pretty much together give or take a few frames

83
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,280
difference.

84
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Perfect.

85
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,430
So I hope that's clear that things and specifically why you need to apply your transforms when it comes

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,620
to doing physics.

87
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,570
And I will see you all in that next lecture.
