00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.530
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.560
We're going to have a look at a form of subdivision which is chopping up a face as you can see here.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.880
We've chopped up the top face and actually extruded some additional detail from it.

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.170
We'll have a look at the specials menu as well.

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.250
And we'll have a look at why if I go into edit mode this can be a good and a bad thing as well depending

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.130
on what you're trying to achieve.

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.530
Let's find out more and hop on over into blender Hello everybody and welcome back.

8
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.950
So we have our model in front of us here and I'm going to demonstrate the subdivision on our live model

9
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.530
as well because I want you to play around with it.

10
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.790
Make sure you got a copy of your file wherever it may be before we continue.

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.200
So since this is the 15th one here I'm going to call this 15 challenge even before we get started.

12
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.750
So let's select these top faces and now we want to do an operation on them.

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.390
And it's the subdivide operation now there is a subdivision surface modifier that you may have heard

14
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.850
of before but we're going to touch upon that later on in the course if you use the right mouse button

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.820
it will bring up a context menu in this case the face context menu.

16
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.540
This is a special menu deliberately set up for face selection.

17
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.100
Hey guys.

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.300
Mark here quick update for you the right click menu here is actually been renamed it was incorrectly

19
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.610
named in a previous version of blender.

20
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.100
It's now the vertex context menu.

21
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.210
Still right click to bring up the specials.

22
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.550
But now it's called vertex and you click to subdivide their mind to make a were at the top there.

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.230
We've got subdivide and that's what we're going to do.

24
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.900
And you can see what it has done is it's subdivided the faces as they were.

25
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.660
So you haven't got equal subdivisions everywhere.

26
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.410
It just depends on what the underlying geometry was.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.310
If I subdivide that's again what I could then do is mimic the states that I have before and select this

28
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430
area here here and here.

29
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.570
And before we know it's we can then extrude that up and we've got some extra detail.

30
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.940
Okay.

31
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.680
Mixing up a few genres of buildings here I'm sure they didn't look quite like that.

32
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.610
But to demonstrate the point of subdivision we've now added extra geometry to our model really really

33
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.930
quickly.

34
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.040
Now there is a couple of issues with this.

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.760
The first one is that all of these edges.

36
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.420
These this this this one going around here.

37
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.910
If I if I hold down old and shift and select these these are all superfluous.

38
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.030
They're not needed.

39
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.680
Now before we go and get rid of them I want to show you one of the issues that we've just created for

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.370
ourselves.

41
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.560
If we go ahead and select this face here and try and subdivide that nothing happens or has it.

42
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.730
How about this face here.

43
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.610
Let's select what we face so turn on this face here and subdivide nothing's happened.

44
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.800
Well it has what we've effectively done is we've chopped this face up into even smaller edges.

45
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250
And that's going to cause us no end of issues.

46
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.640
So if I go to Ed select we can see that it's got an edge there an edge there.

47
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.610
All these little micro edges and now making up this single face in fact with the face selected we can

48
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.500
see that the number of edges that make up that face are 14.

49
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.550
And that's not apparent by just looking at it.

50
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.000
So what can we do to sort that out.

51
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.300
Well I'm going to undo a couple of steps there until I see that I've got my top bit selected again.

52
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.920
There we go.

53
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.250
Out shift and select that top one there.

54
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.060
So one of the issues with subdividing like that is you cause a load of extra and unnecessary geometry

55
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.330
and we can get rid of that by dissolving so we can press the X key and dissolve those edges and we can

56
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.920
do the same for these.

57
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.960
And this one across the middle as well.

58
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.320
Now before I do that I do want to show you that it also breaks loop cutting.

59
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.550
So if I was to go control an R you can see that that bit there I can loop cuts and the loop cut itself

60
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.090
stops at that face won't go any further.

61
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.320
And that's because these faces that once were quads I only had four sides now have multiple edges so

62
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.620
blended just doesn't know what to do.

63
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.860
So let's go ahead dissolve these top edges here and see if we get back our loop cuts around our model

64
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.470
brilliant.

65
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.320
That's exactly what I wanted to see.

66
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.870
And it's not going around this way.

67
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.220
Now that's interesting.

68
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.560
But if we turn around to the side we see exactly why it's doing that.

69
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.170
We turn around here we see that it's not cuts down here.

70
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.530
However it is on this part.

71
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.030
So when we cut through our model initially and made these two areas where we're going to put our steps

72
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.620
and our ramp in a few lectures time here we don't have that in fact this face here is made up of one

73
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.350
two three four five six.

74
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390
And we can double check it down here as well.

75
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.410
Six edges that's not ideal.

76
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.210
However depending what stage of modelling you're currently at and whether it's just a prototype that

77
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.850
you're going to eventually show someone without details of its topology how the meshes laid out.

78
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.490
I would argue that it's not worth trying to solve that little conundrum at the moment as to how to make

79
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.870
sure this has continuous edge flow going around it.

80
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.430
That's a lot of extra work for actually no apparent gain.

81
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.920
The danger is that one of these edges is inadvertently selected and let's move it's on the y axis or

82
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.120
it's moved slightly and now you've got a face that really can't exist it is bent and all over the place

83
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.230
and that I don't know if it will but that can cause us some very weird.

84
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.380
Yet you can see that we've got this odd diagonal line coming across the surface of our model our lamps

85
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.460
not particularly strong in this case if I was to select it was not in edit mode there we go go GZ and

86
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.400
lift it up slightly and go g or.

87
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.260
Which way do you need to move on the y axis.

88
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.430
If I make sure that that face is actually illuminated we can see that there are all sorts of funny artifacts

89
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.720
going on especially at low angles for the lights.

90
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.770
By the looks of it if I move the light to just the right angle it really shows it off.

91
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.610
Ah there we go.

92
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.950
We start to get these horrible artifacts going around and that can be avoided with good topology.

93
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.660
In fact look there is a line going across here and there shouldn't be by our own reckoning.

94
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.320
And it just looks odd and horrible.

95
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.280
And that's because the underlying mesh doesn't match with what we're really seeing and blenders trying

96
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.690
to make up for it.

97
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.860
In the meantime now whilst we're in object mode what we could try is having the objects selected right

98
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.010
clicking into on shade smooth that will sometimes sort out those type of problems.

99
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.030
And as you can see in this case it doesn't actually help us at all we'd have to do lots more work to

100
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.740
the model to make it conform to having smooth shading turn on.

101
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.040
So I'm going to go back to shading flats because that's just the nature of the object we're doing at

102
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.980
the moment and I'm going to fix this little issue here by simply undoing a couple of steps.

103
00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.640
There we go.

104
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.920
But just be aware of the extra geometry that you're creating when you're doing this type of work.

105
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.310
And the one final thing that I want to look at here.

106
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.830
Let's put it back into solid shading for the moment.

107
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.810
Is Luke cutting around the edge here now.

108
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.240
That's absolutely fine.

109
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.050
If we wanted to put a doorway just here.

110
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.860
But if we wanted to go ahead and add in something going around the entire model would be a bit stuck.

111
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:31.830
And that's because we decided to do this top part of our model before Luke cutting around this area

112
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.960
here before we started adding these top sections on we could have easily put a loop cuts around our

113
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.260
model.

114
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:43.050
In fact if I go back and revert this to its previous states nothing to lose by balls doing that you

115
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.200
can see I can indeed cut around the model.

116
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.680
So do plan your work going forward because often you can find yourself being able to do something one

117
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.370
moment and then being unable to do it the next because of the decisions that you made in the future.

118
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:06.660
So now I can go ahead and subdivide those top areas and do exactly the same as I did before to add extra

119
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.590
detail.

120
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.730
So subdividing has a lot of benefits because we're able to add extra detail to our model.

121
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:19.350
However as you can see it's going to fall flat at some point when you're going around your model.

122
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.290
And this is where good topology or the layout of your vertices edges and faces really comes into its

123
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.990
own makes working with Blender a lot easier and you'll learn those skills as you become more proficient

124
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.010
as a modeller.

125
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:39.240
But for now it's time for your challenge and your challenge is to add some extra detail to the top of

126
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.990
the pyramid using subdivision and create a doorway at the top of the steps.

127
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.370
And let's have a look at a quick example.

128
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:54.020
So here we go here's the detail at the top of my mind pyramid and also a doorway at the very top.

129
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.840
This is roughly what we're aiming for by the end of this lecture.

130
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.040
Go ahead pause a video now and give this a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

131
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.630
Let's go ahead now and add some detail to our model.

132
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.260
Okay everybody Welcome back.

133
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.780
So I'm not going to start with this I'm going to revert my file once again to how it was previously.

134
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.820
I do want an entrance way at the top here so I am going to put a loop cut around my model.

135
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.960
I'm not going to fool around too much around the top here but I am going to add in a few little details

136
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.240
I am going to subdivide twice like I've done before and I'll take away the extra geometry later I'm

137
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.650
gonna grab this middle area and go g and Z and just lift it up to give myself a little little bit of

138
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.230
a different look at the top and I'm going to grab these two sets of faces each of the side and lift

139
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.860
those up slightly as well.

140
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.380
I just want a bit more interest to my model.

141
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.020
There's no right or wrong way of doing this but it just adds to it.

142
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.960
I'm gonna subdivide that top area of S. I can get some more square area.

143
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.650
There we go.

144
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.760
And I'm going to push that into my temple.

145
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.280
And again I'm just adding little details here.

146
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.670
And finally I'm going to extrude inwards here so we've got somewhere at the very top of our model for

147
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.960
the stairs to lead up to.

148
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.190
And if I wanted to yeah let's do it let's subdivide that twice and then I can do it once more with a

149
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.080
door in there.

150
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.650
Excellent.

151
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:26.980
So I've added a good bit of detail to the model overall I've not gone to too much detail that is important.

152
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.890
I want to come out and just have a look around I'm going to change my shaded mode to either rendered

153
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.720
or looked at.

154
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.070
Is always a good one to have a look around and what we really want is overall it not to look too detailed

155
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.360
in some places.

156
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.520
This looks absolutely fine at the moment.

157
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.280
I could have added some more details around the top here.

158
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.070
There is no end of what you can do.

159
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.720
I'm going to leave it there for the moment.

160
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.370
I'm really interested to see the designs you've come up with.

161
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:56.210
Have any of you stuff Suzanne the monkey on the top as the goddess of this particular temple.

162
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.920
OK.

163
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.180
So I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with.

164
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.360
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
