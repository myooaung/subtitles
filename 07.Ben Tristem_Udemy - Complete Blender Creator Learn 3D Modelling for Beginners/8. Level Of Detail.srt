00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello everybody and welcome to level of detail.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,300
So this is one of the last in a series of kind of theory lectures.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:18,070
But I think this is really important to understand so that you don't end up in a rut of trying to model

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,660
one thing really well.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,470
When that perhaps isn't the best thing you can do.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:29,980
So my advice here and it sounds very straightforward when you hear it is start basic so focus on representations

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,940
of the right size and shape but just block work models.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,070
This is really important especially when you're starting to map out to see inmates make sure things

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,040
fit where you think they're going to fit the real heartache is when you decide to model something you

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,900
spent ages modeling it's it's great if you've learned new techniques whilst you've been doing it and

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,520
you've got another reason for doing it.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,640
However if you're making up a scene and you spend hours modelling that say an alter or a sarcophagus

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,650
and it turns out that you're not going to use that you've effectively wasted that time and if you're

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,970
trying to create assets for a game it's better to have many assets that your game team or even yourself

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,070
can pick from and then you can work on those in much more detail.

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,720
It allows quick iterations of your model.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,860
So if someone says to you oh I want it wide or longer or could you do this here then you're able to

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,130
do that really quickly.

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,850
In fact you could give several variations on a model because you're doing them at such a low level of

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,500
detail initially.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,830
Now remember the higher detail often requires more processing time.

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,360
So so we're not just talking about your timing creating but if there are more vertices in a scene is

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,610
going to take up more resources of your computer and often take a lot longer to render as well.

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:44,930
Okay.

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,330
So one of the biggest things here is watching your time and how it applies to level of detail.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Okay so the level of detail and the time taken are usually directly proportional to one another.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,830
What do we mean by that.

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:03,670
Well if I asked you to model a simple building you could probably do that in under a minute if I asked

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,340
you to model a building with all the intricacies of the guttering and the window trim and the door trim

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,650
and individual bricks need to be slightly out of place.

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,330
So it looks more realistic.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,930
Well it's going to take you a lot longer to level of detail and the time taken and I say I usually directly

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,580
proportional to one another because you can add detail very quickly using other techniques like sculpting

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,600
add detail incredibly quickly but in general the detail level is proportional to the time taken.

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,860
Now when fleshing out the scene and prototyping you probably want quite a few assets.

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,810
So making sure the low detail to begin with is a great way of achieving that goal.

37
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,060
And you can test models and your scene really quickly being able to swap things around scale things

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,650
to different sizes because they don't have details and yet that will be distorted if you just did that

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,980
so the various ways of approaching this task and I would recommend getting comfortable with rough assets.

40
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,960
It's a great way of getting a scene nailed very quickly.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,010
So let's just have a look at a quick charts.

42
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,040
Now these numbers are plucked out of the air but they're just highlighting a fundamental point.

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,350
So we've got level of detail here and you may wonder why it says ABC.

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,920
Because if you've done some reading in the past Ello D is usually 0 1 2 3 4 etc..

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,760
So the way that in a game engine level of detail tends to work is that you will have Level of Detail

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,460
zero which is your base model the highest quality model and then some game engines like Unreal will

47
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,170
auto lot.

48
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,300
And they will cut down the level of polygons and the text to detail the further you are away from a

49
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,540
model or you can explicitly say I want to preserve these details the further something gets away.

50
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,790
And so you can load in individual models.

51
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,480
So in order to avoid that confusion I'm going to use the terminology ABC D so we can actually go up

52
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,230
in our polygon counts as we go now polygon count is just one example here.

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,460
It could be texture detail as well.

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,490
It doesn't really matter.

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,760
Basically the complexity of your model.

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,480
So for instance here at 200 polygon model is probably only going to take you on average 15 minutes to

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:16,970
do.

58
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,970
Once you've added materials and played around with a few things you may find that something with a bit

59
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,600
more detail in it takes you up to an hour to do so in that same time it's taking you to make that Elodie

60
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,290
be model you could potentially put out four different models in the same time.

61
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,190
So this is the power of what we're talking about here as we go up the scale we end up on a cloudy day.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,680
And the reason why I've put that in there at 2 in 2008 could be 20 million.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,010
It really doesn't matter but it's the time it takes to do that.

64
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,370
You will find that some carrots are artists or environment artists.

65
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,570
Once that's nailed down and they really start focusing on the detail it can take them a week to complete

66
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,500
a project.

67
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:05,090
We want to be the other end of the scale at the moment we want to produce many asset reasonably quickly

68
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,040
so we can scale up.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,480
If you're just focusing on one thing for a long time you're going to learn a lot more the other way

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,250
round.

71
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,150
And finally let's look at the two asterisks down at the bottom we've got every polygon counts what do

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,340
I mean by that.

73
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,900
Well it's simply if you were to apply a subdivision surface modifier onto a model that's not really

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,660
a counting polygon you've just increased the polygon count and not really added much to the model.

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,400
So we're talking about polygons that actually matter and counts towards your model.

76
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,180
And then finally the time included.

77
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,760
Yes that includes the other word artwork too as I've hinted.

78
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,930
Your textures your materials your u v unwrapping which we'll get to shortly.

79
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,500
All of those things are important and do count towards that time.

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,210
And the more simple your model is the less time you'll be unwrapping is going to take the less detailed

81
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,780
you're worried about your textures being etc..

82
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,570
Enough of words on a screen let's look at a practical example.

83
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,540
So in front of us here we have a sarcophagus.

84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,570
This took no time for me to model up so then we move on.

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,360
I've started adding detail.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,030
This is about the right level for Elodie.

87
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,750
Now you can see some facets there that I'm not happy with but I also rejected the idea of sorting the

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,730
mounts at this stage because that doesn't add anything to the model itself.

89
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,810
And then we go a bit further and we add more detail on and this could be the ELODIE level C as it will.

90
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,570
And then just for fun I added a few more details on there some worn edges and then smooth them out and

91
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,180
created finer detail across the model.

92
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,270
And this is the sort of thing that starts to take a lot of time.

93
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,970
If I'd gone straight for something like this then we end up in a situation where if this is rejected

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,180
I've potentially wasted all of that time.

95
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,130
Now this doesn't line up this didn't take me a week to do but the first model here in this particular

96
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,570
scene.

97
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,220
This took about a minute two minutes to do but 10 minutes faffing around playing with shapes.

98
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,600
This didn't take much longer.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,750
On top of that but just contains more detail on it and to get the point across quickly I very quickly

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,400
sculpted some extra detail on here.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,190
Some wearing on the edges.

102
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,360
And then I tidied that up a little to make it look that much better.

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,430
And this is just an analogy to the extra time you could spend on a model.

104
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,610
Okay so that wraps up this lecture.

105
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,960
The important takeaway is watch your level of detail.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,340
The last thing you want to do is spend all that time working on something that you're not going to use.

107
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,830
So make sure you're making lots of low poly models to begin with and then later on when we pick the

108
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,530
ones that are necessary for your scene you know those are the ones that you want to focus on increasing

109
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,680
the level of detail on and we'll also go how we can fake some level of detail later in the section through

110
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,470
the use of normal maps.

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,850
But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
