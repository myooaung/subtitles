00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.800
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.410
In this lecture we are going to create a two additional bones.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.990
And then as we switch over into post mode you'll see that they have custom shapes and the great thing

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.680
about these custom shapes is we know these are going to be control bones.

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.730
So let's go find out more Hello everybody and welcome back.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.050
First of all let's turn on our overlays with the overlay so we see all this bone here in the lamp is

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.180
slightly rotated so let's select everything and alternate are and clear all rotations.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Excellent.

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.500
Now look from the side we need to create our bones.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.690
Now I'm going to create the top bone and I'll leave you guys to create the bottom bone yourselves in

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.280
the challenge to create a bone an additive.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.460
We're going to go into edit mode and we're going to select the end point of this bones of the head of

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.210
the bone and extrude out on the y axis.

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.200
Now because we've extruded from a head of a bone.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.040
Now if we go ahead and start moving things around everything follows it and we we will want it to do

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.600
that but not in this way.

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.270
So we need to clear the parents of this bone so we go back into edit mode.

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.900
Alton Pei will clear parents and that's what we want to do at this point.

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.160
We want this to be a floating bone.

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.680
We could have if we wanted to just added another bone to our scene.

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.170
However it's much easier to extrude from this point because it's just that happens to be in exactly

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.310
the right position.

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.780
Now a press G and why I'm just moving away slightly and we will use that bone for the lamp to look at

24
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.600
it.

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.700
Now what about making it look custom.

26
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.210
Well let's go ahead and have a look in the bones properties itself.

27
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.970
You won't see this unless you impose mode.

28
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.800
So let's go ahead and pose mode and then if we scroll down going to minimize inverse Kana Mattox.

29
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.860
This is area under viewport display and you can set a custom object that you can say anything you'd

30
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.460
like here.

31
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.990
The reason why you might want to set a custom object is to distinguish our rigs controls from the rest

32
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.370
of the skeleton.

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.970
This enables you to just grab the bits you want in order to control and later on.

34
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.430
It means that we can potentially hide these from our seam can go ahead select them go hide select them

35
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.520
go hide and then all of that will will need do is grab this bone here and it won't look like a bone.

36
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.900
It'll look like something else in the moment and move that's around in order to control our lamp.

37
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.540
Now of course one of the problems is how well I've just hidden all my bones how to go and select them

38
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.670
again you could undo but let's say you'd saved and come back Alton H.

39
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.620
We'll show those bones again.

40
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.730
And so if you wanted to have them selected I could arrest H to hide them as well.

41
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.410
So alternate you bring them back.

42
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.310
So what were we doing.

43
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.540
We've got this control bone that we're going to look with.

44
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.410
So let's name it look.

45
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.870
Because that's what it's all about and we don't actually have an object yet that we could use for it.

46
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.310
Now I'm going to use a very simple object so I'm going to create myself cursor it's a world origin and

47
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.510
I'm going to create a mesh object a cylinder now a cone would be much better.

48
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.670
Now let's go ahead select this again.

49
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.090
Go into pose mode and scroll all the way down custom objects we're going to set it to the cone.

50
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.930
Now that doesn't look any good does it.

51
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520
Doesn't really show us the direction we're looking.

52
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.330
So I can grab the cone once again but we need to be an object mode to do so.

53
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.340
The actual cone mesh object.

54
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.420
I'm going to go in edit mode so we can see what was going on live.

55
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.640
So if I rotate that's on the x axis by 90 degrees or minus 90 we see at the very top left as we're rotating

56
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.620
it round is going to be minus 90 so let's type in minus 90.

57
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.810
Now it's not quite right at the moment it seems to have rotated all the way down here and not around

58
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.050
its origin so let's have a look at what it's rotating around is a medium points.

59
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.010
I'm not quite sure what it is rotating around then.

60
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.130
So let's change that.

61
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.020
Let's change its pivot point to the 3d cursor.

62
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.750
Before we do that rotation there we go that's perfect.

63
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.530
So that's going to rotate on the x axis by minus 90.

64
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.600
That's be precise.

65
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.540
Press X again.

66
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.630
Excellent.

67
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.840
Hey.

68
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.930
Pun not intended.

69
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.350
I'm just going to scale that down and move it slightly on the y axis the global y axis so we're gonna

70
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.130
press again to roughly where the bone was.

71
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.880
I can't see the bone any more it's been replaced with this.

72
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.240
Now one of the things will happen is when you put your arm which your selected you go into a pose mode

73
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.190
you'll see everything as it is.

74
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.640
If you go into edit mode it will revert back to being a normal bone which makes sense but I'm happy

75
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.810
with where that is and what it looks like.

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.910
Brilliant.

77
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.570
Okay.

78
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.260
I'm finally I'm not going to leave as a solid object.

79
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.010
I'm once again going to go down and turn on wireframe mode.

80
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.980
So we see a viewport display wireframe then you can see through it and then the final thing I want to

81
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.010
do is grab my cone itself in object mode.

82
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.430
This one here I'm going to rename it's to bone shape cone or bone shape.

83
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.820
Look look.

84
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.750
There we go.

85
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.770
That's good.

86
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.010
And then finally I'm just going to press H to hide out the scenes that's nice and hidden.

87
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.450
There we go.

88
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.790
We've got our first bone at the top.

89
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.810
All sorted.

90
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.530
I'm going to go solid shaded boats so we can just see saw our first bone is all set up and sorted.

91
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.660
And now of course comes your challenge and your challenge is to create a controlled bone from the tail

92
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.330
of the stem bone.

93
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.390
Now do check that the bone that you've created is not connected.

94
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.510
Remember to name the bone as well something appropriate.

95
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.770
Whether that's roots or base something along those lines.

96
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.980
And then finally create a custom shape for the bone as well.

97
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.960
Paul's video now and give that a go

98
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.600
Hello everybody and welcome back.

99
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.800
Okay let's hop on over into blender and create our other control bone OK.

100
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.230
So let's go into edit mode because we need to add a new bone.

101
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.440
I'm going to go to side the side projection.

102
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.840
I'm gonna grab the tail of the stem bone extrude it out lock it to the y axis so it's nice and flat

103
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.260
now won't actually matter how big this is.

104
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.970
I'm going to select the bone as well and just press G to move it around.

105
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.250
That is not connected to any of the rest of our model which is very useful.

106
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.310
So we don't have to clear the parents in this case.

107
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.350
Okay.

108
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.550
The next thing we need to do is create our custom shape and then we can apply it says go ahead.

109
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.200
What do I want my custom shape to be.

110
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.590
I think I'm just going to go for a circle.

111
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.290
I did not mean to add another bone because I didn't come out of edit mode.

112
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.950
There we go.

113
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.930
So I'm still at the center of the scene.

114
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.410
I'm going to add in a mesh circle now the circle itself has too many vertices at the moment I'm going

115
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.450
to set it down at eight I could have set this a bit lower as well to be quite honest but no worries

116
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.000
we don't need to do anything.

117
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.020
And I'm going to lever it's just a rim I'm not going to add a feel to it and then it will naturally

118
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.790
be a wireframe anyway.

119
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.810
In fact we could do just saves us a bit of work basically.

120
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:30.980
Now that's there we can go and hopefully select all bone go into pose mode scroll down custom object

121
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.780
circle.

122
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.300
Now of course the problem with custom objects circle I'm going to search for it because it's going to

123
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.550
be the only one called circle on it there's lots of circles but here we go just this custom one here

124
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:53.090
circle I can hide it but the other thing is it's just called circle so I can call this control own base

125
00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.520
now I don't think I've named my bone as of yet so let's go back and edit mode select the bone scroll

126
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.960
all the way up.

127
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.680
Yes it's called lamp stem one do make sure just call it bone base again.

128
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.920
So that's a really important to make sure that you go through and just check your naming on all of these.

129
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:19.370
It's very easy to just plow forward with your projects and completely forget to do something basic like

130
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.580
naming and a while smaller projects you're likely to get away with it but if you keep that habit what

131
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.470
will end up it will just come back and bite you in the backside if you're not careful on a much larger

132
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.190
projects.

133
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.400
I've had it before I was doing something that had a lot of repeated patterns in it and I just lost my

134
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.290
place and it was so difficult trying to rectify that.

135
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.180
It almost felt quicker to just restart the project.

136
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:50.540
Anyway I'm digressing and you guys let's see where you're getting to now what kind of shapes did you

137
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.750
use for your control bones that switched back over to pose mode.

138
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.780
I've got a simple cone and a circle.

139
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.550
What did you choose share over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
