00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.460
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.230
Let's just have a look at a couple of renders so we've got this render here which is what we did in

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.550
the last lecture.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.660
However what we can do is change the camera properties and give it a completely different feel to it.

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.400
It's also in a slightly different position.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.430
But you can see that we can see more of our board.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.270
And that's because we've made this particular camera a wide angle.

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.390
It can get a lot into one picture.

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.240
And similarly here we've got our standard camera looking down on the board and we can flatten the perspective

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.580
by having it a telescopic camera and see it changes but not that much but we do need to reposition the

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.210
cameras as well because this has an effect of zooming as well if we're not too careful.

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.550
So let's hop into a blender and find out more okay.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.210
So in front of us here we have our standard camera.

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.680
Let's go and have a look at how far camera instead so going to select the camera controlling zero and

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.900
have a look at it.

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.810
Now if we go to the properties of the camera itself.

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.520
So on the right hand cycle down to the Object data and we have a couple of settings for the particular

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.030
camera.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.930
I'm going to name it.

20
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.820
Camera file.

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.470
So I if I have to reference it here I've got the right camera.

22
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.970
And here we go.

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.330
We've got the type of camera.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830
Typically you're going to have a perspective camera.

25
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.210
If you're doing something like an architectural drawing that doesn't require perspective in it so all

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310
heights are the same no matter what the distances then all the graphic would be your choice.

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.650
I'm going to leave is perspective for the moment.

28
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.830
The first thing we're going to do is twiddle with the focal length.

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.060
What's this mean.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.890
Well the lower the focal length the wider the lens will be which will have the appearance of zooming

31
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.730
out.

32
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.710
But what it does do is give you that wide angle look we saw earlier.

33
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.770
However the opposite is true if we go the other way.

34
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.670
So if we go to say two hundred it has the appearance of zooming in.

35
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.210
And if this does happen of course we then need to go and move the camera back slightly so that we get

36
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.450
the picture back in frame because we're changing the effective zoom of how light is entering the camera

37
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.150
and of course we can just move it about and we get that more flattened image.

38
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.200
In general if you were going for a more zoomed in shot this is how you would do it.

39
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.810
You would not just move the camera closer.

40
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.330
That is another option of course.

41
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.540
Now let's have a look at the near one to really demonstrate the focal length being changed at 50 mil

42
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.170
at the moment.

43
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.980
I'm going to change my camera here.

44
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.310
It's a camera far and I'm going to change my camera here to camera near.

45
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.660
Oh I'm a poet.

46
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.320
There we go.

47
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
And let's set that maybe 24 and then we go we can see more straightaway.

48
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.430
And of course we may have to then reposition or zoom in the camera.

49
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.930
Now one thing that you can get into is this issue here we're now too close.

50
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.690
So let's say we were really extreme.

51
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.800
You can see it's now clipping parts of the scene in order to sort that out.

52
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.970
You need to come down to clip start distance.

53
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.020
Then we can pull it all back in something that's very important and easy to miss.

54
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.160
If you're very close or indeed very far from your object because it's the camera's distance from your

55
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.510
objects not necessarily what you can actually see in the frame and there we go a nice quick tip on managing

56
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.520
your camera properties.

57
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.820
Now what I'd like to do is a quick challenge is go ahead and adjust your camera's lens settings so that

58
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.560
you get some more interesting looks.

59
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.870
If you need to add more cameras to your scene do so especially if you don't want to lose one of your

60
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.120
previous settings.

61
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.530
Remember multiple cameras and not just for different views there are also four cameras with different

62
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.330
settings balls over the air.

63
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.380
Now give that a go and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
