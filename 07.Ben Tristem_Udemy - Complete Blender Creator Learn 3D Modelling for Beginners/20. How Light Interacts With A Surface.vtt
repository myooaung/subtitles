00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome to how light interacts with a surface.

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.320
So in this video you'll gain a better understanding of how word light works in the real world and how

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.830
it transfers across into the cycles rendering engine.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.070
Now we've already got a rough idea when it comes to plain surfaces.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.350
And we started building that up by mixing shaders together and we starting to change how light interacts

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.120
with the surfaces depending on the angle of which is viewed from or even just with a texture applied.

7
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.940
So we're starting to control how that light actually is being reflected and seen by the cycles rendering

8
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.470
engine.

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.520
And that's how we can start building up more and more realistic materials.

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.390
Now we're going to look at six ways that light and surfaces can interact.

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.390
And of course in real life they don't just act him one way they act in multiple ways.

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.020
Also going to gain some understanding about the physics behind how our materials are working and don't

13
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.060
worry we're not going to get too deep into the maths behind it.

14
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.370
So in order to start this we're going to grab a pen and pencil or in this case a digital version of

15
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.690
it and start having a look at how light interacts with the surface.

16
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.800
Okay so in front of us here we have six different setups in front of us.

17
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:31.440
And these are suppose are analogous to the having a just a a a rectangle there with one individual shader

18
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.600
attached to it.

19
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.880
So for instance reflection now when reflection happens and we've covered this right earlier on in the

20
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.370
course when we started talking about shaders we have the angle of incidence where the light comes in.

21
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.690
So the angle here.

22
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.070
Is it called the angle of reflection.

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.030
Of course nothing is a perfect reflector in the real world.

24
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.340
So this is a perfect example.

25
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.860
In reality you would end up mixing it with something else.

26
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.160
And in fact that's what we're aiming to do here to get a little bit of a deeper understanding what's

27
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.280
actually happening to light when it hits the surface so we can set up more realistic material so we

28
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.060
can think more in-depth about what is happening.

29
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.300
So scattering.

30
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.970
So for instance here diffuse.

31
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.690
So we have again the light ray coming in but instead was a bit of a wobbly light ray.

32
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.870
We would have it scattering off in different directions at different magnitudes depending on the surface

33
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.800
itself.

34
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.850
And that is very useful when we combine the two.

35
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.580
Of course if we did combine the two you may end up with a big reflection coming out if it was quite

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.890
a glossy surface and some diffuses well and that would be a mix of these two put together.

37
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.210
Of course then we can add other things into control how that mix happens and that's what we've been

38
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.350
doing very recently.

39
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.050
Now what happens with absorption well as it sounds as light hits a surface some of it will be absorbed.

40
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.250
It's just the way the world works.

41
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.820
So it'll go into the material and be lost forever.

42
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.610
Now it won't be everything that gets lost because that's impossible.

43
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.510
Mass is a black hole which case this would be an entirely black material.

44
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.350
No we're talking earlier about not having materials that was zero on anything.

45
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.400
So let's say green or white light hits the surface and some green is absorbed.

46
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.240
That means we've got the blue and the yellow.

47
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.870
So we have a little bit of the blue and the red.

48
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.130
We have a little bits reflecting here.

49
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.740
Red might come in and get absorbed a little bit but be reflected off much more or bounced off or whatever

50
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.230
it happens to be.

51
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.340
And then of course the blue light itself if that also struck the surface that may be the biggest one

52
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.780
of all.

53
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.610
And that would be a kind of a a pinky colour.

54
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.500
Overall it would be somewhere around here probably would get that type of shade or this particular material

55
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.460
would look a kind of magenta in colour.

56
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.630
Now refracted that is an interesting one you can do this at home when you stick a pencil or a straw

57
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.300
into a cup of water.

58
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.570
You'll see light comes in and then it will bend towards or away from the normal.

59
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.240
So we've got our normal running through here either burn burn turn towards it or away from it depending

60
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.350
whether it's entering a less dense material or a denser material.

61
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.490
So if it's more dense it will tend towards the north of it's less dense it will tend away from that

62
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.220
normal.

63
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.590
So if it was going from glass into air we would find that out.

64
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.820
Well let's do that.

65
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.820
So in from air into glass would do this.

66
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.510
And then as it struck the other side it would carry on roughly at the same angle it was before.

67
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.390
So it slows down and then picks up speed again.

68
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.690
And now this here that we've just drawn is an example of transmission where light doesn't have to be

69
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.770
refracted.

70
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.700
The majority of the light that enters an object goes through that surface and comes out the other side.

71
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.790
Now of course it could be transmitted.

72
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.400
And instead of coming out in a straight line it might be scattered on the surface.

73
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.650
Incidentally when things go inside a model you can end up with subsurface scattering.

74
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.730
So we go back to scattering up here.

75
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.700
If this was a subsurface scattering node we'd find that light would enter the material and then bounce

76
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.110
around and some of that light would find its way out.

77
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.090
And some of it would be absorbed as well.

78
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.350
So there's a lot that joins all of these things together.

79
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.680
Now some of the particular shader nodes that we have are to make our lives easier.

80
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.990
Before a while not that long ago actually the subsurface scattering node didn't exist.

81
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.920
And before we had to do a mixture of all of these things blending them together to try and get a subsurface

82
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.020
scattering or something that at least emulates it.

83
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.190
The final one here there's no direct shade before but it happens in real life and it's worthwhile knowing

84
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.970
about it.

85
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.570
So when light or energy would hit piece surface and let's say it gets absorbed and it gets absorbed

86
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.450
almost fully with very little reflections so we get most of the energy coming in.

87
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.030
Now this particular object would have absorbed energy so it will start emitting energy as well.

88
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.260
Now usually that would be infra-red energy or something along those lines.

89
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.760
But it could also be visible light if it was energetic enough.

90
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.530
So we can't really do the radiated by a shader.

91
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.050
But I think the closest thing to that if you were to emulate something that was hot perhaps something

92
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.710
that was glowing because a lot of energy had been put into it it would be radiating to be emitting so

93
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.190
an emission shader would be quite a useful one here.

94
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.620
I'm sure you could set up a couple of maths nodes and other things to calculate a certain amount of

95
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.920
radiation depending on light hitting the surface as well.

96
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.950
So let's go have a closer look at some shaders now and hop on over into blender.

97
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.520
Okay so we're on a default blender file here.

98
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.380
And one of the things we can do to try out these different Shaila types and then turn snapping on an

99
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:35.520
With lift this object up by one and move it across a couple are now going to go to the 3-d cursor where

100
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.410
are we 3D Curson just set it plus one on the z axis.

101
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:48.590
So when I add a couple of more basic objects like a cone and Suzanne let's stop at Suzanne the monkey.

102
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.240
There we go.

103
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.500
And we rotate Suzanne around 90 so she's facing us although that is down the camera.

104
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.920
She was rightly added.

105
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:03.570
I want to set smooth shading on this cone so smooth shading there will get some odd effects around the

106
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:09.120
base here because well it's trying to smooth around a great of a 90 degree angle so that's going to

107
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.330
look interesting and I'm going to smooth Suzanne here now with Suzanne one of the things to bear in

108
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:22.260
mind is she's going to be quite jagged So I'm going to add in a couple of subsurface divisions just

109
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.510
to make her look that much smoother.

110
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.940
Okay let's go to the camera view and well let's move that camera around so we've got a much better view

111
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.590
case of all three of our objects.

112
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:42.690
Now finally to play with this I'm going to add in one final meche So I've got a surface to work with.

113
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.010
Going to move that down and scale it up.

114
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:52.770
So we've got a surface and I'm going to set all three of these objects to have the same material.

115
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:59.140
So let's go to the materials tab new and let's change the colour so we can see what's going on.

116
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.090
Ullman could apply that material to all these other ones as well.

117
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.090
Okay so we've got our material set up.

118
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.870
Lighting is not great at the moment so when I go to my lamp maybe it universal using the sunlamp and

119
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.180
use nodes.

120
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.850
Okay.

121
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:21.330
And I'm going to make the outputs of the strength about four so it's nice and bright when I get rid

122
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.660
of my propertys panel and my tool shelf and just zoom into the area we're looking at.

123
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.790
Now we've got this set up we can actually play with the material and I'm going to call this test material

124
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.160
so we know what's going on and we can actually change this to all different types so we can make it

125
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.980
glossy You can see this reflecting Incidentally you see this really jagged stuff happening around here.

126
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:49.350
That's simply because there's there's not enough polygons to interpolate between them all so you end

127
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.200
up with a very jagged surface.

128
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.880
If we wanted to improve that again we'd have to add some subsurface divisions but of course with that

129
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.080
comes a few problems in itself because that cone no longer looks like a cone but kind of cool it now

130
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.120
looks like a teardrop which I didn't know that would happen.

131
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.120
First time I've tried that.

132
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.810
There we go.

133
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.900
How cool is that.

134
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.520
If I'm going to move that across on the y axis so it's a little.

135
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.520
I've moved the wrong thing move across on the y axis it's a little closer to our models.

136
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.810
Okay I'll leave it like that just because I can and because I quite like it.

137
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.260
Okay Somehow I've got these three objects that we can play with.

138
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.000
We can play with the materials and I'll get to that in a few moments after I've just explained a couple

139
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.340
of items here.

140
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:47.400
So I want to explain that why volume absorption and volume scattering will come out black and anything

141
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.800
else to do with volume.

142
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:56.470
And the reason for that is because we're changing the volume properties and not the surface properties.

143
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.300
So we see the word surface here and volume here so we can swap these round or essentially click on the

144
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.240
little darton remove and then go to volume and add it in to volume absorption for instance.

145
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.810
And if I make this density something like 15 we'll be able to see what's going on there.

146
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.050
The thicker your object is the more light it's actually absorbs.

147
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.640
So we give this a colour let's make it a blue.

148
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:28.620
We can see that's we end up with a very dark blue or essentially black if all the light is absorbed

149
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.070
by the time it reaches the middle of a thick object.

150
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.910
And these is a quite thin so it lets a lot of light through.

151
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.850
Now volume scatter is very similar but it's kind of opposite in a way.

152
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.450
So you're telling it which colours are being absorbed.

153
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.340
So in this case the blue you can see opposite is the yellow surface absorbing a lot of blue and the

154
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.780
output is mainly yellow.

155
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:57.690
If I tell it to absorb all the green and of course don't go all the way because otherwise you'd get

156
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.930
a complete zero on something and which is something we don't want.

157
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:09.720
If we go let's say to here we can see that the pink light is being scattered etc etc etc. says the opposite

158
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.340
side of that colour wheel.

159
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.150
Now when we look at the nodes set up we get something.

160
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.050
Well it really highlights what's going on in the background here.

161
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:25.670
So if we're playing with the volume scatter it needs to be plugged into the material outputs in these

162
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:31.760
to be plugged into the volume inputs of that material outputs otherwise it won't work and it actually

163
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.240
says here volume and we've got a green shader outputs.

164
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.360
So it's looking for a shader input that's also a volume.

165
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.950
If we plug it into a surface it doesn't work because it's not set up to do that.

166
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:49.890
The other thing to show you guys is the anisotropic filter.

167
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.780
Where is that anisotropic in this tropic.

168
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.810
I'm being complete we go.

169
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:01.490
So anisotropic basically means it changes depending on the direction at which the camera and slash lighting

170
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.500
is hitting the object.

171
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:10.060
So in this case an anisotropic is used as a control here and a stroppy amateur tropica I don't know

172
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.820
how mispronouncing that amateur trophy up anyway.

173
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.810
It depends on the handler which the light is.

174
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.290
And we end up with a very good looking saucepan lid.

175
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.080
If we get the settings quite right there.

176
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.150
Perhaps not on a cube but we get the effect there if you look on the bottom of a metallic saucepan of

177
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.240
what's going on.

178
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:37.720
So it's very very good for metallic objects it's basically directional reflections in that case rotation.

179
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:42.720
Well that kind of skews that and makes it look a bit odd in places.

180
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:48.340
But it will have its its time and place depending on the model that you're working on.

181
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.740
So that's only a couple of these shaders gone over.

182
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.700
And of course it's time for a challenge.

183
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:03.600
I would like to go and play with shaders so set up a series of basic objects just use primitives to

184
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:10.200
get the hang of this and obviously watch for facets as well so if you are going to use anything that's

185
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.520
basically smooth you want it to be as smooth as possible in the first place.

186
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:23.130
So bear in mind if you're making a sphere or you're making a cone etc. just to make sure you don't have

187
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:29.730
artefacts when your rendering apply the same shader to each one of these objects you can see how it

188
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.970
affects different objects at the same time.

189
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.790
Remember you can use a render board has to speed up rendering so you have to render the entire scene

190
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.010
you can draw that render border around your work so you don't have to wait for your computer if you've

191
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.920
not got a particularly quick one to render the scene.

192
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.050
Remember you can lower your samples as well just in case you've turned them up at some point in the

193
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.740
past.

194
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.330
I wouldn't recommend any more than 10 wash to do in this testing.

195
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:03.680
Try out all of the shaders one by one to see their effect on those primitives on those objects and you'll

196
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.020
get an idea and a feeling about how they're going to work.

197
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:14.660
When you start using them on other objects as well remember volume shaders need to be plugged in to

198
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.860
the volume input of the material output node.

199
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.440
They're designed to work on the volume of the shape not just its surface.

200
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.430
So a video now and give that a go.

201
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.540
Okay guys.

202
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.550
Welcome back.

203
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.490
Let's go play with some shaders.

204
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.530
Okay so we're back over in blender and I'm going to go and open up a file.

205
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.070
I was working on earlier just a few extra primitives in it.

206
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:41.960
And here we go.

207
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:47.630
We've got smooth shading applied to four of the objects here and the others are flat.

208
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.360
So let's hop into rended mode so we can see what's going on.

209
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.900
And I have got the man lights a peachy creamy colour at the moment.

210
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.110
So with diffuse we know what that looks like we'll play with that.

211
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.450
Lots hair does look very odd.

212
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.000
Did you notice that when you played with hair he heads up faceted all over the place.

213
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.460
Of course this shader is in fact designed for hair not thick objects.

214
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.550
But there we go.

215
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.050
If that's a pattern you're looking for and something.

216
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.470
Well it's there and ready for you if you want to use it.

217
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.930
So let's see what else we got here.

218
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.160
Volume absorption.

219
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.970
Of course we can't use that on the surface we need to use that on volume.

220
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.020
That was great fun to play with glossy.

221
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.370
I always love glossy I like shiny things.

222
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.770
Call me a magpie.

223
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.910
I can make things reflective and we've already played with making this roughness just a little bit more

224
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:45.380
sensitive before I quite like the tune shade whereas it bit the further downtown.

225
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.310
Now I thought this is quite cool.

226
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.550
Give us a more cartoony appearance to your models.

227
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.080
And there were two options here.

228
00:16:53.180 --> 00:17:01.650
Diffusive glossy glossy had a much harsher reflection to non reflective area I suppose that's right

229
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.540
with it being glossy size I quite liked having that quite high up because it gave more of that comic

230
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:17.290
book type feel to its core smoothing just made those those boundaries a little less harsh.

231
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:23.460
Although when he wakes up a size so high it didn't really make sense raising the smoothness because

232
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:29.390
it made it quite bland by quite like the the output that this gives a very cartoony very.

233
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:35.950
That's basically what it is it's a toon shader it's supposed to look more cartoony velvet's now.

234
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.860
It was an interesting one for me that kind of looked more like.

235
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.860
Well obviously it's supposed to be velvet so why.

236
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.680
Let's make it a luscious deep red or gorgeous.

237
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:54.220
But it reminded me more of the diffuse shader with the black splodge facing the camera than about you.

238
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.170
But that's how I felt about it when I first saw it.

239
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:04.560
Now I do know that it's useful for doing surfaces that have a house slightly hairy like fine the hair

240
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.500
on a face or something along those lines.

241
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:13.890
So it can be used much more subtly than this extreme example translucent that's always fun to have.

242
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.520
Of course these are designed to.

243
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:23.160
Some of these are designed to be used with other shaders so translucent as the main sounds is just letting

244
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:30.240
light through our model which is great but of course it would be better if it was mixed with something

245
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:36.160
else to make it semi transparent glass is a good one to play with.

246
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.980
Now there are shader itself has got some spec clarity to it so it's glossy and refraction down in the

247
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:50.360
bottom is basically the glass shader without reform without the gloss added to it.

248
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:58.350
So very similar but this is more of a I suppose a plastic sort of feel to it rather than a glass.

249
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:05.880
Now the one that will get most people is hold out because you're very unlikely to use it unless you

250
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.320
are trying to separate something out later on in the compositor.

251
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:16.650
Essentially hold out adds a value of zero for any object that actually has that material applied to

252
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.110
it.

253
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:24.060
And when that happens it means that later on you can fill it in in a render in the compositor.

254
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.430
But we're not going to use that in this particular section at all.

255
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.540
So lots of different ones to play with.

256
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.870
Did you have any particular favourites.

257
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.830
Say I quite liked to know that was one of my favourites because it had that high contrast to it.

258
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.440
Did you end up mixing or adding any of the shaders together.

259
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.750
Did you get some effects that you really liked.

260
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.400
I quite like mixing emission with certain shaders because it makes the objects glow as I said I like

261
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.170
shiny things.

262
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.190
Anyway if you've come up with some great shader combinations I'd love to see them in the discussions

263
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.140
and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
