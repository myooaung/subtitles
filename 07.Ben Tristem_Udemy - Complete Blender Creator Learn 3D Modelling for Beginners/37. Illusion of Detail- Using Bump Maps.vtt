00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.820
Welcome to illusion of detail using bump maps in this video you will use a text to control how light

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.190
is interacting with a surface.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.780
We'll see how to use texture as a bump map him blend render and use generated textures rather than hamade

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.610
just to speed the process up.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.370
If you want more control of course you can make the texture by hand.

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.920
So before we hop in a blender Let's have a quick overview of bump maps in general.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.220
Now normal and height or displacement maps are both types of bump map the term but maps often thrown

8
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.620
about.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.660
But it does in Corpus.

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.590
Both of those because they both change how light interacts with a surface.

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
We're going to use a displacement map in this particular example.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.780
We'll move onto normal maps later on.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.800
Now what they do is they tell a shader how to interact with light so as a light ray goes across a completely

14
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.850
blank surface.

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.250
It usually just bounces off in a certain way.

16
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.600
However what we can do is use a texture and this can give the illusion of detail on a surface.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.070
It fakes highs and lows so we get some detail on our surface.

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.670
They can increase render speeds versus using geometry alone and not only that they can speed up construction

19
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550
speeds as you'll see in a few moments.

20
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.670
There's absolutely no way that without using a texture would ever be able to make a brick look a bit

21
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.170
more brick like.

22
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.830
So let's have a quick look at hite's Maps vs. a normal map and see the difference.

23
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.460
Here we have a very simple jagged surface.

24
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.670
And as you can see the low points of the surface is dark and the high point is white and you can see

25
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.210
there that they drift from one level to a mid grey then to a black again and then to wide as it reaches

26
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.690
the highest point down to mid grey and up again.

27
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.200
Now that is showing the height differences not necessarily the direction of the faces.

28
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.900
With a normal map they don't display any height information.

29
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.360
They simply show the direction that the faces when we fake them would be facing so we can see here that

30
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.430
despite the fact that the faces themselves are higher up there's no change in the normal direction of

31
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.050
that particular face.

32
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.200
And of course we'll cover normal maps in a bit.

33
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.640
So let's go play with displacement maps now or height maps over and blend up.

34
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.100
Okay so we're back over in blender and I'm going to apply these bump maps.

35
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.220
This displacement map to my wall piece.

36
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.240
First of all for testing and I just want to show you here.

37
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.070
The textures does look slightly different.

38
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:06.090
I went in and spent about another half hour 45 minutes or so just adding a bit more detail to my my

39
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.360
base colour there and I think that's turned out rather well.

40
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.810
It's obviously not super detailed but I like the way it's come out.

41
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.490
Am I am going to switch to blend render.

42
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.160
Must blend again blend a render.

43
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.530
Okay I'm just going to sort out my windows here so we can see what's going on.

44
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.950
On a turn on rendered mode in the viewport shading and we don't see anything and the reason we don't

45
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.160
see anything is because we are still using the node setups on so and toggle that of course you can use

46
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.040
nodes for Blender and I've just elected not to so I can switch between these two setups to move across

47
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.910
to the texture's tab and add in a new texture.

48
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.650
Now we have a list of textures at the top here in blender render which we can use within our model and

49
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.330
for the moment what I'm going to do is go down to the next text just slots.

50
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.520
And add a new texture.

51
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.310
I will change the type of texture to something I'm going to choose.

52
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.670
Clouds I think that's going to work out pretty well.

53
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.240
We can see over in the viewport.

54
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.680
It's gone a bit odd and I'll explain what's happening there in a moment and this texture here is not

55
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.160
very well named so I'm going to call that displacement.

56
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.310
All very badly displacement.

57
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.800
There you go.

58
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.120
And this one here I'm going to call block work not block block work but just block work.

59
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.240
Okay so we've got this texture underneath this one and it does work in is it the order here does matter

60
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.360
it does work its way down so if something is.

61
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.280
Here in the second position.

62
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.060
If we move it to the first position we can see it's overwritten with block work.

63
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.120
If we can't see this other texture and that's because both of these are trying to control the colour

64
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.540
they're trying to influence the colour.

65
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.230
If I scroll down here until we get to where it says influence we can see that they're both trying to

66
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.250
control the colour and in this case the texture itself the black and white texture is saying where it

67
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.150
is black.

68
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.450
I don't want it to control any of the colour and where it is white.

69
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:26.180
I would like it to control the colour based upon this colour down here so if I changed this to blue

70
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.720
it'll be the cream and blue if I change it's any other colour it will be there.

71
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.750
Green and cream.

72
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.380
Now I don't want those clouds to control the colour.

73
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.100
I would rather they controlled something else and I can have them control the secularity and if I turn

74
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.170
the intensity down a little.

75
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.030
Let's go for point eight let's say.

76
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.710
Now when I move around you can see that this particular wall piece is reflective in certain places and

77
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.890
not in others.

78
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.000
And that's to do you do with that texture it's saying where there is reflection and where there is not

79
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.500
reflection.

80
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.230
Now since we're working with displacement maps you may think that's the right one to pick here.

81
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.090
Under geometry is displace.

82
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.850
You've probably been reading down here.

83
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.020
Gone are about to click on displays.

84
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.420
Well let's do it and we can see there.

85
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.010
It doesn't do anything.

86
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.880
The reason for that is for in order for a displacement map to actually display something it has to have

87
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.560
something to splice.

88
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.380
Now that does sound like a tongue twister that basically there's not enough geometry in this model currently

89
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.660
for anything to be moved about.

90
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:44.990
I would actually discuss actually using textures to control geometry later on not in this particular

91
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.520
section.

92
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:52.310
This is all about the illusion of detail not creating detail so I will want to put a tick in the normal

93
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.860
box.

94
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.460
Now even though that black and white image isn't a normal image blender render can work with it.

95
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.540
And here we see that we end up with a bumpy surface based upon those clouds that it's generated over

96
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.590
going too far we see that it's it's not perfect.

97
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.370
We see the squares going on here of the pixel changes so we might require something a bit more high

98
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.200
rez at some point but for this stage it's absolutely fine.

99
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.000
Now we control the normal amounts.

100
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.050
Obviously if we bump up the maximum five it looks really really bumpy.

101
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.110
Now that is no good for a wall but that might be good for some muddy floor or something along those

102
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.090
lines that has a lot of bumps ridges in it.

103
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.770
If we set it to something like point five then we get a much more subtle effect.

104
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:48.170
If we decide to go negative it simply inverts the colours so the highs become lows and the lows become

105
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.940
highs.

106
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.390
Now that is going to produce a different pattern to this.

107
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.670
If I whack it all the way back up again.

108
00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.130
But essentially it is the same pattern just where it's fakin going in and out.

109
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:06.200
Now one thing to bear in mind with the illusion of detail is where it breaks down is the edges.

110
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.480
If I rotate this round and see that there aren't any bumps there are no bumps in this model at all.

111
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.440
And that's where this illusion can break down especially around the edges.

112
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.430
So that's something to bear in mind.

113
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.830
Now I've been playing with this.

114
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:31.250
And I think a normal value of point five is actually about right and that comes out pretty good.

115
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.750
And there we go the displacement maps in a nut shell using Benda render.

116
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.950
And I have got a challenge for you guys.

117
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:45.900
I would like you to create a cycles based bump map so render yourself a nice example of the blender

118
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.650
and a set up and use it as reference material.

119
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.530
See you've got some guidance to how you want the new cycle's render to look like.

120
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.670
Use a bump node to control your diffuse shaders normal impact.

121
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.430
Experiment with the nodes to get a similar appearance.

122
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.770
Now do bear in mind there is no correct method.

123
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.850
So remember there is no right way of doing this.

124
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:20.220
There will be multiple solutions however you can use a minimum of two nodes a generated textured node

125
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.200
and a bump node.

126
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.970
In order to do this.

127
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.190
Being creative can end up with awesome results.

128
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.310
Sometimes the unexpected can end up being better than what you planned.

129
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:39.950
So remember to play around with these settings and remember to think through your nodes logically at

130
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.370
the end.

131
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.740
I'll go through some alternatives and the pros and cons of using those as well.

132
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.100
Couple of hints for you.

133
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.520
There is no cloud texture in cycle so you're going to have to use something else and there is lots of

134
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.310
choice.

135
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:59.840
And I'd like you to plug the texture into the diffuse colour inputs to see what it looks like.

136
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.710
You don't have to do that but it's a great idea to get an understanding of how that texture that you're

137
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:13.400
using to control actually looks so you can just plug it into the colour input of the few shader and

138
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.480
see what it looks like and then you can replug everything Backhouse in as well.

139
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.800
Pause video now and give that a go.

140
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:29.180
Okay so let's go ahead and set up this in cycles so I'm going to go to my materials and enable nodes

141
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.330
and switch over to cycles render.

142
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.640
Now I'm not going to have my reference image on the screen because I've got it quite busy as it is at

143
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.090
the moment.

144
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.350
I'm just going to try and create myself a little more space on here.

145
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:48.710
And well this is one of these examples where a floor would be quite useful on our model so we can see

146
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.200
it a bit more in situ.

147
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.920
So I am literally I hope that's on the ground.

148
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.020
I'm going to go into object mode create a circle.

149
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:06.410
Just for it to exist on and scale that up or it's way over there that's not gonna work quite as I expected

150
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.000
it to.

151
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.900
Let's just add another circle and delete the other circle in a moment.

152
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.840
Too many circles.

153
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.290
Now can I add a circle.

154
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.930
Scale that up.

155
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.150
Well that's an invisible circle at the moment.

156
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.120
It's kind of cool Why is that invisible.

157
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.700
That's very good question because it's not filled.

158
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.690
There we go.

159
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.530
So that's roughly on the base of this.

160
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:35.530
Just to give it a bit of presence and I'm going to make I am going to make that in fact slightly glossy.

161
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:41.480
I'm going to go for glossy So it looks like it's reflecting and increase the roughness.

162
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.680
So a rough glossy material that's looking good.

163
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.440
This sun isn't looking particularly bright is a sunlamp the strength to turn up a little.

164
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.610
Okay so now we need to set this up in cycles which of course will be slightly different.

165
00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.770
So first of all let's switch across to cycles and make sure we're now using nodes for our material use

166
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.360
nodes.

167
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:03.870
There we go.

168
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.210
So we've got our base to fuse texture back again.

169
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.550
Now I've got a reference image off to one side that can't for everything on my screen Unfortunately

170
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.330
if I bring everything on here I'll just get confusing.

171
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.910
So I need to modify this.

172
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.700
Let's zoom in a little and see how this is laid out so the output is what we're seeing.

173
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:30.130
And we've got a diffuse shader based on here and the colour is being controlled from that image.

174
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.520
Great.

175
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.880
So that's.

176
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.180
But that bit's set up so we need a nother texture to use for control.

177
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.960
So we need to go ahead and add in texture.

178
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.800
Now if I had an image texture that was appropriate I could use that.

179
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.290
That's no problem at all.

180
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.110
I can pick one of his other textures unfortunately clouds isn't there.

181
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.780
So we're going to have to play with a couple of these and see what we get so I'm going oh I've just

182
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.120
slipped off the menu there.

183
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.810
I'm going to.

184
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.000
First of all start with all brick texture.

185
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.820
Does that work.

186
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:07.950
So I'm going to plug in the colour to the few shader and just see what happens when I try this.

187
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.530
Well it doesn't seem to be producing any sort of textures at the moment.

188
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.050
Anyway I don't think that one's going to help us.

189
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:21.180
It might do actually if we have the vector plugged in so none of these at the moment are being told

190
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:27.540
none of these textures are being told how they are to be mapped so let's go and add in an input texture

191
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:35.020
coordinate and say you are being matched with unique award let's say let's map in the spirit texture

192
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.340
and see what happens.

193
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.710
Oh okay that's that's interesting.

194
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.300
That may that may help us.

195
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.830
I'm not sure I think I'd have to match up the two blocks really well in order to hear that.

196
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.570
But I don't think in this case that's going to help.

197
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:57.640
If we had an already blank wall that might actually be helpful if we wanted those Square style bricks.

198
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.280
I don't I want my other one.

199
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.690
So let's find a different texture.

200
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.000
So let's go ahead and add in texture.

201
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.840
I'm going to try.

202
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.260
Noise.

203
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.430
So the vector that's been mapped out via u v and the colour.

204
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.190
That's plug colour into colour.

205
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.260
Okay so this one's got colour noise and it lets let's plug in the factor into colour.

206
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.900
Theirs are black and white channel brilliant.

207
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:28.880
So now we can go ahead and using the colour the original diffuse texture as the diffuse colour.

208
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.220
And let's see what happens if we plug factor into normal.

209
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.490
No that's not done what we want to so let's pull that out again.

210
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:44.140
By the way when you're doing this there is a preview over in the materials side as well so we can open

211
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:51.040
up the preview that's here and see how that's looking on different types of objects so this is what

212
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.390
it looks like on a sphere.

213
00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.920
This is what it looks like on a plane.

214
00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.040
This is what it looks like on a cube Suzanne etc quite powerful options there.

215
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.090
Well see what it's going to look like on other shapes.

216
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.870
So let's try to factor into their Again narrow.

217
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.360
It doesn't help at all.

218
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.880
All it does is make our image rather dark.

219
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.020
So we need something to convert to that.

220
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:18.160
So it's compatible with this normal inputs and we use a bump no to do that so let's go ahead and find

221
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.150
bumped node.

222
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.180
Well it's under vector of course you could search for bump.

223
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.890
So I'm going to add the bump node in there and using the fact I'm not going to control the normal angle

224
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.700
much control the height.

225
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.170
And then the output here I'm going to plug into that normal.

226
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.850
That is starting to look much better.

227
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.580
Starting get that bumpy feeling again.

228
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.890
Of course it's not going to change the edges or the actual geometry at this point in time.

229
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.290
Is only controlling how flight looks so we can change this distance here and set it up one.

230
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.950
And in terms of strength how well no one's a bit too much.

231
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:02.830
I think I would rather have it with a distance and maybe point to but slightly stronger.

232
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.820
That's up that's okay.

233
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:12.680
I would like it to be a bit more subtle than that so that's try point three and point five.

234
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.470
Yeah they're starting to look much better.

235
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.080
Of course we can tweak these to our hearts content.

236
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.750
And you know be happy with one one moment and the next.

237
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.720
We can also change the texture itself so I can make it a bit more bumpy.

238
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.800
Ah.

239
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.910
That is start.

240
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.560
That's starting to look a bit more interesting.

241
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.430
I'm liking how Suzanne is looking at this point in time.

242
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.040
So that's more of a kind of a rendered finish if I bump this scale up.

243
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.940
What does the detail though.

244
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.820
Well let's let's lower that down.

245
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.090
I think I am going to boost it up to maybe 20 or so.

246
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:52.190
This detail if I lower it all down it's always good to go to extremes with these will with no detail.

247
00:16:52.700 --> 00:17:00.630
It's kind of a smooth bumpy and it tends to get well noisier I suppose with more detail in a distortion.

248
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.700
All that starts adding swirls.

249
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.130
That's kind of cool.

250
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:04.640
Okay.

251
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.260
So this is what I mean by the experimentation.

252
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.540
In fact Blender's gone a bit laggy whilst it's rendering things out there we go with experimentation

253
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.170
you can.

254
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.700
Okay this is no good for our particular wall that we're working on but that's something to remember

255
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.580
for later I'm pretty sure.

256
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.600
So I'm happy with a slightly larger scale there.

257
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.390
And so I'm going to go for too much more detail the eight.

258
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.390
They'll let somebody find out.

259
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.480
Now we've got that as we can see here.

260
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:37.350
It's I can't see the texture underneath anymore so I'm going to have to bring the strength down so I

261
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:43.160
can see the underlying texture as well that is looking pretty good.

262
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.120
I feel I'm going to have to increase the distance here.

263
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:51.570
And again these are tweaks you can go backwards and forwards to your heart's content and do now at a

264
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:58.110
certain distance it seems to make no difference because based upon this strength here I'm going to lower

265
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:05.160
that back down to say poitou so now our wall has a texture on it that will change based upon the light

266
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:11.090
hitting it which is very important that means we haven't baked the lighting information into any texture.

267
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.320
It's being generated based upon where the lights really are in our scene.

268
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.600
Now a couple of other things I would like to do here of course is I am at a stage for it.

269
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.510
Why am I going to do that in this particular solution.

270
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:30.060
And I'm going to play with these a little more until I get to roughly the right point where I want to

271
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.810
be.

272
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.710
I mean you can play with this all day long.

273
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.850
I'm quite happy with that.

274
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:42.480
Now one of the questions that you might have is well why didn't we just plug this factor straight into

275
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.530
that displacement.

276
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.620
And I'm just going to remove the normals that we've created.

277
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.920
Now there's a couple of reasons why we haven't done that.

278
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.120
The first one is we want to control the diffuse shader how to diffuse shader is being handled not how

279
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.790
everything at the very end is being handled so there's a slight distinction and difference between the

280
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.290
two.

281
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.860
But this is also a valid solution for the right effect.

282
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:14.850
Again like most things in blender as long as you get the end desired result a lot of using blender is

283
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:21.390
kind of a mixture of knowledge and just trying things out and making sure you're logical with how you

284
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.790
plug things in.

285
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:29.970
So in this case we do want to specifically control the diffuse shader and how that interacts with light.

286
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.570
If we plug it in all the way into displacement it changes how the whole object or anything else that

287
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.110
this material is applied to interacts with light.

288
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.730
So I'd love to see what textures you came up with and apply to your wall.

289
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.860
How did they look when you move them across to the building that youre creating.

290
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.630
Remember to share in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
