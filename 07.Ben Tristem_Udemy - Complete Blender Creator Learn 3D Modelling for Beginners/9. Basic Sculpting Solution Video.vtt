00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome to the basic sculpting solution video.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.580
In this video you will see my solution to the define your bunny shape challenge in the last lecture.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.620
So let's quickly remind ourselves of that challenge which was defining your bunny shape.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.650
Hopefully you've gone through you've had lots of fun whilst this is happening.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.360
And let's hop straight on over into blender and define my bunny shape so let's hop back to our.

6
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.260
I love these hop references with the bunny don't you.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.390
Let's hop back to our fluffy bunny and the first thing I'm going to do is actually add in some ears.

8
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.550
So I'm going to place the 3-d cursor on the head roughly in the position I want to generate a bit of

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.870
geometry I think let's stop thinking let's go back to our reference material hop around to our.

10
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.290
Other way.

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.050
Control.

12
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.820
There we go.

13
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.580
So the is emanate from somewhere around here and roughly at the back of a head.

14
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.260
Perfect.

15
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.760
So I'm going to add in this case a plane I'm going to rotate round on the x axis to roughly the right

16
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
angle and scale it in.

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.780
So again it's roughly the right size.

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.720
Now I'm going to want to scale it in on its own axis x axis as well by the looks of it.

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
So scale X. So make it a bit flat.

20
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.610
So they're going to pull them in sitting all the way inside our model.

21
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.690
And then I'm going to extrude it up in its own said axis.

22
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.300
In a moment.

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.020
So let's go into edit mode and extrude.

24
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.300
In fact that's probably right.

25
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.430
Why frame off.

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.320
Well I say that's probably right that's probably massive.

27
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.670
There it go.

28
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170
So I can rotate that top.

29
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.110
But again on the x axis perfect pulled it up slightly and pull it up.

30
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.750
I'm going to add a loop cuts in the middle here and again scale that outwards.

31
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.580
That's probably made a bit thickness there.

32
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.770
Okay.

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.650
Scale back in on the x axis only to make it in again this top it's going to want to be thin anyway so

34
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.280
I'm going to select the face and scale it in on the x axis to make thin ought not push it through one

35
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.810
another.

36
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.810
Okay.

37
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.980
Now this whole top area here I'm going to turn this toggle off limiting selection to visibility so I

38
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.810
can go through my model.

39
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.110
If I wanted to but with that face selected I'm going to pull it over slightly to the side just a little

40
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.840
and I'm going to do the same with this area here so I'm going to use border select to select all the

41
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.070
that top area.

42
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.520
And I'm going to selected something I don't want to select actually.

43
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.630
It's clear my selection select.

44
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.170
It's turned back on board a select and they're selected the face.

45
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.400
Let's go to virtex select and that will eliminate that problem.

46
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.700
Excellent.

47
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.600
And just push that bit over as well.

48
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.000
And probably just select the top here and again this is probably me delving a bit too much into detail.

49
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.030
That's fine.

50
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.860
I'm going to select in object mode.

51
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.440
Both are models.

52
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.590
So then I'm just going to duplicate that has got two ears rather than one so I'm going to use a mere

53
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.620
remodify.

54
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.540
Excellent.

55
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.710
And it's going around the point of origin now I don't want the point of origin to be there I want it

56
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.690
to be at 0 0 0.

57
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.110
So with that in mind let's our mirror object.

58
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.820
If I said it the rabbit itself which is still called metal ball.

59
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.970
So sort that out and apply that's there we go.

60
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.220
That's that's better.

61
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.350
Or a rabbit.

62
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.210
Big is that I can model a bit more detail in a moment.

63
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.070
Let's all already add a subdivision surface modifier.

64
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.860
There we go.

65
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.280
It's already looking a bit better now.

66
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.810
Crank it up by one.

67
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.770
Excellent.

68
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.500
And a lie and go got some curvy bunny is now going to select this top one and the bottom one and merge

69
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.930
them together into one object.

70
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.600
And I'm going to call that rabbits of course because it doesn't have a name at the moment.

71
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.120
Excellent so let's get on to sculpting itself so I'm going to frickin to sculpt mode.

72
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.200
And.

73
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.120
Probably going to subtract first of all around the neck area and then it's just going to go round.

74
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.770
Here is symmetry turned on.

75
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.160
Yes Attis and low my strength a little but widen the brush that's a bit too big because I can zoom in

76
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.100
and say well let's.

77
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.890
I need to tidy up my screen so I can see more.

78
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.320
Pull that across.

79
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.640
I should be fine with that.

80
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.830
They're okay so let's go through here.

81
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.540
It's red tape round that's a bit of a hollow in the back of the neck.

82
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.530
That's probably a little too much at the front so that's go and add.

83
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.150
Now the devil is in the detail when it comes to this.

84
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.390
I'm unhappy with the general body shape so let's focus on the head now.

85
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.320
We're going to have to have a lovely little face here someone going to go to the front for you which

86
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.130
will be control and one for me and turn our.

87
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.600
Image off the back.

88
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.020
I'm going to do a very caricature of a mouth.

89
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.600
It's probably quite accurate as well.

90
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.160
I'm going to subtract because I'm going to be pushing into our model and going any dynamics apology

91
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.160
going on since we've got a lot of detail being made here I'm going to go back into object mode and set

92
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.820
the shading as smooth go back into sculped mode.

93
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.840
K I'm going to need a much smaller brush.

94
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.570
I'm going to make it much smaller and zoom in a little way here.

95
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.640
Now I'm going to define the rabbit's nose mouth as well and I do need symmetry turned on and are fine

96
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.090
straight.

97
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.080
Find out straight away of symmetry is turned on it's enabled dynamic top ology.

98
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.940
I think this is the middle of our model.

99
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.400
Yes it is.

100
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.110
So I'm going to put a straight line down here.

101
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.790
And of course your version of your bunny you can do it how you like and then increase the strength a

102
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.220
little.

103
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.530
So you want this well defined.

104
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.590
Now the nose is something like that.

105
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.050
And the mouse is almost the reverse of that.

106
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.210
And of course I've learned how to jaw rabbits from my stuffed teddy when I was little.

107
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.350
How about that.

108
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.370
Okay enough of my teddies and then see how that looks.

109
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.850
That might be a bit Big actually on our rabbit.

110
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.640
But you know what I'm going to leave it like that.

111
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.770
Let's give it more of a nose as well.

112
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.040
So let's bring up the size of the brush a bit lower.

113
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.310
One of the great things about using the short is you can see how big the brush is actually going to

114
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.640
be life.

115
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:36.240
I don't want the strength too high but I need to start defining the nose a little more.

116
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.630
That we might want a bigger brush here and smooth that out.

117
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.620
Lesson learnt here.

118
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.160
That's eating away at my changes down here but that's fine.

119
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.560
So I've actually had a brief look at.

120
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:07.920
A skeleton of a bunny and it doesn't look a thing like what I'm doing here that smooth that out a little

121
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.490
and around there.

122
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.180
Yes we do need a little bit of a dimple in there starting to come together.

123
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.000
Probably a little strong.

124
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.380
Half the problem.

125
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.480
Okay.

126
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.400
And I'm going to smooth some detail around the neck as well.

127
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.130
Excellent.

128
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.290
So that's starting to come together really well.

129
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.660
Now the position of the eyes.

130
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.730
Let's get this accurate.

131
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:41.260
It's always round here and turn my reference on the eye is there and I'm literally going to do a subtract

132
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.660
at full strength and I'm just going to get the brush roughly the right size.

133
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.250
So let's go in.

134
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.960
There we go.

135
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.460
And I'm just going to draw a round and round in a circle.

136
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.870
To give us the eye sockets that we can work on.

137
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:07.260
Now of course that looks quite rough there at the moment and you can go round it and smooth it out.

138
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.670
I don't like that at all so let's come back a little more and just do that again.

139
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.240
That's probably not happening here is enough detail.

140
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.090
So I've zoomed right in.

141
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.340
So now we're going to have much more detail when we come in to fill our model in.

142
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.640
And of course that will go down to a certain level.

143
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.080
Then we can click again and found when increase my breast size ever so slightly and undo that last bit.

144
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.660
You'll find yourself undoing lots whilst you're doing this.

145
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.760
Do not worry about it.

146
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.130
There's no perfect way of doing this.

147
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.510
And literally the amount of time you spend doing it will be proportional to the detail that you can

148
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.400
actually put into your model.

149
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.540
It's as simple as that.

150
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.790
The more and more detail you want the longer it will take of course you've got to be careful not to

151
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:09.030
go too over the top with detail because that's where most of us get caught in drawn in and sucked into

152
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:17.280
making our models because we end up spending far too much time on the model itself instead of where

153
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.080
the detail actually matters.

154
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.210
And I think this whole is in in the bunny's skull is probably deep enough.

155
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.460
Now let's hop out and see and go around.

156
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.950
Yeah that's absolutely fine.

157
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.460
Now I'm going to turn the strength down as I apply smoothing not zero but a little bit more.

158
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:40.250
So I just want the area around the eye to be much smoother than that.

159
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:45.570
So let's go round here and just smooth out the details around here.

160
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.350
So that will make the recess not so big in there.

161
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.170
Perfect.

162
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.080
Then I'd make the brush size just a little small and go around the edge here.

163
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.520
So it's not quite so disastrous.

164
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.520
Kate I don't like this little bit here so we can go back to AD and start adding some stuff back in.

165
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.830
That's absolutely fine.

166
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:14.560
Moving that house a nice big eye there and whilst I'm here I mean that's that's there.

167
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.170
But we can actually model a rough in place.

168
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:27.420
So out of sculped mode into object mode I'm going to click there with the 3-d cursor and add ourselves

169
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.430
an eye as well.

170
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
Well that's a big big player in.

171
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.660
There we go.

172
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.940
And I'm going to rotate that around so the pole is facing outwards.

173
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.200
So that would be along the y axis.

174
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.070
There we go.

175
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.920
That looks okay to me.

176
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:56.240
So let's have a quick look around the model and see some areas that we can focus on a little more now

177
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:02.090
looking at the IS themselves we can actually go and sort some of that out as well.

178
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.410
I'm always conscious of the time I've got in these lectures to show you what's going on.

179
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:11.570
I've got another five minutes or so so let's crack on and do some modelling with those ears.

180
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:18.440
Okay so when you spend a bit more time on it you can define a bit more of your model here and you can

181
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:24.270
see I've gone into a bit more detail around the is itself I've pushed in.

182
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.600
Oh have just clicked.

183
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.620
I just pushed in this area here and help redefine where the mouth is et cetera.

184
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.580
Completely referring to the reference material again.

185
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.530
So one thing I noticed with my reference to in fact looking again I made perhaps a bit too hollow around

186
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:46.790
here but I did notice that the nose here kind of comes to a point and mine didn't it came to a blob

187
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.980
at the end.

188
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.690
That helps to find the nose a bit better again.

189
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.350
Do bear in mind that the fur itself is being added on top of this mesh so you don't need a super detailed

190
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.830
mesh at the moment.

191
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:05.390
I can see here that I probably want my ears to be much bigger as well and I'm going to use a proportional

192
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.510
editing tool in a moment in order to just move this knows about the thing it needs lifting up ever so

193
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.200
slightly.

194
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.510
So I'm going to go ahead and go to edit mode.

195
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.010
Wow there's a lot of geometry there.

196
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.630
I'm just going to dissect everything for the moment.

197
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:26.940
I'm going to select one of these things on the front arm to turn off this see through our model malarkey.

198
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.960
And I'm just going to circle select to select a group of staff at the front of the nose it doesn't really

199
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:41.450
matter in this case which ones I've selected and then I go to move those but I'm going to use that proportional

200
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.410
editing tool.

201
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:53.480
So let's turn proportional editing enabled memory go and let's make it nice and big so we can move our

202
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.610
model.

203
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.120
That's quite useful.

204
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.850
In fact we can move a lot of our model if we wanted to which we don't want to.

205
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.970
We just want to move a much smaller area and points up slightly.

206
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.780
But I do need to be in the right for you to do this.

207
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:13.310
So now I've got VAT's with proportional editing on I'm going to grab it and make sure it's only moving

208
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:19.610
in the z axis up and down and you can see I can raise it up to roughly the right place and I'm going

209
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.620
to pull it out ever so slightly.

210
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.600
Then I can do a very similar thing.

211
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.820
So this is almost like sculpting again but in a different way we're actually just using proportional

212
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:35.180
editing to control a model angle to select this area here on ARM model again and whiz around back to

213
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.940
the side after selecting that area.

214
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.030
If I'm right and I'm going to move it again but this time.

215
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.180
Down ever so slightly now because we're locked to this plane.

216
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:53.990
We should be absolutely fine it shouldn't move in the x axis at all.

217
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.270
Perfect.

218
00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.510
Now this fluffy area here I am not too worried about that because we can add that fluff later on the.

219
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.700
Is themselves let's have a look at the years.

220
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.000
So let's spin round and go up here.

221
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:13.490
Okay so I'm going to say D select what's currently got selected.

222
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.350
Excellent.

223
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.680
And go around to the side view again and use.

224
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.470
Border select.

225
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:28.290
Just select the top of a I once the top of that area on both so limits a selection to visible turned

226
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.450
off round to the side and let's just select the very top of those is brilliant.

227
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:41.340
And then we can move those up and because proportional editing is turned on it will do everything and

228
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.320
using the scroll wheel we can change the size of that pocket there.

229
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.840
Let's see how that looks now much bigger is much better.

230
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.600
Perfect.

231
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.590
Let's whiz round and object those who can see what we've got here.

232
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.510
Excellent.

233
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.040
How did you guys get on.

234
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.920
I'd love to see your bunny rabbits and see how they're coming on.

235
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.450
Did you go for a more caricature of bunny rabbits.

236
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:11.010
Please share in discussions how you got on what you created and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
