00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,210
Hello everybody and welcome back at some point when you've linked to file you may want to make parts

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,130
or all of it local.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,020
So let's talk about some advantages and disadvantages of doing so.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,620
The advantage of course the big one here is you will have more local control.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,360
In fact if you do everything you've essentially appended rather than linked in which case it's just

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,940
like a duplicates a copy of that data in your file without any links to the original external files

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,690
moving a project can stay together.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,410
This is a very important one because if you're dealing with a large project having everything all in

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,070
one file as I'm currently doing in mine is really really useful.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,100
The problem of course is it can balloon your blend file and make it much larger than it necessarily

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,090
needs to be.

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,640
However if you need to share your project with someone else actually appending everything into the scene

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,630
which is having everything local then that that might be the way to go and we'll talk about packing

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,570
into the blend file as well which is incredibly useful.

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,600
It means that any textures you don't need to make sure they're linked to specific places on drives.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,720
They can be baked essentially into our blend file although caution you can get your blend file very

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
large which may take some time to open if you're not careful.

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,590
Disadvantages Potentially more work involved.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:32,010
So one of the issues of course is as you probably guessed or talked a lot about how you can bake things

20
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:39,930
in and then you can share etc. When you have everything local it means that if you make one change you

21
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,750
may have to repeat that elsewhere whereas if you've got something linked in externally that one change

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,180
should affect everything where that particular data block has been linked.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,470
Any edits you make on the original as you're saying their effect all linked data blocks but not the

24
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,790
ones made local.

25
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,910
So that goes for materials it goes for mesh data and it goes for particle systems as well and anything

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,740
that is a linked data block.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,050
So when do you localize.

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,120
This is a great question and there's not going to be a hard and fast rule unfortunately it's going to

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,930
vary depending on your circumstances.

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,350
So a basic one he would just simply be when the link is not required anymore.

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,160
That's that's quite a common one.

32
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,540
Yeah.

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,640
I want to take this and just make it unique and not worry about the other file over there when you want

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,650
to make the asset unique so that moves on from this but in this particular file so maybe that you want

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:40,950
to make it completely unique by altering the mesh data and of course if you're using that file in other

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,680
places what you don't want to do is edit the original and then find that it ends up slightly wrong style

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,840
for instance all the wrong colors or the wrong materials in all of the other files where it's linked.

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,640
Of course if you're just working on small projects you may find that this never becomes an issue but

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,780
it is something to be aware of when you want to make changes irrelevant.

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,910
Other potential projects.

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,430
So that again goes on what I've just been saying you don't want to change your source file and have

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,280
it changed loads of other projects just for the one that you're working on.

43
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,610
OK.

44
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,210
So we have a couple of options when we come to making something local.

45
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,000
There are four in total will run through each one and then we'll go play over in Blender selected objects.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,360
So this close the object data blocks to the new blend file.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,600
Now this won't allow us to edit the mesh data.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,390
It won't allow us to edit the material so it does bring across and it's almost like creating a proxy

49
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,580
at this point in time.

50
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,460
The all the other data blocks themselves remain linked to the original file.

51
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,310
So this allows changing of anything in the object data block but it won't allow any changing for the

52
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,370
rest of the hierarchy underneath option to selected objects and data.

53
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,160
So this will clone the objects and data block into the new blend file another data block is in this

54
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,650
instance when we're talking about an object like a like a cube that will be the data so be the mesh

55
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,510
data.

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:12,440
So now we can edit that file but it does mean that any changes to the mesh data will now be broken so

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,470
we no longer have that link going back to the original file.

58
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,200
But the materials and other data blocks will be linked to the original object.

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,980
So it means that if you update materials then of course they will update in this file that you're working

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,370
in as well option 3.

61
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,250
You can probably see how this is going.

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,980
Selected objects data and materials.

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,680
So this clones the object data her materials data blocks and that means that allows editing of the object

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,980
data and materials data blocks and breaks those links making them local to this file and that's pretty

65
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,680
much almost all of the things you will generally be working on.

66
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,240
And finally option for this is basically appending at this point just with an extra step involved.

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,030
So there is an option here that's all.

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,650
And as it sounds this is pretty much the same as pending the object into the scene is now entirely local

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:12,090
within your new blend file with no links to the original file and we will see that as well because an

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,180
icon will disappear when we do that sort of thing.

71
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,430
Let's go and have a look at this now and hop on over in the blender Hey welcome back.

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,180
Okay so we're about to experience some weird behavior so I've gone back into my Susanne linked so we

73
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,600
can play with making things local.

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,240
I'd like to show you some quirks as well as we go okay.

75
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:41,140
So to make something local we basically have to go over to where we've got the chain itself and go ahead

76
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,930
and click it.

77
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,430
That will remove the links and it doesn't really matter how many times we go ahead and click this chain.

78
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:56,750
However the ones that we duplicated earlier on they don't have the same issue notice here we've got

79
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,540
our shiny green paint so I can come in and change this and look how about that.

80
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,890
These are updating and these ones aren't which is very confusing because looking at the naming structure

81
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:15,790
and let's just pull these out here and have a look at the data within the cube to link proxy was the

82
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,580
one that we made first of all.

83
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:26,560
And yes it looks like here we no longer have with our cube the mesh data is no longer linked and the

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,340
shiny green paint is no longer linked either.

85
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,560
However this one still has it.

86
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,760
We're in edit mode this pair here this cube to link proxy.

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,030
They'll still have it.

88
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,300
So we're kind of in this deadlock at the moment we're trying to work out.

89
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,200
I mean at first glance you think oh OK.

90
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,240
Mike's talked about the hierarchy so if I look at the cube here or perhaps if I go down to the mesh

91
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
data perhaps I can release it there.

92
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
They just won't work with the selected.

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,110
You can go to object relations and make local selected objects.

94
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,470
It just doesn't like it.

95
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,540
So with this first proxy or proxies that you make you just cannot make that change to them.

96
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,940
They're not designed to work like that.

97
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,290
So what you can do instead I'm going to get rid of that proxy.

98
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,180
This is no longer a proxy.

99
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,040
So it can lose the proxy suffix on it.

100
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,760
If we go back to our original linked date to this cube to link it's just they're hiding behind the other

101
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,950
two bulbs every Go ahead.

102
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,700
Now is the time where we can go and make this local sense linked at the moment.

103
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,580
If we come in and get objects relations we've got a couple of options selected objects much like a proxy.

104
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,370
But without all of the caveats a proxy come along comes along with like the inability to change some

105
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,950
of those settings we were having a problem with objects and data that will mean we're able to edit the

106
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,370
mesh as we've discussed before data and materials.

107
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,850
Now we can adjust the materials or we can go for all.

108
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,530
Now when you select all as I've mentioned that is the same is just appending at this point so you can

109
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,010
come in.

110
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:10,870
Press all we're not quite there just yet and I believe that's currently not desired behavior.

111
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,410
I think that is a bug.

112
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,880
The easiest way at the moment may be object to local is to go to the object Data tab and then go ahead

113
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,990
and click.

114
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,480
And there we go we've now got the queue to link and we've got two instances of that we can see.

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,890
And when you click on though and when you click on the changing click on there we get the cube to link

116
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,530
comes back into fashion.

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,380
We can name it here and call it ball finally.

118
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:43,270
And it's got two users we can see there are two users of that particular data in the scene and then

119
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,220
we can come in we've got our cube here and we've got some material and we can't free up the material

120
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,960
yet it's an indirect library data block we cannot change it because it's based upon the mesh data and

121
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,720
the mesh data is linked.

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,350
So we can go ahead and free that up.

123
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:06,240
And once we've done that we can come in because of that hierarchy and make local our green paint swap

124
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,280
it out the other shiny green paint which is red so much better and now everything's all updated.

125
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,410
Now none of these now have any links back to the original.

126
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,870
That's one thing to bear in mind and be careful with when you're making anything local.

127
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,250
So how about a live example of that when we've been playing with it.

128
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,880
Let's go and put that to the test so let's go ahead and open up our proxy church that we've been working

129
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,030
on.

130
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,620
OK.

131
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,240
So now we're in our proxy season or let's say we want to modify this window that we've got here.

132
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,590
Obviously anything object related we can do.

133
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,250
The moment that we make ourselves a proxy or indeed use the library override we are in control of the

134
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,070
object data which can be really useful.

135
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:01,630
But one of the underlying issues with changing the scale or even even the rotation or position of an

136
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:09,130
object in the scene is it can affect modifiers it can affect particle systems and physics in ways that

137
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,980
you didn't conceive it might have done.

138
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,680
So just scaling this up might be brilliant.

139
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,540
And then we can put particle effects on it and it doesn't behave as you'd expect it to.

140
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,500
Because when we try to apply our transforms we can't do it.

141
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,460
It's a multi-user object.

142
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,120
So sharing match data is something else.

143
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,590
So we can't just apply it because it would change everything down the chain.

144
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,150
That's a safety mechanism to protect yourself.

145
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,580
And the reason why you might want to either make something local or make it unique.

146
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,320
So this point we can come in and make this mesh data here unique.

147
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,740
The moment we do that we should be able to apply all of our transforms multi-user objects.

148
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,880
So the windows are as you want mesh cube.

149
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,360
Eleven is multi-user.

150
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,750
In fact we didn't have to even have an error come up to see that it sees as two uses here.

151
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,010
So go ahead click on that.

152
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,740
It's now unique user.

153
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:15,230
And then we can go ahead and apply all of our transforms which means that this is really this big now.

154
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,150
Of course we could go into edit mode and do that in the first place but we are still had to of unlinked

155
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,590
the mesh data in order to be able to do that.

156
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,760
Now that's an obscene size and I don't have any control over it which is something I don't like.

157
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,100
I don't know how that big how big that is now because I've applied it all in particularly paying much

158
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,120
attention.

159
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,210
That can go.

160
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,230
Let's go through the process again let's link that across.

161
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,660
There we go.

162
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,080
We've got two windows here and of course the other way of doing this is with this window selected again

163
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,330
if I went shift in day rather than alternate day we've effectively made its own unique object with its

164
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,270
own unique mesh data that we can go in and edit straight away.

165
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:08,460
Now remember that will now be unique to this file which may be what we want if we want this to be the

166
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:14,640
end of the churches and we want the big window but we didn't want to keep modelling all of this extra

167
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:22,620
stuff we could come in and perhaps scale it on the z axis by two and knowing us that's probably not

168
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,450
quite right so let's undo that for the moment and scale on the z axis by four or three.

169
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:30,880
There we go.

170
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,130
That's pretty good.

171
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,920
Let's scale it on the x axis by 2.

172
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,230
Yeah.

173
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,740
There we go.

174
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,720
It's pretty good.

175
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,660
And now we could surround it with stuff if we wanted to.

176
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,710
Does the floor piece fit in still.

177
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,660
Or do we need an extra floor piece if we do that the floor piece also fits in.

178
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,010
Absolutely fine.

179
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,290
That's one of the things you've got to bear in mind if you go ahead and scale things.

180
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,740
And of course the bricks are now all the wrong size.

181
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,710
That's the downside of just scaling randomly.

182
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,220
But you get the idea how we can mockup a building and sort out all this incidental detailing later on

183
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,590
if necessary.

184
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,900
Okay.

185
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,660
Awesome.

186
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm going to leave that information with you so you can play with it and make your building your own

187
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,200
and that's really where I wanted to go at the end of this lecture I want you to think about any extra

188
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,340
pieces you need.

189
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,550
Are there any special objects like perhaps this big window here that you can make do with just scaling

190
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,030
one of your existing Windows if necessary now.

191
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,230
I'll be honest at this point in time I'm not particularly planned mine to be this particular scale at

192
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,170
the moment and I would encourage you to just be experimental at this stage while you're still putting

193
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,220
things together.

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,930
You never know you might get one of those happy accidents happening and I really love it when those

195
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,670
two.

196
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,870
So go ahead make sure you fleshed out your your parts pieces and anything else you need to do.

197
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,790
Have fun and experiment with your building and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
