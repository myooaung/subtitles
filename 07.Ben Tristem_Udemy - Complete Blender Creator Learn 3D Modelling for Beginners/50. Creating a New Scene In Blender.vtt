00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to creating a new scene in blender.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.800
In this video you will learn how to create a new scene.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.580
After we've done that we'll see a way of adding light rays in blender using the world volume settings.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.950
There are other methods to doing this as well just to let you guys know.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.710
However we're going to be using the world settings as it works best.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.770
In our case with the building we're doing so let's hop straight on over in a blender.

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.210
Okay so we're over in blender at the moment and what we're about to do with the volume settings.

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.740
Well the it only works with spotlights.

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.220
So the environmental lighting and any other sun lamps or any other lamps that you've got in the scene

10
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.860
where she worked for volumetric lighting which is a bit of a shame but that's how blender is at the

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.370
moment.

12
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.270
Of course it gets updated regularly so more and more options may become available in the future.

13
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.080
So first of all what we're going to do is create a new scene because we're changing fundamentally how

14
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.730
this scene is going to be lit and some of the other settings we can go into a new scene.

15
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.270
And then we don't need to worry about it now.

16
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.370
You may have noticed seen at the top in the outliner or you may not have paid much attention to it and

17
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.910
just worked further down here each individual scene is self-contained it contains the render layers

18
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.640
the world and all of the mesh and other objects you have in your scene.

19
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.830
Now on top info ahead a bar there's a little plus button next to scene and at the moment.

20
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.440
This is not got a names.

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.250
I'm just going to call it Gothic church.

22
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.340
Now my scene is actually named.

23
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.770
And we can see it's named up here as well.

24
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.170
Offic church now it clicked the pause button here and it gives us a couple of options.

25
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.390
We can create a brand new scene so it'll be an empty seat in this we used to when we opened a brand

26
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.070
new blend.

27
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.450
Now this is useful if you're working on something else that's got something to do with your Gothic church

28
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.390
or your office etcetera that you're working on and you want to keep it all in one blender file.

29
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.020
We can copy the settings from one to another but with no objects as says Caesar we can link objects.

30
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.520
Now of course the good thing about linking the objects is it means that anything you change in the scene

31
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.880
one will go across to the second scene as well that were about to create a link object data so we can

32
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.920
do that as well.

33
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.690
And finally a full copy.

34
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.620
Now that will make a copy but changes will not go backwards and forwards.

35
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.040
And I am going to select all copy in this book.

36
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.370
In this case because I just want to work on it as is in isolation.

37
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.500
Essentially something go ahead and click for copy in its cool Gothic church as the one we used to this

38
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.180
by now and Im going to call this light rays because thats what it's all about.

39
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.750
So I've got this indoor scene here and we want to add light rays to it.

40
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.920
Now there are various ways of doing this.

41
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.300
But the best one is the world option so we go in the properties menu here to the world options itself

42
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.670
and under volume there's nothing currently selected So let's go to volume and where it says none we

43
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.050
can change that and it needs to save volume scatter.

44
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.830
So I'm going to go ahead and click on volume scatter.

45
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.410
Now a density of one is relatively thick and that's not going to produce very nice results.

46
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.940
Now before we go and start playing with these options I'm going to go into the render tab of the properties

47
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.430
and just scroll down.

48
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.970
And I'm going to change my light path's to direk light.

49
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.170
That's just going to make it nice and quick to render our case and now that that's been done I'm going

50
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.020
to go back to World properties and on the density I'm going to turn that down to about Point one for

51
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.120
the moment ask.

52
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.330
See how that goes and adjust it from there.

53
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.630
The other thing that we may want to do here just to speed up our volumetric calculations is under the

54
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.800
settings we can turn on some modernness and we can put a tick in that and that just makes it quicker

55
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.610
to render.

56
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.100
Now in this it could be rectangular.

57
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:23.590
The volume settings shift here the equal were is good for outdoors and the distance is for this or indoors

58
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.750
lit up by the sun outside and things like that so.

59
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.540
Or if you've got a mixture of things you can go for multiple important so I'm going to set that to distance.

60
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.360
Okay.

61
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.770
So now that I've got the scene roughly set up let's just move on over into rendered mode and we can

62
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.110
see that it's pretty dark.

63
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.830
And the reason why it's pretty dark is because the light in our scene comes from two places a sunlamp

64
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.610
that's placed in the scene and the environment.

65
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.960
None of which affect the lighting triangulations were in doing volume.

66
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.780
So what we need to do here is go over and find our lamp.

67
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.110
Or if you've not got one you're going to have to go and create one.

68
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.650
I have got a sunlamp in my scene so I can go ahead straightaway and change that from a sunlamp to a

69
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.450
spot lamp.

70
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.670
Now that's not going to be good enough just yet because what happens with the spot lamp is the light

71
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.810
falls off.

72
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.300
The further you get away from it.

73
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.950
So we need to make sure that that's constant.

74
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.050
So what we can do here is go into the node properties of that.

75
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.570
Particular lamps so we go to the node editor and we can see that there's a lamp out at the surface and

76
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.380
it's an admission which is great and the strength is currently at five.

77
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.870
If I put that 50 we might be able to see it's 500.

78
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.650
No it's too far away it's not actually reaching the church building itself at the moment.

79
00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.160
So what we can do here is set this strength the light fall off the further away it is we can set that

80
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.970
to a constant value so acts more like the sun as it goes through the scene.

81
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.160
So going to add a node in here.

82
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.240
So we go to out and go to colour.

83
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.880
You see there's an option here like to fall off.

84
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.340
Of course if you know it contains fall off we can go to search and type in fall off.

85
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.470
And there it is.

86
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:27.110
So now we've got that we can line up for constant outputs of the light fall off with the strength and

87
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:34.220
then turn the strength up to three 50 400 something along those lines.

88
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.250
Now it doesn't seem to be affecting our scene at the moment.

89
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.550
There's a couple of things that we need to check.

90
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.300
I'm happy with everything as it set up here.

91
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.250
But what I don't know is where the lamp is and where it's pointing.

92
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.920
So that's quite important so I'm going to go into solid shaded mode.

93
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.500
Okay.

94
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.840
So the lamps over here and it's pointing into the building.

95
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.740
So that looks pretty good to me.

96
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.480
Quickly render that and see if it's lighting up the outside we can see here is getting through here.

97
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:09.140
Now I think that the light is actually being absorbed by the volumetric shading that we've got going

98
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.930
on in the environment.

99
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.300
So what I'm going to do here is still looking from the outside because that lamp is well it's well it's

100
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.140
not being isn't even lighting up the ground so that's no good.

101
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.610
Let's go ahead and go to the world properties here and scroll down the density here let's make it 10

102
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.980
times lower Let's go nought point nought one.

103
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.930
Aha.

104
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.520
That is much better.

105
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.520
Let's see what that looks like inside as well.

106
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.560
How that is looking much much better now.

107
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.060
Now it's still a bit dark in there and that's where we can use a couple of tricks to bring the light

108
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.960
levels up.

109
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.460
Now the moment because we've got the light paths on the render tab set a direct light there's not that

110
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.200
many bounces going on.

111
00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.260
Certainly by changing that to limited global a nation for global illumination or just changing the settings

112
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.860
here.

113
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:09.060
So for instance increasing the number of diffused bounces the volumetric bounces as well will help here.

114
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:14.370
So what we can do here is literally just render this out and see what it looks like and then take a

115
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.630
base from there.

116
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:22.620
Again make sure that you've got a relatively low resolution because the volumetric calculations is going

117
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.810
to take a while to do.

118
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.190
Now of course this I don't know quite how it's going to look when it's finished.

119
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.200
It looks like we've got some rays coming in.

120
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.750
It's looking pretty good there.

121
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.430
Okay that is looking pretty good.

122
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.730
Now it's going to pause the render there and I'm going to switch to another render slots to perform

123
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:47.420
a change test but a not would diffuse back down to zero and go ahead and render that again.

124
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.070
Now this is going to be slightly quicker in its processing but it's going to have less bounces in the

125
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.630
scene.

126
00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:01.530
Now that is a style choice of course if you want to add more realism with the different bounces but

127
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:08.580
this is going to end up much darker because light is not going to be bouncing off certain areas and

128
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.320
we can see already it's had a much in well it looks much more contrasty.

129
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:20.630
So that's with one bounce enabled so you've got some details where the light is not directly hitting.

130
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:27.420
And if we go to here we see that it's a much darker image but I think that's a bit more atmospheric

131
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.790
as well so there's a there's a kind of a toss up there between your style choice that you want to go

132
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.140
for that looks pretty good.

133
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.160
And of course with that it's time for a challenge.

134
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:50.380
I would like you to go ahead and add volumetric lighting so you may have to use s.p. you rendering for

135
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.420
this depending on your graphics card.

136
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.170
And depending on your version of blender as well.

137
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.120
So bear that in mind if you're if it's not working for you.

138
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:08.220
Create a new scene and then add some volumetric lighting to your new scene and see how that comes out.

139
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.770
Borzov video now and give that a go.

140
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.470
Okay guys.

141
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.460
Welcome back.

142
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.580
I'm going to hop back into my blend file now and just see if there's any optimizations that I want to

143
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.280
make and see if we can make this scene even better.

144
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.170
Okay so that's looking pretty good.

145
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:34.340
Obviously that's pixillated because of the amounts I've turned down the resolution I've put it at 25

146
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.320
percent of 10 ATP there.

147
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.120
Amber I quite like that dark atmosphere.

148
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.810
And I think I could if I could just bring that up just a little it would probably make a much better

149
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.920
impact on my scene.

150
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.060
So with that in mind I'm going to try.

151
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.650
Well let's scroll down here.

152
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:59.040
Let's try turning up the amounts of bounces that happen through the volumetrics of the light that's

153
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.050
coming in.

154
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.670
Let's see if turning that up adds to the ambience of the room I don't want it much lighter than it already

155
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.220
is.

156
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.380
Adding one to the use she made it too bright for me.

157
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.900
Let's go ahead and render that and see how it looks and obviously pick and who render slop before I

158
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.630
do so.

159
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.020
Otherwise I won't be able to compare one to the other.

160
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.060
Okay so this render here is coming up to the end of it.

161
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.380
And is it why it's different to the first one it's certainly lighter.

162
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.580
And that is adding a lot of definition here in the in the pillars in the columns that are there.

163
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.660
And I like that's that's all bringing that forward.

164
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.580
It has made this scene a little noisier.

165
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.380
Presumably because of those volumetrics.

166
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.530
So what I need to do here of course is render it at a much higher sample rate.

167
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.970
I'm happy with how that's looking at the moment so I'm going to render it now at I'm going to renderer

168
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.870
a higher resolution for a stance that's going to take longer to do and I'm going to render it.

169
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.410
I'm going to do the full screen render and then leave.

170
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.750
Five hundred might be a little high but I'm happy to wait.

171
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.850
So I'm going to go ahead hit render and I will see you guys back in a few moments.

172
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.470
Okay so here we go here's the final rendering is still a bit noisy but more and more samples will certainly

173
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.530
sort that out.

174
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.930
But this is looking pretty good it's got the right sort of definition in there.

175
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.160
I can see some detail in the dark areas which is awesome.

176
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.950
That's exactly what I wanted.

177
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.280
How did yours turn out.

178
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.390
I'd love to see them remember to share them with us so we can all relish in your wonderful creations.

179
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.130
Of course as always I will see you guys in the next lecture.
