00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,890
Welcome to linking blend files making local in this video you'll learn why you want to make a link they

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,260
to block local understand we are starting to sever links by doing this.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,280
Learn about the various stages of making it local and decide when would be a good time to localize that

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,400
data block.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,220
So let's go over a couple of advantages and disadvantages that this does.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,680
So one of the advantages is you will have more local control you will have to keep opening up a separate

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,460
blender file and modifying it before seen the changes in your scene search can be a bit quicker.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
Working with it on this way.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
External files if they're moved the project can stay together which is very useful especially if you're

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,870
working in a team or you want to deviate from a path and test something out.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,720
Perhaps now potentially there's a disadvantage there's more work involved.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:07,170
And we have to be careful that when we decide to make something local that we do really don't need that

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,030
link anymore.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,480
Or which links do we need and which ones do we not need.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,500
Remember that any edits that you make on the original affect all linked data blocks but not the ones

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,620
made local.

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,820
So when do you localize.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Well when the link is not required I know that's a bit woolly at this point in time.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,150
How do I know whether the links are not required.

20
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,470
Well if that's the question you are asking then perhaps you shouldn't be actually making something local.

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,380
So when you want to make the asset unique in this particular file so say you were building up this building

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,600
and that we've generated a textual and material that go along with this but you want to take it off

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,290
on a different direction see what it looks like.

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,920
As with a different material applied to it a chrome finish to the wall says or Mary whatever you want

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,970
to do with it.

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,970
Well this may be a time to make the material date or block unique so you don't have to make everything

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,560
unique you can make individual parts of the linked file unique and local to the blend file that you're

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,970
working on.

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,600
The other thing is when you want to make changes irrelevant to other potential projects.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,710
So we certainly don't want to change the material of a wall that we create just so effects this one

31
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,320
because if we're linking that in any other projects that we're working on if we've got a nice assets

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,410
store and we don't want to go ruining every other project we've got with changes that are specifically

33
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,360
local.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,340
Hint there to this scene that we're working on.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,730
So we've got four options.

36
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,970
Option one selected objects.

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,370
So what that does is it clone's the object data block and anything in the hierarchy beneath it to the

38
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,010
new blend file all the other data blocks remain linked to the other file.

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,080
And this allows changing of anything in the object data block.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,700
So now we can scale it rotate it a movie etc. but it does sever that first link.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,520
Option 2 is a little bit more selected objects and data so this close the object and the data.

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,510
Data block to that a new blender file in this allows editing of the mesh data.

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,810
Breaking that link and making it a local file now is important.

44
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,090
If that happens any meche data that you update on the original will not come through.

45
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,270
So that's great if you're trying to make a particular part fit an awkward place in your scene but don't

46
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:42,440
want to edit the original the materials and the other data blocks remain linked to the original objects.

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,610
If you go ahead and change or update any of those when you open up your blend file again you will find

48
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,780
that those come in to this blown thing.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,890
Option three.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,990
Well as you can probably guess the selected objects data and materials clone's the object the data and

51
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,370
the materials data block making all of those available for editing.

52
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,520
This allows the editing of all of those data blocks and breaks those links making them local to this

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,970
file option for.

54
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,400
And this is the final one.

55
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,420
All as it sounds this is exactly the same actually not pretty much the same but exactly the same a pending

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:27,370
the object into the scene is now entirely local with no links at all to the original file.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,410
You can do whatever it was it's is if you had made it in this particular blend file.

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,940
So now we've had an overview of all the different ways that low calls can happen.

59
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,820
Let's go experience this and hop on over in a blender.

60
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay so we are back over in blender and I want to demonstrate this making local.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,560
So the first thing I'm going to do is actually bring in something else so I can work rivets in a link.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,810
I'm going to go in two or are meshes.

63
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,620
I'm going to bring in my mannequins so I can work on that.

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,540
In the scene around object mannequin and link from Library.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,730
So that's now in here.

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,850
Now I don't have to make it a proxy first.

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,360
I can make some of it local straightaway and we can do that under the object menu just like before.

68
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,650
And we've got this make local and you can see the shortcut key is the L key and the here are the four

69
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,360
selected objects.

70
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,530
And here are the four selections that we've gone through the selected objects the selected objects and

71
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,020
data which will then enable us to let's say move it rotate it scale it and then we've got enable us

72
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,250
to edit it enables us to change the materials and just the same as a pending and instead of clicking

73
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,860
one of these at the moment we're going to have another look because we know we can do these but these

74
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,110
don't give us full control or we can make a decision about each one of these items completely individually.

75
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:03,000
So let's make sure the mannequin or whatever you've brought in is selected.

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:11,040
And then we are going to first of all take a look at the major ones here.

77
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,080
So this mannequin I know has object data and we can see it's greyed out at the moment.

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,150
We have meshed data just here and moving forward.

79
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:29,820
We have material data now the mesh and material data are part of the object data so there's no making

80
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,040
that local just at the moment.

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,420
What we'd need to do first is work down that hierarchy.

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,430
So in this case and here's the material laid out here we can see they're all links the mesh data is

83
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,120
linked.

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,860
The material is linked and the object data is linked.

85
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,750
So let's go to the object data first and there's a little button on the end of the name the object data

86
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,190
itself and that will click to make it local.

87
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,140
Perfect.

88
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,500
That's the same as pressing L over here and doing selected objects.

89
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,180
The moment we've done that what clicked on this button here we can see that this is no longer greyed

90
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,370
out and is enabled for editing.

91
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:16,100
That's now local to this file any object data that we change in the source file will not be updated.

92
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,280
Now that does allow us to move it about.

93
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,490
So it's very similar to making that proxy.

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:31,140
However it has now broken the object data link so have we changed any of these other items in the object

95
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,440
data block.

96
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,160
It would not transpire it will not come across to this blend file anymore.

97
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,850
If we go down to the next area which is the mesh data itself that is greyed out and we can click here

98
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,050
and make it local of who we want and that will enable editing.

99
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,090
So now when we hit tab it actually goes into edit mode and we can go about editing this little mannikin.

100
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,250
Perfect.

101
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,290
Well so we have we have the material the materials are still linked as well.

102
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,570
So at any point we can bring in the material that says materials 001 Here's a not very well named.

103
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,270
We can see that is a linked material which means if we change that in the source file even though the

104
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:20,530
mash data and the object data are now local to this file if we go ahead and change that it will update

105
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:20,920
here.

106
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,730
I'm going to go demonstrate that right away.

107
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,730
So what I would do is I will make sure I save the file I'm working on hop over to this other file and

108
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,760
just play with it for a moment.

109
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,670
First of all I'm going to change the material how I'm going to rename it.

110
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,800
I'm going to call it manequin rough material.

111
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,590
So I know what it is now that I've renamed That's what I will need to do to make sure it's absolutely

112
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,040
clear.

113
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,860
Is go ahead and change the colour.

114
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm going to change it to a bright yellow and hop into material mode to make sure that's happened it

115
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,730
has perfect save the file.

116
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,310
Again this is a rough file so I don't mind playing with it.

117
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,960
And let's say on here we want to give them a pened nokio knows sons are going to select a couple of

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,020
faces here and pull it out.

119
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,360
It's going to grab that and proportional editing down a little.

120
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,830
There we go we've got a nose coming out I'm going to lock it to the y axis completely.

121
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,940
So our mannequin now has a nose and a save the file.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,010
And when I go and open up the Gothic church that I'm putting together we will see that the linked data

123
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,950
has been severed.

124
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:42,310
This mesh isn't updating and because we changed the name of that material that has also disappeared

125
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,240
and we can't even see that in the materials list anymore because we've severed the object data which

126
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
itself contained the mesh data and the material data along with it.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,570
Now that's not a big deal we can go and link that bit back in straightaway we can go file out we can't

128
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,560
do it in edit mode so let's hop into object mode and go to link we've got the mannequin here.

129
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm going to go up a level go to material and here we go because we've removed the other material it's

130
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,700
just disappeared it's as if we've deleted it and if we go ahead and open up that material we can then

131
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,670
assign its note as it had.

132
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,930
LS 0 initially has now gone because I was very quick and clicked on it and that's now applied to here

133
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,150
and we've got ourselves a yellow mannequin Okay.

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,560
Let's go in just experiment once more and make sure that wasn't a fluke.

135
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,490
Let's go and save the file.

136
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:44,140
Let's change that mannequin serial colour to something else let's change it to a green or a red.

137
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm gonna change it to a green save the file and now because I've not updated the name.

138
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,970
We should find that it comes across Green.

139
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,390
Perfect.

140
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,800
Okay so a quick challenge for you guys.

141
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,600
What would you make local think about what's in your scene at the moment.

142
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:10,780
If you've already done a range of parts into your interior design and think about do you need to make

143
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,950
anything local.

144
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,550
Have you designed your design so that's not applicable that is entirely possible.

145
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,440
And if you do need to make anything local think about why you would want to make it local and which

146
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,470
data blocks if any you would make local.

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,580
Now do think carefully about whether you need to do that now or whether you're going to develop your

148
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,940
model a little and do that later.

149
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,490
I'm sure at some point you are going to have to make some of your meche or materials local to the particular

150
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:50,380
scene especially if you're experimenting with multiple scenes with the same building blocks coming in.

151
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,060
You might want to make a red building or a yellow building or green building.

152
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,980
Obviously while it might not be if it is a kid's toy building then you might be making then that bright

153
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,250
colour.

154
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:07,540
But you may be doing subtle shades of sandstone or granite or something along those lines where you

155
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,940
want to change the material but only locally in this particular file.

156
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:18,130
And that's a great way of using the same mesh but actually making it look completely different by changing

157
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,030
the material applied to that mesh.

158
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,110
Anyway enough of me rambling I'd like you to go and pause a video and give that ago.

159
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,600
Okay guys.

160
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,800
Welcome back.

161
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,210
Let's go hop back on over in a blender.

162
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,480
So the first thing that I'm going to do here is just lay out my pieces and see what I've got to work

163
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,040
with.

164
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,470
Okay.

165
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,230
So there we go.

166
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,950
There's my pieces all laid out ready to start organizing into certain sections and I've just glanced

167
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,460
at Wikipedia in fact wonderful place for research.

168
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,950
The parts of a church because I hadn't actually got a clue or clue what they called so I'm going to

169
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:02,220
have to make some empties Now just to represent those particular parts of the church so I'll be back

170
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,310
in a few moments.

171
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:10,510
Okay so I've gone ahead and created empties for the five main parts of the church that I'm creating.

172
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:17,520
And I need to organize is a bit better at the moment because I've got it in alphabetical order essentially

173
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,000
which is very difficult when I want to group them by type.

174
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,220
So we're going to go to the View menu here and sort alphabetically I'm going to turn that off.

175
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,430
And there we go we've now linked by an empty then meche object down here which is much better for me.

176
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,770
The next thing for me to do is start organizing these parts.

177
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,780
Actually in these set scenes so I'm going to start with the nave and the isles which are going to make

178
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,740
up the main body of the church itself sort out all the ancillary bits afterwards.

179
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:54,270
So I'm going to start building this up and I'm going to use Linked duplicates of these particular items

180
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,120
in order to construct my church so I'll be back with you guys once again in a few moments once I put

181
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,640
these bits all together.

182
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,830
Now before I got going to sort these out into their various empties over here the first thing I did

183
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,900
was make a parts empty and put everything into that.

184
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,380
Now in order to start using these bits what I'm going to do is I'm going to select them all straight

185
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:23,370
away so I can use them in my model and then go object to link duplicate of course the shortcut key is

186
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,070
Oulton.

187
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,610
And we've got our duplicate objects there but they're still under the weather still under the parts

188
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,110
empty as a parents.

189
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,660
So at this point in time whilst they're still selected what I can do is just hide all of the other empties

190
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,710
apart from the one that I want to work and I want to work on the naved to begin with.

191
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,130
So now because all of those are currently selected than the last one I selected that was the archway

192
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,990
at the top.

193
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,080
I've already forgotten what that's called but I can now click because the only empty left is this one

194
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,750
here I kind of clicked in the outline here but I can also now select it in the 3D view as well.

195
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:10,320
And then I can press control and pay a parent object and then move those copy linked copies.

196
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
That's very important across.

197
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:19,050
That also means that now I can make sure when I select the parts and everything under the parts itself

198
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,300
that we can move that to layer to in fact all of these other ones need to be on layer 1 that we're working

199
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,860
on.

200
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,450
We need to select everything under here and we can do that by control clicking on the nave itself and

201
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,070
then try moving it to lay a 1.

202
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,890
Now when we have a look at Layer 1 we should have all of our bits there layer 2 will also have all of

203
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,990
our parts.

204
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,230
Brilliant.

205
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,630
So let's go ahead now and assemble this.

206
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,120
I am midway through my construction at the moment and I will just say at this point in time that the

207
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,590
wireframe mode is incredibly useful for lining things up.

208
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,030
If I didn't have wire framo turned on that's the Z key.

209
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:06,380
Just remember all you can do it down here on the 3d editor head a bar switch to wireframe And then when

210
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm looking it's hit from the sides.

211
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,550
I can actually move things exactly into the position they need to be in in the course if I'm zoomed

212
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,070
in enough with the increment snap turned on it allows me very fine control.

213
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,110
Excellent.

214
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,900
Let's carry on with the building.

215
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:29,570
Okay I'm finally at the end of my assembly stage so I've assembled as you can see some corner pieces

216
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,780
here to make a funky outside.

217
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,440
Know we're working our interiors but I feel I look pretty cool.

218
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,630
So I did it is as simple as that from the top.

219
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,070
Let's zoom round to the top.

220
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,010
We've got the rough shape that we want going on there.

221
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:53,090
I've added a bit of a side door in terms of the organization of this I have in each area so whether

222
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,100
it's the entrance the Charles or the tower etc..

223
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,500
I have sub areas so in the entrance I have the entrance way sealing the walls the floor etc. and what

224
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:10,760
that enables me to do as was holding down control is I can start to remove bits from the scene very

225
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,390
quickly.

226
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,930
By control clicking the little icon there so I can go through here and remove the tower.

227
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:25,490
And I go through and it lets say move the aisles ceiling etc. So there's lots of powerful things that

228
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,880
I can do by going through here and because I built up in such a way I can actually just remove bits

229
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,640
as and when I want.

230
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,330
Now a couple of things that I have made local here.

231
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:45,380
One of them was this bit at the very end so I have basically made this part to fit in here and I can

232
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,300
take it out the scene and work on it.

233
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,070
Otherwise I'm with them and actually turn smooth shading on.

234
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:58,010
On this particular part whilst I'm here to remember so that part has now been made and is ready.

235
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,690
So that's the last last bit at the end of the church there.

236
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,590
None of these are changed from their standard layout.

237
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,350
Probably gone to add some sort of funky window in there.

238
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,790
Again I'll look up reference material to work out there but that's later on it's a bit of detail.

239
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,650
I've added a doorway down here and let's just turn back on the tower and the entrance way.

240
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:28,490
The towers got a unique part at the top as well because that's a slightly smaller one than the main

241
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,030
roof sections down here but it's a similar style.

242
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,670
It's just been made to fit this area here so that's also a local part as well as this one.

243
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,190
On the end here.

244
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,760
Brilliant.

245
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,970
How did you guys get on.

246
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,700
I'd love to see the church design you've come up with.

247
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,550
Remember to share them in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
