00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,160
In this lecture we're going to have a look at making this Mayan pyramid type shape in front of us.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,070
Now the moment this is all the Fidelity we need so we're not going to go full blown Mayan on this was

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,800
simply setting up the base structure so that we can add more details later and you'll find this is common

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,180
when you're making models in general.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,870
You don't wanna go straight for that high fidelity go for a low poly simple version of your model first

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,600
and then add the details later.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,680
So let's hop on over into blender and use the inset tool to create this object.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,630
Hello everybody and welcome.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,340
So let's have a look at the setting.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm going to go into edit mode and it's a face operation so I'm gonna make sure we've got a face select

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,770
turned on.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,650
Now if I select this top face here extrude it by nothing.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,440
Which is something you can do even that creates geometry on top of itself.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,800
We're not gonna leave it like that so that's okay.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,020
Now we can scale that in and when we do we get an object like this.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,140
And if we extrude and extrude by nothing and scale it in we get a similar sort of step shape as that

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,650
pyramid.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,970
So that's pretty good.

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,160
We can get in and then just make a final edit there to make it look a bit more interesting.

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,510
Okay.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,290
So now we've tested that y about this inset tool.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,490
So let's select the face closest to us over here.

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,170
Now the inset all can be gotten from this tall shelf.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,270
If I press the T key to bring that's up we have inset faces and we can see those shortcut key for it

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,580
is I.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,830
And that is predominately what I will use I will often use the shortcut keys because over time you learn

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,960
that using them is going to be far far quicker than finding the right buttons of press.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,240
However this man you can also be very useful if you have a touch screen for instance you can scroll

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,930
down and tap the one that you want and then carry on with the operation.

31
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,110
And I will upset because it's a face operation we can also find it in the face menu under inset faces

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,500
pretty awesome.

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,920
So let's see what inset faces does.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,990
Oh it seems to do that extruded by nothing and scaling altogether.

35
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,710
Okay let's have a look at the operator panel this produces.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,150
So let's open it up.

37
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,810
And there we go.

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,890
We've got lots and lots of options.

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,760
Some of them only apply if you've got neighboring faces selected when you perform an inset.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,710
Some of them do something completely different.

41
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,390
So let's go ahead and extrude this face out and scale it in.

42
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,180
So it kind of mirrors the top one over here because we're going to play with both of these.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,480
We'll start off with this one at the front that we're already working on and I'm going to insert it

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,890
again and just click now because I haven't done anything else.

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,830
The operator panel will still be there and then we can start having a look at some of these options.

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,310
The first one is the opposite of in the setting which is our setting.

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,870
So instead of moving the geometry inwards here I was to click that you can see it's moving the other

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,490
way and the thickness is pushing geometry back away from that face.

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,580
So that can be incredibly useful if you do need to add a little bit of extra geometry underneath.

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,350
There are other ways of doing this as well.

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,660
There are always other ways of doing things in Blender now going to these select outset for the moment

52
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,370
and I'm going to tweak this thickness here until I get a relatively good size for me.

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,530
Now we've got this depth slider here as well so we can automatically push things out at the same time.

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,830
Now that's really cool because you can do multiple operations all in one go if you wanted to.

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,780
Often I would insert and then move things manually because that to me feels like more control.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,380
However if you know exactly what you're doing and you're just tweaking these figures here then that's

57
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,340
absolutely fine.

58
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,090
Now because I've clicked away when I was trying to show you something.

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,950
I've lost the in setting I've done something else.

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,040
There's nothing I can do to get back to the operator panel has questions asked the lot and unfortunately

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,360
you've done another operation you no longer have access to the previous ones.

62
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,920
Let's select this top one at the top here and do some other stuff.

63
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,170
I'm also going to hold down shift and select these other faces as well under pressure the insect key

64
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,210
and see what happens.

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,390
Okay.

66
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,270
That's interesting.

67
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,540
Hmm what's going on there.

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,060
Well there are a couple of things that you will notice as you go through these options and I do encourage

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,430
you to play with them.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,840
Not only can you hover over the top of them which gives you a tool tip but it's good to play it's how

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,790
you discover things.

72
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,890
So these two seem to do absolutely nothing compared to what we've got at the top here.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,370
OK let's see if we can just tweak this number here to a lower figure because occasion it can get a bit

74
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,270
too large no offset relative that makes very little difference to this as well edge rail does make a

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,100
little bit of a difference it keeps these edges in line rather than bending them out a little further.

76
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,790
Okay.

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,250
So I quite liked the fact that it's keeping the edge rail in line it saves me having to reach scale

78
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,410
and tweak it about later on and the offset relative I'm going to turn off outset we've already played

79
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,160
with select outer.

80
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,350
So that selects the new part of the geometry that's being created that's quite useful sometimes I'll

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,690
show that again in the bits.

82
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,180
But the one I'm getting to is individual look how much different that is compared to that it's completely

83
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,050
different.

84
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,510
Individual is something I use quite a bit especially when you transport holes or windows in an object

85
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,170
is a good way of doing so because then you can do something to this additional geometry and depending

86
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,000
on what you're trying to do this always going to be another way of creating holes or a window within

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,690
your object like this.

88
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,660
Let's go ahead and select this other one and inset it in because I wanted to show you these select outer.

89
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,750
So once we've done that we can click on select outer and it actually selects the border.

90
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,630
So that does mean that you can go in straight away and maybe extrude that out to make more of a tunnel

91
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,440
going on.

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,490
And of course because we've done that we've lost the operator panel.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,140
So once again there's a little hint there that make sure you finish the current operation before doing

94
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,730
something else whether it's moving scaling rotating extruded et cetera et cetera.

95
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,750
Any other operation will get rid of the operator panel.

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,640
Okay so that's a good play with in.

97
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,400
And I've got some sort of I I know command module for a spaceship or something exciting like that.

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,910
So do play with Blender and come up with some weird and funky shapes you'll be amazed at what actually

99
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,570
turns into a good idea or certainly sparks something.

100
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,990
Then you can develop into a good idea.

101
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,010
And now we've played around with in setting it's time for your challenge Okay everybody it's time for

102
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,490
your challenge.

103
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,130
Now this is gonna be the first time I'm gonna be very specific.

104
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:49,810
Quality design brief imagine a client to come to you and said I want a pyramid that's 20 by 20 meters

105
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,190
on the base and has seven steps so let's run through the specification.

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,940
I want you to scale the default cube to 20 meters by 20 meters by two meters.

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:08,290
Once you've done that create steps of one meter in and one meter up so you'll be inserting by one meter

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,960
and then extruded by one meter as you go.

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,160
Now this is critical as we want a 45 degree angle for later on.

110
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,860
And of course if you're looking at reference material of a mind pyramid you'll notice that it isn't

111
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,370
quite as crude as that.

112
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,390
But for the purposes of this exercise we do want it to be a 45 degree angle so we need to go in by one

113
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:34,960
meter and up by one meter and we're going to create a total of seven steps including that first one.

114
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,280
So that will be counted in the first step.

115
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,250
When you've done that we're going to create a little room in a building on top which is going to be

116
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,160
two to four meters high so you're going to inset it's two meters from the last step and then extrude

117
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,070
up analogue.

118
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,320
I'll give you a bit of freedom here two to four meters I'll probably go smack bang in the middle at

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,820
three meters.

120
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,300
Hey guys.

121
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,290
Mark hey at some point you're going to see Mike in when they 7 step pyramid and sometimes it's gonna

122
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,020
be a nice step pyramid.

123
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,950
This is a little bit of an overhang from the Old Course where we used an eight step pyramid.

124
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,850
It doesn't really matter which you use and doesn't really matter how many steps you put in that we can

125
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:19,300
leave up to you but when you get to making these stairs later on you may need to use different values

126
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,730
to get the right angles.

127
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,940
And with that back to Mikey.

128
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,640
So go ahead pause video now and we're aiming to have something like this by the end of this challenge.

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,510
Give it a go and I'll see you back in a few moments.

130
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,670
Let's go ahead and make up my own pyramid or suddenly the base mash for it's in front of us.

131
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,050
We have our default cube and it is of a size two meters by two meters by two meters.

132
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,170
So we just need to scale this by 10.

133
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,000
Now we have two options we can do that in object mode and apply or we can do it in edit mode.

134
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,370
I'm gonna save myself some work and do it in edit mode.

135
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,840
Everything is selecting the bigger scale things by 10 but not on the z axis.

136
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,590
I'm going press shift in Z to do that.

137
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,340
To press Enter to confirm.

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,130
So the next thing we need to do is in set.

139
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,920
So let's go ahead and select the top face.

140
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,530
Press the eye key and I'm gonna move in roughly because we really need to look at what's going on in

141
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,000
the operator panel.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,070
Now the thickness itself I'm going to set it as one and then I'm going to look at our model from the

143
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,610
top and just zoom into the top corner that looks like we've got the right amount.

144
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,090
And the reason why that's work is because let's just um take these other things here.

145
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:38,620
We need the offset even which is fine we don't need boundary enabled now offset relative would base

146
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,610
it upon the scale of our object.

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,830
So in this case here if I was to go offset relative it would it would go right into the middle and through

148
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,410
itself but I could probably get away with points 1 so it's not quite there yet I think we need to offset

149
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,840
even at the same time.

150
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,430
There we go.

151
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,280
So point one of 20 is to blender units and there we go we can see that's two by two that I'm not gonna

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,260
do that I'm going to lever off and I'm literally going to type in the distance I want it to be sorry

153
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,840
I need offsets even turned on.

154
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,980
So there we go.

155
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:19,450
Now that I've done that I can go ahead here and extrude on the z axis by one inset by one extrude by

156
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,550
one.

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,070
Now you will notice that I can just repeat those two letter combinations.

158
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,530
I 1 e 1.

159
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,490
Now how does it know which direction I want to extrude on.

160
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,350
It's just remembered previously right.

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,020
I'm losing count of how many steps I've got here and we want seven in total so the first one two three

162
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,950
four one two three four five six seven perfect.

163
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,990
So now we just need the building on top somewhere inserts it by two in this case and extrude up by two

164
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,980
three.

165
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,450
There we go about three.

166
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,530
Perfect.

167
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,250
I'm liking the look of that.

168
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,060
Excellent.

169
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:05,560
Have you guys gotten on this is a very repetitive task but some tasks in Blender are repetitive.

170
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,110
I'd love to know if you found an easier way of making this mind pyramid without those two repeating

171
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,970
tasks.

172
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,840
There is a way in code to do it using the python console but that's not working in 2.8 just yet and

173
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,230
we'll cover things like that a bit more detail later on in the course.

174
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,330
But for now we've got our base my in pyramid shape sorted.

175
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,240
I'd like you to share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
