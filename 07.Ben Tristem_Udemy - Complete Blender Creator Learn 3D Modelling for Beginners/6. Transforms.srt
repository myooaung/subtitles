Hello everybody.
1

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,550
By the end of this lecture we're going to learn how to move rotate and scale any object within blender.
2

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,000
And it's not just useful for mesh objects like this but we can also have fun with lights in scenes as
3

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,820
well.
4

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,680
Of course this will come much later on in the course when we start rendering out our models.
5

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,590
Let's find out more and hop on over into blender OK.
6

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,680
So we are over in the default blend file at the moment.
7

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,770
If you're not here, you've been playing around you can get back to here by going to file new and going
8

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,200
to general and you'll get a scene very much like this.
9

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,610
So we're talking about transforms in this lecture and transforms are key.
10

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,320
They allow us to move things around they allow us to scale things make them bigger and smaller.
11

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,620
And they also allow us to rotate them and that is really really paramount and useful when you're working
12

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,320
within the 3D editor because you need to be able to do these things.
13

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,580
They also apply elsewhere in Blender as well which can be really useful with the shortcut keys remain
14

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,760
the same.
15

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,910
So the first place I want to draw your attention to is the left hand side of the screen.
16

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,560
We have a toolbar on the left hand side of the screen.
17

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,440
If you don't see it you can use the shortcut key T to make it appear and there's also little arrow of
18

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,070
you look there in the top left that you can open up.
19

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
Now the second group of icons relates to transforming.
20

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,180
You can turn on a couple of widgets that will appear on the screen.
21

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,050
So we've got move rotate and scale.
22

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,890
And we've also got a widget that does all three.
23

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,680
So if we enable that we've see that suddenly our cube ends up with these control points around it.
24

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,030
Now noticed that they're color coded as well the color coded in green blue and red representing X Y
25

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,410
and Z Y being the green X being the red and Z being the blue.
26

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,630
And we can confirm that as well in the top right.
27

28
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,100
We've got those colors and letters as well.
28

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:14,070
Now if this didn't happen perhaps you'd deselected from the cube because in order to transform something
29

30
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,650
you need to tell blender what you want to transform.
30

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,910
Now if you click anywhere else in the scene it would deselect an object.
31

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,190
If I left click again in this case and I select the cube you see that it now it has the outline around
32

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,160
it again the orange outline means it's selected and it's also got these tools around it's a scale with
33

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,920
these blocks to rotates and also just to move really useful being able to just grab those and move them
34

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,730
around.
35

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,540
Now if we had something else selected maybe the camera over here or the lights at the top then the tool
36

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,360
moves to those places.
37

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,890
Now the other place that you could manipulate these is over in the properties panel now similar to the
38

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,560
tools on the left hand side on the right hand side there's a properties panel there's a little arrow
39

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,090
that you can open it up with and you also have the N key.
40

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,430
Now the N Key will bring open this properties panel and it will change depending on what you're doing
41

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,720
and which window, which editor you're in but we're in the 3D editor at the moment.
42

43
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,470
So what else can we do here.
43

44
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,910
Well we can be more precise with where we want this light.
44

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,510
We can click and drag.
45

46
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,130
We can even type in here.
46

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,520
So if I wanted to set that's a one meter in this case I could do so I could highlight by clicking and
47

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,460
dragging over all of these fields and change them all to the same value that can be incredibly useful
48

49
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:49,030
as well such as if you've rotated something I mean you want to set the rotation all back to zero.
49

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:56,170
We can highlight it all and press zero and there you go it's cleared the rotation that was once there.
50

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,770
There is another way that we can do it and that's already we can see that in the right hand side the
51

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:09,580
far right hand side we have the object properties so we've got the properties in the 3D window and we
52

53
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,280
can close that down but we also have the object properties going to make this area here wider by moving
53

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,240
my cursor between these windows to get that double headed arrow and I can make this wider as I want
54

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,800
more much much more narrow about there is can be fine for the moment.
55

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,780
And here is the properties panel.
56

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,290
This is here by default.
57

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
We hover over this little icon at the very top of this window.
58

59
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,890
We can see that the editor type is properties.
59

60
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,990
In fact these exist all over the place within blender.
60

61
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,450
We go to this one at the top here we've got outliner.
61

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,380
We go over to the far left we've got a 3D viewport that's the main one we're working in and at the very
62

63
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,480
bottom we have one called the timeline and these can be changed out and manipulated.
63

64
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,560
We'll learn about that more later on but we can also set the object properties, the objects transform
64

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,050
properties and it's neatly under the transform dropdown so we've played with these and we can click
65

66
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,360
and drag and move around and that's that's great.
66

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,500
We can set things up.
67

68
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,910
But how does this really help us or what we can do is we can start putting things together and rotating
68

69
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,680
them and moving them around.
69

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,100
But for the moment what's I'd like you to do is get the hang of doing this now.
70

71
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm a big fan of shortcut keys but they can be a bit overwhelming from time to time and I don't exclusively
71

72
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,560
use them.
72

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,950
So I will often use N and T to bring open these areas on the left them right.
73

74
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,090
I like N and T simply because it's a pain to click on the little arrows.
74

75
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,740
So I go to that and I also use shortcut keys.
75

76
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,440
I use the menu options.
76

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,140
I use the property panels.
77

78
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,930
It just depends on what I'm doing if I need something precise.
78

79
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm not going to do it by hand but what I can do is get rid of all of those.
79

80
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,180
And there are three shortcut keys that you can use as well.
80

81
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,930
I'm going to open up the tool shelf and just go at the very top again and go to our normal select mode.
81

82
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,670
Now if I've done that what I can do is I can press the G key the G key is all about moving around pretty
82

83
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,720
cool Hey now what was missing when we were moving before is these arrows.
83

84
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,990
That's very useful to be able to move something on the x y or z axis.
84

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,350
So how do we manage that.
85

86
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,920
Well what we can very easily do let's make that gizmo disappear again.
86

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,720
If I press G to move it then I can simply press the letter in the direction I want to lock the movement
87

88
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,140
so I can get X and it will lock in the X axis Y in the Y axis and Z in the Z axis.
88

89
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:56,640
Now if I didn't want to move up or down and just around the X Y plane what I can do is press G to say
89

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,630
that I want to move it and then say shift in Z to say not on the Z axis.
90

91
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,570
Now if you were to just go shift and Z you turn on what's called wireframe mode and we can turn that
91

92
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,650
off again we shift and Z so if it's going like this.
92

93
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,660
That means that you've not pressed G first or perhaps you've not pressed one of the other modifier keys
93

94
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,780
S for scaling.
94

95
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,850
And again we can lock that on X Y and Z or R for rotation and again X Y and Z.
95

96
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,410
Okay.
96

97
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,180
So the final thing to touch upon is applying transforms if we open up the properties panel again we
97

98
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:44,670
can see that it's location is relative to the world origin which is 0 0 and 0 so its 5 meters in the x axis
98

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,530
point four meters in the Y axis and point two six in the Z and that's to do this orange dot in the middle
99

100
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,450
of our object would talk about the origin points later on we have a rotation and a scale applied to
100

101
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,600
our model.
101

102
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,450
Now there are plenty of operations in Blender where if you do not apply the rotation and scale you can
102

103
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,230
end up with some really weird effects going on.
103

104
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,610
So it's often a good idea to apply the rotation and scale following doing a transform the location however
104

105
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,100
is often just left as is.
105

106
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,980
Unless you've got a very specific case.
106

107
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,310
So we can do that by going to the very top of the 3D Editor window to the object's menu going to apply and
107

108
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,040
we can see the shortcut key there is control and A and if we use control and we'll get the same window
108

109
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:46,140
up let's try that now control and A there we go and we want to apply the rotation and scale and we find
109

110
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,330
then that the rotation is set to 0 0 0 and the scale has been reset to 1.
110

111
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,110
Now that's a really useful thing to do and there's something that I'm going to remind you about throughout
111

112
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,210
the course as we go.
112

113
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,100
And now we've learnt about transforms what I'd like to do is reinforce that knowledge with a little
113

114
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,960
challenge. OK so your challenge starts a new blend file.
114

115
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,450
Once you've done that move the default cube one meter on the Z axis.
115

116
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,680
So that will be moving it up.
116

117
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:25,320
Then rotate the default cube 45 degrees on the z axis again once you've done that.
117

118
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,340
I'd like you to make a diamond shape by scaling it by 2 on the Y axis.
118

119
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,170
Now you will notice at this point if you scale it by two on either the X or Y axis it's not gonna make
119

120
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,900
a diamond shape straight away.
120

121
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,790
So what I'd like you to do is play and think about when you might need to apply a transform.
121

122
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,060
Here's a clue.
122

123
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,630
It's going to be more than once and the other thing that you can play with if say you're moving something
123

124
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,520
on the Z axis by 1.
124

125
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:02,830
You could press G to move Z to lock it to the z axis and immediately press the number one press enter
125

126
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:09,550
and it's moved by one meter on the z axis so it can even be quicker to move things around.
126

127
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,410
And let me just show you the end state what we're trying to achieve.
127

128
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,860
So this is the final shape that will end up with as you can see here.
128

129
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:27,120
I've applied all of my transforms except the location 1 so we've got it sitting with orange dots one
129

130
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,710
meter above the zero point of the world.
130

131
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Okay so this is what we're going for.
131

132
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,020
Go ahead pause the video now and give that a go
132

133
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,500
Okay everybody Welcome back.
133

134
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,740
So I'm going to start off by starting a brand new scene so new.
134

135
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,070
General Okay so we've got our default scene in front of us I'm gonna press G to move it Z to lock it
135

136
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,730
to the Z axis and I'm going to press the number one and that's lifted it up one meter and we can confirm
136

137
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:05,300
that over in the properties panel here we can see that it has been shifted on the Z axis by one meter
137

138
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,140
and we can also open up the 3D editor properties window and see exactly the same information.
138

139
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,830
I'm gonna leave this open and then rotate it by 45 degrees on the Z axis.
139

140
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm then going to scale it on the X axis.
140

141
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,670
Now this is where it starts getting a bit weird.
141

142
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,220
So if we scale it's in the 3D window itself and on just locking into the X axis we get it scaling
142

143
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:39,260
like this it's pretty cool it's making a flat a square of the height one meter.
143

144
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,080
Okay.
144

145
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,070
Oh sorry 2 meters there'll be 2 meters high.
145

146
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,340
Okay that's not what we want we can see here it's scaled on the X and Y axis.
146

147
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,730
Okay.
147

148
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,330
So if I set out back to 1.
148

149
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,980
Okay so we can set these independently now you might think oh OK.
149

150
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,010
Is that because I didn't apply the the rotation that we have there.
150

151
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,790
Well let's try it.
151

152
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,180
Let's see what happens.
152

153
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,170
And this is what I want to encourage you to do is to play in blender.
153

154
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,530
What happens if I apply the rotation first and then try and scale it on the X axis.
154

155
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:23,760
Oh that looks completely different and if I scale on the X axis here it does the same thing.
155

156
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:30,300
So because the rotation wasn't applied it was doing something completely different in the 3D viewport.
156

157
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,030
But as soon as that rotation was applied then it starts behaving differently.
157

158
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:44,930
Again pretty cool Hey but it just shows you the difference that applying or not applying a transform
158

159
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:51,470
can have and that's just at this stage later on it can really impact your work and even destroy your
159

160
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,810
models if you don't get that right.
160

161
00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:00,500
So is worthwhile right from the very beginning even at this stage applying those transforms and now
161

162
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:08,980
I've just scaled it up on the scale and make that diamond I'm going to then go Alt and A and I'm going
162

163
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,600
to apply that scale.
163

164
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,830
This is our new object.
164

165
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,230
It's really this dimensions is not being transformed into a different shape.
165

166
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:28,050
I'm going to finally save my work with file save and I'm going to call this transforms diamond Excellent. 
166

167
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,570
Okay.
167

168
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,220
How did you guys get on.
168

169
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,300
I know this is a very straightforward start but these are some key skills that you're going to need
169

170
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,230
as we progressed through the course and so we're going to start with these small steps.
170

171
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,690
And by the end of this section you'll be amazed at what you can achieve with just these simple tools
171

172
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,540
that I'm now giving you.
172

173
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,700
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
