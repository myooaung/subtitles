Hey so hopefully you have a lot of fun blowing things up with Mike.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.670
I know you had a lot of fun making this section.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.450
The purpose of it is a bonus section.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.160
It's to deliver to the promises that we made to our Kickstarter backers all you guys have got it for

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.590
free.

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.480
And what's more it's not the last bonus section in the course.

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.920
So Mikey let's recap what they learned and what they can do with what they learn in this area.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.470
We'll certainly learn all about the physics engine a bit quirky at times but it really adds that level

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.220
of realism with things falling over you just take a freeze frame was destroyed perfect.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.460
And of course we learn how to break objects into smaller pieces when a wall falls over of course and

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
we use that example in me in the section when it all falls over it doesn't just fall over brick by brick

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.450
it will fall over and break up into small pieces so we made sure we've covered that as well.

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.220
Lots of fun lots of destruction it was a good lesson so thank you for being with us and dive into the

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.770
next section.
