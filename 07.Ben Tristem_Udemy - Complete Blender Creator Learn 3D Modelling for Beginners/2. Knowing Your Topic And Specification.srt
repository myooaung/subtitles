Hello everybody and welcome to knowing your topic and specification.
1

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,420
Now understanding your subject is key to being able to model it.
2

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,310
Draw it or do whatever you want with it especially later on when we come to animating things if you
3

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,760
don't quite understand how something works or how it's really assembled you can end up with something
4

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,250
looking just a little bit odd. Planning your model.
5

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,160
This is key knowing your scales.
6

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,530
Knowing how things are going to interact, that is key to making sure that your model acts in a way that's
7

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,100
believable.
8

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,010
And also knowing the importance of research I will repeat this throughout the course reminding you to
9

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,160
go and get some reference material reminding you to check that what you're doing is real is something
10

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,820
that's tangible and makes some sense.
11

12
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,260
Now I'm going to hop on over into blender and show you just what I mean.
12

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,080
So here we are over in Blender and I'm going to go to the drawing section of blender so I'm going to
13

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,200
go up to file new and go to the 2D animation part.
14

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,840
So here we go to the animation we get this white area here that we can draw on which is pretty awesome.
15

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,870
I'm going to undo that for the moment and I'm going to go control and space which will make this area
16

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,930
here whilst my cursor in it, full screen.
17

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:24,430
So what I'm trying to get across here is if I asked you to draw a bowling ball and some pins it might
18

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,730
look something like this and you might kind of get the pin like that and you might know go No it doesn't
19

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,440
quite look like that they're more like this.
20

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,190
And before long you just end up not really knowing where you are.
21

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,750
And the same is true with anything.
22

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,890
If I ask the majority of you out there to go and draw a house you might draw something that looks something
23

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,720
like this especially if you're from England because we all draw houses like this over here.
24

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,150
So you go and draw a house like this and to be quite honest there are very few houses that actually
25

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,200
look like that.
26

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,300
If we really look at a house you suddenly see that actually this comes out slightly and there's this
27

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,810
bit here called eaves and windows don't look like that.
28

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,710
They've got window sills first and they've got lintils on top and yada yada yada.
29

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,410
I could go on and on but the important thing is if you went and got some reference material of lots
30

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:21,010
and lots of houses you'd know exactly what it should be looking like now it's your artistic license
31

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,140
to take those realistic features and maybe exaggerate them.
32

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,860
So this chimney on top here might be realistic in how it looks because you've put the correct number
33

34
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,640
of bits at the top but making it exaggerated like that.
34

35
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,340
That's fine that's with an artistic license actually getting most of the way there is a good way of
35

36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,270
starting.
36

37
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,280
And with that in mind we're going to jump straight into our challenge now because while I'd like you
37

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,220
to do is get the dimensions of a bowling ball and pin once you've done that get images you can use as
38

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,500
reference material.
39

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,700
Now reference material can come in all shapes and sizes and all sorts of angles and views.
40

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,730
But what's important here is that you get profile images.
41

42
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,800
So this is what we're going to look at here especially for the pin a ball is a ball.
42

43
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,780
We can pretty much line that up and that's fine.
43

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,190
But when it comes to the pin itself may be useful if you've got a view directly from the side or the
44

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,530
front so that we can use the profile of the pin itself and trace around it.
45

46
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:31,210
So we don't even have to think about things so go off, Pause the video now and give that's a go. Okay everybody.
46

47
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,040
Welcome back.
47

48
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,460
Now when it came to the dimensions of the bowling pin and ball you may notice that I didn't give you
48

49
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,730
any specification as to whether I wanted it.
49

50
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,520
Milimeters, meters, feet, inches whatever.
50

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,970
Truth be told it doesn't matter because in a future lecture coming soon we'll switch out those dimensions
51

52
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,120
within blender itself so it doesn't really matter.
52

53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,260
So what have I done.
53

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,860
Well I've gone ahead and got myself a profile image of a pin.
54

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,910
And here we go.
55

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,540
This is the pin I've got for my reference.
56

57
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,490
Now of course this is more of a clip art style pnn.
57

58
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,710
I like its overall form and shape and I think it's going to look pretty good when we use it as a profile
58

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,150
image and trace around it to make our 3D model.
59

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,330
Now the one thing missing from this is actual dimensional information.
60

61
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,250
I don't know the radius that this is going to be or its height at the moment.
61

62
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,780
So let's go find out what the height of the pins are, and in this case I've happened to go over to Wikipedia
62

63
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,990
to get these you may have got them from other places.
63

64
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,090
And what's important is that we're just consistent.
64

65
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,330
So if you get the information for the bowling pin and the bowling ball from the same place it doesn't
65

66
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,120
really matter if it's slightly different for someone else.
66

67
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,420
So we can see here we've got the weight of them.
67

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,100
They weigh about one point five kilos and we can go down here we can see there's different types of 
68

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,000
them look about.
69

70
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,960
I didn't know they exist like that candle pins.
70

71
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,770
That's pretty awesome.
71

72
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,050
So here we go.
72

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,910
The top here we've got our specifications that we need to focus on.
73

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,050
We can see that pins a four point seven five or twelve centimeters wide at the widest point and 15 inches
74

75
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,390
or 38 centimetres tall.
75

76
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:09,510
So I'm going to be working probably in meters still or and might even switch it to centimeters or even
76

77
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,450
millimeters so I can match these up.
77

78
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,910
Exactly.
78

79
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,310
It doesn't really matter if we're roughly in the ballpark of you've made your pin in this case four
79

80
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,330
point eight inches wide or 125 millimeters wide is not going to make that much difference to our overall 
80

81
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:24,750
scene.
81

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,120
So those sorts of details are useful to know because we can set up our scene accordingly and make sure
82

83
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,490
that the units we're using for our models over in Blender are correct and we'll learn about that more
83

84
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,110
over in the next lecture.
