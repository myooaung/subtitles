00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.190
Welcome to virtex and edge slide in this video.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.520
You'll learn about edge and virtex sliding and see.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.760
This is a useful way of refining your model without having to create or remove existing geometry.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.240
So let's go explore.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.390
Jim burtis sliding and hop on over in a blender.

6
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.900
Okay so now there were over in blender one of the first things that you'll see in is suddenly on my

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.800
model your model might be a little more refined.

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.470
Is that there is a certain level of detail in some places and things need a bit moving about so there's

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.820
a vertex's that's sticking out there as we go around the model.

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.900
So it's quite a sharp point.

11
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.560
There's another one here.

12
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.080
It gets a bit wobbly in places so we can straighten that up specially along this bit here.

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.280
That's also very very wobbly.

14
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.450
There's a couple of ways that we can go about sorting that out.

15
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.720
And I'd like to introduce you to Ed sliding and virtex sliding.

16
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:17.540
So for instance this syeed Edge loop Let's go to edge loops first logo s loop running all the way down

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.000
there and terminating at the neck.

18
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.410
If we wanted to do something with that we can slide it and would access the edge menu some mesh edges

19
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.730
or control in e you notice on here there's something called Edge slide.

20
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.240
Now we can also get to the edge slide function by pressing the G key twice so we can see here that I'm

21
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.530
able to move the entire loop in between the two bounding loops and indeed push up against the next one.

22
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.440
Now if you do end up as you can see there with it's smack bang up against the next one.

23
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.690
Ah I've got merged vs. turned on so that fortunately got rid of that graphical artefact we were seeing

24
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.050
there.

25
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.170
If I didn't have it turned on this press the G key twice and slide it in you could see it as Ed slide

26
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.070
down in the lower left and slide it all the way up against this one.

27
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.970
We get this horrible artefacts coming up and that's a good sign that you've got an intersecting faces

28
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.900
or in fact in this case two edges right on top of one another and we've got all this.

29
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.350
Well not very smooth shading any more.

30
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.550
You can see it abruptly changes blender literally doesn't know what to do because you've got one edge

31
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.680
and another edge on top of one another.

32
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.610
And what smooth shaven tries to do is sort of interpolate between the normals of that particular edge

33
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.080
and it can't do that if they're on top of one another.

34
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.720
So it goes all messy and it wound and undo that now cause that's not something I want to do.

35
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.250
Similar to Ed's sliding is vertex sliding and that is simply when you are you probably guessing what's

36
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.540
coming along here where you grab a vertex and this tiny pressure Gee twice.

37
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.800
And it goes to virtex slide or indeed you can get it through control and V for the virtex manual.

38
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.990
Go down to the menu system itself and we end up with virtex slide as well and you can see the short

39
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.640
cut for that as well can be shift and V.

40
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.520
Okay so now we're actually sliding with the G key twice.

41
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.450
We can see that we're actually moving along the path of that edge easier in this direction or that direction

42
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.300
you can see here that you can only go in one direction at any one time.

43
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.740
You also get this this all white sort of guide coming up as well.

44
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.270
Now I've also got snapping turned on some is going to turn that off so it's not going to do anything

45
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.270
abrupt so I can press G twice R and D shift and V.

46
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.210
It's just a short cut to the same place and this is literally just moving it along the edges.

47
00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.280
This vertex is part of and that can be incredibly powerful if we if we look at the side of a head here

48
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.010
going round.

49
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.910
We've got for instance this area.

50
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.500
Here's all a bit lumpy so we can go here and say well you know this loop that's coming around here.

51
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.270
Well this one here for instance.

52
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.120
Might just go it does it actually add anything useful.

53
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.140
Did I had it there for the.

54
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.840
Is I think I might have done so.

55
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.470
Is this one here useful.

56
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.710
I don't think it is and if that's the case we can always delete that and dissolve edges and that will

57
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.700
get rid of fat one.

58
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.480
There being a problem now of course we've got this here that's sticking out a little.

59
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.500
This one here.

60
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.320
And by moving them with a combination of manually moving them.

61
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.350
Or of course using the slide functionality.

62
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.050
It's a slice of functionality is absolutely brilliant for lets say we need to move this one going around

63
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.240
here.

64
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.300
Yep that one going round there that's a good one to pick and just move it out a little wider.

65
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.350
That's the one defining the eye.

66
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.600
Let's not pick that one so this one here we can press the G key twice and pull it back along those edges

67
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.650
that already exist and that will help smooth out our model as it goes around.

68
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.880
That's the face morphs around so that is how you use the edge and virtex sliding tools.

69
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.050
And of course no lecture is complete without a little challenge.

70
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.090
I would like you to go ahead and refine your model.

71
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.830
So go around your model and check for your edge loops are where you need them to be.

72
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.920
Do a little bit of adjustment again.

73
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.920
Well basically doing the overall shape at the moment.

74
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.740
I've noticed mine starting to get a bit flat in places.

75
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.630
Do you need as much geometry as you've currently got.

76
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.750
The main area of focus really at the moment is the face and there's going to be this side of the head

77
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.790
itself to do the ear in a bit but the back of a head is it can be quite large quads going on there.

78
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.100
If you want it we don't need that much detail around the back of a head because there isn't that much

79
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.450
detail.

80
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.230
Check your vertices too and move them if necessary as a move them using slide tool if they need adjustment

81
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.170
or indeed move them manually as well.

82
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.220
Or use any other techniques that you want.

83
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.850
It's a pause a video now and do a little of refining of your model.

84
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.740
Okay guys.

85
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.700
Welcome back.

86
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.980
Let's go and have a look at my model and see if there's any intermediate refining that we can do.

87
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.540
Okay so where.

88
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.080
Back over here.

89
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.670
And I'm just having a look at things like this loop coming around here.

90
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.940
Is this a loop anymore.

91
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.390
No it's not.

92
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:56.420
So what's happened here we've got quad running around here that's pretty sharp just there as well.

93
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.800
It's difficult sometimes get an angle on it because if you're out of this view it looks at a really

94
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.830
sharp view.

95
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.290
Around here it looks quite gradual but I think that one does need lifting up ever so slightly.

96
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.600
I didn't mean to press the vignola I mean the press shift and V.

97
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:17.650
If that up ever so slightly and did the same with this one and again by using shift V rather than just

98
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:25.630
moving its up manually you can guarantee that it's laying on line you've already defined so you don't

99
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.010
end up pushing the model up too tightly which is very easy to do.

100
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.400
So that's looking okay here.

101
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.500
This is atrocious all this detail running round the back here.

102
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.000
There's a couple of ways we can get around that.

103
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:46.450
One of the first things I'd look at is whether or not we can terminate some of these loops coming around

104
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.040
where they're not needed.

105
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.920
So we're certainly going to need loops towards this part of the model and we can see that here.

106
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.520
We might want another loop running around here.

107
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.840
So I'm going to cut back in.

108
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.090
Now we're going to end up with a triangle here that we can sort out.

109
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.320
Amber I'm going to just come along.

110
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:12.850
Our model very manually here I know and pop in that set of cuts I'm quite happy with that that's going

111
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.990
to define that.

112
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.640
The face.

113
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.060
And then we've got this one running around that will hopefully define the head yes.

114
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.290
Unhappy With that running round there.

115
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.100
So then we've got the question of all of these other ones here.

116
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.090
Now we can start terminating these as we go we can start merging together to make Well slightly odd

117
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.020
quads.

118
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:45.220
So for instance here we can get rid of and dissolve every other edge so it's dissolve those edges so

119
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.020
you've got a series of faces here.

120
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:56.000
Now we've got to remember at this point in time we don't need to worry too much about having a bad topology

121
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.910
just above here we can go and fix that later.

122
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.740
One of the first things I'm Ask going to do at this point in time is start weeding out of the verses

123
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.250
we don't need.

124
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.440
In fact at this point it's a speed myself up what I'm going to do is not do what holes have mapped to

125
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:18.170
do and go in and select and go round the model and see where these go to surveil lead to about here

126
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.000
here and here I think I might be wrong.

127
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.580
That's just double check.

128
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.050
I could actually select one and work it from there so that one there.

129
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.000
Now one there.

130
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.280
I'm just going to delete those will not delete them but dissolve them and then I should be able to select

131
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.190
these loops and dissolve them.

132
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.260
So they're starting to look a bit better.

133
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:49.280
The final one is this one here so that one goes all the way round that she terminates here at the back

134
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.760
because we are a pole.

135
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.000
So once again I can dissolve that completely.

136
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.250
From our model.

137
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.940
Now that does cause a few little interesting bits.

138
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.550
Like at the bottom here what happens.

139
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.900
Well we can grab since I've spotted it.

140
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.120
Grab this with virtex slap and just put that bit together there.

141
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.740
And that ensures that at least this says loop going down the back rounded up the front.

142
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.840
Excellent That's what I wanted to see is still hold.

143
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.490
Now obviously it terminates here and what we can do and it's not a bad thing to terminate here.

144
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.550
We could actually leave it like that in many ways because I don't think it's going to show up anything

145
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.860
particularly bad.

146
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.200
And the reason for that is at the top of the head it's not going to be animated.

147
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.610
So we could potentially leave it for that I'd like good topology around here.

148
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.650
So we'll work on that later when it comes to a bit of detail.

149
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:53.150
This triangle at the front here be quite awesome to have that working all the way round and down.

150
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.990
Now we've got to think here if this is a loop that runs all the way there we're missing something aren't

151
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.280
really win this one runs all the way down.

152
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.500
But this one is terminated with a triangle here.

153
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.480
So one of these edges needs some extra supports.

154
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.060
But of course that itself would be diving into the detail.

155
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:20.220
Speaking of which look about I'm just looking at it from the front and that is stuck out like a sore

156
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.680
thumb so I'm going to grab those two there.

157
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:29.090
When you shift and V to slide them down ever so slightly and with snapping turned off are not v.

158
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.830
Shift them visalus undo that shift and be.

159
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.390
I do prefer actually pressing the G key twice.

160
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:41.760
I feel like I'm not going to make too many mistakes by using that shortcut key rather than ripping my

161
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.900
model apart accidentally.

162
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:51.090
So we'll come back later on and sort out this triangle here after we've learnt a bit more about how

163
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.490
we can define edge loops with much more detail.

164
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.970
How is your model coming along.

165
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.900
Did you refine it to make it a bit more in proportion.

166
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.940
Did you have anything that was glaringly obvious standing out.

167
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:10.370
Please share that work in the discussions and I will see you in the next lecture.
