Hello and welcome to this quick lecture on blenders interface.
1

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,330
Now blender has a series of windows and a series of workspaces and it's very very customizable so you
2

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,730
can pick no end of different options that suit you.
3

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,430
Now we've already been tweaking some of the interface by making it larger or smaller in either direction
4

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,560
up or down as you can see here.
5

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,450
We just have to wait to that double headed arrow appears and then we can move things around.
6

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,980
However what happens if we want to change how it looks.
7

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,020
Where are the other bits of blender.
8

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,250
Well on the screen at the moment we have four main areas.
9

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,270
We've got the 3D edite and if we hover over this drop down in the top left we see we've got the 3D viewport.
10

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:58,730
As the editor type if we click on that it shows us all of the other options that we could have including
11

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,400
some of these shortcuts in order to change.
12

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,440
So if you're a keyboard shortcut person they're right there.
13

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,290
In fact most things within blender do have a keyboard shortcut annotation with them if they've got a
14

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,340
keyboard shortcut.
15

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,560
So you've got editor types and we can switch this out we can switch this to a movie clip editor.
16

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,660
And there we go.
17

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,730
And we can switch it back to the 3D viewport and we can hold down shift and the F numbers to skip through
18

19
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,900
those if we want to now.
19

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:34,370
So we can customize all of these little areas but we can also customize the entire lot at once.
20

21
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:40,430
So if we have a look at the very top we see this says layouts, modelling, sculpting, UV editing et cetera.
21

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,520
Now if you've come from an older version of blender you may find that not all of those are there if
22

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,490
they are not then you can scroll along to the end of this list and press the plus button and it gives
23

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,420
you all of these extra areas these work spaces that you can use.
24

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,500
And each one is set up with a different purpose in mind so if we quickly skip through these not in detail
25

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,410
but this is a layout if we click on the modelling tab we go to what would jump into edit mode straight
26

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,090
away.
27

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,540
We'll talk about edit mode in the next section sculpting is there.
28

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,700
UV editing, texture paint and you can see it changing the interface depending on what the task
29

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,340
is you're trying to do.
30

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,220
And that's one of the big things with Blender it tends to be a bit overwhelming because it can do so
31

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,640
much and that's why we're going to take you step by step through each of these areas as we go through
32

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,690
the course, including customizing your layout creating new layouts, however you want to use Blender you
33

34
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,020
will be able to.
34

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Now one of the quick things I want to show you here is what you might do if you have a multi monitor
35

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,850
setup.
36

37
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,110
So if we go to the window option one of the things we can do is create a new window.
37

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:01,640
This is now a new independent window that I can move to another screen which is really really useful
38

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,320
when you need the extra space.
39

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,590
And of course you can close that down as well.
40

41
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,270
And there is a difference between a new window and a new main window.
41

42
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:19,900
A new main window imitates what we have before with different selections along the top a different window
42

43
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,380
doesn't have any of those.
43

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,310
It's like an extension of the existing one here.
44

45
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,220
And so it updates at the same time.
45

46
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,600
So there's something to bear in mind a couple of final things.
46

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,370
The header bars used to be at the bottom of these windows rather than at the top or most of the editor
47

48
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,300
windows.
48

49
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,270
If you find an empty space and right click it brings up the header menu and you can flip it to the bottom
49

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,160
if that's how you prefer it if you want to keep it like you may have been used to before.
50

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,570
I'm going to flip it back to the top.
51

52
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm kind of used to headers being at the top now since they are called headers and this is a thing
52

53
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,800
that I use a lot.
53

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,340
Maximize area so if I'm working showing you a model I'll often go control and space whilst my cursors
54

55
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,220
in the 3D window and it will maximize that particular area and I can just go and control in space again
55

56
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,240
to toggle it back.
56

57
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,150
Now my cursor does have to be in this window.
57

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,330
You may have noticed that if I move my cursor out over the outline on the right hand side and start
58

59
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,210
using the numberpad keys it does nothing.
59

60
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,370
The moment I move it into the 3D editor space it then acts accordingly.
60

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,960
So do be careful where you put your cursor as it can change how blender behaves.
61

62
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,900
And I've seen no end of people confused.
62

63
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,560
They've just nudged their mouse over accidentally while moving things around and then they can't do
63

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,470
what they think they should be able to do.
64

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,700
Very easy to get caught out without one.
65

66
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:55,680
Finally at any point you can split and combine windows so at the moment if there isn't a spliter a widget
66

67
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,900
like they used to be you just move your cursor into one of the four corners of any editor window and
67

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,420
you get the little cursor change into a cross which means you're able to split a window.
68

69
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,900
If I click and drag to the left you see a new window appears it will automatically imitate whatever
69

70
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,410
the previous one was.
70

71
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,070
Unfortunately you can end up in a bit of a pickle with blenders interface if you're not careful.
71

72
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,610
But don't worry you can go back at any time to a previous layout very easily.
72

73
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,620
First of all you may have only opened up a couple of these and you may be struggling to make them disappear
73

74
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:31,920
again.
74

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,510
Well the windows must line up so these two can join.
75

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,450
Now these two can join.
76

77
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,800
Now these two can join notice that an arrow is appearing and the arrow can be flipped to the other way
77

78
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,940
if necessary.
78

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,830
But the areas that you'll merge in have to be the same size.
79

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,360
Alternatively if you'd made a real mess of the interface and you didn't want to do it you can right
80

81
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,760
click on layouts and delete it.
81

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,980
You can then go along to the plus button at the very end go to general and load up layouts again and
82

83
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,180
there you go it's back.
83

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,790
You may want to then right click on it and reorder it to the front so ends up where it was before.
84

85
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,540
So there we go.
85

86
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:19,290
Blenders interface is incredibly customizable and I encourage you to explore it and not be scared of
86

87
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,530
it either even though it covers a multitude of different disciplines but you will learn these throughout
87

88
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,350
the course and you'll become increasingly more comfortable with not only the different workspaces but
88

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,870
altering blenders layout so it suits you and your workflow.
89

90
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,050
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
