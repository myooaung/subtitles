00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video we're going to use white paint to paint the area where we want our hair to grow a really

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.460
powerful technique for getting a lot of control over your hair.

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.250
If you haven't done so already open up your head sculpt again we're going to be working in that first

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.670
thing you gonna do is click on the head means object No no I mean object mode click on head and shift

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.710
data duplicate yet right click to leave it in exactly the same position I'm going to rename this FROM

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.730
HEAD TO CALL IT head hair I'm also going to click on head hair and head and let's see I'm going to hit

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.400
em on my keyboard as opposed to em whatever else you want to hit it causes on the keyboard record you

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.950
talking about new collection on the keyboard.

9
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.640
Goodness me.

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.850
And rename this head so I can group them together because I'm gonna be working in both of those and

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.160
you know it just to be a little bit cleaner than I had been LET'S GIVE MY OTHER HEAD a capital H.

12
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.550
Okay.

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.470
Head and head here.

14
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.700
Right.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.790
These are the two I'll be working in at the moment.

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.380
Next let's turn our visibility for a head.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.760
So we're only seeing head hair.

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.200
Just check.

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.170
That's what we're looking at there.

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.160
Yes it is excellent.

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.800
Click on head hair.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
Now the thing we need to do is reduce the complexity of this.

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.840
We don't need all of these vertices even.

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.690
Goodness me there's so much of them in there's so much detail so to do that I'll click on modifier add

25
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.070
modifier and find re mesh and re mesh allows us to reduce the complexity.

26
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.470
Now let me see I'll get on a more favorable view which will be my solid shading and that's kind of a

27
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.920
cool look.

28
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.330
To be honest I like the the political style the low poly style.

29
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.920
I'm a fan of that but that's not what going for at the moment.

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.590
If we click on smooth shading you'll see that we've got a pretty good likeness.

31
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.660
We don't need the year and we don't need the mouth.

32
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.710
All we need is the head.

33
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.140
That's the place of putting the hair.

34
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560
I don't like that we've got a little bit these pumpkins at the top so going to change this setting the

35
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.670
oak tree up to five just to see.

36
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.440
That gives us the smoothness we're looking for right.

37
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.480
Yeah I think that's pretty good.

38
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.730
Again talk about the ease they can look a little bit odd doesn't matter.

39
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.240
Actually let's clear it up to six I think that's going to give us a little bit more detail without having

40
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.100
too many faces.

41
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.170
Eight thousand seven hundred and fifty compared with when we had the main head which is two hundred

42
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.860
and eighty thousand two hundred ninety thousand.

43
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.950
Okay that's good.

44
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.890
Click Apply.

45
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.320
Make sure we're on head hair quick apply.

46
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.740
Excellent.

47
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.590
That is now applied if we jump over into edit mode you'll see the topology here there's a reasonable

48
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.150
amount of detail that's good that's amount of detail we want it's pretty ugly it's not the sort of topology

49
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.490
that we'd want to use if we were trying to use the unwrap this is just for the purpose of generating

50
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.540
hair without having a bazillion vertices on there for completeness I'm going to jump in x ray mode and

51
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.330
just delete the shoulders because I don't need that delete and then faces just working in the head the

52
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.980
spot where we want hair to come out of technically we could go and get rid of all the inside faces and

53
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.490
the ease and stuff I'm not gonna worry about that for the moment if you wanted to clean it up more you

54
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.730
absolutely could.

55
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.680
Okay back into object mode let's find our particle properties add clicking the plus button rename this

56
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.840
to head hair Yep click on hair and when it comes out of everywhere reduce the hair.

57
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.870
This is where it's good to get the hair roughly the length you think the hair might be.

58
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.800
Now I in my photo over here have very short hair and I was tempted to do this lecture with trying to

59
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.250
get that accurate hair but I'm conscious that many people.

60
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.000
If you're working on yours you might want to have slightly longer hair than that and it gives us some

61
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.860
more interesting things to do so for the purpose of just this video I'm gonna make the head a hair a

62
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.710
little bit longer.

63
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.080
This is not me trying to pretend I've got longer hair it's just me trying to make this tutorial a little

64
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.270
bit more interesting than if I have my little stubbly hairdo in there and the number I'm gonna reduce

65
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.270
down to 500 for now just to see how that goes.

66
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.950
Now it's going all over the face we don't want that.

67
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.260
Now we could turn the number down to zero.

68
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.600
Jump over into particle edit add in a new hair boink and then use the simple children to have the hair

69
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.120
clump around that using the radius to have it tighter or less tight.

70
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.130
That's one way to do it.

71
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.480
There's another way I'm going to show you now which is pretty cool for the specific thing we're trying

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.930
to do so let's undo those steps.

73
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.680
Get to the point where I've got my 500.

74
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.150
Yep excellent 500 today.

75
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.830
We're going to paint some weighting onto here to say where the hedge the hair should or should not be.

76
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.670
First thing we need to do is to go down to the object data properties click on that and you can see

77
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.260
vertex groups click plus to create a new vertex group.

78
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.270
I'm going to double click or F2 and rename this to hair now over into my particle properties when a

79
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.940
scroll down until we find vertex groups and you see under density we're going to click on the selector

80
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.170
and choose here.

81
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.470
Okay.

82
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.490
Nothing's happened just yet.

83
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.150
That's all fine and dandy we're about to do something cool.

84
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.300
Happy now mode selection select white paint.

85
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.340
And from here you can see we've got our brush.

86
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.150
I'm going to make my brush a little bit smaller.

87
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.140
We've got the weight and we've got the strength.

88
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.910
Now if we paint on top of the head you can see the hair is going to grow just where we've painted which

89
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.960
is real magic.

90
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.340
I think that would be such a quick way we've kind of played around before with creating some facial

91
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.620
hair just to go plump and there we go.

92
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.750
Then we've got facial hair perhaps in the spot that we want.

93
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.280
You know what this is stunning look like like a bit of a punk rocker guy but I'm going to undo all of

94
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.040
that undo undo undo and start to paint properly.

95
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.680
You notice as soon as we paint it goes from having the particles all over the object to just being where

96
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.060
we've painted it.

97
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.720
Now let me show you a little bit here strength we increase that up often that means that we will paint

98
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:36.060
quicker the coloring from this light blue to green the colors of the rainbow sort of matched up to red.

99
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.090
Show us that this is where it says yes 100 percent of the White 100 percent put hair here and then on

100
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.950
the outskirts saying it has less weight towards that for our purposes we kind of want hair or no hair.

101
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.540
So I'm to change the fall off to more of a sharper look this fall off look down the end Hey you don't

102
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.460
have to do this but I find it just gives a little bit of a crisper edge when I paint it.

103
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.710
You see the amount of extra blurriness is a little bit smaller just so it's tighter.

104
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000
We can come back and tweak that later you can see it's very angular.

105
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.660
If you need to be exactly precise then you could go into edit mode and edit your vertices to get it

106
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.850
looking the exact way you want.

107
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.470
We shouldn't need to do that.

108
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.190
We can be in our white paint.

109
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.160
We can click on the next button down under white paint under the rush under draw sorry and blurred out

110
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.730
a little bit.

111
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.040
That should smooth that a little bit more make a little bit less less angular like that but again that

112
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.500
shouldn't matter too much with what we're doing for now we're just painting the White to say hairs should

113
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.270
or should not be able to go here.

114
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.560
Now it's a little bit tricky to see where to paint with this kind of blue look that we've got going

115
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.170
on here.

116
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:50.140
So what I'll do is within my particle properties I will find my viewport display and turn off show emitter

117
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.180
and then turn back on the head that allows us to paint directly over where the head is if I go to one

118
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.950
of my material or render views or we are to see this where I can see exactly I've already mapped out

119
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.790
where I want their hair to be going.

120
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.770
There's a whole lot of art affecting I got going on my screen here.

121
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.790
Don't worry about that that goes away.

122
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.270
I don't know why all the little black dots I don't know if you can see it on yours but I've got that

123
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.830
on mine.

124
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.570
So what I'm going to do is just go round and paint make sure I've clicked on head hair and then make

125
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.090
sure I'm on white paint and then as I paint it nothing happens.

126
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.470
Okay.

127
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.100
Sorry I just edited it a little bit of the video out and I probably clicked a few buttons that weren't

128
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.540
on before because let me put it back to what it was because I was just really trying to put down here

129
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.250
and it wouldn't work and that's because I was still on my blood all over here.

130
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.760
Don't make that same mistake as me.

131
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.260
Okay.

132
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:40.150
So let's just recalibrate what I want to do is to leave head on go into one of the views where I can

133
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.840
see where the hair should be putting my render view and just start to lay down the paint.

134
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.700
So I'm actually painting the weights and because the weights says OK I'm I'm saying hair should go there

135
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.690
I shouldn't go there then the hair is going there and we'll tidy up the hair and a little bit at the

136
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.120
moment it's just getting the shape for it

137
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.710
case I've got the edge of it.

138
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.190
Now let's just paint in the middle and increase my brush size

139
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.730
just finish it up in this mode so I can make sure I don't miss any bit so I've just changed it to solid

140
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.540
shade mode.

141
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.730
I've turned the emitter back on and I've turned the head object off so I can just very easily see the

142
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.940
rest of the paint here and I need to see the actual head itself

143
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.900
now you might get there and say ah no what have I done.

144
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.190
I've gone and painted too low down the back here.

145
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.160
Let me show you what to do if that's the case.

146
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.720
So I turn the emitter back on turn the head off.

147
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.800
So what I do is turn the white all the way down to zero.

148
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.110
It says paint a zero weight on top of the head.

149
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.950
So if I go and do a little bit of painting down here it will on paint.

150
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.270
What I've got so that's how to reverse the White painting.

151
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:02.300
If you need to reverse the White painting now back to object mode and let's see I'll turn off the emitter.

152
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.080
I will turn back on the head and we'll go add some children into interpolate.

153
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.840
There we go point.

154
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.210
We've got a whole bunch of hair.

155
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.580
So you've got the hair pretty much merit where we wanted it.

156
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.290
We've got a couple of these stragglers.

157
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.940
Now if you see the stragglers what's a better view.

158
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.300
There you go.

159
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.210
You can see that better.

160
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.560
See these guys are way out of place.

161
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:25.230
Let's go into particle edit and add some hairs right up near the front.

162
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:32.750
I'm going to change the count to 1 and just add them in pretty much the exact area that I want.

163
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.150
So when it comes to interpolate thing we've got the information this is really handy as well when you

164
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.080
want to style it.

165
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.770
And often the front of the head is going to be a very important part to style it.

166
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.330
And of course we could have just gone in hand placed all of the hairs right from the get go.

167
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.950
But I'd like to allow the interpolation to do a little bit of the work rather than hand placing everything.

168
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.690
Okay.

169
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.030
Just around the important parts around the ease I'm going to cut that one cut.

170
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.430
So it's gone.

171
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.020
Cut cut cut cut just turn around a little bit.

172
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.960
Okay cut.

173
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:12.640
That one was sticking out and I will add a couple here just around the ear and particularly if you're

174
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.530
working on female hair it's good to do a line of hair down the back and then brush it down another line

175
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.570
brush it down another line brush it down so you get that layered effect for me on my boof head here

176
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.740
I'm just kind of painting a whole bunch pretty consistent all over although technically this should

177
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.630
be a little bit of a patch missing there but as I said before we're can do this not necessarily accurate

178
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.240
to the way Rick actually is.

179
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.530
Okay.

180
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.890
Up into object mode.

181
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.900
We've got some hair let's just add some more children under display amount.

182
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.930
Let's make this 50 see how that looks and I'll put the render amount to the same so I don't have any

183
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.920
surprises.

184
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.380
Okay.

185
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.490
So then we have hair.

186
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:52.000
It's following exactly where I've painted my whites which is really quite lovely we can super easily

187
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.940
add more or subtract by just going into the White painting and adding and subtracting.

188
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:03.190
And the challenge I have for you is to set up white painting for the head you're working on create a

189
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.150
new head object by duplicating it.

190
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:11.710
And then Ramesh that to reduce the complexity use white painting to get your hair in the correct place

191
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.470
on the head and then get to the point where you're happy with the length and the position of the hair.

192
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.460
But don't worry about styling it just yet.

193
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.670
We'll be doing that in the next couple of videos.

194
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.060
OK.

195
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.990
So I pose a video and take on that challenge when you are done jumping to the next lecture and we'll

196
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.260
continue on with the process of making this hair look even better.

197
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.230
Learning a few new techniques.

198
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.530
OK see you in the next lecture.
