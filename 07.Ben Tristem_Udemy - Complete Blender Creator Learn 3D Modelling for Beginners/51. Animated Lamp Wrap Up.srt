Hello everybody and well done you have completed this section of course it's been quite a big section

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,140
and what you guys have shown me so far.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,500
Absolutely phenomenal.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,670
Thank you very much for sharing your work.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,100
Now what I will say is if you're one of those people who's been waiting to perhaps more of the end so

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,300
you've got more of a finished product to show off now would be a great time to do so.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,170
I'm really looking forward to jumping into the next lecture with you rather the next section where we're

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,240
going to start making game assets.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,670
We've had a taste in this section at the very end we've made our model compatible with a game engine

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,020
in the next section that's all about game assets themselves.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,360
And I'll see you all over in that next section.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,830
Take care.
