Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.020
In this lecture we are going to make our bowling ball just a little bit more pretty so that it looks
2

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.670
more like a decent bowling ball as you can see here.
3

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.760
This is one of the many options that we could go for but they will all look roughly the same at the
4

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.530
end anyway.
5

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.430
So let's go find out some more.
6

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.300
OK were back over with our messy looking ball here.
7

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.550
Let's see if we can do something to fix the shading.
8

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.950
First of all we need to understand why the shading is being horrible like this.
9

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.850
And it's simply because blender is doing its best to smooth shade.
10

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.810
The entire object and we've put in a 90 or over 90 degree bend that's a problem.
11

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.300
If you go more than 90 degrees and try and smooth shade it blender just doesn't know how to do it properly.
12

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
So you end up with this of artifacting on a model.
13

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.700
So how can we go ahead and sort of fix that.
14

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.030
Well the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to set up a camera zoom in here and come back out
15

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.160
again so we can find a good angle to work with about there maybe I'm having trouble.
16

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.670
There we go.
17

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
Better use the mouse wheel to slow down the progression.
18

19
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
Now one thing to bear in mind is if you come this close and see your model you are zoomed in massively
19

20
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.120
so you will see any little artifacts that are happening.
20

21
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.570
Okay.
21

22
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.210
So the first thing that I want to do here is just render out the base so I know what it looks like and
22

23
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.160
it looks horrible.
23

24
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.580
Okay.
24

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.430
What else can we do.
25

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.270
Well let's go into Slot Two and just close that down.
26

27
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.990
Then when we render the next one it will be in Slot Two.
27

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.290
We'll go to slot 3 etc. as we go so we can compare the different options.
28

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.190
Okay.
29

30
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.860
So the first one I want to do is work on the shading itself at the moment blenders being told to smooth
30

31
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.580
shade everything.
31

32
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.870
Is there a way that we can start controlling that.
32

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.640
Well there is underneath the mesh data properties.
33

34
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.330
So if we go with the bowling ball selected go to the mesh data properties scroll down a little bit more
34

35
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.920
and go to the normals tab drop that down and we have also smooth.
35

36
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.530
And that means that anything greater than 30 degrees will be flat shaded.
36

37
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.070
So if I increase that we find that the inside goes.
37

38
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.070
Which perfect.
38

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.650
And then eventually we'll get to a point where it goes just like it was before.
39

40
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.300
So I would say that this is a good halfway house here.
40

41
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.950
And we've probably got an issue at the bottom.
41

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780
Yes it's rounded out the the bottom as well.
42

43
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.080
See if we can increase that slightly and get the bottom back in here we go.
43

44
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.490
So that's where the bottoms in as well.
44

45
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.070
So we can see everything going on there.
45

46
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.270
It doesn't look quite right and that's because it goes smooth and then the sharp angle and smooth again
46

47
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.780
things don't usually look like that in real life.
47

48
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.870
And certainly they wouldn't be with this type of top smooth inside.
48

49
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.490
You couldn't really get away with that.
49

50
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.630
So the accurate way of displaying that would be like this.
50

51
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.910
And those don't look like comfortable finger holes.
51

52
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.420
So I don't think this is going to be the suitable way of going forward.
52

53
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.980
But that is one way of making sure that you have flat shaded or flat areas and smooth shaded areas on
53

54
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.710
your model.
54

55
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.470
Let's render that out.
55

56
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.770
That's gone on to slots and then slot three skill sets up and ready to render to.
56

57
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.040
I'll shut that down.
57

58
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.880
What else can we do.
58

59
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.260
Well let's turn off auto smooth and go back to this stage.
59

60
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.880
The next thing that we're going to do is we're going to turn on the modifier.
60

61
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.120
So we're going to go to the modifiers tab go to the second column which generates geometry and go to
61

62
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.680
the sub division surface modifier and we'll get a bump that up so maybe two or three levels.
62

63
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.930
That's going to increase the number of triangles in our scene.
63

64
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.000
But it's going to give us a good idea of how this looks if it's smoothed out.
64

65
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.930
The other thing to bear in mind is the render quality of the render quality is lower than the viewport.
65

66
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.270
You can end up with it looking good in the viewport and then when you hit render it looks a bit ugly.
66

67
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.510
So now that we've got the subdivision surface modifier setup we can have 12 to give us a starting point
67

68
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.040
we can see here.
68

69
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.530
It looks lovely and smooth.
69

70
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.800
It doesn't have the horrible artifact thing it did before is pinching a little in the middle but that
70

71
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.750
is to be expected but it's not very well controlled.
71

72
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.270
So how can we make it a bit neater with out adding extra geometry.
72

73
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.550
Let's go and select slot four and come back again.
73

74
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.980
Let's go into edit mode.
74

75
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.550
I'm going to use the alt key and select the edge loops.
75

76
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.800
So making sure I'm in edge select around that hole and I've managed to miss it there.
76

77
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.810
There we go that one there.
77

78
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.570
Can I deselect.
78

79
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.130
Perfect.
79

80
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.240
So we've got these three edges selected.
80

81
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.540
I'm going to open up the properties panel and the area you want to look for is under edge data.
81

82
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.740
You want to look at the mean crease level.
82

83
00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.390
If I turn that up to 100 percent or 1 when we go ahead and look at it it will look a lot sharper than
83

84
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.180
it did before.
84

85
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.910
And this might be all you want to do.
85

86
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.530
However if we take a closer look at the model itself just change.
86

87
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.280
That to slot five.
87

88
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.230
It looks like we've added a little bit of a lip there as well which is something we perhaps don't want
88

89
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.260
to do.
89

90
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.090
So we may want to go back in and let's set at that point eight.
90

91
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.500
So it's a little bit less and a little bit smoother going round.
91

92
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.930
I mean this is something you can tweak to your heart's content.
92

93
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.720
We certainly don't want one.
93

94
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.400
We may want something above 50 percent by the looks of it.
94

95
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.170
So maybe point five five let's render that out that's starting to look pretty good.
95

96
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.850
Let's go to slot 6 and explore another option.
96

97
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.140
This is what I love about blender.
97

98
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.710
There's always more than one way to do something.
98

99
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.800
So we've still got this horrible shading here.
99

100
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.840
What happens if we add some geometry.
100

101
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.870
Now I wouldn't go ahead and subdivide the edges even though we could potentially get a round circle
101

102
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.370
there.
102

103
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.330
It won't look great overall.
103

104
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.160
Made that mistake in the past.
104

105
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.420
So what else can we do here.
105

106
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.820
Well we could bevel these edges.
106

107
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.950
So we've gone to the vertex menu before and selected bevel vertices.
107

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:17.390
However if we go to the edge menu there's an option to bevel edges which is control and B so we do control
108

109
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.020
and B what we can do is we can widen that out.
109

110
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.290
We can see it pushes apart almost like an inset either side of an edge and erasing that original edge
110

111
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.060
and we can make it a bit smoother by using the mouse wheel.
111

112
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.960
We can add more segments in and of course looking at the bevel modifier we get a similar set of options
112

113
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.060
to what we had before with the vertex bevel.
113

114
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.100
What happens if we come out and have a look at it like that.
114

115
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.700
OK.
115

116
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.810
So we're still dealing with something quite low poly so if we go ahead and render it we will end up
116

117
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.180
with artifacting.
117

118
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:56.150
Now one thing I want to stress at this point is you will get artifacting when you render a low poly
118

119
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.630
model with smooth shading turned on you will almost always have some sort of artefact going on which
119

120
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.330
is why for all of the other exercises we have had turned on the subdivisions surface modified.
120

121
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.600
Let's see if this makes a difference so if  we go up to a quality level sorry a quality level a render
121

122
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.520
level of two subdivisions let's see what that looks like.
122

123
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.660
That looks pretty good as well but that's added extra geometry and has it added to the overall feel
123

124
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.830
of the model.
124

125
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.010
I think it has, I'm going to set that up just one level higher and to see if that makes a difference when we
125

126
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.570
have a look at it here.
126

127
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.610
Yes yes it does.
127

128
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.780
And the other thing that we can do and I've seen this on a lot of bowling ball models is now that we
128

129
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.800
have the extra geometry there and we perhaps didn't need this middle bit so we can go in selecting that
129

130
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.360
middle bit and once it's selected we can dissolve those edges.
130

131
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:59.890
What we can now do is we can assign a material to that face loop that runs around and if we do that
131

132
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.880
much we will be able to do make sure we can select them is we can have different colored rims around
132

133
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.730
the holes I've seen that style on a lot of different bowling balls where this area here is colored in
133

134
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.670
probably so you can see where your fingers are supposed to go on an otherwise spherical object.
134

135
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.180
So there we go.
135

136
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.870
They are my top tips on how to make a sharp transition whilst dealing with an
136

137
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.920
otherwise smooth object.
137

138
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.920
I quite like this particular one but now it's time for your challenge. Okay so your challenge is to work
138

139
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.780
on your bowling ball to make the holes look much better than they currently do.
139

140
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:43.760
We're mainly focused on that shading artifacts that happen around the holes at the moment.
140

141
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.310
Now keep the triangle count below 10000.
141

142
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:52.430
We don't want to brute force it's by just keep subdividing for instance but do use the subdivision modifier.
142

143
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.000
If you think that is going to help you out there.
143

144
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.750
Experiment with different options and pick the one that works for you.
144

145
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:04.370
I do want you to be a bit more experimental at this stage I want you to explore the different options
145

146
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.230
that we've been through perhaps try out some ideas of your own as well and if you've tried something
146

147
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.940
different than what I've shown you already I'd love to hear about it over in the discussions.
147

148
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.910
But for the moment pause the video now and give that a go
148

149
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.080
Okay everybody Welcome back.
149

150
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:27.320
Let's go ahead now hop on over into blender and finish off of the holes of our bowling ball okay.
150

151
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.250
So I'm gonna just revert this back to this horrible state that we were on before.
151

152
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:41.700
Now looking at the topology underneath I do really want somewhere that I can have the rings around here.
152

153
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.900
This is a design decision at this point.
153

154
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.980
If you were making a model that did not have a colored ring around here you could probably just leave
154

155
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.710
it.
155

156
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.040
But I am going to have a colored model and because I'm just working with material colors at the moment
156

157
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.140
I want to make sure that I can apply it to the surface and I cannot do that unless there's geometry
157

158
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.160
there to apply it to.
158

159
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.200
So to begin with the bottom of these holes they're already selected is there something I want to do with
159

160
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.410
them.
160

161
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.920
Well to be honest they're out of sight and out of mind.
161

162
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.260
So I'm going to leave it.
162

163
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.010
I'm not going to even worry about them, Let's work up the rim of these holes so I'm going to select
163

164
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.130
the rim of the holes, I am going to bevel.
164

165
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.820
There we go.
165

166
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.060
And let's just bring that out to about there I think.
166

167
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.370
OK.
167

168
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.840
That's looking good.
168

169
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:36.630
Add a subdivision surface modifier and I'm going to add a level of two to the model and that brings
169

170
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.970
our triangle count to nine thousand one hundred.
170

171
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.300
So I'm happy with that.
171

172
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.130
I'm also happy that if.. and we can't look at it directly but I'm going to come into the model here.
172

173
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:54.430
I'm happy with the very close up that we've got here where we get a bit too close.
173

174
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.600
Here we go something like that and render it doesn't look completely smooth around the edge.
174

175
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:05.370
You know what I'm happy with that for the moment because it's it's meeting the 10k spec.
175

176
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.950
The only way I'm going to get that really really smooth around the edge here is to actually increase
176

177
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.330
the poly count.
177

178
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.690
I'm going to hide that away for the moment.
178

179
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:21.030
I'm just going to play with the other option that we had before under the mesh data properties under
179

180
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:26.450
the normals and auto smooth just to see if I can get a neater edge around.
180

181
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.340
So that's that's a bit too much there.
181

182
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.410
That's.
182

183
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:37.090
Is there an angle of which I can exploit it so I end up with a decent rim around.
183

184
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.050
So if we turn it up massively we get obviously the whole thing gets this sort mottled effect.
184

185
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:49.920
I really want to focus on just one hole there so let's go over and increase it slowly and I believe
185

186
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.510
I mentioned this earlier on in the course but if I haven't already then you can also hold down the shift
186

187
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:00.480
key when you're scrolling and it gives much finer control when you're moving your mouse from the left
187

188
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.170
to the right.
188

189
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:10.080
If you need it so you can see at the point there that's where we start losing all of the extra sharpness
189

190
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.830
around these holes.
190

191
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.960
Does that look any good.
191

192
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.920
The question I would say no in this case I'm not going to go with that look and this is it.
192

193
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.560
If you're experimenting it's absolutely fine.
193

194
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.820
And I would always encourage you guys to experiment and just have fun as you go.
194

195
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:30.630
So we've got this bit of geometry goes into the model and I'm happy with how that's looking because
195

196
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.350
we can modify it later on.
196

197
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.270
So that's coming along really well.
197

198
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.010
I'm just trying to think if there's anything else I want to add to my ball whilst I'm here.
198

199
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.220
Otherwise the finger holes themselves are done.
199

200
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.510
We're getting a triangle count of nine thousand one hundred twenty which I'm happy with.
200

201
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.860
Coincidentally I did wonder how much it would cost me if these bottom bits which I'm going to have to
201

202
00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:03.600
go into wireframe mode to select so that bottom bit there that there and that one there perfect managed
202

203
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:09.260
select it not too hard, I'm going to delete those faces and come out again.
203

204
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.040
So it saves us a couple of hundred polygons.
204

205
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:19.260
It's not significant and it may cause us an issue if you can see through so i'm going leave them attached
205

206
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.430
for the moment.
206

207
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.970
That's pretty cool looking at it like that.
207

208
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.330
I'm gonna go back into, Lets do  lookdev mode.
208

209
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:32.050
It just looks a bit shiny is reflecting the environment that set up I'm liking how that's come together.
209

210
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.640
Brilliant.
210

211
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.260
How are you guys getting on.
211

212
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:40.410
Which method did you choose do share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next
212

213
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:40.890
lecture.
