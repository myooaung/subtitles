1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,200
So that concludes this section of the course.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,070
We've had a good time.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,660
Hope you've created something you're proud of.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,610
And if, like me, look at your creation and you see there's still a lot to improve and oh, I wish

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,480
I did that better.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,240
And there's more that I can work on this particular part.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,920
Then take as much time as you like.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,080
Really finesse it to the point where you're happy with it.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,820
But don't be too hard on yourself.

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,810
If you're not quite there yet, it's all about practice with these things.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,240
And if you've been interested in the character creation side of things and want to create more than

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,980
just the head, maybe some arms and legs in a body, then be sure to check out our blender character,

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,340
create a course where we do go into creating those arms and legs and body.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,410
And we work on rigging and animating and texturing and all the good stuff that comes along with character

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,040
creation.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,990
So great work in this section.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,130
I look forward to seeing what you've come up with and I will see you in another section of the class.
