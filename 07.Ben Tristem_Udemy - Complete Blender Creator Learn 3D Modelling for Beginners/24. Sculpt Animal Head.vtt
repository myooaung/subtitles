00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.430
In this video, we're going to be working on the head of our animal, adding some is if your animal

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.070
has ears and doing a lot of sculpting of the face.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.910
I've added a second image right into my scene here so you can see what I'm talking about.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.890
I've also got my pure RF board with my images, but it's a little bit harder for me to record that while

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.780
I'm talking to you because it gets in the way.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.570
But I wanted to show you the shape of the cat that I'm working with and the broad areas that I need

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.660
to be taking into consideration as I'm going through this process.

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.860
So you can see the mouth has a certain shape to it that has a squareness on the side.

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.080
The two sides here goes down into a point and then up into a triangle.

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.080
And within it we have the nose making that sort of shape.

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.960
So this is the shape that both of these two cats have of ours to look at.

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.430
One of these other cats say this one.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.650
It has a lot more of a triangle.

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.110
So from the bridge of the nose down to the bottom, left over the bottom of the bottom right of the

15
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.340
mouth there and back up.

16
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.950
So it makes more of a triangle with a little bit of a up peak where their mouth is represented.

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.900
So I looked at it.

18
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.950
This cat also has a very wide head.

19
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.820
It kind of looks a little bit like a chubby cat, doesn't it, because it's furry and its heads a little

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.530
bit wider than it is high.

21
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.660
Whereas I think the sort of cat that I'm interested in is has a little bit more of a higher head.

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.850
It's still wider than it is higher, but it's not quite as wide as this cat over here.

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.140
The other reason is that I've dropped this new cat into the scene as I think I'll end up current coloring

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.080
my cat as black.

25
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.240
So I want to have this in here so we get used to the colors as we're going through the process.

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.360
Now, the next thing in terms of blocking it out is that I'm looking at here is we've got a fairly pronounced

27
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.420
bridge of the nose that sticks out and similar to humans in many ways, you know, eyes and nose, mouth,

28
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.250
etc., but just the shape a little bit differently.

29
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.090
And the eyes you can see the inside corner to the outside corner has much more of a slope on it like

30
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.490
that that we need to take into consideration.

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.700
Morrissey human would be a little bit more straight on just under those.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.640
So as we're drawing our stories, we're sculpting the eyes.

33
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.950
We need to be taking those points into consideration.

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.680
And also the thing that is a little bit tricky is where do the ears join the head on a cat or whatever

35
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.660
animal you're working on and you see with this cats is they match right up to the very size.

36
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.160
There's a nice straight line that's made and where they join is roughly above the inside of the eye.

37
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.570
So we can use that as a point for where we we have the ears joining the head.

38
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.970
And there's a bit of a natural curvature where there is a natural curvature to the head and then a little

39
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.520
bit of a cavity that we need to create within the ear.

40
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.010
And then the ear itself is a pretty straightforward kind of triangle with not too pointy an end on it,

41
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.580
in on it.

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.330
And so the overall shape of the head itself is going to be obviously oval in shape if you just draw

43
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.580
around the outside here and it's definitely a little bit wider than it is high.

44
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.560
It's not quite round.

45
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.790
It's a little bit more squashed down, whereas a human head, human heads tend to be a little bit more

46
00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.690
oval that way.

47
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.350
Or is the cat.

48
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.520
We're kind of rotating the head a little more sideways when we're looking at it from this front on view.

49
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.070
If we zoom around over here and have a look at the side on, this isn't really the best cat, I think,

50
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.940
for me to be using in many ways.

51
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.400
Where am I was turned off my model, which is currently so-called.

52
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.680
Shame on me.

53
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.670
Let's rename that to Cat.

54
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.660
They would go on as hide that for a moment.

55
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.540
So looking from a side on point of view, you can see the ears are heading all the way back here where

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.000
they join.

57
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.500
Actually, no, this probably skin or fur there, isn't it?

58
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.580
That, I'd say is from there to there.

59
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.540
So when we're looking at our front on view, it looked like it was on the front of the head or, you

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.210
know, up in the sky.

61
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.830
Front and front.

62
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.930
Whereas when we looked from the side on view for this particular cat, we can see that it's not quite

63
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.610
so, not quite so.

64
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.330
Obviously, front to front at the back of the ear is a lot back on the head.

65
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.060
And then the head shape is like rounded.

66
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.120
And we have a fairly flat front of the face, flat front of the face and flat nose making that sort

67
00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.690
of angle.

68
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.420
And the brow does stick out somewhat.

69
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.860
It is a little bit stuck out.

70
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.090
So you don't to have a head that's too flat like that, you need to have it sticking out a little bit

71
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.740
more where we've got the bridge of the nose.

72
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.180
And then a little bit in here, I think we'll play around with after we've modelled the head.

73
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.020
And up here for this particular cat you can see just looks like a straight line.

74
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.690
Zinczenko But when I turn my cat back on, you say it looks a little bit odd.

75
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.960
I think once we get the head in there, it might look a little bit better, but at the moment seems

76
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.010
like the next little bit long.

77
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.020
But we'll see how that all plays out.

78
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.550
Throw you over to your challenge, which is to sculpt the head start by understanding the main shapes

79
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.000
and lines of the head with whatever particular animal you're working with.

80
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.650
It's going to have some similarities.

81
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.010
The human head that we've worked on, but obviously it's going to have them.

82
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.680
The shapes and sizes and placements different block out those shapes first, add some clay strips down

83
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.270
if you like, and mold it into shape and then add more details once you've got those broader shapes

84
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.720
into place.

85
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.120
And as I did before, when you come back from working on your head.

86
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.330
I'll just quickly take you through a speed recording of me going through my cat head.

87
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.840
OK.

88
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.660
So you take on that challenge, sculpt the head, I'll see back here when you done.

89
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.200
Radio, let's start by adding the shape of the front of the mouth, just that triangle kind of shape

90
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.590
he's talking about before adding the bridge of the nose to smoothing out as we go.

91
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.830
I'm using clayey strips.

92
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.700
I like the old clay strips and down and down smudge around.

93
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.990
Just line it up.

94
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.430
Look it out.

95
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.970
Reference images quite a lot.

96
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.680
Doing lots of smoothing.

97
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.410
Just digging as well with the clay strips.

98
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.330
So techniques that you're familiar with by now with the clay strip.

99
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.410
I'm just going around doing a little bit of pushing and playing with the grab tool.

100
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.130
I kind of bounce around all the different tools depending upon when I get stuck.

101
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.350
So if it feels like I'm not getting enough purchase, then I might try another tool trying to make the

102
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.300
nose a little bit pointier at the end there, digging in the eyes just with the draw tool.

103
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.060
Now the crease tool trying to get that sharper line, you could use the draw sharp tool as well in this

104
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.620
instance, trying to get the edges, trying to get a little bit of definition by using that crease tool

105
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.570
and then flattening the bridge of the nose, getting some blue bit more brow.

106
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.850
And there seems a bit odd saying eyebrows for Catts.

107
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.400
Kessner really have eyebrows because that's all covered in hair.

108
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.970
But they've got brows and those brows above their eyes.

109
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.430
So technically eyebrows digging around the nose.

110
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.080
You can see that I'm having a little bit of an issue with the resolution of my mesh, particularly around

111
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.500
the nose.

112
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.560
So if you're finding that, then jump into Duyen Toppo and increase the value in there so you get more

113
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.160
resolution.

114
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
You don't get that kind of pixelation popping in a mouth.

115
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.270
I tried the happy smiley cat mouth, which technically is kind of where their mouth goes, but looks

116
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.380
a little bit silly doing that.

117
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.350
Cats tend not to be smiling as they're just hanging out.

118
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.480
You know how cats are so just gone for that smaller mouth at the moment.

119
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.600
Then we'll see how it looks when we cover it with hair and fur.

120
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.870
Might need to dig in a little bit more.

121
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.550
It's trying to get the shape of the head.

122
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.670
The grab tool with a big setting to push and pull the entire head, flatten out the front of it a little

123
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:59.090
bit, and then just adding more detail, more features, more brow using the clay strips, digging things

124
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.700
out, getting the crevices, looking the way they're supposed to look.

125
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.620
Just the normal process we've been through.

126
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.370
I did have a little bit of problem with the chin, depending upon which image I look at.

127
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.190
Some cats have a larger chin, some have a smaller chin, kind of that area, double chin, if it was

128
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.680
humans, if you will, underneath the the bottom of the main chin there.

129
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.470
So I was having a little bit of trouble with that, just trying to get the right shape when it looked

130
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.480
like one of the other cats in my images.

131
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.130
It just didn't feel right.

132
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.780
And then at this point, I'm saying I think I've made a seal, and that's mostly because we don't have

133
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.890
any E's in there yet.

134
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.700
So let's add some is the way I went about doing this is I added a cube mesh, scaled it to size, got

135
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.200
it roughly in the position of where I wanted the East to be.

136
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:45.110
Then add a subdivision surface modifier, increase the values up to three four Renda and viewport clicked

137
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.360
on page very important and then jumped up to edit mode and added in some extra loop cut.

138
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.920
So control off of the loop cuts and then just moving those around.

139
00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:01.460
Now I'm editing the cage itself, which is going to change the underlying structure that's been subdivided,

140
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.570
rotating it around the position that I want, move it, kind of get that forward.

141
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:11.210
I'm stalking my prey, kind of lean to the is a lot of animal is are going to be naturally straight

142
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.960
up or back.

143
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.020
But these ones I want to have forward and then I can use that cage.

144
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.250
So I'm in edit mode.

145
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.110
I'm just hitting three on the keyboard to get face and that allows me to move that geometry around.

146
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.640
Of course, I could have just sculpted it just by using the snakelike tool and writing out, but decided

147
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.810
to go with this approach.

148
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.220
And at this point I'm pretty happy with the air, so I'm going to mirror that or add modifier at the

149
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.560
mirror modifier and just do a little bit more proportional editing with the head.

150
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.170
And at this stage, I wanna join my ears to my head.

151
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:45.110
So I'm gonna go out and just check that I have in preferences that I have the ball tool as my add on

152
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.210
is installed and yes, it is already hit and on the keyboard find edit and then I'm going to click on

153
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.440
the Cube which the is and also click on the cat.

154
00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.140
So control click on the cat and then just click on Union and that will merge those two things together.

155
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.090
If I scroll around, look on the inside you can see that it removed all the bottom faces from the ease

156
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.210
and make sure that is welded onto the head of the cat.

157
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.000
We just check that by grabbing some my sculpt tool.

158
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.200
You can see it's modifying the the ease and the head at the same time.

159
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.510
That's important just to check that it's all connected and your wireframe doesn't have half of the ease

160
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.950
ticking through the head of the animal.

161
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.820
Okay, so I'm just speeding things up again, just playing around with a little bit of remeasured to

162
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.970
make sure that I've got the right amount of density for my cat.

163
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.470
That's a little bit too low.

164
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.290
Point zero zero four within rematch seems fine.

165
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.830
So to make sure that the ease roughly matched the head, just hollowing it out.

166
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:42.940
So back into my draw tool, using control to dig building adulatory to the back of the is clay tool

167
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.580
once again.

168
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.030
And then if you have a look at images of cats with their ease, it's pretty gross.

169
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.780
Something to search for on the Internet inside of cat ears.

170
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.860
But you can see roughly where the ear hole is supposed to be in the ear.

171
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.660
So I've tried to approximate that a little bit.

172
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.130
Not that we're ever gonna be looking inside the cat's ear, but it just helped me to get through the

173
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.670
process of making the ear just a little bit of last shaping and building.

174
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.880
And I wouldn't recommend this if.

175
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.760
Slower computer that went into edit mode and pretty much nearly crashed my system, just scaling up

176
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.860
the size of the head and then going around and smoothing the process a little bit more, smoothing a

177
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.140
little bit more, looking at the head and generally declaring for now the head and the ears are done.

178
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.980
So hopefully you've had a good success working on your animal as well.

179
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.200
Remember that this is something that takes many tries, many goes, much practice to get looking the

180
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.720
way you want to.

181
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.910
And also, remember, we're gonna be covering it with hair so we can forgive a few of the things that

182
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.260
aren't exactly perfect.

183
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.400
Okay, great stuff.

184
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.700
I will see you in the next lecture.
