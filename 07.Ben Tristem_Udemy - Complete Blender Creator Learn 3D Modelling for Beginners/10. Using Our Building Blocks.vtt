00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.690
Welcome to using our building blocks in this video.

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.150
You set your commit message before working.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.900
And that's important because that allows us to focus on the work that we're doing.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.350
It also means that we won't slip out of what we want to do and end up doing lots of other things.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.410
It also means when we need to go back in time if we need to go back in time in the future that we've

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.740
got a precise location we know what we did at that point in time we're going to start building your

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.170
building and that's very important we've got these assets that we've made the wall the doorway the window

8
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.300
etc. but we haven't used them in anything at the moment so it's not a good idea to produce a load of

9
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.990
those into you seen their real effect.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.130
When you brought them into a model and start assembling them not very lean if we produced tons of stuff

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.650
and haven't used it yet but we've only got a few items it's a good time now to bring them in and start

12
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.200
noticing a few issues and working out a way around them things we need to correct things we need to

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.240
modify.

14
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.500
So let's go explore this now and hop straight on over in a blender.

15
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
Okay so of course before we hop straight into blender we need to make sure we're focussed on what we're

16
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.890
doing so let's go ahead and click on commit.

17
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.280
Now there's going to be nothing to commit at the moment unless you've changed something in your working

18
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.990
folder.

19
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.720
However I haven't said there's nothing to commit that's absolutely fine.

20
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.270
I'm going to go to my commit message down the bottom here and I'm going to paste in the title of the

21
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.310
one I'm working which is using our building blocks and I'm going to put in testing as well.

22
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.490
Just to make sure we know that we're testing the project here.

23
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.770
Now I can't click commit or anything that's just ready to go in a bit.

24
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.910
I'm going to minimize that and put it out of the way for the moment.

25
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.900
I've gone ahead and opened up a brand new blender file and I'm going to remove the cube from the scene

26
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.700
because it bears no relevance unless leave the camera and the basic lighting because we can use that

27
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.640
for testing.

28
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.550
So we're going to be spending all of these objects will go on to linking them in a bit.

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.980
Because that's got some additional benefits to it.

30
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.350
But just to get a feel about what we're doing is just gonna spend them in and we can see the short cut

31
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.630
there is shift an EF 1.

32
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.130
So we go ahead and press shift and EF 1 we can start importing now.

33
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.490
I'm going to have to navigate to my assets PAC.

34
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
I'm not going to bring in many at this point.

35
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.680
I just want a feel of what's going on.

36
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.810
So when I go to my meshes I'm going to bring in a square not the square detail just the plain old square

37
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.270
so square object and the square mash and I would shift an EF 1 again.

38
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.140
Again you can go through the menu system if you want.

39
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.580
I'm going to bring in the doors because that's quite a useful one to work with.

40
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.770
And finally I'm going to bring in the window as well and I've got two choices of windows so I balked

41
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.240
that one out.

42
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.410
I'm going to bring in the one detail because then I'm going to have to rotate it at some point.

43
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.450
Now that we've got V's into our scene what we can start doing is moving them about now.

44
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.900
One of the things to bear in mind is a quick glance at the outliner at the moment.

45
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.820
We've only got three or mesh objects in there but when we start duplicating and moving and all that

46
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.570
sort of stuff to produce are our building we'll see in a moment that that starts to get very messy and

47
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.100
very complicated and difficult to navigate.

48
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.240
So it's all so worthwhile.

49
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.880
Before you start doing this not afterwards because it becomes a pain to do afterwards but before doing

50
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.150
this we actually create ourselves in empty and it doesn't matter which one of these you choose I'm going

51
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.920
to choose a plain axis and I'm going to cool it all under no room test for the moment and then everything

52
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.410
can be linked to that empty.

53
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.220
And when I reproduce or duplicate something I'm going to make sure it's added to the room test.

54
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.790
So let's go ahead and start playing with these things straightaway now instead of just grabbing them

55
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.740
and moving them about because we've made them out of whole blender units.

56
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.500
It's very easy to quickly make something up.

57
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.440
So I'm going to make sure that the snapping tool is turned on that we've got the snapping set.

58
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.880
So the type increment which is the bottom one of that list.

59
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.370
And now we can just literally move things in increments of whole blending units which is very powerful.

60
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.610
Since we've got things set up like that.

61
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.480
So I've got this basic thing here let's make a let's keep moving it I'm going to make an eight by four

62
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.970
room I think there's eight by four or soon find out.

63
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.760
So I've got a window on the end and a door and I'm going to duplicate by holding down shift than day.

64
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.270
Not not necessarily linked duplicates because I may want to make these independent.

65
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.130
So in this case it doesn't really matter and I'm going to place it there quickly and rotate it on was

66
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.170
z axis by 90.

67
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.570
Now I've got a particular direction where this is the outside and this is the inside.

68
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:08.640
So this is going to have to be moved to over here brilliant So let's move that up and across to there.

69
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.310
I'm going to duplicate that again and lock it to the y axis and place it where I need it.

70
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.970
Finally I'm going to grab both of them and Jube placate again.

71
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.100
Just check checketts duplicated rotate it on the z axis by 180 and then I can quickly shift it over

72
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.160
here and a long to there.

73
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.770
Now we can already see there's going to be a few issues.

74
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.460
These corners don't mine up and there's a couple of choices as to what we can do here.

75
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.740
Am I going to put the floor in first hand and make sure that it works.

76
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.020
Now the floors a little high so I've got to make a note here that the floor needs to be dropped down

77
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:55.010
so every time I import a particular floor piece it sits below the floor or everything else sits above.

78
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.940
I think it's easier if we make the floor piece sits below.

79
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.670
So I'm going to move them all well.

80
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.080
I'll move it first so move in the z axis.

81
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.990
By mine this amp that point to fry fix so that should put it at the base.

82
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.150
And again you can use an array modifier for this.

83
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.540
If you would like to but I'm very quickly just building this up haven't saved yet.

84
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.900
But that's okay.

85
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.320
Then thing I'd lose too much of my day.

86
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.470
If a blender decided to crash.

87
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.770
Now we can see there that it's gone underneath our our piece here.

88
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.730
No that's not a particular problem because that's nice it lines up nice and flush.

89
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.300
But you can see in certain other places let's just pull it back slightly This is a great example here

90
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.920
so we got the door here.

91
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.320
If we wanted to use this externally as well as internally we can see that these pieces don't quite line

92
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.910
up.

93
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.000
So there's a couple of things.

94
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.640
Can do here.

95
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.690
I can make sure that all of my wall polices also go down by point to five so that sorts out that and

96
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.850
then they sit nice and flush.

97
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.110
I can make sure all of my wall pieces extend by point to.

98
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.840
But hang on a minute.

99
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.130
Which piece do I want.

100
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.820
It doesn't end up very modular.

101
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.800
If I have to keep adding and moving and picking certain window sizes that are an end piece or a beginning

102
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.360
piece what would be easier is if there was another piece that fills in these gaps.

103
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:25.300
So a for by this is four across Isn't it so a 4 by point twenty five pillar could sit in there and then

104
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.510
we can make a decision here as to whether or not we go all the way down and that would be three point

105
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.140
twenty five in height.

106
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:39.520
So we got prehaps some extra pieces to make we could fill that gap in exactly or even make a corner

107
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:45.760
P So an L shaped corner piece and that might actually be more practical than just a thin sliver to sit

108
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.410
inside the wall or even both to give us more options.

109
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:55.090
But you can see the power of that straight away that we've mocked up a basic room in a matter of seconds

110
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.200
from pieces.

111
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.010
Now obviously this is a series of pieces all strapped together and it looks like a series of pieces

112
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.750
all strapped together because we've not got much variety.

113
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.770
But as soon as we get a bit more variety in there we can start playing now because all of these pieces

114
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.520
before we duplicated them were underneath the empty.

115
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.720
Imagine if they weren't going to have them move them all individuals point because they were underneath

116
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.760
that empty.

117
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:27.100
We've now got a nice clean hierarchy we've got this single room and then we can move the single room

118
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.240
by just moving there empty that everything's parentage to.

119
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.920
So it's very important just like setting the commit message before starting your project so you remain

120
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.460
focussed on what you're doing.

121
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:45.130
That we start doing the actual hierarchy is well before we start modelling and putting all the pieces

122
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.020
together.

123
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:51.400
Trust me if this was a much bigger room than this and those items if you were trying to nest them and

124
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:58.040
parent them all to something it can take a real time to try and organise what's what and where it is.

125
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.210
Of course all of these at the moment are just named.

126
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.250
Well they're kind of named in appropriately because it's just the static mesh wall window detail whatever

127
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.430
the sign says 0 1 it doesn't tell us where it is on the model.

128
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.950
So another thing you can do if once you're happy with it naming them I think is probably best.

129
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.960
Afterwards again everybody's got their different ways of doing it but until you've made it up you don't

130
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.110
know the position of that so this one here.

131
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:33.610
I could go in and rename it if this was an orientation I call call it south window or something along

132
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.580
those lines so I know where it is.

133
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:43.430
If this was a kitchen or the the altar room or whatever that you're working on you can even name it.

134
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.150
You know self and then be more explicit kitchen window or in this case.

135
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:56.530
I would probably put the room first so if it was a kitchen but kitchen so all of the kitchen stuff is

136
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:03.940
grouped together kitchen south window etc. so it's entirely up to you how you do these namings because

137
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:10.720
it does depend on the project you are working on as to whether one naming structure would be better

138
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.490
than another and you will find that you may even change your mind halfway through.

139
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.350
You have to grin and bear with it.

140
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.070
Much like modelling itself if you make a mistake sometimes you just have to start over anyway.

141
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.840
Now we've learnt about appending these things into the scene.

142
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.670
I've of course got a challenge for you guys.

143
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.930
I would like you to finish off the layouts.

144
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:40.320
So go ahead and make a modular corner piece that we can use carry on a spending bill blocks into a new

145
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.530
blend file.

146
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.630
I suggest storing the blend file in a scene's directory in our working folder.

147
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.820
Build a simple building.

148
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.190
Don't go over the top at this point in time.

149
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.700
Never thing to finish off the layout.

150
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.480
Did you notice any other pieces missing that you actually need.

151
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.790
Make sure you make a note of them so you know the size that you're making and putting together.

152
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:12.540
Remember to save your blend file state your files and finally make the commit.

153
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.060
Remember to share your building.

154
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.280
In the discussions remember it's a prototype building at the moment.

155
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.160
He doesn't have to be glorious in any way.

156
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.780
Pause a video now and give that a go.

157
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.850
Okay guys.

158
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.800
Welcome back.

159
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.090
Let's go finish off the lay out in blender.

160
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:37.280
Okay so the first thing that I'm going to do here is just save my file because I haven't done that yet.

161
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.350
And that's quite important.

162
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.730
I'm going to save it into a scene's directory so we're going to save as just to make sure I'm not over

163
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.040
writing anything.

164
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:52.980
And hoping I am but it's worthwhile checking and I go to my game assets folder and this is the that's

165
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.030
the folder on tracking and I need to create a new folder and you can do that in blender is the sick

166
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.950
one two three four fifth icon along here fifth sixth.

167
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.360
I can't count for there plus one sixth grader that one of the star on it.

168
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.880
And I'm going to call this scenes and I'm going to open that up and I'm literally going to give it that

169
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.750
name again using our bill blocks.

170
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.910
Test Room.

171
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.600
I'm going to save that file.

172
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.500
Now I know that I need to just modify a couple of these pieces now because I have appended them into

173
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.670
the scene and not linked them.

174
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:34.790
That means that none of these will up date when I modify the original model where these have come from.

175
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.950
We'll learn about linking in a bit.

176
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.720
So that's a bit of a pain.

177
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.370
All of these models I can't just change at once.

178
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:48.960
Now they do all use the same mesh data which is useful so I can in theory edit all of them here.

179
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.720
But that's that's going to be a bit too much at this point in time I'm imagining if this was much much

180
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.840
bigger would certainly want to work and alter one thing and affect every one of those instances.

181
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.730
So there's a couple of things that I need to make here.

182
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:09.690
I've identified this corner strip here and I've identified this bottom strip along here as well.

183
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.880
So there's a couple of places that I like.

184
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:17.520
I need something in place basically to make sure that it's not horrible.

185
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:24.510
Now the site the same one i'm using across the bottom here I can then use along the bottom here as well.

186
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.220
So there's lots of things to do.

187
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.820
I think a small to poor.

188
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.630
Oh point two five cube will suffice for the moment for these corners.

189
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.900
And then I can position them appropriately.

190
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.580
Of course I'm not going to show you me modelling some extruded cubes except incense the.

191
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.750
So I'll be back in a few moments and place these and finish off my scene.

192
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:56.730
Okay guys so I've been off and I have created a series as you can see cubes here so I haven't named

193
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.790
them appropriately and slap myself on the wrists for that one.

194
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.210
But suffice to say I I've now got a sealed model without extra bits or grooves in it.

195
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.550
Now one might say at this point perhaps that's a bit too much detail.

196
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.950
I mean you may look at this now and go well where's the roof.

197
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.550
Mike you spent all that time on the walls and the floor.

198
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.660
Where's the roof.

199
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.880
Well that's fine.

200
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:27.060
We can go ahead and bring the floor up for instance and then do the same thing round the top.

201
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:33.760
So be a flat bottom so it would be a flat roofed building there if we wanted to do that or we could

202
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:41.440
make a roofline perhaps a sort of 45 degree one from the parts that we've already got.

203
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.760
There's lots of things that we can work with here.

204
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:51.160
Now one of the things that I didn't do before duplicating is place these underneath the empty itself.

205
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:57.250
Now the pain here really comes in selecting them all and fortunately there aren't too many at the moment.

206
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:03.820
So if I go ahead and holding down shift select them in the outline because that's a lot easier than

207
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:09.970
trying to select them in the 3D viewport itself once I've done that I can use control and peel go to

208
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.150
object and parents.

209
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.870
There's nothing to parent it to at the moment we need to select the empty lasts as we've done in the

210
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.040
past and that makes the MTV active objects.

211
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.480
It's a lighter coloured orange and if we can find the empty in the scene which I am sure we can.

212
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.200
There we go.

213
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.260
We can see it's a light coloured orange.

214
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.340
Incidentally as you can see there I did produce a cube that was a bit worthless in the end because I

215
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.440
didn't use this small cube.

216
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.050
But it's useful to just have it there.

217
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:45.670
Another thing that I learnt whilst doing this is perhaps point to five it sounds like a nice number

218
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.600
to have and it wasn't too difficult.

219
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.610
Moving things about however when I'm holding down shift which reduces the increments to a tenth of a

220
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.690
blender unit.

221
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:03.610
It's been quite nice if the walls were perhaps 300 or 200 wide so that then I could have just positioned

222
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:09.850
them very quickly rather than having to use the transforms to move them to the appropriate locations.

223
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:18.070
Anyway I digress so once all of those have been selected and you have the active object set as the parents

224
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.210
that you want them to have we can go object parent.

225
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.190
And of course parent it to the object itself.

226
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.220
And there they are.

227
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.470
They've been moved so they're now all children of the room.

228
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:38.910
And then if we select the room we can literally move everything about which is incredibly powerful.

229
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.620
How did you guys get on what did you discover when you started putting things together.

230
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.910
This is the essence of being lean.

231
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.950
We've taken our basic building blocks that we've done we've put them together and realized that we've

232
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:56.500
got some problems and we can go and correct those straight away before having spent hours and hours

233
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.390
doing some really inch crit and detailed modelling.

234
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:05.080
We found out these problems nice and early so we can go ahead and correct them and come up with ways

235
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.370
to prevent it happening in future.

236
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:15.160
So the final thing here of course to just finish off is make sure that my blend file is saved and then

237
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.340
going to source tree here.

238
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:24.040
There we go we can see that we have our work there and the blend file that we've created and the folder

239
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.470
that's associated with it and I make sure that they are staged and click kemet.

240
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.430
Brilliant.

241
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.930
How did you guys get on.

242
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.730
I'd love to see your room designs.

243
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.170
What else did you discover when doing this rapid prototyping.

244
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:43.450
So we've taken our assets we've moved them into a scene to make sure they're working we found some problems

245
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.910
with them so we haven't wasted lots of time and then we've we can get back we can fix things and then

246
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:54.520
reimport them and make sure they're working and we'll find out a faster way of doing that shortly.

247
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.590
Please share your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
