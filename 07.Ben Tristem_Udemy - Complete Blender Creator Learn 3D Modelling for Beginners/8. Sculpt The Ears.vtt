00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.310
In this video I'm going to focus on adding details to my ears.

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.170
I started off by just scribbling in some grease pencil just to kind of get a feel for from my reference

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.060
image over here.

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.210
What do I need to have the lines.

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.860
What's missing.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.260
How do I need to push and pull it.

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.150
Just getting myself prepared I need to drag it further backwards.

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.760
Add these little things and poke a hole in the side of my head to make these e hole so I can hear through.

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.650
As always I have a challenge for you which is to sculpt your ears much add details on the ears until

10
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.460
you are happy with them.

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.240
That's your challenge.

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.740
Do that with me at the same time or watch along and then do that afterwards.

13
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.640
I'm gonna be going a little bit quicker in this video because we've done a lot of chat about sculpting

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.700
in details already so I'll only pause and take you through things that I think are more noteworthy otherwise

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.510
I'll power through a little bit more quickly and probably speed up the video so you can see what I'm

16
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.340
doing but not necessarily have to listen to me making bad dad jokes the whole way through.

17
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.620
So first thing I need to do I think is with my grab or my snake hook is to pull the ear backwards backwards

18
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.750
backwards so that I do have a little bit of distancing from the actual head of my unit in there.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.390
Pull that back and then add a little bit of the geometry on the inside.

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.220
I'm gonna do that police grab tool as well just to get all this out of the way so it's okay to have

21
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.190
a big blob like that because I'm going to dig into it a little bit.

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.200
I actually want to have more of a blob over here so I'm going to add a little bit of clay.

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.230
Haven't done that technique a lot so I'm just a little bit of clay just to build it up it's similar

24
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.240
to draw but I find it makes a little more chunky a little bit more clay like for Sean.

25
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.450
Actually my brush is not too big.

26
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.280
Get this going that's a valid way actually to enjoy it.

27
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.860
You might blow up a book draw around the outside of it with a clay brush and take it from there.

28
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.710
That's a perfectly good way instead of doing the snake hook that we did in this process.

29
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.090
Putting that in a bit okay.

30
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.440
Now my grease pencil is getting in the way.

31
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.610
Thank you grease pencil.

32
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.330
Kind of looks like a college wrestler now.

33
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.170
That's fine.

34
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.990
Well apologies if you're a college wrestler and you take offense to that but you guys know who you are.

35
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.070
Can I maybe an MMO a star or someone from the UFC.

36
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.830
Let's get detail in here okay.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.890
We figured it out a little bit.

38
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.750
We've got our Cauliflower is lovely.

39
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.250
I'm gonna get my draw tool.

40
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.050
I think this is probably gonna be a good one to use heat control and just dig in to dig into dig into

41
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.240
Okay so you can see here this is me just shaping it up trying to get the shape zoom in and out every

42
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.670
now and again make sure I can see what's going on.

43
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.760
Trying to get the shape I'll start to pinch and crease very shortly.

44
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.530
Find it Good to dig from the underside here so you can see where you're going with this whole process.

45
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.600
Dig dig dig dig.

46
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.170
A lot of modelling is a lot easier when you've got a stylus and a tablet.

47
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.850
I'm deliberately using my mouse because I'm guessing a lot of people watching this video at the moment

48
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.870
are also using a mouse.

49
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.570
I do want to be cruising around like some sort of ninja with a stylus and have bills say how on earth

50
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.310
did you do that with different pressure.

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.810
Long using a stylus I'll speed up the video a little bit here just using the crease tool behind the

52
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.030
ease to make a little bit of a reach every now and again I'm going to use the grab tool maybe a snake

53
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.250
hook tool just to bring things back into the right shape as I want.

54
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.580
It's all looking a little bit Frankenstein at the moment not a Frankenstein Caterpillar just yet but

55
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.660
not so good.

56
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.960
You know it will do His will punch a hole in the side of the head so we've been through that process.

57
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.390
I'm going to use the draw tool get it nice and close may make it to a little bit smaller and then just

58
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.030
draw dirt road raw hitting control at the same time so that we're heading on into the head.

59
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.690
Draw draw draw draw and increase the power a little bit.

60
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.530
Draw you don't need to make a huge holiday in your e and probably stick your finger in your ear quite

61
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.060
a long way.

62
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.260
But from the point of modelling I want it to go too far.

63
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.210
That's totally in the wrong spot so it's hit G make our brush bigger and there's that whole geometry

64
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.590
over in a little bit like better.

65
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.260
It's looking pretty hideous around the front.

66
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.020
That's cool we'll tidy that up in a moment.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.450
Do some pinching and then do a bit of pushing.

68
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.000
Just a reminder of what I've got my settings on.

69
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.170
I have dined top out on 40 at the moment might be a little bit too much.

70
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.550
Just dropped to 35.

71
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.970
We don't need massive geometry on the ears but enough that we're not making a mess member to smooth

72
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.280
from time to time I find that makes things look a little bit nicer a bit more realistic.

73
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.220
Just drawing and smoothing drawing and smoothing cutting down control to get some more small digging

74
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.010
of cabins into the is spreading out the video now and just going to put a bit more detail in the outer

75
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.910
area of the air.

76
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.420
Just dig away at that hole a little bit and make it all a bit crisper.

77
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.610
We'll pop it back up to 40 with my resolution.

78
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.250
Take note as well where the jaw line and the E interact so for me the jaw goes out.

79
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.100
This very kind of faces but Bubba.

80
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.930
And then the jaw line is kind of connecting with the back of the ear.

81
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.270
So I want to have this area in here a little bit less pronounced a little bit more recessed into the

82
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.540
into the head.

83
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.220
I think just to make sure I don't get myself in trouble later on when I come to do the jaw and then

84
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.200
I'll put a little bit of maybe put down some clay just along where I want the jaw to be just I've sorted

85
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.680
out a little bit speeding up the video just laying down some clay that allows us to smooth up at the

86
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.900
top and then just to chisel out a little bit more with the crease tool down below in the jaw line.

87
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.440
Okay got a little calligraphy indent in my head just here let's go and address the indent.

88
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.480
Mostly just using my smooth tool

89
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.520
okay.

90
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.890
So it's important to do the jaw as we're doing the ear.

91
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.480
I think that's coming along pretty good might be a little bit strong at the front here so I'm just going

92
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:13.040
by smooth too and just making sure I haven't overdone those clay strips I put in before zoom out a bit

93
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.450
of a reality check character from the side.

94
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.510
Okay I'm gonna leave it a tiny bit more pronounced along the jaw line for when I come to do the neck.

95
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.160
Then we can tidy all that up but that's okay.

96
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.340
Now for the jaw ee relationship spit out the video again I'm just gonna get the inside part of my ear

97
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.420
a little bit tidied up.

98
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.070
Just get the shape smooth it around little bit just nudge and push as you do.

99
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.550
It's good to do these fine movements I'd like to stop every now and again and have a look at the proportions

100
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.140
of what I'm working on that's the important thing.

101
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.440
That's what people notice when they look at something as if something doesn't quite seem right.

102
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.590
So if you have a look at the size of my ear I'll make it nice and large so they're side by side.

103
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.920
You can see that the from the top to the bottom if that's representing one whole unit of an ear we can

104
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.790
do the same for no nose or chin or anything else that we're modelling it's good to do it this way when

105
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.960
you're making reference.

106
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.930
Is this line.

107
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.670
Does he know he represents somewhat of a middle point.

108
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.230
And it looks like it's pretty much in the middle of the bottom of my ear lobe to the top of the ear.

109
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.780
So then we have a look at our model.

110
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.350
That's the top of the EEA.

111
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.370
That's roughly in the middle so it's not too bad I could probably drag the elbow down just a little

112
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.440
bit and we do need to flatten it out it's still protruding a bit more than I'd like it to but not too

113
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.010
bad.

114
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.840
And then let's have a look at the size the hole it represents roughly about half of that space from

115
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.810
this midpoint to the bottom.

116
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.770
And yeah I think it's representing roughly half could probably dig it out a little bit more it doesn't

117
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.510
look like it's going into the black abyss as much as it could but we'll work on that in a moment and

118
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.010
then if we have a look at the swell it's looking like it's roughly in the middle of this part of the

119
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.690
ear as well.

120
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.390
So I've not done a good job of looping this part just here.

121
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.150
I'll make my brush smaller so I can highlight it a bit better.

122
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.420
This part just here going underneath that part just there.

123
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.590
So when you look at this in proportions you also find some of these little things that aren't quite

124
00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.880
lining up very well sung.

125
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.850
I'm going to do those final two things I'm going to just get a little bit more space in the ear hole

126
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.590
and tidy that up and then I'm also going to tidy up this ridge that goes under the ears I'll speed up

127
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.970
the video while I'm doing that I'll speed out the video here because I do just kind of fiddle around

128
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.930
with the ear a little bit I'm adding a little bit more geometry so it's a little bit thicker.

129
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.750
And then having a few goes at it actually my goal here is to build up the outside while also going on

130
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:29.550
the inside having it look like it's wrapping underneath that outer area dig a little bit of the e hole

131
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.200
a little bit more push things around and just doing some smoothing from time to time by holding down

132
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.490
shift on whichever tool I'm on and then just nudging around pulling back to make sure that I've got

133
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.630
the sizing right.

134
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.460
Just need to nudge things a little bit and using the grab tool just to get my ear positioned in a way

135
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.770
that I like it.

136
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.730
And then final thing to do is just kind of smooth around the edge a little bit unlike the eyes the ears

137
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.320
tend not shut wrinkles and all the signs of aging and the amount of children you have.

138
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.230
So we'll make sure there's not too many bumpy bits on that.

139
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.510
Okay.

140
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.830
I'm tempted to count as time this for hours but we really shouldn't.

141
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.150
It matches the level of detail of the eyes I'm pretty happy with how it looks it's reasonably representative

142
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.800
so I'm going to move on.

143
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.890
So hopefully you've done well with the ear and I'll see you in the next lecture.
