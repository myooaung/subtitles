00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome to baking a normal map in blender.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,260
In this video you will create a normal map you'll understand when to create a normal map we'll be using

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,070
a process called baking and see that baking is the fundamental process for creating other map types.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:25,420
In blender I will understand about cages and why they are used mapping textures to a model Well when

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,290
ever they are being used.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,910
It is a form of optimization So you still always be asking yourself does this need optimizing.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,270
If you already have a low polygon model and it suffices then you dont need to do any more.

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,030
However if you want to keep it a low polygon model but you want to have the illusion of a lot of surface

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,780
detail whether that be a bit of clothing with the weaving in and out or whether it be a wooden box with

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,350
the slats and the gaps in between the slats.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,720
Then we can start optimizing and not having to use geometry to create that.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,990
It allows high detail to be baked onto a lower polygon model and have almost the same appearance.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,060
In some cases you can't tell the difference decreases render times especially if exporting to a game

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,620
engine.

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,060
Now one of the things you've got to consider if you're making assets for a game engine is that the people

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,520
demand 60 frames per second or something along those lines.

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,780
And we want to make sure that they get that and by using normal maps and other type of mapping techniques

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,310
we can increase render speed when it comes to blender itself of course a render of one scene may take

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,350
5 10 15 minutes.

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,280
Who knows.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,160
By using normal maps we might be able to cut that down by 10 20 30 percent in time.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,660
In terms of its rendering time now for the one off scene that probably doesn't matter so much.

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,980
But if you're doing an animation.

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,540
This is where suddenly that saving really starts to compound and saves you a a shed load of time when

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,510
it comes to sitting there and waiting of course when you're rendering your computer is going full tilt

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,970
so it's also a mess save on your electricity bill and wear and tear on your computer.

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,850
Poor thing we do pull it through lots with Blender So let's go ahead and create a little shopping list

28
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,000
of what we going to need.

29
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,400
We're going to need a Harley poly gone source model in order to get the detail.

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,190
We're going to need a low polygon model same model of course just a lower polygon version in order to

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,770
put that detail on.

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,380
If we're just going to stick with a high polygon model then a normal map once again won't be necessary.

33
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,670
Possibly a cage.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,240
Now that would depend on the model that you're doing and I'll give you a demonstration of when you will

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
need a cage.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,850
We're going to need a yuva unwrap of the low polygon model so that we can have an image ready to receive

37
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,240
than normal data.

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,190
So now that we've got a shopping list ready Let's hop on over in a blender.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,350
Okay so we're over on our default scene here and we need a high polygon source and of course a cube

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,700
isn't particularly high polygon So I'm going to make this really quick and I'm going to use a subsurface

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,720
division modifier and crank that up all the way to six and apply it.

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,620
And that's going to give us lots and lots of geometry.

43
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,370
While still in object mode I'm going to create a nother cube and I'm going to apply another subsurface

44
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,200
division and well let's go to sarees subdivisions and apply that.

45
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:47,830
So now if we check how many triangles we got 768 on the low poly and the high poly has 50000 Okay that's

46
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,550
a great extreme example between the two.

47
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,970
Now I'm going to want my Both mine to be smooth shadings There we go let's smooth shade and we can see

48
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,660
a bit of occlusion it's a little bit jacquette around the edge.

49
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,610
I think that is okay for the purposes that we're doing.

50
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,700
Of course we need to name these so let's go ahead and name this high poly ball and low poly ball.

51
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,750
Otherwise I won't know which ones which one I'm looking at the outline.

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,530
In fact I'm going to use the outliner in order to do this particular work with selecting because these

53
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:26,050
two need to be on top of one another Cause we are going to be projecting from one on to another we're

54
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,320
going to be projecting from the high poly on to the low poly so in order to do this we're also going

55
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,150
to have to unwrap the low poly bowls.

56
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,460
I'm going to hop into edit mode and unwrap.

57
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm just going to use smart unique projects because during this demonstration I don't really mind how

58
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,610
it actually unwraps it in fact it may even highlight some problems.

59
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,690
If we don't take control over that unwrap.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,260
So now I have done that I just need to make sure that that has worked and I'm going to open up a UV

61
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,650
image editor and quickly check it.

62
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,810
Okay so you've got a you've Emap there but we don't.

63
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,380
That's going to control the mapping of the normal map that we're about to create so it's telling lend

64
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,690
out where to place the information.

65
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,000
But there's nothing to place it to.

66
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:16,150
So we're just going to have to create a new texture and I'm going to call it normal map because that

67
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,690
is what it's going to be.

68
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm not going to click okay now before we do anything else here.

69
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,660
There may be the occasion where perhaps you've used one you've mapped a certain scale on a diffuse texture

70
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,140
and that's worked wonderfully.

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,900
But now you want to use a different nuveen map with a different scale because we're projecting all of

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,810
the U.S. map has to be with in that one image.

73
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,360
Otherwise it will tile and look horrible.

74
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:47,440
So if we do want to create an extra you v map or more than one we can go to the data properties of the

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,670
low poly ball.

76
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,690
Scroll down and we can see we've done virtex groups before.

77
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,660
Below that we've got shape keys and below that we have you v maps so we can create a new UV map and

78
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,460
call it normal map or whatever you want to call it.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,760
It's a different type of map.

80
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,010
So now we've done that.

81
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,990
We can go ahead and then click the little camera there so that's the one that we as active for rendering

82
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,690
that's the one we want because baking is a form of rendering.

83
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,790
So now we have that we can see that we're looking at the normal map as well because the U.S. image editor

84
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,550
has changed the active U.S. map is the normal map.

85
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,100
So let's go ahead now and go to the render tab and have a look at our baking option so I'm going to

86
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,780
have to scroll them all the way down to the bottom and I'm going to open up.

87
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,310
OK.

88
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,620
Now what I'm going to do here in case I need to flick backwards and forwards between other settings.

89
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,970
I'm just going to split this window here so I can see take all the time so it's not disappearing.

90
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,690
Hopefully I won't need to dash about left right and centre but that if I do I can get back to bake really

91
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,850
quickly.

92
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,030
Now we've got a bake button and if we click that is not going to do anything because we've not really

93
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,980
told it what we want to do.

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,640
Now here we go no active image found at a material or bake to an external file.

95
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,760
So in this case has our low poly ball got a material.

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,450
No.

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,750
So let's go assign material to it and I'm going to call this normal map just so I don't get confused

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,870
with any type of other type of material that we set up.

99
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:26,050
And I'm also going to scroll down here and set the surface colour to an image texture and I'm going

100
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,550
to change it to a normal map.

101
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,510
Now this isn't how you apply a normal map we'll go to that in a moment.

102
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,810
This is just so I can see real time on the model.

103
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,800
What is going on.

104
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,070
I was going to hop out of edit mode there into object mode and change it to material.

105
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,950
So there we go we can see both are black.

106
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,260
So what we need to do is take from selected to active.

107
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,980
So from Behi poly to the low poly.

108
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,210
So let's go ahead and click on high poly hold down Shift and click on blow polin you can see why I'm

109
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,640
using the outline it's a Select rather than the meshes that are on top of one another.

110
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,630
I'm going to change my bake type here to normal.

111
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,680
There it is and make sure selected to active is ticked.

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,550
Now I'm going to hit the back button and let's see what happens.

113
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,130
Okay.

114
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,470
So that's not surprising.

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,890
And that is exactly what I was expecting to get because both of them are pretty smooth.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,590
So let's go ahead and add some detail to the high poly ball and I'll use the sculpting tool to do that

117
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,740
just so we can see what's going on and I'll create some highs and some lows.

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,830
I'm going to use add and subtract.

119
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,730
When it comes to that somebody is going to hide are low poly ball.

120
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,050
I'm going to going to sculpt mode.

121
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,490
That's good.

122
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,860
That's a solid.

123
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,060
I've obviously not could it's selected.

124
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,940
There we go sculped mode and I can't see much of what's going on so let me rearrange my screen really

125
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,910
quickly and I'm going to draw a smiley face.

126
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,830
Who wouldn't draw a smiley face.

127
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,840
There we go.

128
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,980
So we've got ourselves some oh oh I've got symmetry turned on.

129
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,420
Oh it's two smiley faces.

130
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,420
Excellent.

131
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,220
Now let's do a subtract as well.

132
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,450
And let's say there we want to is.

133
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,010
And there we go.

134
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,770
It looks more like a love heart there but never mind Kate So we've got some detail now on the surface

135
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,590
of our model.

136
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,550
Let's see what happens if we go and bake that.

137
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,730
So selected.

138
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,090
Hi Polly shiff low poly too active.

139
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,570
And I'm going to click Oh cant see it.

140
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,340
So that's enable it and then bake if it's not there we can't bake it.

141
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,650
Okay so we can see that the indents that we've made are appearing on the normal map.

142
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,700
But these raised areas seem to be cut outs.

143
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,720
In fact if we changed to material we can see the normal map actually being applied to our model as as

144
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,310
a diffuse texture in this case and we can see that the raised areas are just ignored all together and

145
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,090
that is no good.

146
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,710
We want to include them.

147
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,350
Now there are two ways of including them.

148
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:02,580
Number three actually three ways of including them we can make the low poly ball bigger so we can go

149
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,490
in here scale the low poly ball up so let's go to object mode select the low poly ball.

150
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,940
Scale it up.

151
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,170
Okay.

152
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,120
Now go to a high poly low poly and make.

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,350
And there we go.

154
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,660
So that's one way of doing it.

155
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,950
But now we have a problem.

156
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,610
Essentially the the low or poly models are bigger and we don't really want to do that so let's undo

157
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,150
that step.

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,680
But that is one way you could go about it the other way you can go about it is to add a cage.

159
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:43,840
Now a cage has to match the low poly model in terms of its triangle count so if we duplicated that and

160
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,680
then made it match as close as possible to have a high poly ball that would enable us to use a cage

161
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,660
to make that.

162
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,090
Now the race distance is kind of similar to scaling up the model.

163
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,120
And if we go and scale this up well that's not really scaling but it kind of gives the impression it

164
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,410
moves the projection a bit further away from the surface.

165
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,900
If we now try and do that let's see what results we get.

166
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,010
So at Point two we seem to get a relatively good result.

167
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:23,870
Now bearing in mind this can cause distortion on more complicated shapes you have to use that with caution

168
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,490
and if you've got something that's massively different that juts out from the surface.

169
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,790
These are not really that exaggerated they're not that extreme in terms of how far they stretch away

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,820
but if they were to do that you may want to use a cage rather than just adjusting the race distance

171
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,530
but it seems that point to in this case results in a relatively good normal map.

172
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,360
That looks pretty impressive.

173
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,740
So now that we've got a normal map made what we need to do is apply it.

174
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,540
So in order to do that we're going to need to go over to our node editor.

175
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,280
And this is the material that's currently set up and this is another great thing about applying it to

176
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,950
the diffuse texture straightaway because the image text is already loaded and ready for us to use.

177
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:17,210
So once again I'm going to hide the low are of high poly ball from our scene all together and I'm going

178
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,400
to make sure the low poly ball has it's applied.

179
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,250
So let's go ahead and let's go down here.

180
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes it's got the.

181
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,790
It's got the normal map apply to it.

182
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,170
That's absolutely fine.

183
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,270
Now it may be tempting a course to Let's unplug that so we can see what's going on.

184
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,340
It may be tempting to plug the colour straight into normal.

185
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,060
Well that didn't work and there's no surprise in that that hasn't worked.

186
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,630
We haven't told it anything at the moment so let's be explicit let's tell blender that the input the

187
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,060
textured coordinates i.e. you v based.

188
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,580
So let's join in to there.

189
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,420
Now we don't want the colour be mapped to the normal we need it to go through some sort of filter.

190
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,010
Now we could plug it into the bump mapping that we used earlier.

191
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:17,360
We can also put it into a normal mapping So if we go ahead and add a vector normal map and pop it in

192
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,500
between those two areas there we see that the colour is controlling the colour.

193
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,430
We have not selected a u v map here but we can select normal map in this case and looking down here

194
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,320
we should now see that this is starting to change.

195
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,950
Our model Lets go into rended mode and have a look.

196
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,920
There we go.

197
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,770
That is looking pretty good but it does have some problems we can see its jerking around these edges

198
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,460
and this is one of the art effects that can happen if you dont take control of your seams.

199
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's make the light a bit more exaggerated.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,030
I'm going to go for a sunlamp and what we should be able to see here is if I just line this up when

201
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:04,750
we go ahead and move the sun lamps I'm just going to rotate that sunlamp or on the y axis or something

202
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,900
along those lines.

203
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:13,390
What we should find is that the shadows change is as if there is real geometry there and that's the

204
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,150
whole point of using these normal maps.

205
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,930
That looks pretty.

206
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,950
That's a good example there.

207
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,730
You can see that it's light on one side.

208
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,120
And if we rotate it all the way round it'll become light on the other and then dark.

209
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,540
Now you can see here some artefacts that are being caused by having such a low poly model here.

210
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,330
Let's just check that we do have smooth shading turned on.

211
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,310
Yes we do.

212
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,460
It's just unable to interpret the model.

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,910
And of course the normal map has been is causing this horrible jaggedness.

214
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:54,070
Oh no no wait I see what is going on here and I have forgotten to actually change the type of image

215
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,210
that this thing is.

216
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,630
Let's change the image texture itself.

217
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,150
We haven't said this is non colour data.

218
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,680
So it's interpreting the rgv values as colour.

219
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,980
When we don't we want the r.g. values to be treated as individual values.

220
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,860
There are three channels there from a value of zero to 100 percent and each one of those we need it

221
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,800
to be interpreted completely individually in a blend between the two.

222
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,720
So we can do that by changing it's a non colour data.

223
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,480
There we go.

224
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,760
That is the look we're looking for.

225
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:35,480
And now if we go ahead and grab the lamp rotate it around and access and we can see here that it changes

226
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,830
is as if the geometry were real.

227
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:45,220
Now the question is of course if I have that there and I put the other one there go have Turn the lamp

228
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,350
off instead.

229
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,690
Can you tell the difference between the two.

230
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm going to render these out now side by side and I'll show you how great this is WOWO case are blown

231
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,410
up to full screen and tried to fit them on as best I can.

232
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,640
And I want you guys to guess which ones which.

233
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,320
Okay.

234
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll give you a clue here.

235
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,900
We look for reclusion.

236
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,320
So even though the outside is relatively smooth we can see the eyeball on the other side on the right

237
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,110
hand side in the shadowed area at the top left.

238
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,500
We can see a bump of the eye.

239
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,860
Let's head round the back of this particular smiley face.

240
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,160
Now the great thing about this is the one on the left is less than 1000 polygons I think it's something

241
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,810
like seven.

242
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,500
The one on the right is nearly 49000 polygons.

243
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,550
There's a huge difference in him there.

244
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,560
But there's very little image quality difference at this point.

245
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,410
So you can see how a normal map can really help you out.

246
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,810
And of course if we combine that with the displacement map as well we can get some really impressive

247
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,400
results.

248
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,560
So bearing that in mind it's time for a challenge.

249
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,480
I would like you guys to create a normal map similar to how we've just done.

250
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,450
So take one of your models up to at least an L O D C or D level of detail.

251
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,280
So we going to take a duplicate of the elodie B or A that you've currently worked on and really add

252
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:28,000
some detail to that model then go ahead and create a normal map based upon that and apply it to a lower

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,350
polygon model so apply it back to the level of detail.

254
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,250
A or B.

255
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,050
And finally of course share it in the discussions.

256
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,990
The two side by side and see if people can guess which is which.

257
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,290
If you do it really well it would be very very difficult to tell.

258
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,990
I'm going to not pause a video at this point because we've almost run out of time for this particular

259
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,680
lecture and we'll go through the solution in the next lecture.

260
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,770
See you soon.
