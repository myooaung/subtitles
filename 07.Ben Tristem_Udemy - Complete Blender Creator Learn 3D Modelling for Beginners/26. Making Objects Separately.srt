1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,570
Welcome to making objects separately.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,870
In this video we're going to get back into modelling and the main reason for that is we cannot fully

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,110
texture our model until the modelling stage itself is complete.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,240
And of course at the moment my model doesn't have an ear and it needs a bit of detailing on it as well.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,710
And of course with texturing we need to use young wrap our model and every time we move the mesh the

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,340
UAE map will get less and less accurate and start to cause artefacts so we want to get that modelling

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,130
done or as done as there were as close as it can be so we can then get on to texturing and adding those

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,050
materials to our model.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,820
Now we're going to take a look at the ear in the section with all the folds in it it can be quite a

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,980
challenge.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,980
Essentially there are two main loops for the year the inner and outer loop.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,810
And we'll show you those in a few seconds.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,630
We're going to make it separately.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,500
In this case in order to focus on the actual model of the ear itself.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,130
So isolation can be both a good and a bad thing.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,920
There is some natural isolation if you were making a model where let's say a car you'd have several

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,190
components that would be separate from one another with them.

18
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,670
With the model of the head of course ideally you don't want separate nose separate mouth separate eyes

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,120
ears.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,190
Eyes Yes because we have made them separately.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,240
So that's about the only thing if you were making teeth I suppose you'd go for that as well.

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,550
But the ear itself is actually attached to a head.

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,750
So in some ways you would think oh well can I just make it from the head mesh.

24
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,950
Well in this case what I would like to do is actually focus on the ear without worrying about the head

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,120
itself.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,860
Now obviously that has good and bad implications but we can move backwards and forwards all the time

27
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,530
or just turn the head on and off and see what's going on.

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,760
But it does mean that you're not going to spoil your head mesh accidentally in the process of making

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,680
the year especially if you start using something like sculped.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,170
So you don't accidentally grab part of a head and have to keep undoing some making it separately at

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,460
this point is a good thing.

32
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,350
And then we can reattach it to the head after it.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,530
So let's now go explore those two main loops and hop on over into a blender.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,940
Okay so in front of us here we have one I made earlier.

35
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,860
And you can see that the ear itself looks pretty good once we've got.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,550
Let's turn our lights.

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,130
Let me guess.

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,330
The lights are on a different light.

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,920
There we go.

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,540
So we've got a nice ear going on here now.

41
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,160
It will depend on what your ear looks like that you're modelling on in may look different to this.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,900
Some is have more folds or more creases or more defined shape.

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,450
Some people have bigger ear lobes etcetera.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,100
Of course I've modelled mine on the head.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,470
I've got in front of me.

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,920
And it follows nicely the curvature of the ear I've got in fact the low down here is perhaps a bit bigger

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,740
than is in the reference material but I am absolutely fine with that and of course we've spread the

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,150
ear out itself.

49
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,560
So let's go back to the mesh.

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,540
There you go.

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,880
Looks nice.

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,610
We've actually got a sort of plane to mount it on.

53
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,700
Now one of the things that will have to contend with in a bit.

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,130
And this comes with all modelling when you do something separately is joining it back together.

55
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,820
So we will have a series of seas around the edge.

56
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,000
So taking this one for example when I selected it there are 20 vertices.

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,160
That means there needs to be 20.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,550
On the one we're linking it to and I can almost guarantee there won't be that on the head model so we'll

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:46,290
have to when we get to this stage actually move the detail down as it comes towards this edge here.

60
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,420
So we don't have such a problem merging it together.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,030
Okay.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,910
So without further adieu let's go ahead and start modelling this and I'm going to go ahead and open

63
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,140
up my head file.

64
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay.

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,410
That looks a bit odd.

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,660
There looks like blenders being a tiny bit funny.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,270
Well the eye is in fact there.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,530
It just happens to be a work of blender.

69
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,800
Never mind so let's was round to the side and go to layer.

70
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:23,960
So okay now I'm going to be modelling now Polly to Polly this year itself and this is just one way of

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,670
making it.

72
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,590
There are loads of different ways of making it.

73
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,680
We could literally go in and sculpt it's fresh.

74
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,240
We could go in and and make it from the head itself.

75
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,790
But this way itself is the easiest way I found of making something that's a bit more complicated like

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,120
an ear but actually getting it's sort of to the shape I wanted straight away.

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,440
Now I'm going to add this in a very straightforward manner I'm going to add a single vertex and then

78
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,410
extrude that Vertex and that gives us an edge to work with and when we extrude an edge we get a face

79
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,550
to work with.

80
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:12,020
Now this is one of these times where if you want to copy me exactly Ira that's absolutely fine.

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,480
So I want AITs of these pieces going out.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,810
So one two three four five.

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,460
Six.

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,610
Seven.

85
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,140
It's okay.

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,280
So that's the outer loop made.

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,890
In fact I'm just going to move some of these bits about.

88
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,120
Eric go.

89
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,120
And this is obviously going to be quite low poly.

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
Now let's get the inner loop itself.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,070
I'm going to start from this place here and come down.

92
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,640
Now what we'll want to do on a scale that in Eleusis like what we'll want to do as we come around here

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,450
is make sure that edges start lining up properly so that when we.

94
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:09,320
Get to this point here we can merge vertices here and this one here so this one does need to come down

95
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,690
a little more.

96
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,070
Okay.

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,620
So this itself will become a quad shortly one two three four.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,950
This one will become a quad and they'll be a quad in the middle here as well.

99
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,190
So I'm going to go down to this point here and move it around.

100
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,110
Now this is quite manual issue probably as you're watching me there.

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,910
Now I don't want to actually merge any verses just yet just in case I want to move things about so I'm

102
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,790
going to turn my snapping tool off and I've got automatically merged vertices turned on at the moment.

103
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,890
I'm going to turn off the safety.

104
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,250
I know that sounds an odd thing to say but I don't want a problem where when it comes to sorting this

105
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,730
out.

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,150
OK.

107
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,670
So we're almost there because this final one it's selfless just move this here and scale it up a little

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,110
is all the way to the top here it's going to require a big rotator.

109
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,070
Now be careful about going around inside yourself.

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,700
You don't want the model looking like that.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,530
You want it like that.

112
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,090
Okay.

113
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,870
So I'm happy with this rough outline here I'm going to go to virtex and snap mode turned on and merge

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,940
virtex Automatically.

115
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,710
So I'm going to move this one and plonk it on there and this one to here and this one to here.

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,210
This one to here.

117
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,930
This one to here and this one here.

118
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,660
Okay.

119
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,350
There's one final one here and here.

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,740
Okay.

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:38,540
So we should end up with a quad that we have to fill in here one two three four fill 1 two one two three

122
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,320
four fill 1 2 3 0.

123
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,740
Three for Phil.

124
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,300
Okay.

125
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,040
So we should end up with a shape looking roughly like this.

126
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,770
Now at the moment I'm not too concerned about it not matching exactly the reference material.

127
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,470
This is of course an opportunity that you can go in and start tweaking it slightly so it resembles it

128
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,940
just a little bit close or more closely but I'm happy with the overall layout of that win.

129
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,820
We need more detail anyway in there and we can sort that out in a bit.

130
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,990
This particular one here I am going to scale in ever so slightly.

131
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,780
Okay.

132
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,340
So this face in the middle here is going to be the hole in the ear so I might as well sort that out

133
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,800
now.

134
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:28,530
And I'm just going to literally push that all extrude it actually move it here scale in ever so slightly

135
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,070
and move it to the front.

136
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,080
So there's that.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,520
That is a bit deep actually as it goes.

138
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,540
I mean orthographic projection that that's happened.

139
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,950
So I've got no idea a perspective of course.

140
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,670
So that would do for the input there.

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:52,020
So around the outside here if we imagine the ear itself at this edge here is going to have some thickness

142
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,240
to it so we can go round the edge itself all the way to the bottom and extrude.

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,130
Now under that change the transformer orientation back to global.

144
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:09,510
So I can actually extrude in the x axis in this case I've also noticed that my model seems to have its

145
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,600
Normal's all skew whiff probably just the way I started the modelling.

146
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm literally just going to flip those Normal's.

147
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,940
Normal's flip Normal's.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,750
And there we go.

149
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,840
We've now got things on the outside and the inside.

150
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,660
Perfect.

151
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:26,950
Okay.

152
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,850
So now we've got this here.

153
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,670
We can go around the edge itself.

154
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,900
The complete edge not just there okay.

155
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,760
There we go.

156
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,500
And then we can extrude again.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,490
Now this is going to require a bit more manipulation.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,970
So I'm just going to pull it out now.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,640
Yeah that far because we can faff about with it in a moment.

160
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:58,170
And I'm going to move all of these just the part ever so slightly and also move snap is snapping off

161
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,730
again.

162
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:06,070
And we want these to line up some glasslike the entire edge loop running around there.

163
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,570
And scale x x 0 with this set and normal so let's just try that scale.

164
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,430
I think it's going to be x x 0.

165
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,660
Yeah there we go.

166
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,810
So now everything is co plainer.

167
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,680
Excellent.

168
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,710
So I'm going to move this back now.

169
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,870
About there.

170
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,250
Oh no.

171
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,890
That is far too far.

172
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,680
We get and scale that in.

173
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,690
So that's kind of the back side of the ear itself.

174
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,810
And then we need to do another extrude because we need somewhere to mount it to the head itself.

175
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,250
And then we can scale that outwards.

176
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,070
And move our model around.

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,880
So I don't want that selects I want this select Let's grab this and move it back and get a term proportional

178
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:02,050
editing on or not insert editing on so I can move the entire thing just back.

179
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,720
There we go.

180
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,220
It's just not in the way and then it's a matter of manipulating these here and getting them.

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,900
Getting that flat surface for the it.

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:22,440
Now at the moment you can see we've got some intersecting faces here that is a matter of moving vertices

183
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,270
around until you get them in the right place.

184
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:35,100
Now this can be a bit challenging to get it right and a bit infuriating but if you go around your model

185
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,480
lots and make small changes rather than big ones you'll soon see what's going on.

186
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,650
Now this at this point here these this is obviously too wide that it is standing out massively.

187
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:54,400
So we've also got to move the edge that's somewhere along here and just push out ever so slightly.

188
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:02,950
And again bring bring your mateer your reference material back again so you can move things in a more

189
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,000
realistic manner.

190
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,840
And this has a lot of tweaking to do.

191
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,800
And of course that leads us on to a challenge.

192
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:12,980
Okay.

193
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,380
I'd like you to finish modelling the ear itself.

194
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,080
So go ahead.

195
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,560
Finish off the ear.

196
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,830
Remember to add detail now.

197
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,900
Ears are not flat.

198
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,220
You can go a bit crazy with it as well.

199
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,880
So obviously some features when they're exaggerated only a little.

200
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,060
Don't go over the top but if they're exaggerated they can help convey a better sense of depth.

201
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,070
They're now at the moment the ear we've got is far too wide so there are have to be manipulated flip

202
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:47,580
forward and back between the head model itself and the ear and remember that you will have to add a

203
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,140
subdivision surface modifier at some point.

204
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,240
So the ear would actually shrink from where it is now.

205
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,760
I wouldn't recommend in my experience just adding a subdivision surface modifier and applying it to

206
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,960
get yourself Self more and more vertices to work with.

207
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,450
I would actually just subdivide the mesh if you need more vertices to work with.

208
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,330
The reason for that is if it shrinks immediately you've got a problem from way he was starting from

209
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:23,520
source just subdivide with out actually using subdivisions SERPs monifah or just use simple as the option

210
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,130
on the subdivision surface modifier.

211
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,440
That would also work as well.

212
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,370
And just a reminder you have the sculped tool as well.

213
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,580
This can help if a struggling moving vertiz about just dragging them.

214
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:42,600
You can use the sculped tool to help provide a bit more adjustment in air in a more artistic manner

215
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,260
rather than precise moving that Vertex about.

216
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:53,320
Okay so finally before we crack on with that just a reminder that this modelling itself when I've done

217
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,460
the modelling of an era in the past it's typically taken around half an hour or so to get roughly right

218
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,270
and maybe another half an hour of tweaking as well.

219
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,620
So don't expect this to suddenly miraculously look like a wonderful ear.

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,910
You're going to have to tweak and modify it.

221
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,560
And of course when I show you that challenge results as far as I'm concerned it's not going to be real

222
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,150
time.

223
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,970
I'll skip through the various points that I find important when I'm modelling the support of video now

224
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,570
and give that a go.

225
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,180
Okay guys welcome back.

226
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,460
Let's go finish modelling our ear.

227
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:38,110
Okay so before I get cracking with any further detail I am going to see what it looks like on our head.

228
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,800
Now I'm not expecting it to be smack bang on the head just at the moment.

229
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,150
It faxes e in in the head itself.

230
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:52,920
So it's going to be roughly here and I might as well get it orientated correctly as well surman irritate

231
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,640
it's about there and push it back into the model.

232
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:02,300
So there we go we've got a bigger front profile there we have so we can see here.

233
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,720
One it sticks out further than the other that you may or may not want to do that with your particular

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,170
model.

235
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,540
But it is important to have a look at reference material because some people's ears stick out more than

236
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,190
others.

237
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,770
So even though it's not it's too high at this point in the model on the backend it really needs to be

238
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,710
pulled out.

239
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,210
But first of all let's add some more geometry to here.

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,910
That's go to delay it too by itself.

241
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,660
It is important to hop backwards and forwards and check this often.

242
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,370
Now before I do anything else here I need to sort out this mess down at the bottom here.

243
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,760
It shouldn't take too long to do but I will see you guys back in a few moments.

244
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,470
Okay so that is looking pretty good now.

245
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,710
They were just a bit on top of one another.

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,550
Or rather one was pulled one way too far and not the other so you ended up with a lot of non plane geometry.

247
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,620
But that doesn't matter too much.

248
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,140
But it was intersecting which does matter.

249
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,280
So I'm happy with that overall shape for my ear.

250
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,010
The next thing to do is to go ahead and select everything because we're subdividing everything.

251
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,520
I'm going to use the specials menu to get with the w.k. and all where subdivide right the top there

252
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,600
and only one level some just going to open up the tall shelf I'm sure as only one level Xome sense.

253
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,020
Now we should find we've got a couple of loops.

254
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,980
Let's make sure our loops are still intact as well.

255
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,620
So we've got a loop running around here.

256
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,430
Of course it'll go all the way around our model.

257
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,830
In this case and there should be another one right next to it and then we've got an inner ear loop as

258
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,430
well.

259
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,870
Okay perfect.

260
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,390
So we've got a very flat ear at the moment.

261
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,860
This is no good.

262
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,800
It's self.

263
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,180
So at this point now I've got the extra geometry I'm going to go in and subdivide or add a subdivision

264
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,480
surface modifier.

265
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:00,420
Now this extra geometry helps cage our model and stops it collapsing too much in on itself so that should

266
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,910
still be roughly the right size which is.

267
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,010
And of course now's the time to go in and grab the edges like this.

268
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,490
Edge here let's do all the way round here.

269
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,740
Of course an ear is not flat so that's where you just move that in.

270
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm going to move it Imber selects normal here and just push it in essence so we start to have a shape

271
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,800
of our ear.

272
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,430
Now in this case I'm going to also push a couple of these upwards.

273
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,710
We sure help pinch the ear itself.

274
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,510
Now I've got proportional editing turned on I don't actually want too much of it turned on here so I'm

275
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,860
going to grab this law here and pull it over the top to make a lip.

276
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,170
And of course this is going to be more and more tweaking to try and get the right shapes involve the

277
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:59,670
mosque and turn smooth shading on as well as our is a lovely so we can already see this is starting

278
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,590
to take shape wonderfully.

279
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,220
So going to go around here and manipulate some more vertices and get it sorted.

280
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,910
Okay so I'm just putting together the final bits of my model here and just going back to the reference

281
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:21,260
material and looking at the contours So we've got a contour that flows round here and back again.

282
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,440
So it's a good idea to try and make your mesh reflect that's by just tweaking it ever so slightly and

283
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,140
pulling some bits closer and some bits further away so sometimes I can move a face as a whole.

284
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,230
Sometimes I push virtex up just to add that little bit of a crease in to our model.

285
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,230
So I'm quite happy with how my ears turned out.

286
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,990
How is yours turned out.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,150
Did it take you a couple of times to get your ear right.

288
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,510
It certainly does.

289
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:55,120
When you first start and that's what it's currently looking like on the model.

290
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,400
So of course I'm not too happy with how it looks in terms of here's I'm going to modify it a bit more

291
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,850
I think but I'm happy with that as a starting point now because we've got a fairly detailed year on

292
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,930
our model.

293
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,340
Please share your ears in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
