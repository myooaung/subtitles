Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.320
In this lecture we'll be talking about eevee's render settings.
2

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.650
So at the moment we've told blender that certainly the pins and the bowls aren't very rough they should
3

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.540
be shiny and reflective.
4

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.730
However when we look at the scene even though they look shiny they're not really reflecting anything
5

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.390
at the moment.
6

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.340
However what we can do is turn those reflections on and you may notice that looks a ton better than
7

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.370
how it did before with these reflecting their surroundings as well.
8

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.520
It makes for a much more convincing scene however of course this is a feature that needs to be turned
9

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.560
on and therefore has a bit more of a performance impact.
10

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.180
Let's find out more.
11

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.980
OK everybody so looking at the scene in front of us here we have everything almost set up how we want
12

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.710
to be in in fact we can get those reflections by just one tick box.
13

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.700
But I want to delve in a little bit deeper at this point in time and talk to you a little bit about
14

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.490
how eevee is working in the background the reason why it's so quick compared to some other rendering
15

16
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.510
techniques is because it cuts a lot of things out is rather biased in what it shows us.
16

17
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.800
And it set some hard limits.
17

18
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.910
So if we have a look under the render tab itself and scroll down we see we've got a list of various
18

19
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.800
options we've already had a look at the shadows and we can see that we can adjust the shadow settings
19

20
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.740
themselves in order to create a sharper shadow, a less sharp shadow and we've already discussed how that
20

21
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.600
can impact performance.
21

22
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.060
The same is true of everything else on this list now because we've said that these things are reflective.
22

23
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.690
That doesn't automatically mean that eevee is going to show us reflections.
23

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.050
That is something that we need to turn on and if we go down to something called screen space reflections
24

25
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.270
and puts a tick in the box boom we suddenly get reflections.
25

26
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.270
Pretty cool hey.
26

27
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.670
Is that all we need to do.
27

28
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.340
Well you may want to go in a little bit further and tweak some of these settings.
28

29
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.210
I won't go into the details at this point as to what all of those mean sometimes you just have to adjust
29

30
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.980
them on the, on the scene you've got in front of you remember to have a look at it from the camera view.
30

31
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.040
So half res trace is one of those optimizations if we turn that off the reflections themselves will
31

32
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.430
get sharper and more precise.
32

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.840
However at the cost of it taking slightly longer to render.
33

34
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.400
In fact if you turn everything on it ends up slowing down quite significantly to how you started.
34

35
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.770
But it gives us a good approximation we can turn that back off again continue working but we've set
35

36
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.880
everything up including how rough our materials are based upon not seeing any reflections and that may
36

37
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.480
mean that we need to take another look at our materials so if we go to a bowling ball for instance and
37

38
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.720
have a look at the material properties for it.
38

39
00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.080
Now we start to see the real impact if I hold down shift here to control the roughness much slower I
39

40
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.370
can turn up the reflection so this ball is incredibly glossy and then I can turn that down make it rougher
40

41
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.800
and rougher and rougher until eventually we can't see the reflections anymore.
41

42
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.300
Now this is something that with those reflections turned on we get a much better grasp of how the ball
42

43
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.270
is really looking.
43

44
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.280
And in fact in this particular case I would quite like it to be all the way down probably around point
44

45
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.130
nought five or so.
45

46
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.150
It's a much better reflection.
46

47
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.280
The other thing that I'll point out here and it's specific to the scene that we're working on is currently
47

48
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.790
we're using a different material than we are on this layout over here.
48

49
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.830
So that's something to bear in mind if we want to standardise on these materials we can actually do
49

50
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.490
that without too much impact on the models themselves.
50

51
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.010
If we go back to the Smash scene the one that we're working on.
51

52
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610
I can literally switch the material out for the original ball.
52

53
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.630
What that will mean is then we have two users of the ball material and looking back we've got a zero
53

54
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.340
on our ball.
54

55
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.340
So we go ahead and save our file and then revert, turn it back to rendered mode.
55

56
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.940
You may find it takes a few seconds to update or you need to move the viewport but then we find the
56

57
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.980
extra material is gone.
57

58
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.310
What we don't want is a series of duplicate materials everywhere.
58

59
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.420
If we can avoid it because that makes management very very difficult.
59

60
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.860
So let's hop back to the rest of these eevee options.
60

61
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.660
So we've got ambient occlusion which is a way of faking where contact shadows would be so if we added
61

62
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.790
that in as well we see it has a very subtle effect especially around the base of our objects.
62

63
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.440
Now we've not really got any grooves or anything like that which would really show off ambient occlusion
63

64
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.110
but actually just turning it on makes a subtle difference to the bottom so much so even though it is
64

65
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.860
subtle.
65

66
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.510
I'm going to leave it on.
66

67
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.880
We've also got effects like bloom which on this scene which is already quite bright isn't going to add
67

68
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.020
that much to it.
68

69
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.330
However it can add especially to night time scenes where you'd naturally have a halo of light around
69

70
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.530
a light source itself, Depth of field is really cool we're have a look about in the next section making
70

71
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.580
things blurry
71

72
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.350
that are further away from the object we're focusing on , Subsurface scattering, We're not looking at that
72

73
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.730
at the moment but we will do later on in the course, We have motion blur.
73

74
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.730
Well nothing's really moving at the moment.
74

75
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.400
So adding motion blur isn't going to really do much for us.
75

76
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.890
And finally volumetric we don't have any volumemetrics in our scene volumemetrics are things like
76

77
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.630
smoke and fog.
77

78
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.990
If that's not turned on you won't see it.
78

79
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.170
So that's one of the things to watch out for.
79

80
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.720
And then we've got a few other options as well and we'll explore these more as we progressed through
80

81
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.530
the course.
81

82
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.020
But there you go eevee itself is quite a heavily biased render engine.
82

83
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.730
It will decide by these tick boxes here what it's going to show you and what it's not, what it's going
83

84
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:02.480
to calculate how well it's going to calculate it and there are some limits on that with cycles for instance
84

85
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.280
we can switch across the cycles and let that render out the switch to my GPU so it's going to be quicker.
85

86
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.170
And whilst this is rendering out you will see that it gets less and less noisy around the edges but
86

87
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:21.350
this is a completly, Well it's not completely unbiased but it is quite unbiased which means we get a much
87

88
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.200
more realistic reflection.
88

89
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.900
In fact if I scroll down a little and on the viewport samples is only gone to 32.
89

90
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.600
If I set a zero whilst on talking to you we will find that over time it will sample more and more and
90

91
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.570
more and the lighting and reflections will only get more and more accurate.
91

92
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.180
Unfortunately when your scene starts to get a bit heavy you can see just moving around here at the moment
92

93
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.640
like this you can't really see what's going on.
93

94
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.890
And if you've got a semi slow machine you may find that leaving it to render out so you get a better
94

95
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.420
impression takes just too long and that's where eevee really shines.
95

96
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:07.430
But the one big thing between cycles and eevee,
whereas cycles you can pretty much click and let it render
96

97
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.340
eevee you do have to work on and you will also find at the moment at least the lighting between eevee and
97

98
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.780
cycles isn't that consistent, cycles often ends up a lot darker than eevee does.
98

99
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.630
I'm gonna switch back to eevee now and I'm happy with my scene how it's set up however now it's time
99

100
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.160
for your challenge.
100

101
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.200
Okay so your challenge I'd like you to go ahead if you haven't done already and turn on screen space
101

102
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.200
reflections and I'm sure you'll agree with me the difference it makes to your scene is fantastic, it
102

103
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.980
looks a lot better especially since bowling alleys the bowling ball and the pins are often quite reflective
103

104
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.790
and shiny.
104

105
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.310
This really does add to it.
105

106
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.840
I'd like you to try ambient occlusion as well.
106

107
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.240
I think it adds even though it's subtle it adds a lot to the scene itself.
107

108
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.320
I would then like you to also check for duplicate or redundant materials and remove them from your scene.
108

109
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.940
It's important that either have a build up of redundant information it's just going to cause you a headache
109

110
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.120
later on it's best just to make sure that you tidy up as you go we've made duplicate objects which in
110

111
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.220
turn has made duplicate materials we actually want them to share those materials to go ahead and remove
111

112
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:25.100
those redundant materials from the scene and then finally render out your work and share it with us.
112

113
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.690
I'd love to see how you guys are getting on. Pause the video now and give that a go
113

114
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.600
Okay everybody, Welcome back.
114

115
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:42.690
Let's go ahead and fix up our scene and turn on screen space reflections. Okay so this is where we left
115

116
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.350
off before.
116

117
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.300
I'm going to go on and turn screen space reflections on straight away.
117

118
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.120
I'm going to leave off half ray trace for the moment.
118

119
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.030
I think it adds enough of a difference to be worthwhile.
119

120
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.400
I'm going to turn on ambient occlusion as well.
120

121
00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.650
Just that slight darkening around contact points is really adding to it.
121

122
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:06.900
Now you can come in here of course and up the distance if you want the trace precision we could have
122

123
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.400
that turned up as well.
123

124
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.290
It's entirely up to you.
124

125
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.590
I think leaving it as default is absolutely fine.
125

126
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.170
I can't remember what that default value was I'm going to right click and reset the default value.
126

127
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.780
There we go.
127

128
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.580
So I'm happy with those settings now I don't think there's anything else I would want to turn on or
128

129
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.420
tweak.
129

130
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.890
Now that we've got that turned on.
130

131
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.850
OK.
131

132
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.590
So our bowling ball itself.
132

133
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.970
Let's have a look at the material that that is using that is using the ball we've already changed that
133

134
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.900
the pins.
134

135
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.450
Were they using pin 0 0 1 and pin striped 001.
135

136
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.350
Well I'm going to switch those out to pin and pin stripe.
136

137
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.230
There we go.
137

138
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.260
The alley way.
138

139
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:51.300
I'm going to switch out alley and what we should see is that we end up with zeros next to the ones that
139

140
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.460
we've finished sorting out.
140

141
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.230
So we've not finished the pin stripe or the pin.
141

142
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.030
Why is that.
142

143
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:03.360
Well if we have a look at this particular pin here it is using the correct ones but these others have
143

144
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.960
not inherited it.
144

145
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.040
So what we can do is select all of these others in whatever way that you want to select them.
145

146
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.290
I want to get rid of the back there make sure that this last one is the active select and if you cast your
146

147
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.840
mind back we can make links with control and L to materials.
147

148
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:29.460
Now we should find that everything has inherited the correct materials and we have a zero next the pinstripe
148

149
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.470
and pin which we do.
149

150
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.560
So I'm happy that we've got everything sorted there, I'm going to save my file I'm then going to revert
150

151
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.760
now it is important
151

152
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.220
you check in a Windows system,
152

153
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.940
The star has gone from up there so make sure you have saved before you do anything like reverting.
153

154
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.960
I'm simply reverting here to make sure that they have gone and they have.
154

155
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.930
OK so we've got lots of users of the same material that's absolutely fine.
155

156
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:02.010
And I'm also going to tweak some of the materials here so the board is certainly sharing the right material
156

157
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.270
now.
157

158
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.960
But do I want it a little more glossy.
158

159
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.130
I think I do.
159

160
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.510
How about the pins themselves.
160

161
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.530
You see this is this is what you're now able to do do I want them more or less glossy.
161

162
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.860
Well we're talking about just the stripes there.
162

163
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.620
So let's go to the pin material itself and also play with that so we can make them a lot more matt or
163

164
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.670
we can make them highly glossy.
164

165
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:27.420
I'm going to go to about one point one 5 which is roughly where we were before the final one is the
165

166
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.600
floor here so we can also make that glossy as well.
166

167
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.520
I think that really does bring it out.
167

168
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:39.170
Now one of the things that you may have found already is that darker materials show reflections better.
168

169
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.960
So if we were to go ahead and make this floor a much darker color.
169

170
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.670
So if we go to the base color here and just turn it down so it's darker.
170

171
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.090
You will see reflections much more easily than you did before.
171

172
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.940
So that's something to bear in mind.
172

173
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.090
The darker your surface the easier it will be to see reflections.
173

174
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.540
So I'm going to make mine a darker color of brown.
174

175
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.380
Or maybe that color around there reddy, a reddy sort of orangey brown a yellowy color.
175

176
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.710
There we go.
176

177
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.380
Perhaps mustard is a good term for that.
177

178
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.400
And then we've got everything here so let's look through the camera.
178

179
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.590
I like the look of that.
179

180
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.600
I'm also going to move this now along the Y axis.
180

181
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.230
I'm just going to move it along.
181

182
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.080
It's going to pass through that backdrop there.
182

183
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.700
That's absolutely fine.
183

184
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:30.540
But what it does mean is that the background itself is not going to have this square cut off that it
184

185
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.110
had before.
185

186
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.830
It's going to have this lovely curve to it.
186

187
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.730
I like how that looks.
187

188
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.290
And of course you can see back towards the camera in the ball itself.
188

189
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.510
That's pretty awesome.
189

190
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.170
So the final thing to do there is save my work and go ahead and hit render.
190

191
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.340
And there we go.
191

192
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.350
That looks brilliant.
192

193
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.780
I hope you're really pleased with how yours is turned out as well.
193

194
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.540
I'm going to save mine here.
194

195
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.600
Smash with lighting and reflections.
195

196
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.460
There we go.
196

197
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.930
So if you're working on this you don't have to save everything as you go but it's a good idea to save
197

198
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.250
your end results.
198

199
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.050
I'm really happy with how that's turned out.
199

200
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.140
I hope you are happy with yours as well.
200

201
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.190
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
