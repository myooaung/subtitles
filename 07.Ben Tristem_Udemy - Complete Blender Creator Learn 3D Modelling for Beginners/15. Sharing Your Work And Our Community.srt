Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,780
In this lecture I want to talk briefly about sharing your work and where you can get help from if necessary.
2

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,100
So if you're struggling with a lecture or you don't understand something that's been said you can always
3

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,490
go and browse the Q and A on udemy and if you click on that link down there it will open up and you
4

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,090
can ask for a question you can even search for questions that have already gone.
5

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,390
Now what I would ask you please to do is not post your pictures in the Q and A if you do that it really
6

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,180
makes it difficult for us to go through and actually find genuine questions.
7

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,870
If you've got an image to share it's much better shared in two different places.
8

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,950
Let me close down the questions for the moment and go over to resources available in the top left.
9

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,780
If I go down to this lecture which in this case is lecture 11 there is this lectures discussions.
10

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,350
If I click on that it will take me to this particular place on our forum.
11

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,640
So this is a place where you can share your work.
12

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,660
And if we go into here this is the end of section challenge of this particular section that people are
13

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,650
taking and they've shed loads and loads of work.
14

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,920
It's a much better place much easier to see what is going on this is absolutely fantastic.
15

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,310
But it's also a great place to get feedback constructive feedback and if you're struggling with a more
16

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,560
challenging topic.
17

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,960
Now the other place that some people may have and some people might like is to go to the blender course
18

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,040
community sit w w w dot Facebook dot com forward slash groups forward slash blender course and they'll take
19

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,980
you to our blender website where you can join over 11000 other students just like yourself trying out
20

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,210
different things in Blender playing with 2.8.
21

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,120
It's amazing the community welcomes everybody so please do come along and join and share your work help
22

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,660
others as well if you're a bit more experienced.
23

24
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,770
The final place I just want to show you very briefly is more of a life thing that's always a discussion
24

25
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,730
going on.
25

26
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:08,570
No one's around just at the moment early in the morning on a Monday but on the game day of official
26

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,350
discord you can go to hash blender and discuss your work there as well.
27

28
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,480
There's always someone about so do ask a question in there as well.
28

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,500
And one of the community will be happy to help you I'm sure.
29

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,140
So in summary if you've got a question about the course and the content within the course itself ask
30

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,770
in the Q and A's if not follow the links in the lecture discussions or go directly over to the community
31

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,160
websites and join in over there to share your work.
32

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,750
Of course you're free to share over on the blender Facebook group as well.
33

34
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,460
And if you've got any quick questions you may be able to get a very quick answer over on the Discord
34

35
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,630
channel.
35

36
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,810
And finally one of the things I really love is seeing your work it really inspires me as a teacher to
36

37
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,080
see beginners become proficient in this skill whether you're starting off as a complete beginner or
37

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,390
you've come back to experience 2.8 from the very beginning and you've already got a bit of Blender
38

39
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,290
under your belt.
39

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,220
I love seeing the transformation within you so please do share your work.
40

41
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,080
I'm looking forward to seeing it and I'll see you all in the next lecture. 
41

42
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,410
Take care.
