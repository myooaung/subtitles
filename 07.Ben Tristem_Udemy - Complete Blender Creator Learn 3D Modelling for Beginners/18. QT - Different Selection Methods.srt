Hello everybody and welcome to this quick tip on selecting.
1

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,910
This is all going to be about a bit of a refresher and also just to show you some of the other selection
2

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,880
methods that are available to you in Blender.
3

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,180
First of all and this is the primary one you've got to tell blender what you're selecting vertices edges
4

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,190
or faces and you can use one two in three to go through those as well providing you're not emulating
5

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,320
numberpad.
6

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,720
Now if we turn all three on by holding down shift and selecting them there can be an issue selecting
7

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,230
faces I just managed to select a face straight off then.
8

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,350
But you can end up having to click several times to get the face selected.
9

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,040
So this is a great example of where just saying I want to select faces is great because then we can
10

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,890
come through and every click you know is going to select a face even if it initially isn't the one you
11

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,570
intended to select.
12

13
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,120
Now going to our tool shelf.
13

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,660
I just want to highlight the fact that there's a selection type.
14

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,750
We've got select, select box select circle and select lasso and you have to hold your button mouse button
15

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,720
down when you're selecting this area to have this dropdown appear.
16

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,950
And by default select box is the one that's there which means we can draw a box around and anything
17

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,630
any face in this case that's within that box get selected.
18

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,520
Now we've you notice along the top we have new add subtract difference and intersect the main ones that
19

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,530
I tend to use are add and subtract.
20

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:37,900
In this case if you draw a new area it is a new area it will deselect what was selected before and
21

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,390
then add in the new stuff if we had ADD selected that's like holding down shift all the time so this
22

23
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,200
is great.
23

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,080
If you can't get to that shift key to add to your selection and subtract as you probably have guessed
24

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,380
removes your selection difference that's a select something first so we can do a difference if I select
25

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,750
this area in the middle is like a subtraction it's what difference with these an intersection is what
26

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,110
intersects when you draw that box around it's almost like keep the ones that the box is on and that's
27

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,780
also available under select lasso which is more for organic models or ones that aren't nice and square
28

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,360
like our pyramid here and acts in exactly the same way the one that doesn't act quite in the same way
29

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,060
is the circle select and when you have this turned on you can use the left click to actually just draw
30

31
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,820
over your model and select things that way at the very top you can adjust the radius so if it's too
31

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,630
large you can come in with a smaller one and we can hold down control to start undoing these faces
32

33
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,090
which can be incredibly useful because let's say selecting this ramp here we can just draw a line straight
33

34
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,670
down and boom everything selected.
34

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,550
Now I have a bit of a hit and miss of what selected the moments and I saw I can double tap the A key or
35

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,030
go alt and A to deselect everything and A will select everything so it's up to you how you decide to
36

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,680
use that functionality in typically in Blender Alt and that letter will undo what the letter did to
37

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,440
begin with and a quick shout out here to Marc our student instructor who kindly made sure that I remembered
38

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,170
to tell you guys that you can also press the w key when you press the w key it will cycle through those
39

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,720
different selection methods and the final one I want to show is expanding and shrinking selections so
40

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,550
say I select this area at the very top of our pyramid I can then use control and the NUM pad plus to expand
41

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:39,460
the selection and we can see here one of the problems with having uneven geometry, so up until this point
42

43
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,970
on the top of this building it has even geometry as your going out then it becomes uneven because we've
43

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,250
reached the edge on just the next expansion and that can cause problems when you're trying to select
44

45
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:58,210
something if it was perfectly even we could select the bottom as we have done here and then expand from
45

46
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:04,420
that and you can see it does expand evenly and eventually as you can see here the top does also equalize
46

47
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:13,270
I'm gonna select everything and I'm going to hold down ALT as I select this top set of faces so as we've
47

48
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,570
experienced before with Edge selecting you can hold down alt and select an edge loop you can hold down
48

49
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,220
alt while faces are being selected and select a face loop.
49

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,350
So with that face loop selected what we can do is we can do something a bit more advanced we can go
50

51
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,410
to our select menu and you can see all of the other types of selection you can do keep skipping off
51

52
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,480
of it there and one of the great things you can do is selecting similar and you see the shortcut key there
52

53
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,530
is shift and G.
53

54
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,950
Now there are lots of other options here.
54

55
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,600
My favorite sometimes depending on when your model itself is co-planar so anything that exists in
55

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,290
the same plane as that one can be selected but one that is very useful is normal.
56

57
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,900
So basically that saying Please select all of the other faces as part of this particular model that
57

58
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
are facing in the same direction whose normals match.
58

59
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,980
And if I go ahead and do normal you can see here that all of the upwards facing normals are selected.
59

60
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,470
If I were to select this face here at the very front and In fact don't want everything selected as i've done there.
60

61
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,870
So I'm just gonna deselect.
61

62
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,970
I'm also going to switch my selection back to select box because that's what it's on by default.
62

63
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,450
Now I go select select similar normal.
63

64
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,180
You can see all the faces that are facing in the positive Y direction have been selected.
64

65
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,740
Even the ones that are just shadowed on the backside of this model and probably there you go, the inside walls
65

66
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,650
as well on this doorway.
66

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,210
So that concludes our look around selection in this lecture and it's time to put those skills to the
67

68
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,780
test with a challenge. Okay it's challenge time.
68

69
00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:00,010
I'd like you to remove the top part of the steps on each level and create a ramp 45 degrees from the
69

70
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,940
base to the top of the steps we have created.
70

71
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,800
Now I think this is best that I show you an image as to what I'm trying to describe here as it's quite
71

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,190
challenging to describe.
72

73
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,700
So let's hop into blender and we see here we've removed the steps that were there originally and we've
73

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,640
replaced them with a ramp going up.
74

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,460
Now there are a couple of ways that we could go about this some of which even preserve the topology
75

76
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,970
going around the model and even fill in these triangular gaps that are left if you end up with this
76

77
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,370
result that's absolutely fine.
77

78
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,400
But in the challenge I'll show you how to do both ways.
78

79
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,110
So go ahead pause the video now and give that a go okay.
79

80
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,280
Everybody welcome back.
80

81
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,660
Let's go ahead now and create a ramp for our mayan pyramid
81

82
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,950
Okay everybody and welcome back.
82

83
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,890
So we've got a couple of options how we go ahead and create this ramp that we want now we can go ahead
83

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,090
and make it very simply by selecting the bottom edge just here and the top edge that it goes to making
84

85
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,870
sure we've got the right angle pressing F key.
85

86
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:12,920
And now that's filled in we can go in and select all of these very gently they we go gently or carefully
86

87
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,400
and there we go.
87

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,230
We've got a we've exposed the ramp underneath and then it's just a matter of going through and linking
88

89
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,900
all this lot up.
89

90
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,290
Is there a cleverer way that preserves some of the topology without having holes in our model.
90

91
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,730
This is a valid solution by the way of exposing a ramp underneath.
91

92
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,750
Absolutely fine.
92

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,310
However if there's something better that we can do.
93

94
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,320
The answer is yes there is but it does involve a bit more thinking forward as you go.
94

95
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,540
So going to undo those steps there.
95

96
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,770
Now we need to select a few more bits other than just these edges so I'm going to select the faces running
96

97
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,820
down here.
97

98
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,970
Now this does require a bit more forward thinking press the C key to enable the circle select and then
98

99
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:04,700
we're able to also control the width of our circle with the mouse wheel which is really awesome as
99

100
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,020
well.
100

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,790
So with all of those selected I'm actually going to extrude and then press escape.
101

102
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,100
Now you may think oh wow that's just created duplicate geometry hasn't it.
102

103
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,880
Not quite because what we can now do is exploit the same thing we did before.
103

104
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,280
So we go ahead and select all of these edges on this leading edge here and then when we move it we see
104

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,020
that we've got some solid geometry so if I move it back.
105

106
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:43,470
So G X one it's minus one in this case we end up with our ramp but we also end up with some faces there.
106

107
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,000
The only thing we then need to do is make sure we remove our doubles so I'm going to press A, F3 to
107

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,610
search and then remove doubles.
108

109
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,220
So what we've got there is the solution we're looking for but really quickly done.
109

110
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,630
There's always going to be more than one way of doing something.
110

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,220
You may see this hashing area here.
111

112
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
That's just from filling that in earlier.
112

113
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,900
So I can get rid of that face that's there.
113

114
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,990
Okay.
114

115
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,290
So we've now got a series of sections running up that are individual which is great but it's also in lock
115

116
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,730
step with the rest of our model which does mean that we've got a few more options when it comes to editing
116

117
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,290
and our model is sealed.
117

118
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,500
It's got no magical holes in it.
118

119
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,800
Okay.
119

120
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,630
So there we go there's two solutions to the same problem.
120

121
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,940
They give slightly different results but overall it doesn't change the look of the model that much especially
121

122
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,800
when these triangles themselves in a few moments will end up covered up.
122

123
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,190
So please show your work over in the discussions looking forward to seeing it.
123

124
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,000
Also if you've had any problems or different solutions I'd love to see what you come up with.
124

125
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,000
Please show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
