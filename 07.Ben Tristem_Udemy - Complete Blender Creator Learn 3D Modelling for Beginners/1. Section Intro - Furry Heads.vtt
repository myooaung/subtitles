Hello and welcome to this section of the course.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.000
This is gonna be a really exciting section where we focus on sculpting and hair particle systems.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.350
We're gonna create a couple of things.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.060
First of all, spend some time sculpting a head, working on the eyes and the nose and the ears, and

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.590
then putting some hair on that head.

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.770
And then we are going to transition into creating an animal.

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.590
I'll be creating a cat that started off being a really cool black cat, but ended up being a little

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.190
bit of a chubby, messy ginger cat.

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.240
But I'm pretty happy with it.

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.490
We're also going to be looking at using the hair particle system to create grass and how we can create

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.320
different sort of grass with transparency.

12
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.190
So lots of sculpting, lots of hair, particle system in this section.

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.880
Lots of practice of both of those things over and over to get you really good at it.

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.590
So let's jump in and get started.
