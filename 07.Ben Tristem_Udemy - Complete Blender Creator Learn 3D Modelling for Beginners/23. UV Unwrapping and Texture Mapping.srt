00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,410
Welcome to you v unwrapping and texture mapping.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,550
In this video you will understand an image texture replaces the colour of a material.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,690
You'll learn how to unwrap part of a mesh and apply the texture to it.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,010
So let's get straight on over in a blender.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,880
Right so over in blender The first thing I'm going to do is just bring up the node editor here.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,490
Right.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,060
So on the left hand side of this no.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,410
Ed we're going to introduce a texture some of them a go at.

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,380
And good texture.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,540
And we want an image texture.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,410
You could also go shift day and search for Image texture.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,490
Of course go to texture and image texture.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm just gonna pop that there and I'm going to link straightaway the colour to colour and the colour

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,440
down here as well.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,670
So that means that the image texture is going to control the colour of these two shaders.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,050
Now it would be nice to see if what's actually going on over here on the material to have you can see

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,680
it's on this bright magenta this bright pink.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,520
And generally we know texture is assigned.

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,010
That's the colour it goes.

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,550
So let's bring this back down a little here so we can still see the note.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
And we'll switch to the 3-d view and change it to rended modes.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,750
I can just see what's going on.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,500
Okay.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,160
Brilliant.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,840
So we've got ourselves a pink eye.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,320
Now you may want that type of I but I actually want to apply my image to it so I'm going to go to open.

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,580
I'm going to find the iris I made earlier.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,650
Well in fact we made earlier and opened up your one eye open in my chair and it goes black.

29
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,640
So of course the first question is well why isn't it applied.

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,110
It's not going to work yet because we haven't map it.

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,600
So let's go ahead and do that now.

32
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,440
So I'm going to pull down this area over on the left.

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm happy with the outliner itself.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:11,270
So I'm going to go down here and switch this to the image editor you ve an image editor.

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:11,880
Then.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,980
And in here I'm also going to open up.

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,070
Our Iris So that's loaded up there.

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,060
Now the final thing to do is select what we want to be mapped to this image whilst it's open.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,620
So over in the 3-d editor window I'm going to switch back to solid mode.

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,620
No changed my mind.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,130
Probably material no texture.

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,490
Yes we can actually see it here.

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:46,380
Okay so I need these three rings here selected so I'm going to get back to solid mode and using in face

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,650
select I'm going to use oltz to and shift because I want extra rings selected.

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,450
There we go.

46
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,370
So these face loops have been selected.

47
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:06,360
Now I need to go and press the UKI or you can go to mesh on a 3D Ed header bar and go to UVA unwrap

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,800
and you'll get the same menu for you V mapping.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,660
And we want to unwrap them click unwrap and we can see over on the image editor on their right hand

50
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,430
side here.

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,920
We've got that mesh the area that we've selected appears on top of our image here.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,540
Brilliant.

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,540
So we hop over into rendered mode.

54
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,100
We can see that we've got ourselves in Iris.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,640
And if we go over to this image editor we can scale this in and we can scale it out.

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,990
All of we keep scaling it out we get a very funky.

57
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,490
Am I going on I don't want that so let's bring it back in almost there.

58
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,660
As you can see you can play with this to your heart's content.

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,960
I actually quite like it's low down here because it's got that extra ring going around it so there's

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,760
lots of options you can do to play with that.

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,460
And we've got Tom selves a pretty good looking guy as always.

62
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,990
Let's go and render the final image as well and see how that's looking.

63
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,810
There's a few extra steps to the high.

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,260
It's not glossy enough at the moment.

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,140
So in a challenge in a few moments there we go.

66
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,650
That's an awesome looking.

67
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm much better than that plain orange.

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,740
So let's go ahead and add one final challenge to make this a nice and complete.

69
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,970
Okay so your challenge add a lens to the eye.

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,490
So we're going to create a lens and I suggest a duplicating the iris and the pupil part of the mesh

71
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,580
and separating it immediately into a separate object.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:56,710
Assign a glass shade to this new object and sets the wire to around one point four but do feel free

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,240
to experiment with this.

74
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,290
I've found one point for works rather well.

75
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,880
Recess the iris and pupil ever so slightly.

76
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,620
Otherwise the two meshes will be touching one another and it will look horrible.

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,460
And another thing you could do is pull out the lens further from the eye.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,490
I suggest using proportional editing for this and try to remember not to pull the actual lens fully

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,110
from the eye.

80
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,370
Otherwise it'll look more like a contact lens rather than part of the self.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,770
Now finally set up a new cam camera zoomed into the rabbit's eye and share that render in the discussions

82
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,980
pause a video an arm and give that a go.

83
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,790
Okay guys.

84
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,760
Welcome back.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,650
Let's add a lens to our rabbit's eye.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,350
Right so the eye is coming along lovely here so let's add a lens to it so we need to go back over to

87
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,340
the 3D view.

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
An unknown to struggle for a bit space here.

89
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,020
Let's set this the solid mode.

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,140
So I will want this front bit here selected as well so I'm going to use circle select in order to do

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,810
that.

92
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,490
So that's the iris part.

93
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,310
And the people parts select and we can just confirm that it be rendered or material or textual mode

94
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,890
that's all there we can see what's going on.

95
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,050
So back home it's a solid mode now I've done that.

96
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm going to duplicate that straightaway and then separate it as a new object so it can see a shift

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,500
and we will duplicate it and I'm going to hit P immediately to separate it by selection.

98
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,390
Excellent.

99
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,680
So now if we are we don't have an outliner anymore.

100
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,570
Let's bring back our outliner.

101
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:54,410
Okay so now under the rabbit mash we've got eyes and eyes 001 and I'm going to call this lens so we

102
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,590
can carry on with it.

103
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,190
Now the lens itself we can assign a material to it straight away.

104
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,830
So let's go and remove eyeball iris and pupil from this particular lens.

105
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,360
A new material.

106
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,910
And I'm going to call it lens.

107
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,960
And down here I'm on a set it's to a glossy know you want glass shade up just underneath.

108
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,440
So already I know are of one point forty five am good at a lower that down to one point four and I'm

109
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,180
going to leave for roughness zero.

110
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,360
Otherwise it would look bad and this colour I'm going to make sure it is pure white.

111
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,660
Which is not quite.

112
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,930
But now it is excellent.

113
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,930
So now we've done that so let's just render Well let's go in to.

114
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,510
Viewport shading rendered.

115
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,140
Okay.

116
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,870
That's not quite right at the moment because the two meshes exist on top of one another really.

117
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,200
We don't want that.

118
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:59,120
So we need to lower the eyeball itself or actually push out the lens.

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,330
In fact in this case I'm going to do both.

120
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,090
So let's go back over to the eyes themselves.

121
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,580
Switch back into solid mode over into edit mode and let's grab.

122
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm going to add a loop.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,430
Cut him first then I'm going to turn texture back answers here.

124
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,840
So I'm going to add at the loop come but right up against here which would generate an edge on top of

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,560
an edge but it will enable me to just move back the whole top bit here quite easily.

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,860
So control an R for loop cuts here.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,380
And now the slide between medium but it up against this edge here and now when we go into phase selects

128
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,480
we will see.

129
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,490
Let's go back to solid mode that we've got these dots going around here.

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,800
And that means that basically there's two edges on top of one another and there's an infinitesimal small

131
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,760
face along there so let's go ahead and select all these top so I'm going to move around here and using

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,250
circle select on and to make that circle a little bit bigger.

133
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:10,860
And I need to select a little bit more going round here being nice and slow with it so I get all of

134
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,280
the bits I want.

135
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,040
Excellent.

136
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:22,320
And I need to move that backwards ever so slightly so let's just move our ball around.

137
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,320
Perfect.

138
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,590
And I'm going to grab it and move it.

139
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,370
But I'm going to hit Z and then Z once more to move it in and out.

140
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,370
And I'm literally going to move it back ever so slightly as inside our model and I switching to wireframe

141
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,480
mode you can see a bit more detail of what's going on there.

142
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,800
That looks good to me.

143
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
In fact that may be a little bit too much.

144
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,370
Not sure.

145
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Let's see how it works out.

146
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,040
Let's go to our lens and we're going to do a similar thing here so let's hop in to edit mode.

147
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:05,280
Without wireframe on so I can see what's going on and I am literally going to select this centre bits

148
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:05,850
here.

149
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,200
But not the extra bits just remove those with the middle mouse button.

150
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,240
Now I've selected that I can do a similar thing as I did before grab and z z but I don't want this sharp

151
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,470
cone coming out so I'm going to stop doing that and turn on proportional editing down here and enable

152
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,910
it.

153
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,230
And let's grab a move that's now at the moment.

154
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,670
That means that the proportional editing circle is far far too large.

155
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,630
So I'm just going to use a scroll wheel there we go.

156
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,420
It's come back down.

157
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,760
I do not want to move this base.

158
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,150
It's going around here.

159
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,300
I don't want to move that away from our eye.

160
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,420
Otherwise it would look very odd.

161
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,760
So they on to move that far.

162
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,750
Even so I want here to go z and z.

163
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,390
It's coming out in the right direction.

164
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,060
And probably to about there.

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,280
Excellent.

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,520
So let's see how that's looking that's go over to rent mode and have a look.

167
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,990
That is looking much better.

168
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,160
Excellent.

169
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,810
So there's a couple of final things to do here.

170
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:17,010
We need to set up our camera so little to borrow another camera I'm going to borrow a 35 mil one.

171
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,120
And it's hidden at the moment so I won't be able to duplicate it whilst it's hidden so let's hide it

172
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,570
and duplicate it.

173
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,720
Excellent.

174
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm going to name that.

175
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,580
I can so I know which one it is.

176
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,630
Excellent.

177
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,180
Right.

178
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,850
Let's go round.

179
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:42,040
Let's set the active object as that camera and lock for camera to view in the properties here.

180
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,380
And let's now zoom in and round in and here.

181
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,900
That's probably a little bit too close.

182
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,100
No.

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,880
That will do.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,530
I'm happy with that.

185
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
And let's just render the image and see what we've got so far.

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,320
Okay that is looking pretty good.

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,900
If a little bit noisy.

188
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,050
And of course the noise level here is simply the number of samples we've got.

189
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:18,740
So let's go to our random settings here and I'm going to up in sampling.

190
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm going to ah it's only at 10.

191
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,700
That's why.

192
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,570
So I'm going to.

193
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,840
Up to 100 for the moment.

194
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,830
That might be a little high but I really want to see what the details are going to come out like.

195
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,500
And further down here I've just one when that was actually rendering there and it is the tile size.

196
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,850
Once you get used to blend yours go oh that's a bit too big so I'm going to lower that down since I'm

197
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,270
on a C P U.

198
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:48,620
I know that it works really well with 16 and 16 16 and 16 so that's render that once more.

199
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,330
And hopefully this time we'll get a better impression of the actual quality especially when the samples

200
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,980
have gone up tenfold.

201
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:03,220
So here we go much less noise we can see already in the reflections themselves.

202
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,220
I'll look at that that's absolutely crazy towards the top here in the rabbits I work because we've now

203
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,710
put the lens on top.

204
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:16,540
We're actually getting a reflection of the eye socket itself and at the top here that looks like a reflection

205
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,720
of the rabbit's ear as well.

206
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,880
So obviously when we're this close it starts to highlight some possible problems like the skin tone

207
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,140
of the rabbit may change that to be slightly less pink.

208
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,630
And I think to make it a bit more natural but we've got a really nice looking I hear and obviously you

209
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,970
can play about with the type of Iris that you've gone for on your app.

210
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm quite happy with this dark dark rabbits I hear after looking at reference material that seems to

211
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,240
be pretty accurate and this is looking really really nice.

212
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,590
I'm going to stop the end of their gaze.

213
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,930
I don't really need to see much more of it.

214
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,500
And I just click the little cross at the top here and I'm going to save that image because I'm really

215
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,910
happy with that so I'm going to save as image and I'm going to pop here.

216
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,320
I close up.

217
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,730
There we go.

218
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,990
And save that image.

219
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,690
Excellent.

220
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,950
How did you guys get on.

221
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,360
I'd love to see how your eyes are coming along.

222
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,070
It's really detailed now it's really coming along really nicely.

223
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,340
And we're going to start working with the rest of the scene very shortly so please share it in the discussions

224
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,120
and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
