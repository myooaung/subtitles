Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we are going to map our texture repeatedly.
1

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,710
So ends up being not so blurry and a bit more concise on the surface of our model looking much much
2

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,700
better.
3

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,560
Let's go find out more.
4

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,840
OK.
5

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,130
So we'll start off with are default cube here and we'll go ahead and add a texture to it but this
6

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:33,210
time I'm going to open up the shading tab as I do so now we've got our cube in front of us here were automatically
7

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,100
placed in Look Dev mode.
8

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,870
And I'd also like to draw your attention to the area at the bottom because that's what we're going to
9

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,100
be focused on as we start adding things to our material.
10

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,570
So first of all let's go to our materials tab and start setting up the material as we would do normally.
11

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,120
Now I've inadvertently hidden my sidebar along here and we can reopen that at the top here and I will
12

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:05,450
also unfortunately not have a blank area for my screen cast key so I'm going to add that back in now.
13

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:13,400
Okay so now that that's done notice here we have material and material that we named this wood notice
14

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,520
that the material name updates over here as well.
15

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,570
And as we scroll down notice that it says use nodes these things in front of us.
16

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:29,250
These two boxes are both nodes the material outputs is what our material looks like the principal
17

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,280
BSDF is the shader.
18

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,160
So this is where we can change the color of things so we can go to here and change it to a yellow and
19

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,790
notice it changes over here as well.
20

21
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,180
So there are plenty of places that you can actually change things.
21

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,150
And as you get more comfortable in Blender you'll probably be playing around in the node editor more
22

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,160
so than over here.
23

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,670
Now we've already gone into the base color click that little circle gone to an image texture.
24

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,130
And here we go is added another node in for us.
25

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,270
That's pretty awesome.
26

27
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:06,470
And then we went down here and under the vector added in if we scroll down here generated for instance
27

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,890
and there we go we've got four nodes altogether generating our material.
28

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:19,640
If I go ahead and click open on image texture on this node and then go to the wood folder and then
29

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,970
just select any one of these we end up with the image on our model looking pretty good.
30

31
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,950
That's exactly what I'd expect to see.
31

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:36,980
Now when it comes to mapping a image to a model or a texture to a model this is the basic set up that
32

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,660
you would have you may decide to use a different type of texture coordinates UV's we'll cover later
33

34
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,130
on.
34

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,590
And of course different textures themselves and there's lots of things that you can do with image textures
35

36
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,370
in order to control your model.
36

37
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,860
You can move these nodes about and you can also add new ones in and in order to change the scaling of
37

38
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,350
our image on here as you can see here is quite a large image on our cube.
38

39
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,360
What we can do is we can add in another type of node called a mapping node.
39

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,850
Now we could do that over here as well in the materials editor but to be quite honest it's a real pain and
40

41
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,760
faff to try and do that we'd have to remove our texture coordinate first and add things in a very specific
41

42
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,520
order.
42

43
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:30,170
And when it comes to creating a material for our models it's really not a great idea to have such a
43

44
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,770
rigid structure when creating a material is often better to just flow with it and change things as you
44

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,100
go.
45

46
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,460
So let's go to the ad menu.
46

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,110
Go down to vector.
47

48
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,240
And here we have mapping that's the node that we want to add.
48

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,500
We can also find it under the search menu if we type in mapping.
49

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,000
I often use the search menu because I know what things called I'm going to press enter to select that.
50

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,880
And before you click anywhere what you can do is you can start moving it's around and what you will
51

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,230
notice is that as you move that your mouse cursor over these connecting lines that join the nodes together
52

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:18,250
you can go ahead and add a new node in and it will map it in place and it will even move nodes across, How
53

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,640
Cool
54

55
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,390
is that!
55

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,950
So now we have five nodes making up our material.
56

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,940
Now if we want to if we want to change the type of mapping from generated to object we can simply just
57

58
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,860
click and drag.
58

59
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,980
And it will replace the previous line.
59

60
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,380
Now you may find occasionally blender crashes when you do that's and if that does happen reopened blender
60

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,340
try and recover last session.
61

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,560
Well it's called a cube there.
62

63
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,880
Has it got the material applied.
63

64
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,550
No it does not have material applied.
64

65
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,690
It doesn't remember it at all.
65

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,740
So that didn't work.
66

67
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:01,060
What we can do instead is go to file recover autosave and then find what we were on before.
67

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,480
So we're looking for something around the right time.
68

69
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,360
That's right.
69

70
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,080
Auto save here.
70

71
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,770
There we go.
71

72
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,700
That's where we were before or at least almost where we were before.
72

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:19,830
So let's go ahead spread these out again and add in a mapping node.
73

74
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,160
Now the great thing about the mapping node is it enables us to change the scale of our texture.
74

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,490
Now we've got vertical lines going down here because it's being projected from above.
75

76
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,460
And of course there's nothing to project from above is infinitely pixilated.
76

77
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,240
This is just the color of the pixels on the edge of that image.
77

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,660
Okay.
78

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,050
So first of all let's have a look at scale.
79

80
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,180
Now scale works counterintuitively if you want the texture itself to be smaller on your model.
80

81
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,610
So using more of the image or repeating it more often you have to increase the scale.
81

82
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,890
Now what I can do here is individually go through and say type in five five and five.
82

83
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,710
Now you'll notice that last one doesn't do anything.
83

84
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,430
And that's because an image is just two dimensional X and Y are often the only ones you need to modify.
84

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,260
However because we've got these vertical lines coming down here we're going to have to switch from flats
85

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,660
to box projection.
86

87
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,050
Now we get something different going on first of all.
87

88
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,890
It doesn't look that great we've tiled it too many times.
88

89
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:31,520
So I'm going to now highlight and drag down slightly and you can see that we can adjust things that
89

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,130
way as well.
90

91
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,890
Now if you don't quite manage to highlight them all.
91

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,770
It can be a bit awkward and it can be awkward try and get them all highlighted.
92

93
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:47,330
But what you can do is high hold down shift and change these very slowly between one another.
93

94
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,470
The other thing you can do of course is rotate things around this can end up making your model look
94

95
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,650
a little less uniform but you do have to watch out because you can end up with some horrible distortion
95

96
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,250
if you're not careful.
96

97
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,540
And if you like your keyboard shortcuts you can click the top one here type let's say zero.
97

98
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,630
Then just press tab to go to the next field.
98

99
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,450
So that can be another way of going for 4 4 4.
99

100
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,950
And there we go those are all set.
100

101
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,340
Now you will find that the higher you set the scale it does start to become silly at certain points
101

102
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:28,990
with any texture even if it was a repeating or tiled texture you'll still be able to see the repeating
102

103
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,730
pattern at some point.
103

104
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,080
Right.
104

105
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,210
That's gone a bit too far let's set it back down to around three.
105

106
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,700
That seems to be about right for this particular model with this particular texture.
106

107
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,680
Now the location can be very useful if something isn't lining up quite how you want it to.
107

108
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,920
You can move up and down the Y will move it from the left to the right in this case.
108

109
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,350
So we need to align it perfectly with one bit of the image that's how you do that.
109

110
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,640
And then finally the Z because we now box mapping the Z does come in.
110

111
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,560
So for some reason that match just a bit better on one way than the other.
111

112
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,490
Then of course do that.
112

113
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,660
Now I'm going to save my work in this case just mapping because I'm going to change something.
113

114
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:19,470
I'm going to go to object instead of generates it and just see if I get a better mapping of my texture.
114

115
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:25,750
So it's gonna be smaller in this case I can probably increase the scale here two maybe so that I'll do
115

116
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,110
for the moment you can see it's repeated around four times across the top here.
116

117
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,940
And what you can see is at some points it goes from the dark side the light side around here.
117

118
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,980
So is a bit of discontinuity in our texture.
118

119
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,610
And the same I think around the bottom as well yes.
119

120
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,770
So we've got it all dark side dark side come round light.
120

121
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,350
And this is where taking more control over the mapping of your textures using something like u v coordinates
121

122
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,510
can help massively but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and we won't be covering that
122

123
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:05,630
in this section so we play with the location and scale the rotation and you can tweak it to your heart's
123

124
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,250
content.
124

125
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,860
I generally only rotate it ever so slightly and I find that that if we go too far basically as you approach
125

126
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,250
90 degrees or a hundred and eighty will be fine and then to seventy will start stretching its out as
126

127
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,760
well.
127

128
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,380
So it's pretty cool being able to angle it slightly that may give you a better look especially on your
128

129
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,250
board itself making sure it's not completely uniform.
129

130
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,610
Great idea.
130

131
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,570
And now it's time to make your board look a little bit better in your challenge OK so your challenge
131

132
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,430
is to experiment with the mapping node.
132

133
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,730
Remember there is no right or wrong here.
133

134
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,740
So just go wild and see what you come up with.
134

135
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,570
Adjust the scaling of the texture.
135

136
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,380
See if you can get it to fit our board a little bit better.
136

137
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,620
Try different rotations having everything lined up perfectly.
137

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,120
Often makes for a dull model.
138

139
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:02,330
And then try using the object and generated texture coordinates and see which one you like the best.
139

140
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,560
Or even just which one suits the board the best, Pause the video now and give that a go
140

141
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,230
Okay everybody Welcome back.
141

142
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,810
Let's go ahead now hop into blender play with the mapping node and change how our texture is being mapped
142

143
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,260
to our board.
143

144
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,560
Okay everybody Welcome back.
144

145
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,540
Let's go ahead and just going to save what we've been working on here and open recent my chess scene.
145

146
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
So we've got our board here.
146

147
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,400
You'll notice that it's always defaults back to this solid view.
147

148
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,370
There's a good reason for that.
148

149
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,260
If you opened it up in rendered view and it was really really heavy to render I required a lot of system
149

150
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,210
resources.
150

151
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,430
Well you wanted to open up in rendered view and be nonresponsive for a bit whilst it works out what
151

152
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,930
it needed to do.
152

153
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,810
Right.
153

154
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,370
So I've got the reflection working really well here but this texture is blatantly too big at the scale.
154

155
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,070
So we need to reduce that down.
155

156
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm going to hop straight into my shading tab and I can't really see my board it is selected i'm going to press
156

157
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,840
the delete key on the number pad and zoom in and I'm gonna have to create myself a little permanent
157

158
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,160
shading setup here so let's go ahead do that now.
158

159
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,610
Okay.
159

160
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,890
With that's all sorted.
160

161
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,380
Let's go ahead and add in our mapping nodes.
161

162
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:27,090
I'm going to add search mapping its loose there, going to hover over the top of the appropriate link between
162

163
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:33,540
our nodes and there we go we've plopped that in now I might play with the rotation and move it around
163

164
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,530
ever so slightly to be fair I think I'm only going to adjust the scale.
164

165
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,530
So let's start with maybe three.
165

166
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:40,880
Mm hmm.
166

167
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,380
Yeah I think that's about right.
167

168
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,280
Boom done.
168

169
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,440
Now let's play a little bit more.
169

170
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,400
Let's rotate this round.
170

171
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,300
I think we're going to have to do all three , I don't think i'm going to get away with just rotating X although
171

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,670
the Z looking down and making a slightly diagonal that's looking promising actually.
172

173
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:08,430
I don't think we can just rotate everything by 35 I believe that will just look silly.
173

174
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,250
But you never know it might keep everything in line.
174

175
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,640
Something really weird happens here on this transition.
175

176
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,540
Those are the sorts of things you'd need to really watch out for.
176

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,490
Is these sharp changes in the actual image itself as it goes around that's really going to break the
177

178
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,330
illusion.
178

179
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,650
When these are all set to zero.
179

180
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,940
That's not an issue.
180

181
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,920
They're going to rotate it on the z axis probably to about 45 degrees actually.
181

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,040
Let's make it exactly diagonal across as if it was cut the other way.
182

183
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,960
I like that a lot.
183

184
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,660
Let's just check for distortion there's gonna be distortion at some point but does it matter.
184

185
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,840
It looks very very lovely from the bottom a view we're not going to see that much.
185

186
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,310
I really like how it's looking let's save our work before we go into rendered mode switch to rendered
186

187
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,930
mode.
187

188
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,070
And yes that looks gorgeous.
188

189
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,850
The blue light on this side obviously doesn't make it look quite as warm as the yellow lights on this
189

190
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,590
side.
190

191
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,190
So I think this is going to be a good angle to take our render from.
191

192
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,530
So I'm gonna go to the camera view and a press shift and the grave key and whizz round all that really
192

193
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:28,390
is whizzing round very very sensitive cases about here go back slightly to get more of the board in
193

194
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,670
shots and go up as well but not too far because the lower you down the more reflection you're going
194

195
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,170
to get on your model K that's looking pretty good from there.
195

196
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,370
We'll go back into layout mode for a moment so we can see more of our screen Yeah that's looking pretty
196

197
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:52,520
good I'm not quite liking these black pieces at the moment and this is when you're scene starts to
197

198
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,950
come together do you like how things are looking they're not dark enough as far as I'm concerned I'm
198

199
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,100
gonna make them nearly black and I'm going to make them a little less shiny oh they're reflection it's
199

200
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,570
all the way down I don't want the matte either do you want a slight sheen on them so I'm going to set
200

201
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,870
that that's about 40 percent okay yeah that's looking much better something to go ahead.
201

202
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,520
Press F12.
202

203
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,160
There we go.
203

204
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,440
Forgot to turn them on in rendered view as well.
204

205
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,880
Easy mistake to make and we've got some bits in our scene that we don't want either.
205

206
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:39,090
So let's find the bishop itself and turn off any of the notches when it comes to rendering and what's
206

207
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:45,450
very useful is at the top here instead of just searching for them manually I can just turn off the notches
207

208
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,250
let's go and render it again.
208

209
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,370
Excellent.
209

210
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,330
Well I might do.
210

211
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,580
Not yet but perhaps when it comes to finalizing the board itself the bishops themselves are uniform
211

212
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,530
at the moment they're both facing exactly the same way.
212

213
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Now I really want a bit of rotation in them.
213

214
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,530
Maybe a bit of randomness as well just to make the board look less computerized less rigid and more
214

215
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:16,020
realistic because let's face it even if we set up the board perfectly now everything is going to be
215

216
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,740
aligned in dead center.
216

217
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,040
Okay but there we go.
217

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,090
That's my render.
218

219
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,020
I can now save that image and boom.
219

220
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,780
There we go.
220

221
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,630
Please share your results in the discussions.
221

222
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,550
I look forward to seeing how your boards are coming along and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
