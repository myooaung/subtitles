Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on there is more than one way.
1

2
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.560
Now the reason why this is here is because at about this time in your learning journey you often see
2

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.520
people doing things slightly different from what you're doing and you start scratching your head and
3

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.070
you're going oh should I've done it the other way.
4

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.260
They looked far better.
5

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.830
Well during your learning journey you're going to learn lots of ways of doing things and there's always
6

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.130
going to be more than one way.
7

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm sure you've already screamed at the screen going.
8

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.050
No Mike I would do it completely differently from you and that's absolutely fine.
9

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.810
The crucial thing is that you end up with the same end result whether you go left and then right or
10

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.490
and then left to get there.
11

12
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.610
That's absolutely fine as long as the end result is you're arriving at your destination.
12

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.040
And of course some people will go straight to a really complex model and spend lots of time practicing
13

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.080
on one item.
14

15
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.890
Others will practice on lots of different things and develop their skills in a slightly different way.
15

16
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.180
We all learn differently.
16

17
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.820
We know that however don't get yourself down if you're wondering if I'm doing things the right way.
17

18
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.340
You certainly are if you're progressing and what i'd inspire you to do at this moment in time is keep a
18

19
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.070
record and screenshots or even print out what you've made so far.
19

20
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.530
Even if you've got a 3D printer that'll be even more impressive.
20

21
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.230
So as you go through this course watch your development grow by keeping a track record of it.
21

22
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.890
That's one of the best ways to do things as we go.
22

23
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.990
And as we go through if you find out a different way of doing things share that with everybody share
23

24
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.820
it with the community you may have come up with an ingenious way of doing something that none of us
24

25
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.250
have thought of that does happen from time to time.
25

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.960
Why not be the one to showcase that particular technique.
26

27
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.380
Remember you can share in the Q and A's or over in the discussions.
27

28
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.360
And I love seeing what you guys come up with.
28

29
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.980
I really do it inspires me as a teacher and I'll know that other students really appreciate seeing other
29

30
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.670
students work as well so they can progress together.
30

31
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.040
And it doesn't matter if someone's really really good.
31

32
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.820
That's fine.
32

33
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.670
That's something to aspire to and you'll get there too.
33

34
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.000
As you progress through this course and with your own practice as well.
34

35
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.250
So it doesn't matter how your skill level is at the moment I'm looking forward to seeing you progress
35

36
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.040
as you go through the course and take on the challenges.
36

37
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.310
And I will see you all in the next lecture.
