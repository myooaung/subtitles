00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,910
Welcome to the introduction to marking seems in this video.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,360
You realize that you've unwraps will have seams in them.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,400
Well most of the.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,200
Way you can do an unwrap where all the faces are on top of one another says all been squished together

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,850
into one location.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,870
And of course that's useful for certain circumstances.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,230
But usually you'll want to have seems to define how you want blender to unwrap will be learning how

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,010
to mark seams where you want them and understand that this gives us the most control over our models

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,790
unwrapping.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,580
So we've said seems lots.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,120
What is a seam.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,990
Well it is a cut in your model telling blender how to unwrap the model itself.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,590
Now if you imagine seem most of us would associate a seam with a bits of clothing now a bit of clothing

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,610
becomes a 3D model.

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,950
But essentially it's made from 2D fabric.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,720
So it's a great way of visualizing how something two dimensional is then put together it's a three dimensional.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,040
And of course the reverse if you were to unstitch along those scenes it your your shirt or your trousers

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,530
would end up being a flat bit of material.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,990
And they may not resemble much of the original.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,560
Close do look odd and so you ve unwraps occasionally it allows you to separate parts of your meshes

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,020
from one another and apply texture to those parts individually.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,030
So a couple of tips for making seams and will go more into this later on as well.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,710
Now seams can ease the cause distortion a mis alignment of textures so you do have to be careful where

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,350
you put them.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,560
Seams often occur on hard edges.

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,620
Now on organic models that's not too much of a problem.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,540
You just need to hide them out of the way.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,540
But on a more industrial or what we call hard surface non organic models are hard edge and a seam often

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,780
coincide.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,050
They are made where you are least likely to see them.

31
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,630
So if there is any distortion a misalignment of textures that you are applying you're less likely to

32
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,230
see them and they won't ruin your model and understand.

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,430
As I've said before this gives us the most control over our model.

34
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,930
So let's go make some seams now and hop on over into a blender.

35
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,350
Okay so we're going to start in a default blender scene and not try anything too complicated at the

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,230
moment when it comes to marking seams.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,150
But I'm going to get rid of that cube and go ahead and add in a euv Sphere.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,120
Now I'm going to play with that for a moment.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,380
I'm going to give myself an image editor as well so we can see the unwrap as it happens we don't particularly

40
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,430
need an image there but if you want to play with the picture of the world that we were playing with

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,080
before then by all means go ahead.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,140
Okay so let's have a look at what impact it has.

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,490
Why.

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,620
We just unwrap as we can expect it produces this.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,150
Everything piled on top of one another and that has its uses but it's no good if we want to map something

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,090
across the entire sphere in this case.

47
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,750
So let's try adding in a scene.

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,570
Now what we need to do is select the edges or edge loop.

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
That's often very powerful.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,750
Not always but sometimes.

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm missing the edge loop here that goes all the way down from here to the very bottom and would just

52
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,090
start with that one and we need to tell blender that that edge is a seam and we can do that over in

53
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,020
the tool shelf and the shading Enu vs tab we can click on Mark seen is also available under the mesh

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:58,200
menu under edges Mark scene and of course we can see the shortcut for the edges menu is control and

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,110
so we can hit control any and Mark seam.

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,690
Now when you mark the scene it goes red in colour.

57
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,580
If I just.

58
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,210
Unselect that edge loop there we can see that it's red in colour.

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:18,170
Now select everything and see what happens if we unwrap and although it's different it's still a bit

60
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,360
difficult to use because of the stretching and distortion I can see in front of me.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,240
So let's try perhaps adding in a nother.

62
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,440
Over the other side some with a hole down.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,940
Old select the edge the loop running the other way.

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,930
It's not quite essential that select the other one.

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,750
I'm just going to clip Mark seam in the tool shelf.

66
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,830
Select everything and unwrap again.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,630
Okay that's a bit different isn't it.

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:52,570
We've got to use V unwraps Now these because we've sliced all the way through the model they are now

69
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,320
separate islands.

70
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,200
If we.

71
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,520
Oh if I just expand this out so you guys can see more of the header bar down the bottom here.

72
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,450
Remember we can select the verte sees the edges the faces and then there's the Forth button there which

73
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,450
is Ireland.

74
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,630
We can actually move these individual islands about and if there was an image underneath it would be

75
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,230
changing on here as well.

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,340
Now we can add a seam around the equator of this sphere so that would be this one.

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:29,510
Here we go window control an E and Mark a seam and a select everything.

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,410
And unwrap.

79
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,580
How we get something completely different.

80
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,550
I think during that laskey press I must have accidentally created some doubles because we've got this

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,630
ring around here so I'm just going to select everything I'm going to search for doubles.

82
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,140
And remove doubles.

83
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes I did inadvertently create a ring of double So let's unwrap that.

84
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,190
And that's created four separate islands as you can see.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,950
Cut the model in half one way and the other.

86
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,460
Now there will be times when you've misplaced to seem.

87
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,530
So let's try removing a scene now.

88
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,210
It's very similar to what we've done before by adding a seam.

89
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,460
It's just another option there.

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,760
So I'm going to select this edge loop running along here and the one the other side.

91
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,260
Now I've done that.

92
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,150
I can either go to the tool shelf or control an E or down to the menu if you want to go through a menu

93
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,650
system and clear the scene.

94
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:38,190
Now when I go into edit mode and select all and unwrap we have a different unwrap this time as you can

95
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,410
see there's lots of ways that you can cut things up and depending on what you're trying to apply to

96
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,740
your model will depend on how you decide to cut it up.

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,830
In this case it all of these are valid unwraps some are just easier to work with than others depending

98
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,890
on what you doing.

99
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,810
So this would be a brilliant unwrap if you were working on an eye but not so brilliant unwrap if you

100
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,060
are working on a map of the world mainly because none of these can be stretched to fit a map properly

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,590
of course you can go really silly and you can select everything and mark it as a seam I don't know quite

102
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,960
how this is going to turn out.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,940
It's probably just going to turn out to have a lot of little squares so let's go unwrap Yeah.

104
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,690
There we go.

105
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,370
It's literally every one of these faces is now his own island.

106
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,150
Obviously that's a bit extreme but you might want to play with the various options that you've got here

107
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,340
so I can select a couple of segments here as we go around our.

108
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,850
I was going to select them at random.

109
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh I want that in a ring.

110
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,660
There we go.

111
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:52,890
So we selected the lead segments I can mark them as a seam and we'll get some probably Cresent shaped

112
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,560
unwrapped when we go and unwrap it.

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,110
There we go see problems in maps of the world that look like this when they're unravelled.

114
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,820
In fact that's how a lot of early Globes were made when they folded all the bits of paper that they

115
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,760
printed the map on onto a globe to make them.

116
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:16,170
One final thing that you can do rather than hitting you and unwrap every time is after you've made a

117
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,800
change to let's make one final change here.

118
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,830
I'm going to highlight everything and clear those scenes and I'm going to send it back to that equatorial

119
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,170
cup that we had before which is that one there are marked for scene.

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,800
OK.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,990
So now we've done that if we select.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,780
All we can go over to the image editor and unfortunately it's not the U.K. it's actually v e key.

123
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,350
Well the unwrap again.

124
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:50,580
And that's also available under uv's on the menu option and unwrap as you can see there's very powerful

125
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,320
it stops you having to muck around over in these 3-d ED all the time.

126
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:03,330
Incidentally these other ones kind of ignore your your scenes so if we go smart TV projects it's pretty

127
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,020
much ignored.

128
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:12,180
Those scenes all together in fatties that's totally unusable for anything I can think of at the moment.

129
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,420
Let's go ahead and give your knowledge a little bit of a test with a challenge.

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Okay so this one's going to look a bit straight forward but it's can be conceptually hard to work out

131
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,940
how to play scenes on a 3D object which are going to make convert to a 2D object.

132
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:39,480
So what I'd like to do now is place the appropriate scenes so that you can unwrap a cube so it looks

133
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,620
like this.

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,340
And we've seen this animation before so we end up with that cross shape.

135
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,480
That's how I want you to unwrap a cube.

136
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,440
So pause the video and give that a go.

137
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,530
Okay guys.

138
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,420
Welcome back.

139
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,130
Let's go ahead and unwrap a cube.

140
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,930
Okay so we're done with this sphere for the moment.

141
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,210
I am literally going to hop into objet mode and delete it.

142
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,520
I don't need to start up a new blend file and I'm going to add in a cube.

143
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,890
Okay so we've got the cube in front of us and then hop into edit mode.

144
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:23,710
Now I've got to visualize chopping this up so I'm going to select a couple of edges under me bring up

145
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,810
the tool shelf here so I can just go Yeah definitely that one.

146
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,820
There's going to be a top to it's office square I'm going to represent that the top of that cross.

147
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,120
So that is going to be there.

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
Mark seam and there.

149
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,960
So that's definitely one bet.

150
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,360
Then it comes out.

151
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,170
So that would be the middle bit of a cross.

152
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,170
So it needs to come this way so it's that one there.

153
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,590
Mark scene.

154
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,910
And this one here Mark scene.

155
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,240
Or is it all this can be confusing so that there no it's not that one there at all.

156
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,670
This is why it's conceptually hard in 3-d to get this in your head since Hashi there of all places.

157
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:21,110
And that creates the cross and there's no seam across here to this spear here as that seems there and

158
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,810
then it's this is following round and then we end up with two bits there and there.

159
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,140
So we just need to chop all.

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:39,030
I've lost my bearings now so I've got that bit there a seam here and I think it's there there and there

161
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,060
of course what we can do at any point of filling those in.

162
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,310
I'm just going to see if I've got that top bit right.

163
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,630
Well we've got some of it right as you can see and then it's twisted and distorted the rest so let's

164
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,030
put in those three seams there and Mark seen them go over here.

165
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,370
Select everything.

166
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,760
E to unwrap.

167
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,290
Okay so we're getting closer.

168
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,360
I've obviously joined the wrong two together so I'm going to try that scene.

169
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,880
I think that's actually the one I had the first time I've rotated this thing round so much I'm not surprised

170
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,800
I'm not dizzy.

171
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,770
So let's try to unwrap again.

172
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,730
Yes there we go we've got that cross shape.

173
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,200
So what does that look like.

174
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,970
That looks like.

175
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,270
Let's just clear the selection there.

176
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:36,110
That looks like two seas or two ends joined together either side so that's worked out pretty well as

177
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,260
you could see it can be quite challenging even with a cube just to get the right seams the ones that

178
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,370
you want.

179
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,050
Or in this case the ones I wanted you to get just right in order to do the unwrap.

180
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:55,010
This is a great first step to understanding how to unwrap models.

181
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,310
Now it's not an exciting procedure.

182
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,720
I've never met anybody who relishes the idea of unwrapping a model.

183
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,970
It's one of those things that has to be done in order to do it and it can be a bit mind boggling.

184
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,250
It is very satisfying however once you managed to get it right.

185
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,590
And of course next time we'll be looking at scenes that are on slightly more complicated shapes but

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,180
until we get to that point remember to share your work in the discussions.

187
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,220
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
