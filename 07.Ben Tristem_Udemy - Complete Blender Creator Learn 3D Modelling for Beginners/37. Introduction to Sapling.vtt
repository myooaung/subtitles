00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.140
Welcome to.

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.410
Introduction to a sapling in this video.

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.720
You'll turn on a sapling and on your learn the fundamentals of suppling understand to save before using

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.950
sapling and we'll see why and learn how to prevent blender from crashing when using sapling.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.300
Let's go explore sapling now over in blender.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.260
So the first thing that we need to go and do now is make sure that sapling is turned on.

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.750
So you'll find that under file user preferences and go to the add ons tab.

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.250
Now we can search for it.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.610
In fact it's here add curve sapling we don't need to search for it.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.240
I've already got it turned on.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.180
If you haven't please put a tick in this box and save your user settings.

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.980
Excellent.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.860
Now that saplings turned on we can go and explore with it.

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.810
So first of all so we don't muck around with our current blender file the bunny that we're working on.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.370
Let's go explore the sapling add on in a brand new blender file.

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
Ill also make sure everything's nice and smooth for us and nothing else is slowing us down.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.640
So I'm going to make sure I've saved my fluffy bunny and hop over into a brand new blender file.

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.260
Excellent.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.900
So now that we're in a brand new blender far we can go ahead and add half first tree.

20
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.120
So first of all let's get rid of our cube.

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.540
Now the sapling add on itself is located under the curves so you can go add curve and add tree or shift

22
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.170
in a curve add tree and it will add a tree forus not quite there yet.

23
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.870
Let's go in and see what else we can do.

24
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.430
Okay solvay expanded the operation panel all the operator panel in the lower left hand corner here so

25
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.580
we can play with some of these settings.

26
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.620
Now when you're going to go into great detail at this point in the course regarding sapling but do have

27
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.030
a play about it's a wonderfully addictive tool for making some wonderful.

28
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.660
Trees and other plants as well.

29
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.930
So we're going to start on the Geometry tab and look at the branch splitting and branch growth.

30
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
We're not going to do the leaves or anything else for the moment we just go and deal with these three

31
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.240
sections and a very brief overview of them.

32
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.700
So geometry if we turn the bevel on we can see the the tree becomes three dimensional which is a great

33
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.800
stance and the bevell resolution determines how high.

34
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.400
How many faces this is going to happen at the moment.

35
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.520
Scott 4 I presume this is now 5 6 7 etc. but what you can see is as these increase the number of triangles

36
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.950
also goes up so the higher the resolution the tree the more efforts you are going to have to put into

37
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.770
rendering it as well as the curve resolution doesn't make a difference when it's on vector.

38
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.910
However when it's on auto.

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.310
This curve for a solution has a huge difference and it basically controls midspan up here with the curve

40
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.760
resolution set to 1.

41
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.250
You can see that these are really jagged.

42
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.290
But as we turn this up they get smoother and smoother.

43
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.380
But of course that adds more geometry as well.

44
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.210
Random seed will as it sounds.

45
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.210
It starts the tree off in different ways.

46
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.940
A great way of getting a good starting point.

47
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.010
In fact I quite like the one that one there kind of wiggles along as a great start ratio.

48
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.170
Well this is the ratio of the trunk size so that looks more like a dragon's tail or something outside

49
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.810
of World of Warcraft of days gone by.

50
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
To be quite honest I can't see that being a tree.

51
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.890
Could be some alien plant though.

52
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.190
Your imagination can run wild.

53
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.450
But that biloela not ever backed down.

54
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.650
Scale of the tree is how high it is solves.

55
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.370
You can make it a whopping great big tree or a tiny tree.

56
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.940
So I'm going to make it a bit smaller so just fits on the screen so we can see the whole tree scale

57
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.320
variation.

58
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.370
The variation in the tree scale so we can turn that up and down and it will make another difference

59
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.410
radius scale.

60
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.350
Well this is going to change the size of the trunk itself.

61
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.760
We want that back.

62
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.500
Here we go.

63
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.800
And the variation will change a variation on that.

64
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.840
So going onto the branch splitting this is where you need to be careful.

65
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.380
I can't stress enough that you will lock blender up at some point whilst playing with this.

66
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.840
So if you're working in a file before you play with sapling please save.

67
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.180
Otherwise there's a good chance that you'll get fed up waiting and will have to quit the program and

68
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.200
start again.

69
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:55.860
So levels here now these levels going from one to three and will for lock up my computer it might do

70
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.180
be a great example of how not to look at your computer.

71
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.220
Okay I am able to go for in general you probably don't need to go any more than 3 so I'm going to leave

72
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.950
it on too for the moment so we can see what's going on now branches at the moment.

73
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.140
Zero is absolutely fine here.

74
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.890
If we turn this up it's not going to do anything at this moment in time.

75
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.190
The next one means off this main trunk.

76
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.990
There are now 50 branches on the third layer down so 1 2 3 where it's 30.

77
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.040
It means for every every one of these 50 there are 30.

78
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.770
And finally the four effort every one of those attached to those attached to those there's going to

79
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.350
be 10.

80
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.190
Now you can see very quickly cause these are multiplied up you only need to change one of the lower

81
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.150
figures to have a huge impact further down the line.

82
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.520
And that's one of those things that all cost you dearly.

83
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.840
If you go too high.

84
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.990
And trust me I've done it accidentally.

85
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.580
You're just moving the figuring.

86
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.560
Just go to high and the system decides to it's not crashing it's just going to take ages to calculate

87
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.570
the new geometry segment splits are very similar to branches.

88
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.240
Ever let's just lower these down so it limits my chance of crashing.

89
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.960
So we've got 10 branches that are producing 10 branches and that producing 10 branches.

90
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.670
So there we go.

91
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.760
We've got a series of branches coming in off there.

92
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.070
Now other segments splits.

93
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:34.980
They split the branches themselves but they don't alter these numbers here so if you split up some of

94
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.440
these branches Well it looks of it funky at the moment and I don't think were going to be able to count

95
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.980
them.

96
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.290
There's far too many of them now let's drop back down a couple of levels if and let's drop down to just

97
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.390
level two so we can see what's going on.

98
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.340
So we've got 10 branches coming off of here.

99
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.600
Well it looks it doesn't quite look ten branches but that's what it says.

100
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.650
We got ten branches coming off of here now.

101
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.200
If we splits.

102
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.690
This first level.

103
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.200
We still only have 10 branches coming off of it just splits the first level so is a great way of adding

104
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.380
detail without having to add a load more branches because you're just splitting branches that already

105
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.720
exist.

106
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.670
One of the useful things just go turn up the number here again so we can see more some more tree basically

107
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:29.790
is the base size and that determines where the actual branches start from at zero or close to zero.

108
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.780
Any way the branches themselves will they start towards the bottom of the tree so that there looks much

109
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.760
more like a Christmas type tree of fir tree.

110
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:49.020
And of course up the top here a couple of trees that look like that will not look like this.

111
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.740
A couple of ones are like this Acacia trees and things like that.

112
00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:00.910
So there's a lots of different types of tree that you can emulate using this and I would encourage you

113
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:07.630
to play with the split tangles split angle variation and all of these things here and you'll soon see

114
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:14.260
that you can make your tree that was once facing up would droop down and have some really weird effects

115
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.130
carrying on with it there.

116
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.000
Okay let's move on to the final section here.

117
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.960
The branch growth.

118
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.390
Now this is where you can really change the dynamic of the tree and you can have a let's say a shorter

119
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.890
stump just here.

120
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.670
Now all of these are relative to the one above as well as very important to realize that point five

121
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.350
and point five.

122
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.990
Well that's half of it was before but point five and 1.

123
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:49.000
Both of these are now the same length and point five and 2 means that's the actual All these branches

124
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:55.400
are twice as long as the original stump itself.

125
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.000
Vertical attraction.

126
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.900
Well it simply changes their vertical attraction it literally all looks.

127
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.360
That is quite awesome.

128
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.800
Sorry I have not done that before.

129
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.090
That is quite alien.

130
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.170
It's hypnotic.

131
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.730
Okay that's basically pulls some vertically in a course when they go on over earthcare Looks like it

132
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.120
wraps it round again and then pulls and backup.

133
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.460
So very cool.

134
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.440
And again we've got lots of other things we can work on down here.

135
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.520
In general I don't bother changing the curve for a solution but as you saw earlier it changes the detail

136
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.030
level of the curves and it can actually change the appearance of the tree quite dramatically.

137
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.250
So do play with these sections here and there are a couple of things I want to show you now that you

138
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.860
can actually make.

139
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.150
I have made two things I've made a tree and I've made a little bush wood flowers.

140
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.920
Just to show you how versatile sapling can be.

141
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.770
So here we have the little bush that I have made with some green leaves on it.

142
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.590
I modelled these leaves very quickly using a plain and subdividing it and colouring it in green essentially

143
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.830
and the flowers were there in the nature pack.

144
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:20.200
I basically just attach them to the vertices at the end of sapling once it was made and of course saplings

145
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.210
more known for its ability to generate a tree.

146
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.530
And here we have a tree in some grass land so you can see the power of it.

147
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.060
And now I've got a challenge for you guys.

148
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:42.770
I would like you to create a flowering bush so you sapling to create a bush like plants create a basically

149
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:52.590
leaf to use on our bush convert the sapling curve into a mesh objects using weight painting and virtex

150
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.770
groups to add flowers to the tips and leaves to the bush.

151
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:03.330
Then we're going to use geometry to make the flowers 3-d.

152
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:10.140
We're going to make sure that all of your objects have an appropriate material assigned to them.

153
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:17.300
And just a reminder to save before making any changing in sapling to prevent the loss of data.

154
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.980
Just in case you make one change and it causes blender to crash.

155
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.040
So go ahead and plan out the bush.

156
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:30.020
You're going to make have an idea in your head of what it's going to look like as well.

157
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.000
And now pause the video and give that a go.

158
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.500
Okay guys welcome back.

159
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.370
Let's go create a flowering bush over in blender.

160
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:49.880
Okay so I've hopped straight on over into my fluffy bunny and I'm going to create a new layer here.

161
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.840
I'm going to create my bush on.

162
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:58.480
So let's go ahead and add the sapling and it looks like my cursor was just a little bit away and I'm

163
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.220
just gonna move the lock camera off.

164
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.410
Now I've got just about eight minutes to make this in this video.

165
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.240
So wish me luck.

166
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.690
I'm going to add a level to it and make it a much smaller tree.

167
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.390
About one in height.

168
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.620
Perfect.

169
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.230
Right.

170
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.570
Or in fact it's going to be a Bush.

171
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.890
So let's go and do some branch growth.

172
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.220
Let's yeah the first one one.

173
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.780
The second one point nine.

174
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.410
Excellent.

175
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.300
Now there's too many branches there so let's come back to splits.

176
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.480
Let's reduce that a little.

177
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.220
That's good.

178
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.730
Base size this drop it down just a little.

179
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.130
So it's nice and spread out.

180
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.870
That is looking pretty good.

181
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.730
Okay.

182
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.250
So there's lots of different ways you can go about doing this.

183
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:51.050
I don't want to make it too complicated and that's probably going to be complicated enough actually

184
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.090
so I'm going to stick with that.

185
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.210
I'm going to shorten the arm length just a little.

186
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.940
Let's go to branch growth.

187
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.520
Let's bring that one down.

188
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.620
And this one up slightly.

189
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.400
Excellent.

190
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.870
So now we've got vose there.

191
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.630
I'm going to keep that as my base because I'm quite happy with that.

192
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.890
So let's go ahead and convert that so that's good.

193
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.860
Find it in here we've got our tree under a rename that bush to be consistent.

194
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.590
And I'm going to convert that to a mesh object.

195
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.210
Brilliant.

196
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.800
I'm going to give that mesh object to material.

197
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:33.570
I'm going to call it Bach and I'm going to set that Bach colour just to if diff use so dark brown so

198
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.580
stands out.

199
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.810
Okay we need to go ahead and create our flower and our leaf.

200
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.980
Now I'm going to create those on another layer.

201
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.670
So first of all let's create the leaf so I'm going to do that as a very basic leaf.

202
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:55.160
I'm going to get myself a plane here and I'm going to subdivide it a couple of times so I got some geometry

203
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.390
to work with.

204
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.000
Now they're subdivided it.

205
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.760
I'm going to make sure I'm in proportional editing mode.

206
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:09.200
It's you're going to start grabbing bits and pulling them about to try and create a general leaf shape

207
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.680
give or take.

208
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.910
Hey there's there is Travis way.

209
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.530
Okay.

210
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.660
There we go.

211
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.810
So in point happy with that.

212
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.300
That rough shape.

213
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:27.250
I'm just going to twist the leaf ever so slightly to give it a bit more of a dynamic feel.

214
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:27.890
There we go.

215
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.660
So we've got a leaf there.

216
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.140
Perfect.

217
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.930
A final thing I'm going to do on here's a primer add a subsurface division modifier just to smooth the

218
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.160
leaf out.

219
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.850
And I'm going to place the origin on the end of the leaf.

220
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:47.000
Otherwise it will stick in the middle of our branches when we try and put it on origins of 3-d cursor.

221
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.480
Perfect.

222
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.450
So that's that one done is a huge leaf but we can deal with that in a bit.

223
00:14:51.470 --> 00:15:00.470
Now we need to bring in enough flour so let's add a mesh image as planes go find a flower now which

224
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.370
one shall I pick.

225
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.860
I am going to pick.

226
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.210
I'm going to pick this blue one.

227
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.730
I do like it's and I'm going to use the alpha channel because I've set up that already diffused and

228
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.010
transparent import.

229
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.500
Excellent.

230
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.090
Let's just focus on that particular.

231
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.040
There we go.

232
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.800
Let's go into edit mode and subdivide that twice.

233
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.780
And that's going to give us some extra geometry on that plane which should allow us to just pull this

234
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.470
down.

235
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.460
With proportional editing again turned on and make ourselves a bit more of a 3-d flower.

236
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.580
Now on it's a have a trumpet that's too big.

237
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.010
That's perfect.

238
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:46.850
And finally under the move 3D cursor to select it will shift an S and then I'm going to hop into object

239
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.550
mode and set the origin to the 3D cursor.

240
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.530
So again the flowers are mounted on the right points.

241
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.990
Now we've got all that we just need to assign ourselves our virtex groups.

242
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.770
So let's hop into edit mode on this Bush and the object a tour over here.

243
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:11.030
This add a vertex group called flowers and hop into edit mode with the Bush selected.

244
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.650
I'm going to make sure that I've not got any duplicate vertices going on there by removing doubles.

245
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:16.970
Yes.

246
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.380
Fifty one of them were removed some glad I gave it a go.

247
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.400
And I want flowers to basically appear on the end of all of these.

248
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.790
Now it looks like I've picked quite a few.

249
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.780
Of course it doesn't need to be every single one but me being me are I'm going to pick every single

250
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.160
one.

251
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.840
Anyway that looks good.

252
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.890
Add Virts group called flowers.

253
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.360
I'm sure I did that a moment ago.

254
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.660
I'm just going to assign those to them.

255
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.960
Right we're going to lock that group so I can't muck around with it.

256
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.630
We'll going to add one called leaves and that's basically going to be the rest of our model with the

257
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.490
flowers D selected.

258
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.840
Perfect.

259
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:03.010
And now let's go to the leaves click a sign and not lock it just yet.

260
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.460
I'm going to go into a weight paint mode and just remove.

261
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.610
We've got everything painted red there above the tips.

262
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:17.180
I'm just going to go in and scroll up here go to subtract and remove it from the very bottom because

263
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.690
I do not want leaves coming out of the bottom of the plant.

264
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.110
There we go.

265
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.260
That should be good.

266
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.850
I'm going to lock it.

267
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.670
Let's go into the particle effects and make sure that we are on the Bush we are.

268
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.510
I'm going to add a Flowers.

269
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:38.480
First of all Ann I'm going to add leaves as well.

270
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.320
So flowers is going to be a hair type.

271
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.680
And it's going to come from a scroll down here.

272
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.630
Density the flower sections all come from the ends.

273
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:59.260
I'm going to only have what 50 50 flowers coming on there will set the object to the blue flower.

274
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.620
Excellent.

275
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.860
Now I could play about with rotations but I don't feel I.

276
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:03.770
Time to do that.

277
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.000
I'm going to leave it as it is for the moment.

278
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.660
And then on here on the leaves again it's a tight pair.

279
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.860
Object is going to be our.

280
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.320
Or did a name it is.

281
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.820
It's probably still plain.

282
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.180
I can't score down there we go plain yet.

283
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.380
Those are the leaves are going to have to make them a little bit smaller or ashie that's worked out

284
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.430
quite well.

285
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.950
Now they're a bit too uniform across them actually going to turn on rendered mode to see what happens

286
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.920
and they've not got a material assigned to them so let's go assign the material.

287
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.900
Of course you can probably guess what I'm going to do.

288
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.000
I'm going to assign it a green.

289
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.630
That's a little bit darker.

290
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.830
And there we go.

291
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.670
And I think all we need to do to this.

292
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.640
Have we got any children assigned.

293
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.950
Let's go back to the bush scroll down here.

294
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.160
No we haven't got any children assigned us so we can't apply any randomness.

295
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.410
So I'm going to drop this down to about 200.

296
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:10.320
Well outlook's much better straightaway than a proper people children on and change the randomness of

297
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.340
the end points.

298
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.860
Twist and round ever so slightly.

299
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.920
We don't want to do that.

300
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.300
That's looking pretty good.

301
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.870
Let's see how that looks in context by switching on the ground plane as well.

302
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.610
So in layers layer management can't see to do grass.

303
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.350
That's the other one.

304
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.640
There we go.

305
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.410
So that's starting to look pretty good.

306
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.390
Let's render that out there that looks okay.

307
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:45.470
I could certainly work on it a bit longer to make it a bit neater but that's a good start.

308
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.980
How did you guys get on.

309
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.140
I'd love to see what foliage you came up with.

310
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.460
Please share yours in the discussion.

311
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:58.040
Even if you make a couple different varieties and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
