00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,780
Welcome to layering particle systems in blender.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,340
In this video you will see the solution or at least my solution to the last lecture.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:19,170
Use a series of particle systems to plant our various grass types and make sure we use low values during

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,610
prototyping to get a feel of how the grass will look.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,660
So let's hop straight on over in a blender.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,850
So I left you guys.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
Here is some cones on a hill that's not quite grass.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:41,820
So let's go over in to our fluffy bunny file and we had this one played the grass is grass plants plant.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,790
So the first thing to do is on a nest it's under the ground plane itself.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,820
So let's go to the ground plane would come and turn it on air we get.

11
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,720
And let's go ahead and add a particle system.

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,200
Now I'm going to start with probably the most common one which will be the grass short.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,420
And I'm going to add a new particle system one and call it grass short.

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,270
And then once we've done that I'm also going to name it grass short here and this is going to be the

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,040
one that's going to cover all lots of the ground not absolutely everything if the grass ends up too

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,140
thick it doesn't look natural grass doesn't grow and suffocate itself.

17
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,650
So that's set up there.

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,850
I don't see any hairs as switch on smooth shading.

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,720
I make sure I am on the ground plane.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,430
No I wasn't so aware of my on our applied grass short never mind will remove from there go to the ground

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,210
plain.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,980
Add it in and select grass short it's got zero next to it of course because we've just removed.

23
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,540
It's only use a salad.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,940
It's got no use for us.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,510
So there's our grass short.

26
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,150
It's a hair and it's now going to be an object.

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,680
And at grass short excellence.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,210
Now we've got that set up there as goes at the hair length to one and the size to one.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,270
And it's starting to fill up our mesh.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,500
But of course we don't want to leave it there.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,840
What we'll want to do is have some children now set to the display of 10.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,690
I'm going to leave it at a render of 10 as well that's probably going to be enough.

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,350
And I'm going to add some.

34
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,750
Randomness to it's changed asylum even going to up for random size can I make sure there's lots of fats

35
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,170
and random here.

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:48,450
Well I'm going to increase that significantly and I'm going to just change the threshold so he gets

37
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,980
some bits sticking out more than others.

38
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,670
About thirty three or thirty three.

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,620
Thirty five percent of the grass blades are now completely random or not random.

40
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,490
Are not random though we get the right way around.

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:05,950
OK.

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,690
So I'm going to leave it like that for the moment and start adding a nother.

43
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,440
Particle system.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,920
So let's now go in and add another particle system I call that short grass I wasn't going to forget.

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,590
Rather short short grass okay.

46
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,730
Particle system too.

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,750
What shall we do next.

48
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,980
Do the medium m e d r u m medium grass.

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,820
Now of course here I'm going to borrow my short grass that we've already done all grass short can make

50
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,740
a unique user and immediately called it medium grass.

51
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,930
In fact under to rename the other one.

52
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,880
Just me being an analytical about it's all a shot.

53
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,520
S h.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,840
Who are to grasp just what the other one is shortz.

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,400
No that's fine.

56
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,870
Okay so medium grass Let's go in and select here.

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,940
One of the medium grasses.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,320
Excellent and we can see there's probably too many of those.

59
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,410
So I'm going to knock down the number here to maybe 200.

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,410
Starting to look quite nice.

61
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,580
Now I'm going to just go in straight away and add ourselves a virtex group.

62
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm going to call it medium grass one.

63
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Unhappy with the the base grass the short grass covering absolutely everything.

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,190
And I have medium grass to watch he wants to set these up.

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,390
I'm going to have the.

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,820
Grass short plants.

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,290
Grass shorts.

68
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,260
Plants.

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,110
Then there will be grass seed.

70
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,680
And there will also be grass.

71
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,430
See.

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,700
The plant itself.

73
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,950
So grass.

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,050
Plants.

75
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,140
Oh grass seed plants I know which one it is naming is very important.

76
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,040
I've got to remember if I come back to this in a few years time what I know what it means.

77
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,930
So let's go in and go to the medium grass which you're on at the moment.

78
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:36,620
Let's go to the particle system with the medium grass and turn on the density and select.

79
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,120
Medium grass one.

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,640
So that would just need to change once we've got this right we can just change a couple of values.

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,790
Now make sure we've got the right one selected.

82
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,290
So I have a habit of not checking before I plough forward switch ensue.

83
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,750
White paint and let's.

84
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:03,260
Are much better now you see here the number of cause of only highlighted a very small area.

85
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,130
But I'm going to turn off those.

86
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,750
There are only highlights of that small area there.

87
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,920
It's causing all of my grass.

88
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,630
The two hundred plus each one's got tense of the two thousand blades of grass are in that area there.

89
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:28,530
Now I'm going to put this type of short grass very sporadically over our ground there and dents are

90
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,250
over there now.

91
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:37,240
What we could do is arrange it where the camera is Bud Light to counter put it in up our entire scene

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,560
for the moment so I can move the camera around and find a good angle later on.

93
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,900
So I'm happy with that.

94
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm going to go and add a new particle system.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm going to call this one medium grass too.

96
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,540
I'm going to borrow medium grass.

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,270
Make it his own.

98
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,510
Unique user.

99
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,020
And we've got a couple of things to change.

100
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:08,650
I'm going to change the virtex groups down to medium grass so I'm then going you know.

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,660
I am thing going to change the grass medium to grass medium too.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,740
So that's those things changed.

103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,620
And the virtex group we're going to go on to medium grass and I'm just going to do something ever so

104
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,550
slightly different as you can see the grass is coming in.

105
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,220
And as I paint more and more it will start to thin out.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,010
So that's those ones done as well.

107
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm quite happy with that.

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm going to lower the number as well what we don't want is it to be too dense at this point in time.

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Something lower that down to 5 I probably do the same with the other medium grass.

110
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,330
Now this obviously you can tinker with to your heart's desire I'm going to go for eight here of course

111
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,250
a lot of these have the same seed.

112
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,410
So I'm just going to even though they're not the same distribution I'm just going to change the seed

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,250
type on here.

114
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,920
There we go that shows you what's going on there.

115
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,130
And I think see the zero for that.

116
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,960
That one's absolutely fine.

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,040
Soon find out when it comes to rendering so we've got a couple more particle systems to make.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,630
So let's add in.

119
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,410
Another one.

120
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,830
Let's do the grass seed one.

121
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,650
Gas seed grass seed.

122
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,390
There we go.

123
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,340
And again I'm going to borrow.

124
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,030
I'm going to borrow the hammer.

125
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,180
Where is it short.

126
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,870
One short grass down there.

127
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,450
And I'm going to reduce the number all the way down.

128
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:53,280
I'm literally going to go down to 200 or something along those lines maybe even less one hundred.

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,850
It's over the entire area which is fine children.

130
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,190
I'm going to go down to five children.

131
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,410
So there's not very many of these.

132
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,850
And we'll start to see them in a moment when I put on the grass seed not the plants but just the spots

133
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,090
the grass seed.

134
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,940
There we go.

135
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,440
And yet that all looks fine and it's all across the entire scene.

136
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,870
Now I'm going to see how this is starting to look a look through the camera to see what type of view

137
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,430
we've got.

138
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,160
Well the render would look absolutely hideous with that camera selected.

139
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,280
So let's go ahead and go up here.

140
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,010
Lock for camera to view that sumate spin round.

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,180
It's probably going to be a view something like that.

142
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,090
Let's change the before we go ahead and render.

143
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,190
Let's change the samples render samples currently at 100 I'm to lower it down to five.

144
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,950
So it's relatively quick it's going to take a while to compute some of those objects.

145
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,820
Then now we can start to see here that's the Hill ish you can see the hill.

146
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,750
That's not a big deal.

147
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,380
We probably need to increase the density of the base graphs because there's not enough of it but that's

148
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,500
why we render so we can go back in straightaway.

149
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,540
I think there's enough Tallgrass there so let's go and grab our short grass particle system and turn

150
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,670
that up to a thousand and see how that renders out.

151
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,890
That's taking a little longer and looks like it's going to be a little more dense.

152
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:37,070
Of course the lower samples it does mean that you are possible that you're going to get some black colourations

153
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,920
because obviously there's not enough samples to go through the object with light as you can see it's

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,670
taking a lot longer as well.

155
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,470
We'll end up with these dark patches right.

156
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,850
That's looking like we've got a decent amount of cover there I'm just going to stop the render.

157
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm going to lower that down to 600 for the time being and we can play with these.

158
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,980
That's the great thing.

159
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,480
We can go backwards and forwards all day long.

160
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,860
Now can I add in a couple of our plants themselves.

161
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,780
But I'm going to put them in very specific locations.

162
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,020
So let's go ahead and hop into 3D view.

163
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,420
I'm going to hide the other particle systems first.

164
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,260
And I'm going to go over here and do both of these at the same time.

165
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:30,800
So the grass short plants only once that's around that area there that Sony put it on hills why not.

166
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,420
And the grass seed plants I'm going to make this brush a little smaller and pop some.

167
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,420
There some here some there one or two up on the top of the hill.

168
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,530
Perfect.

169
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,800
Now there are only going to be a few of those.

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:58,510
So with the particle system I'm going to create a new one and call it grass it's plants.

171
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,510
I'm going to set this one up manually rather than borrowing settings of any of the other ones.

172
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:13,790
So I wanted to off type hair now and change it straight away for the density here so be it.

173
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,290
Grass short plants.

174
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,860
That's the one we're working on too.

175
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,710
We can see the areas it's going to be in.

176
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm going to turn off children.

177
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,630
I don't want any children on this so it is off by default.

178
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,300
Don't need a thousand of them.

179
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,330
Probably 50 maybe a little more than 50 to 200 in total.

180
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,340
And the hair length of one.

181
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,640
The objets is what we're going to use.

182
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,710
We're going to use grass short plant.

183
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,460
There we go.

184
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,250
And set the size to one here as well.

185
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,890
That looks good.

186
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,670
Apart from doesn't seem to be adhering much.

187
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,380
I think that's just.

188
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,820
And no it's not grass short.

189
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,980
Plants.

190
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,060
My painting the right one grass seed plant grass are just a naming.

191
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,300
In their grass short plants.

192
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,780
Excellent.

193
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,380
Is there another one down here.

194
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,220
We need grass up grass short plant grass seed plant.

195
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,420
That's why.

196
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,420
I've signed it to the wrong one or I've just misnamed things and not noticed.

197
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,620
Very easy to do with lots of things on Answer grass short plant.

198
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,340
That's the layout I want.

199
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,180
Now going to copy that into the next one.

200
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,730
So did I name it.

201
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,130
No.

202
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,400
So brass.

203
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,670
Go in here.

204
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,270
Grass short plants.

205
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:48,310
And then I'm going to borrow it in the particle system six grass short plants grass short plant.

206
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
Why can't I see it.

207
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,740
Is it further up.

208
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,570
Yes it is grass short plants.

209
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:02,210
And I'm going to call this grass seed plants and just scroll down probably even less.

210
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,230
This time some may be a hundred of them in total on the scene.

211
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,740
And I'm going to select the grass seed plant distribution.

212
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,870
Perfect.

213
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,920
So let's oh I haven't changed the object but the looks things.

214
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,770
Grass seed plants.

215
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,650
Okay that's probably too many.

216
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,390
Looks more like a field of corn rather than anything else.

217
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,380
So let's turn it down to 50.

218
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,080
And I want to bits more randomness in here.

219
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,770
So let's see if we can get anywhere with the random size.

220
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,350
That's a bit better.

221
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,200
We make it a bit smaller and of size only seems to make it smaller than what it was before.

222
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,460
So have I increased the size ever so slightly.

223
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,770
It will be larger.

224
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,920
Okay so let's spin back around to around here.

225
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,440
Let's turn on all the other layers themselves starting get a bit dense.

226
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,340
I don't know how long this is going to take to render has our world got an environment texture on it

227
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,530
has excellent can to be well lit.

228
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,050
Let's see how this turns out.

229
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,620
Of course what we should do at some point is also put the bunny back in the scene and let's line up

230
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,940
the camera with the bunny.

231
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,180
It's going to look something like that and render it out.

232
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,180
Let's see what it comes out like.

233
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,420
Okay.

234
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,800
Brilliant that has turned out rather well.

235
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm liking how that is looking.

236
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,860
We've got a few tweaks that I can see straightaway to do.

237
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,350
Of course we're only at a very low sample rate at the moment and notice that took a minute and 45.

238
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,770
My laptop is no slouch but it's also not a complete power house so that's rendered out rather nicely.

239
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,410
I like the way it's turned out.

240
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,650
The grass looks quite natural.

241
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,560
Lying about here is a bit too much to grass.

242
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,320
Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing and where the tree is going to be which I think is going

243
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,230
to be somewhere around here probably wants to remove some of the grass from there.

244
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,960
She looks quite dense up there right.

245
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,160
So I'd love to see how your guys Meadow's are coming on.

246
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,170
Please show me how you're getting on in the discussions I'd love to see what sort of grass you've come

247
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,280
up with as well.

248
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,260
So I always run a bit short of time in these videos.

249
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,390
I'm just going to run through how I got to this stage a few extra bits that I've done obviously I've

250
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,690
covered in the dirt the ground with a diffuse colour and to do that I have gone to the ground plane

251
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:47,490
itself gone to the materials propertys and literally created a material I haven't named yet.

252
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,710
Called its soil for the moment.

253
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,820
So it's my soil material and I set it as a lighter colour.

254
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:01,360
Brown not too dark because the shadowing that's caused by the grass on top of it will usually be enough

255
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,870
to give us some darker soil as well.

256
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:12,430
Now you'll notice that between the last image you saw and this one here I've added a few extra details

257
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,780
and let's break them down.

258
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,950
Now I'm going to hop into the data properties here and you'll see I've added nothing with the ground.

259
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,390
Yeah.

260
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:26,080
Virtex group here that I've painted in I've added some extra grass around the rabbit itself to make

261
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,100
sure that it is covered up properly.

262
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,280
Perhaps a little bit taller grass there we could go for lots of different things.

263
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:41,220
Particle systems I've added that grass around the rabbit base as well and I used my short grass view.

264
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,220
So if we just go into the 3D view I can show you that.

265
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,620
So let's turn off everything.

266
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,990
Here are the bits we need.

267
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,600
Okay so I used our short grass across the entire scene.

268
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,790
I used the medium grass base over there.

269
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:09,320
This one over there the grass seed itself the long see that I spread it out very thinly across the entire

270
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,470
scene.

271
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,120
The grass short plant scattered all over the place.

272
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,810
But I also made it a tiny bit larger and put it around the rabbit base is welchs to make sure it was

273
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,310
fully covered up around there.

274
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,250
I could have probably painted that in a bit smooth but I did literally just dumped all the grass there

275
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,630
to make sure that the base was covered up.

276
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,780
And finally the grass seed plant will have scattered that about as well.

277
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,440
A few critiques of my final render or this isn't the final render but it was the render before the final

278
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,060
render.

279
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,830
And I've got the grass you can see through here I don't know whether that's a big problem or not but

280
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,490
it does highlight that the ground is super smooth and ground generally isn't super smooth like that.

281
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,090
So there's a couple of things we could make it undulate a bit more but I'm not too bothered at this

282
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,640
stage about that there's something we can always sort out later.

283
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,730
So how did you guys get on.

284
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,850
I'd love to see your field your meadows or your grass land that you've created.

285
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,340
Please share that in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.

286
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,330
Take care.
