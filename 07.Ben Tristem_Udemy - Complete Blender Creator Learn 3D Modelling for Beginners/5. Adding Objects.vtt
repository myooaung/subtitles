00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.850
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.370
In this lecture we're going to take a really quick look at adding objects to our scene.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.150
Now in front of us are default scene.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.130
We have a camera.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.930
Objects.

6
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.740
If I go ahead and select that now we have a cube object.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
And we also have a lamp or light object.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.790
Now all of these have a position in our 3D world and that position is governed by this little orange

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.570
dots that all three have in the lamp in the cube.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.130
It's in the center of them.

11
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.610
And for the camera it's where the camera comes to a point.

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.160
If we just move around slightly we can see who's got it there.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.710
Now we won't just cover adding objects.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.920
We're going to cover deleting them.

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.800
So let's go ahead and delete all default cube.

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.440
I'm going to select it and I'm going to go X to delete when you press the X key we get confirmation

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.280
come up and then we can go ahead and delete.

18
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.030
That's objects.

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.630
Now what we can do straightaway is go ahead and add a different object.

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.670
So we've got rid of our default cube.

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.740
We can go up to the Add menu at the top here go to mash and add a cube back in.

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.360
But now let's add something else.

23
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120
Let's add in a U V sphere.

24
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.650
So we've got a ball in our scene now.

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.780
You can also see what's in your scene by going over to the outline.

26
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.600
If we go ahead and I'm going to widen this up a little and let's have a look by clicking this is an

27
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.500
arrow here we get a dropdown we've got camera.

28
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.370
And if we left click here you can see not only is it selected in the outline which can be a little bit

29
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.180
difficult to see the orange circle behind the objects but also it's selected in the 3D view and the

30
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.730
same is true with the light and the sphere.

31
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.480
And these are ordered by their name.

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.740
Now the question is why did that sphere appear in the center of the world.

33
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.820
Well objects will appear wherever the 3d cursor is placed.

34
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.550
Now if we have a look on the tool shelf on the left hand side if it's not there press the T key to make

35
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.700
it appear and we've got this little thing that looks like a target this red and white circle with crosshairs

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.120
in the middle.

37
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.970
If we go ahead and click that's if you make sure that surface projects has a tick in it we can click

38
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.150
on our sphere and if we zoom in and I'm going to just pan down ever so slightly.

39
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.600
We see that this cursor is now snapped to the surface of our cube.

40
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.200
Hey guys.

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.020
Mark here with a little update for you you might have noticed that if you've got your screen like mine

42
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.160
if I just press the TKD to bring back my side panel that you'll notice that you don't actually have

43
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.900
a head about tops when you actually go to select your cursor up in the top left corner here.

44
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.350
You can't actually select surface project you go to the right side of your window.

45
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.070
You might have this little drop down arrow at the top right corner.

46
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.470
If you click that it could reappear and you'll have all your buttons back at the top.

47
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.070
Alternatively you cast your eyes over to the right of my screen you'll notice the wrench and a screwdriver

48
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.630
icon also has surface project and the cursor icon with all of the options here as well.

49
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.200
With that in mind.

50
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.530
Back over to Mike.

51
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.870
And now if we go ahead and go add mash and let's go to a cube it will add it with the center of the

52
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.870
object where the 3d cursor is.

53
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.410
Now whilst you've added something in the lower left you'll see something that says add cube if we do

54
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.000
anything else to the cube that will disappear and change to something else.

55
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640
This is the operator panel.

56
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.530
If we go ahead and open that up we've got an option.

57
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.370
And this is the one time option to edit.

58
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.730
That's primitive.

59
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.640
Now with a cube that doesn't matter too much because a cube is a cube is a cube but we can change its

60
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.730
size but if we go ahead and click on the edge of the cube here and go to add something else I'll a bit

61
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.780
more complex like a U V sphere again we see that we've got an option here to adjust how many segments

62
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.450
how many rings its radius and loads of other pre-determined options as well.

63
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.550
I'm going to make this a very very low low polygon sphere and as we can see is very low at the moment

64
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.940
I'm going to make it just a tiny bit smaller as well.

65
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.520
Now if you're clicking and dragging in these fields what you can do is hold down the shift key to really

66
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.860
slow down so you're not jumping all over the place and trying to really find assets you can hold down

67
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.420
shift and that will slow down how rapidly these values change.

68
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.950
So we've now got a couple of objects added to a scene and we can see in the outline that we've got a

69
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.590
series of spheres and a cube now sphere and Sphere 001 aren't great names we can rename streets in here

70
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.410
and type in the name.

71
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.730
So I call cool this one low poly sphere.

72
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.660
Now it is important to name things as you go.

73
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.850
Now you'll notice that underneath it also got renamed and that's because we're in the object data properties

74
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.340
and we have a closer look at that area in the future.

75
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.540
So the final thing I want to show you is having precise control over this 3d cursor at the moment we

76
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.300
can click on a surface of an object and it will place things there but it might be worthwhile generating

77
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.910
our objects in a very precise location in order to do that we'd need to position that 3d cursor more

78
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.590
precisely and that's true.

79
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.140
Let's say if we wanted another lamp in our scene we can't just click anywhere and it automatically go

80
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.780
to the right place because there's no surface for this 3d cursor to go to.

81
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.370
So if I go ahead and open up the 3D Ed properties panel by even go into the little arrow next to the

82
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.980
3D symbol or pressing the end key we will go into this one lots in the course.

83
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.070
And if I scroll down we've got an option for the 3D cursors position and here you can type in some world

84
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.080
coordinates.

85
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:08.300
So if I wanted to position a lamp directly above this object I would have an x location of 0 a y location

86
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.070
of 0.

87
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.820
And here we can see maybe an as Z location of three and then we can go to the ad menu or use the shortcuts

88
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.730
and go to light and we've got a couple of different types of lights but I'm going to add a point light

89
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.820
again just like the one we've got at the top here.

90
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.820
We'll cover lights and lamps in much more detail later on.

91
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.250
And there we go we may think that the other lamp is now redundant.

92
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.120
So in order to select it we're going to have to go back over to our tool shelf and I'm going to click

93
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.880
over so we're selecting items again.

94
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.440
And then I can select my lamp.

95
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.220
Press x to delete and off we go.

96
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.040
Okay everybody I've got a real quick challenge for you.

97
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.250
Just so we can practice what we've just learned.

98
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:59.940
I'd like you to load up the default scene delete the Cuban light from the scene and add in a U V sphere

99
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.990
and another light put it in a different place if you like but it has to be away and somewhere floating

100
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.340
in space like we've done with this one here pause video now and give that's a go

101
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.130
Hello everybody and welcome back.

102
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.960
Let's go ahead and do this real quick challenge something to open up our the false scene.

103
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.230
I'm going to delete my lamp.

104
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.250
I'm going to delete my cube.

105
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.200
Now the 3-D cursor is already in the middle of the scene so I can go ahead and add in my u v sphere

106
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.000
straight away.

107
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.720
Now for the 3d cursor for the lights needs to be placed in a certain position.

108
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.100
And we haven't taught you how to move things yet.

109
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.040
Well I can do here is set my 3-D cursor.

110
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.080
I'm going to lift it up and I'm going to move it out and across ever so slightly.

111
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.140
It's roughly the same as it was before.

112
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.630
I'm going to add in the type of light that point lights.

113
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.380
And there we go.

114
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.530
My scene has been recreated but this time with a goofy sphere.

115
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.100
OK so there we go.

116
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:06.120
Everybody well done for performing this very simple challenge but very important challenge.

117
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.580
These are some of the fundamental skills that you're going to be using again and again in blender and

118
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.600
it won't be long before you're generating some really amazing models from just using these basic skills.

119
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.430
But until then I'll see you in the next lecture.
