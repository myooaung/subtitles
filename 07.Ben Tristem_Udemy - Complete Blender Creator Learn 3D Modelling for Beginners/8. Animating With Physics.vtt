00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.810
Welcome to animating with physics so animating physics were one thing to remember is blender actually

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.660
allows you to annamay Almost everything.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.190
Now moving of animation she usually thinking about just moving something.

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:22.380
But we can use this feature of blender to toggle whether we are in control of I.e. we were running an

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.350
animation moving something let's say or the physics engine itself is in charge of the mesh.

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.980
Now Blender's physics engine is great it will remember what has just happened in the animation.

7
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.030
So if it was travelling at a certain speed it will continue travelling that certain speed.

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.280
But then with physics applied to it and we're also going to have a quick peek at the graph Ed and that

9
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.140
will become apparent why we need to do that as soon as we hop on over in a blender.

10
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.740
Okay so we're over in blender and the first thing we need to do here is set the scene so I'm going to

11
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.390
add a plane.

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.670
So we've got a ground and scale that up by now them a large number.

13
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.100
So well actually that's very large.

14
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380
Never mind that will do.

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.260
And I'm going to immediately apply a rigid body physics to the ground and make it passive.

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.570
I'm going to lift the cube out to the ground he says having grap the wrong thing.

17
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.410
There we go.

18
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.500
Let's move it on the z axis so GZ one lift it up and I'm going to duplicate that so there's the extra

19
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.520
cube and I'm going to move that new one.

20
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.560
G Why.

21
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.500
I don't know three.

22
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.900
There we go.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.980
So they are separate.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.550
So we've got two cubes here and I'm going to add a rigid body to both of them.

25
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730
So we're ready to go.

26
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.970
Now the the thing to bear in mind here is this little check box when we're dealing with an active rigid

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.720
body there's a little tick box that tells the blender basically whether or not it's animated or not.

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.950
And that's the thing that we can toggle with a key frame.

29
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.150
So first of all let's let's set up a key frame for both of these.

30
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.760
In the starting location now there is a couple of ways of doing this and I'm going to open up the properties

31
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.540
panel and using the Iki to insert a key frame.

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.580
I'm going to hover over the area.

33
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.460
I want to key in and we will see a yellow bar appear here.

34
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.460
So let's go ahead and do that so I've got this cube here selected.

35
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.510
I'm going to press I and we can see a little yellow bar.

36
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.940
So if I move that has appeared which means that it has remembered exactly where it is I'm going to do

37
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.900
the same to this cube here I'm going to hover over its location and press I.

38
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.670
Excellent.

39
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.320
So that's a great start.

40
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.050
We've keyed in the beginning position.

41
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.330
Now we need to move one of them by a certain amount of code to move them both to the same place.

42
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.520
First of all so I'm going to go to the side view in orthographic sides of the relined.

43
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.470
There we go.

44
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.800
Move them positive x and I'm going to turn snapping on so we can align them perfectly and then move

45
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.720
it along here and then up to about here.

46
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.060
He says having not locked in fully and I'm going to do the same to the other one here.

47
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.730
Okay.

48
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.940
Now I did fiddle about.

49
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.340
Fortunately I've not lost anything which is good.

50
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.690
I really should place the frame first because if you go over the top.

51
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.920
In fact I'm going to do it.

52
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.160
If you go over the top of a Already key framed it moves along some and the set this at 30 frames.

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.050
And we've got our cube up here.

54
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.780
Fortunately it seems to have remembered that it had been moved which is good.

55
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.490
So we're going to set it at 30 and we can see the no frame we're on both here in the 3D window and the

56
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.320
lower left and also down here as well on the timeline.

57
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.340
So I'm going to key in that one and are going to click again and key in the other one.

58
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.070
Okay so now both of them are keyed in and if we play the animation will see that it moves from one place

59
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.060
to the other.

60
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.930
No it doesn't.

61
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.290
So why doesn't it.

62
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.020
It's just behaving with physics at the moment because we have not said to animates it.

63
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.410
So now we've put a tick in the animated box.

64
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.850
We should find it moves from one place to another.

65
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.870
Our turns out here both the key frames are in the same position.

66
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.990
Okay so it didn't hold that.

67
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.660
Let's move that one and move this one.

68
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.740
Okay excellent.

69
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.700
Let's key in that.

70
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.190
And key in the other one hovering over and pressing eilerts to make sure it is working now.

71
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.400
Excellent.

72
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.110
So the one thing I want to do here is actually move one to the same place but in a lot shorter time

73
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.660
and then we can compare the two when we switch physics off.

74
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.420
So I'm going to go to where it is at 30.

75
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.200
But this time actually key in these figures earlier on say it's fifteens it's moved very quickly.

76
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.990
So when I go to frame 15.

77
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:05.400
I took notes of one of them there and this was five and six I believe six.

78
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.500
So this cube here is going to get to the end location a lot quicker than the other one and I'm going

79
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.600
to keep that in.

80
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.150
Now I need to remove what I've already keyed in.

81
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.160
So see we've got a she got a key frame applied here.

82
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.920
So that particular cue which would be a bit disastrous if we wanted the physics engine to take over.

83
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.360
But what we can do here is simply delete that particular one.

84
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.230
Now a couple of ways of doing that I'm going to switch over to the graph Ed in a second because one

85
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.080
of the problems if you look at half a cube are going to play the animation here see it move.

86
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.540
Notice that it's it's dampened at the end it's start slowing down.

87
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.230
And that is because of the graph Ed.

88
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.700
It's not linearly going between one place and another as she starts a little slower speeds up and then

89
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.110
slows back down again.

90
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.610
So I'm going to change this view this that's actually move this up so we can see more and more changes

91
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.340
view here to the graph ed.

92
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.980
So here we go.

93
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.530
We've got the cube that we've got selected.

94
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.340
And we can see that there's a slight S curve going through.

95
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.660
Now this is actually controlling how it's moving in the x and z z direction there.

96
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.680
And it's got no movement in the Y which is absolutely fine that is what's happening.

97
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.190
But here we have the actual points themselves.

98
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.430
And it's this this set over here the end ones that we don't want anymore.

99
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.820
So I'm going to right click on those.

100
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.060
The selection is just like it is normally.

101
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.820
And then hit the X and delete the key frames.

102
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.660
There we go.

103
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.790
That's that sorted.

104
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.200
The other thing I want to sort out whilst I'm in this graph editor and I'm going to play with anything

105
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.550
else but like a Bezier curve it has handles and we can change the type of handle and we can do that

106
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:58.170
by going to key as in the key frame itself and handle typing you can see the shortcut key.

107
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.650
Just like that Bezier curve is V.

108
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.220
And if I set it to a vector it will become straight it will tend to carry on rather than doing anything

109
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.790
else.

110
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.230
We can see it's actually changed the motion a little.

111
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.770
And going to go to the beginning one and also hit V.

112
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.160
Instead it is a vector.

113
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.880
In fact in this case because I want them all to be vectors and then a select everything hit v m vector.

114
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.280
There we go is moving along and select the other square and do exactly the same.

115
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.250
Some GLA select all and hit V and vector then they're just linearly moving between the two places.

116
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.950
Okay so now we've done that.

117
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.620
The next thing we need to do is make this toggle switch here where it says whether it's animated or

118
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.790
not because of we turn it off.

119
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.270
It behaves with the physics engine and was it's on.

120
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.900
It just follows whatever path we've had set for it.

121
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.260
So I'm going to go back to the timeline view.

122
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:59.250
A bit less cluttered and what we need to do here is go to the beginning frame and where it says animated.

123
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.650
I'm going to press I over the top of that and we can see it's gone yellow and will select the other

124
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.190
Q And press I so it's animated.

125
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.350
And now I just need to work out which cube is which some scanner play for the animation so this is the

126
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.130
one that reaches there first and it's the one we've got selected.

127
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:24.350
And so at frame 15 as it reaches there we can see it frame 15.

128
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.080
It literally stops at its final resting place.

129
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.810
But at that point we can actually turn off animation song and change it so that we've toggled animated

130
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.020
off and hit the Iki.

131
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.560
And what we should find now is when we play the animation it will remember its velocity an arc away.

132
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.320
Excellent.

133
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.440
Now this other one is going to is different place which is fair enough but those are going to the same

134
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.140
place but it's getting there at a different speed.

135
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.730
So we should see a difference between these two in terms of how high they go and how far they go when

136
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.930
they hit the ground.

137
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:03.760
So let's go ahead and it's at frame 30 I believe if I selected so I can see the little yellow blob brain

138
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.460
thring 30 that's fine.

139
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:11.170
And that toggle animated and press the key to keep that in.

140
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.020
Now when I make the animation itself just a little bit longer.

141
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.190
And let's see what happens when we play that.

142
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.470
So let's go to it and a.

143
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.480
And let the animation start it fresh rather than waiting it to go.

144
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.030
So this one's got a lot more initial velocity than this one so goes further even though they go to the

145
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.810
same point.

146
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.970
So it's remembering where it was before and we can make that even more extreme.

147
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.640
We can go back so this one that's going further go ensue.

148
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:47.210
The graph Ed again where we've had this before and I'm going to use border selects like we've done 3D

149
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.840
Ed and select those three they're using the geeky amulets you going to move it back.

150
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.940
So this is going to make it move a lot lot faster because it's going to get to that.

151
00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.390
Oh I wasn't planning on it going that fast.

152
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.360
There you go it's flying away.

153
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.150
So.

154
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.690
Wow okay.

155
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.850
So let's maybe move that down to 10.

156
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.390
Which is still significantly faster than 15.

157
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.110
So that's drop it up a little.

158
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.930
And there we go.

159
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.730
So that just shows you though go into the same position but completely different times and they go a

160
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.680
lot further or can cango a lot further they're brilliant.

161
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.860
Okay so we've learned a little bit there.

162
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.370
And if these were to come into contact with any other bodies that have physics applied they're going

163
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:37.820
to interact with them which is really really useful because that's going to be a good bit of the challenge

164
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.560
for you.

165
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:46.660
Okay I'd like you to go and throw a primitive at the wall that we've created so annamay any primitive

166
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.070
you light towards the wall itself.

167
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.130
Switch the physics engine before impact and let the physics engine just do the rest and see what happens.

168
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.770
Now do remember to experiment and have fun.

169
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.300
I certainly have when I've been trying this out.

170
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.880
Don't be put off if you throw something at the wall it doesn't go through it.

171
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.940
Think why isn't it going through that wall.

172
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:15.100
What would what would make it go through the wall would one make it knock the wall over a bit better.

173
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.060
Does it need to be heavier.

174
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.690
Does it need to be moving faster.

175
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.610
These two things are very important.

176
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.320
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

177
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.830
But now is time to pause the video.

178
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.580
Have some fun and give it a go.

179
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.950
Okay guys welcome back.

180
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.330
Let's go through a primitive at the wall.

181
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:41.360
Okay so we've opened up a V wall here that we've been working on and I need a place something to go

182
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.450
and impact it's all going to go over here and add ourselves all lots of choices of primitives which

183
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.250
one shall I pick a cone see if it can force its way through the wall.

184
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.790
I'm going to rotate it.

185
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.760
I think 90 degrees on the x axis Yeah.

186
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.710
And I'm going to lift it up.

187
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.270
Ever since flying business off the ground is of five blending units Six okay.

188
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.150
That should be fine.

189
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.980
I'm just going to literally fire it straight.

190
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.240
Just going to flip around from one side to the other.

191
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.070
So it's going to impact slot slots there on the wall.

192
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.290
So I'm going to move it forward ever so slightly an up ever so slightly.

193
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.640
But let's key in its current position.

194
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.390
First of all so let's go to frame zero.

195
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.570
Let's go to the beginning of the animation frame one in this case and key in its current location.

196
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.310
Excellent.

197
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.700
Let's go ahead and move it all.

198
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.760
Let's go to frame 10 let's say and move it forward a couple of blender units and maybe up 1.

199
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.620
Excellent.

200
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:46.940
Let's keep that in and let's make sure that is running on a lesson the keys here or the the frame sorry

201
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.260
to 50 in total just so it can loop quickly there's our wall.

202
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.620
Let's play that and just make sure it's moving it is moving that's fine.

203
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.350
We still got that brick falling off.

204
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.910
Let's give it a rigid body then it's going to flock to the ground which is fine.

205
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.110
We're going to tell it is animated.

206
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.690
And it should move.

207
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.120
Excellent.

208
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.870
And we just need to tell it went to forget the animation now so let's go to the very beginning and say

209
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.320
hey blender.

210
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.770
This is animated so we've keyed that in and let's go to the end of the animation and key it.

211
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:24.360
But this time with it toggled off okay here's the moment of truth.

212
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.130
Let's fire that's at the wall.

213
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.370
Oh no.

214
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.940
What.

215
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.300
What's a flop.

216
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:36.150
Okay so this is relatively straightforward to fix because we just need to move the two closer together

217
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.700
until we get the desired results or the switch to the graph.

218
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:45.030
Ed I'm going to make all of those of vector like we've done before and I'm just going to use and could

219
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.360
select everything in using border so let's build a make this bigger so I can select things than with

220
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.030
select those nodes there and literally just shift them all back at once.

221
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.360
So I try that again I mis clicked on it.

222
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.530
There we go.

223
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.670
Okay so we got those go g and just move them back slightly.

224
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.030
I need a lock these to an axis it's the x axis here.

225
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.370
I'm going to make its five frames and play that and see what happens.

226
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:21.110
How Okay so it's going to have to be less Let's move them all let's just do one frame and see what happens.

227
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:28.990
I've gone too far back haven't I solist just undo that G x and go back to frame.

228
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.080
That's the right one.

229
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.610
Let's see if that works.

230
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.910
Okay so that's not actually working that's all doing the desired result so the other thing we can do

231
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.910
here is just get it to move a bit further.

232
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:46.510
In that tight time frame itself so this time let's go back to the time line itself will stop it from

233
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:52.600
running Let's go to that place where we keyed in the movement which is frame 10 but instead of it having

234
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.060
this position let's literally just shift it further forward and key in that new position.

235
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.710
Now was there.

236
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.940
Wish the would be some sort of active thing to say that you've keep that in or might come up in the

237
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.780
console that is possible in all of this junk up here.

238
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.270
But I don't think it is.

239
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.240
By the looks of it.

240
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.760
So no not there.

241
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.790
Let's see if we can run this animation.

242
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.330
Haha and it hits the wall and does almost nothing.

243
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.140
How about that.

244
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.060
So why is it doing almost nothing.

245
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.370
Well it weighs a kilo and the what the wall weighs a lot lot more.

246
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.730
So let's make it heavier let's make it 50 kg and see what happens then.

247
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.310
Excellent.

248
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.590
So that's bust the hole straight through the wall.

249
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.780
Let's make it five tons that's make it five thousand kilos to see what happens.

250
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.510
So there we go.

251
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.840
Not that much different actually it seems to be busting through the wall before doing anything else

252
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.080
X and suddenly at 50 that seems to have a good effect.

253
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.810
Then we go to the camera view here.

254
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:58.280
Let's make my 3-d windage the little bit on the bigger side so see what's going on.

255
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:03.370
And in fact in this case and on the move the camera out that's in completely the wrong place.

256
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:10.220
Any way to capture anything cool and rotate it around and we've got all of this brick work flying out

257
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.530
perfect that looks brilliant.

258
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.000
How did you guys get on.

259
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.200
Did you disintegrate your wall in a similar manner to me or did you come up with something more inventive.

260
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.150
Please share your work in the discussions over on the forum and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
