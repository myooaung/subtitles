00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.220
And this lecture, I'm going to take a moment, just a rematch.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.860
My animals, so we don't have as many pulleys and set up a very simple Three-Point lighting system and

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.450
position our camera so that we can start doing test renders when we add our fur.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.130
We know we're at the right distance in relation to where we're going to have our final render of our

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.460
animal.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.260
First thing, I'm gonna get my model ready and not to be too high poly to do that.

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.180
I will click on my cat and then jump up to the or over to the sculpt mode in sculpt mode.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.290
I'm going to when it decides to get in Scotland.

9
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.580
There we go on a scroll along.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.400
Turn off Duyen Topo, click on Ramesh.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.200
It's getting a bit slow at the moment.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.040
Here we go.

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.170
Remeasured Point 04.

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.220
I'll start with that and a smooth normal's and click on Ramesh.

15
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.510
Now, if I have a look at how many faces I've got, it's gone from one point three million down to 44000.

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.290
That's much better.

17
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.190
This can be a little bit odd affecting that of wonkiness around the ear, which are, to be honest.

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.980
That's kind of cool in a way.

19
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.250
Not not what I wanted, but cool in a way, because cats, if they get in fights, they often get those

20
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.010
bites on the years and scratchy years.

21
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.820
So I asked me that out later on.

22
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.700
But for now, I'm just going to focus on what looks good with hair.

23
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.860
And if it doesn't look good with hair, I'll make the change.

24
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.840
But now it's okay.

25
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.220
Lost a little bit of detail on the face, but that's okay as well.

26
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.190
We can go and paint some things later on if we need to.

27
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.630
Just a note that I'll be focusing on a solid Calicut.

28
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.480
I had my heart set on working on a black cat, but as I've been prototyping this, it's a little bit

29
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.120
hard to see on screen for you watching.

30
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.590
So I might end up, rather than doing everything black and white, end up doing a bit of a ginger ninja

31
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.370
as my cat.

32
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.840
I think that could be a bit of fun.

33
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.570
In the next couple of videos, we'll be focusing on particle systems.

34
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.180
I'll probably be adding one particle system for the body, maybe a separate for the FT.

35
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.930
I'm not sure yet.

36
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720
My feet are going to be hopefully covered in grass or my cat's feet are.

37
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.350
So I'm not gonna worry about them too much.

38
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.120
Getting them perfect.

39
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.910
I'll have another particle system for the head and then another particle system for whiskers.

40
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.650
Now I'm gonna be making mine a solid color.

41
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.280
I was gonna do a black cat, but prototyping that, it's really hard to see on screen.

42
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.890
So I think I might end up making myself a little bit of a ginger ninja running through the grass.

43
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.760
We'll see how that goes.

44
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.520
If you wanted to make yours your animal to have patches or stripes or patterns, then I'd recommend

45
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.550
going about the process of doing some vertex painting to indicate the areas and then to white paint

46
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.860
and to have the particular particle system, the colored particle system, grow out of where you've

47
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.730
painted the white.

48
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.730
So we practice that when we went through the human head.

49
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.470
And at this point I'm just going to make my cat the one solid color so I don't need to diddle around

50
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.580
with all the different shapes.

51
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.950
But you totally now have the technique and the knowledge to do that.

52
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.200
If you wanted to put that extra detail into yours.

53
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.790
Okay.

54
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.220
So we've re meshed our cat now and has set up some lights already.

55
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.660
Got one light in the scene.

56
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.670
Make sure that I mean object mode.

57
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.700
Click on my life.

58
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.670
Make sure it's visible.

59
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.320
What I'm going to do is change this to be a sun.

60
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.770
So click on the light bulb, change it to sun.

61
00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.450
I'll jump around to look at where the light's pointed, actually hoping a top view and I'll go throw

62
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.090
for a three point lighting system here where I've got my main key light at the front.

63
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.460
I'll have it from the front where I'm going to have my camera pointed to a bit of rotating of these.

64
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.230
Just make sure is not pointing down too low.

65
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.840
Yep.

66
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.420
Pointing up a little bit higher.

67
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.860
Okay.

68
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.160
It's gonna be super bright.

69
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.900
So I'm gonna put that down to three.

70
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
Let's just hop over into a rendering mode so we can see how that starting to look.

71
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.550
Excellent.

72
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.540
Back in the top view.

73
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.690
I'm going to rename my line at this point to be the key light.

74
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.280
I will shift D.

75
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.950
Move that over and this will be my fill light.

76
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.670
Reminds me I forgot my shortcut keys again.

77
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.400
Apologies for that.

78
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.260
I'll start those in case you're wondering.

79
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.910
And so I'm going to turn the value of this, which will be my fill light fill.

80
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.030
I'll turn this down to about one.

81
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.350
Doesn't need to be quite as strong.

82
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.400
Just to make sure that we're filling the other side of our objects.

83
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.420
So we've got a broad light over this side.

84
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.280
Less bright light over that side.

85
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.780
Shift D around back from.

86
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.130
It's going to be back left shoulder.

87
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.870
I'll put it rotate this one.

88
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.560
I will rename to be the Rim Light which will be projected from behind our object.

89
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.570
Then I'll put this up to three as well.

90
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.770
Actually I put this over the Right-Hand side because I think I'd like to have the sun coming from this

91
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.470
side and our camera coming from that side.

92
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.580
So a value of three.

93
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.020
I leave it all white for now.

94
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.400
We'll play around with that little bit later on.

95
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.210
What I do want to do next is to get a camera.

96
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.960
So as I'm rendering out my different ideas, I can see exactly how it's going to look through the camera.

97
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.170
That I think might be the final pose that my cat probably a little bit off center.

98
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.290
But for now, I'll render it in the middle, mostly going for the angle the size, so that when I'm

99
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.090
working on my fur, I can see how it's gonna look for a particular distance because I find the hair

100
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.600
particles.

101
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.260
If you really close, it looks very different.

102
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.420
If you're way back here.

103
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.940
So we don't want to go and be finessing it up close if that's not how we're gonna do our final render.

104
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.040
So probably have a roundabout here on to see all these pores differentiated or make sure that kind of

105
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.590
looks like the cat's walking past the camera and they'll hit control Old Zero on the numpad.

106
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
That's pretty good for my camera.

107
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.560
That should be locked in place.

108
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.480
Even if I move around, turn the camera on, let's do a test render hit F twelve and there it is.

109
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.120
That's the view that I want to see.

110
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.590
Perfect.

111
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.850
Okay, so I've got things the way I want them to look.

112
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.750
I'm going to give you a challenge here, which is to set up your lights and your camera, set up a quick

113
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.720
three point lighting layout as I've done.

114
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.020
Position your camera to where you think the final render will be and do a test render when you're ready.

115
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.920
We'll jump into the next video and we'll stop playing around with our animal fur.

116
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.030
I'll see you in the next lecture.
