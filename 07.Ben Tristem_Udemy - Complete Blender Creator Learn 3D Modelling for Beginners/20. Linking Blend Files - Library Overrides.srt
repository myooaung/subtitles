00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,230
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,910
In this lecture we're going to talk about library overrides and as you can see at the top there I've

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,700
made it very clear this is an experimental feature.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,810
It's still in the process of being built.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,560
Now is the new version essentially of proxies.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,920
But it comes with a few bugs some secret ones where you go and scratch your head but essentially think

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,350
of them as the modern version of proxies.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,320
They come with some extra features which is really useful.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,930
And of course because it's experimental I'm really just going to go over it briefly at the moment until

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,880
it really becomes the way of doing things independent overrides to the same linked data that's useful

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,340
because you may want to say change the material on your linked data on one of the particular instances

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,540
of your object.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,370
And on the other one you don't.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,590
Well this will enable you to do such a thing adding independent modifiers.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,680
That's really useful being able to subdivide something or not and not having to worry about whether

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,480
it was done in the source file making a library override of a library override.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,060
So this is like nesting so if you have a scene in which you have a proxy you cannot create a I won't

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,360
say new thing you cannot create a new blend file linking to that scene blend file that has a proxy in

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,660
it.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,570
That won't work.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,040
However if it has a library override you can chain together multiple blend files.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,300
Obviously the more you have in this chain the more potentially unstable your project is.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,190
One change could break the law a corrupt blend file could could end up destroying something.

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,920
So we need to be careful when you go ahead and make library over and overrides of library overrides.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,360
But enough of talking about it let's hop on over its blender and look at the library overrides

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,500
OK.

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,960
So now we're over in Blender way in our proxy church scene at the moment.

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,990
And I want to demonstrate that essentially it's exactly the same as we were working on before we've

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:19,350
already linked things in so we could just destroy the building that we've created so far.

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,000
Get rid of all these pieces and there we go.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,920
We've got an empty building collection but we still have our linked files so let's bring those back.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,490
So linking is the first step and we've made a proxy.

33
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,320
However what we can do instead is go to the object itself and then in the Object data properties what

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,880
we can do if we go over the chain link icon that we have here we can make that local by just clicking.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,160
And there we go we've got no linked icon at all.

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,360
But we've broken that link and we don't want to do that we want to make sure it's able to be updated.

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,670
So I'm just going to undo that.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,390
But you can see the other option here is to shift click to create a library override.

39
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,940
Now every time I've tried to do this it doesn't actually work unfortunately doesn't do anything at all.

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,080
This is likely to change in the future.

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,790
And again the warning at the beginning this is experimental some things that work as you would expect

42
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,200
them to.

43
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:23,180
But just the same as proxy you can go to objects relations and make a library override when we do that.

44
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,130
We see that we've got the chain link icon again but this time with an arrow through it and like the

45
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,850
proxies we can now move things around which is really really useful and that means that we can start

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,690
doing the same to the other objects here.

47
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,660
Let's go in and make a library override.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,370
I'm just going to do it to the other couple here and there we go we've overridden the library links

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,880
there.

50
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,080
Now much the same as before we can then come in and if you go Alton de to make a duplicate of that window

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,740
to use it elsewhere you may think initially oh it looks like if we go ahead and pop it there.

52
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,720
Oh if I just remove the duplicate Yes I did.

53
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,430
OK so we duplicate it and let's just move out here.

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,230
Look we've broken the link.

55
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,830
Oh but it's not made it local because we cannot edit it so even though it's a unique object in our scene

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:26,370
with the new Object data if we go to our mesh we can see that it's still linked data and the same would

57
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,130
be true of the material as well.

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,480
So we can build things up.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,170
Now I'm not going to challenge you the same as the last lecture because you're just going to end up

60
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,770
building the same thing again which is just a bit silly.

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,210
However this is your library overrides in a nutshell.

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,690
But one of the final things I want to show to you is that if we go ahead and save this file and go into

63
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:57,000
a new file but then try and link let's go into our links come out of here completely.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,460
If we go into arch proxy or proxy church and go to our objects we can see our objects are here.

65
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,600
We can bring them into our scene.

66
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,060
We can't move them just as normal.

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,080
And if we look at the outline there we can see it's the linked file will 0 0 1.

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,460
However if we now go to objects and go to relations we can make a library override again.

69
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,720
How useful is that.

70
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,630
And then we're back to the stage where we can start moving things around that's really cool that we're

71
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,480
able to nest things like that where possible.

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
But remember a chain of these things may break.

73
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,730
Blender.

74
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,640
Now I've just discovered something as well.

75
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,150
Oh blender crash there.

76
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,060
So let's go ahead bring back where I was before and that's not unexpected of course because I'm dealing

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,970
with experimental stuff is bound to happen.

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,910
So where where we proxy church we went to an object doesn't matter which one let's go to our archway

79
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,190
bricks we can see it's linked we cannot move it around.

80
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,880
So what I was going to show you is that if we go into the object data properties and you know are saying

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,480
shift in click of that doesn't seem to do anything.

82
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,390
It doesn't.

83
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,190
However what you can do to realize this this is.

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,020
I read the instructions they don't work.

85
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:20,640
If you click it once it makes it a library override if you click it again then it will make it local.

86
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,250
So it's going to undo one of those.

87
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,210
And there we go.

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,170
Blender has crashed again.

89
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,530
Okay.

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,850
So I think I will leave it there for the moment.

91
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,700
As you can see it's still just a little bit unstable.

92
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,120
Hopefully that will all be sorted out over the coming months and we'll become much more stable.

93
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,360
Okay.

94
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,200
So that leaves us with a choice as to whether to use proxies which is the old way of doing things or

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,620
to do the library overrides I think personally I'll probably use proxies until I know that library overrides

96
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,320
won't crash when I undo that's that that's something I rely on the Undo key.

97
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,740
So yeah I don't want to risk a project like that.

98
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,320
However if you just going and testing try out library overrides and when you think you've got a stable

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,200
copy give us a share in the discussion so everybody knows that it's now stabilized and then perhaps

100
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,430
I can come back and refresh this video with working versions of library overrides and I'll see you all

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,630
in the next lecture.
