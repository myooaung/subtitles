00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.200
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where all we can to learn about constraint.

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.780
That's why our bones have gone green.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.040
If we go ahead here and grab the top arm we can see that it's constrained it won't go any further than

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.220
the top here heavy drag it down it won't go any further than that even if we try and even better if

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.100
we highlight the bottom one and trauma rotate that round we see that it is locked to that axis as well

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.840
which is really useful but not only that the top one follows with it.

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.290
Now these can be a little tricky to get your head round at first but let's dive into blender and find

8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.170
out more okay everybody welcome back.

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.740
So let's first of all my car work just a little bit easier by giving ourselves some more information

10
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.550
that we don't currently have.

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.030
If we make sure that we're impose mode or certainly just looking at our armature itself so we can go

12
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.530
to the armature properties.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.200
If we scroll down that are viewport display that we've played with before what we need to do is put

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.410
a tick in the axis checkbox.

15
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.330
When we've done that we get some information that we couldn't see before.

16
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.830
Now you will notice that that doesn't necessarily align with the world axes and that can cause some

17
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.850
confusion.

18
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.460
But we've got options for that when we have a look at the constraints.

19
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.900
Let's go back into pose mode so we can start moving the bones around once we've done that again over

20
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.490
on the properties panel if we scroll down.

21
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.970
We've got an option here to constrain the bones themselves.

22
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.610
There is another one further up that's just object constraints but we don't want that.

23
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.700
We want the one with the little icon of the bone going through it.

24
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440
Now it would be good at this point to select the object that we want to add are bone constraints to

25
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700
only the bone that we once added to.

26
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.840
And we've got two bones that we can start playing with.

27
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.870
Now if we had a bone constraint there are a ton of different options as you can see here.

28
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.410
We might use some other ones of these later on it be quite awesome if we had the lamp tracking something

29
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.880
across the scene and we can do that with these type of constraints.

30
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.270
Now what we can do here is limit its rotation.

31
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
That's what we're really focused on.

32
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.670
We want it to be able to move.

33
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.280
So that's important but we want it to be constrained on how far it can actually rotate.

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.760
So if we go to limit rotation we can see there that the bone goes green.

35
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.160
Now we can limit x y and z so we can rotate it and limits in those three axes.

36
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.150
However this is being converted from world space at the moment.

37
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.360
So if we go ahead and limit the X it will fall flat on its side.

38
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.070
But if we increase let's just make this area here a bit larger so we can see it's as M. Max if we increase

39
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.760
the maximum all the way up and beyond 90 you'll see that it was actually facing up this way.

40
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.790
But the constraint itself said nope you cannot do that.

41
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.040
And forces the bone to lay flat.

42
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.570
So this is really confusing at first because this would mean you'd have to have a limit of a minimum

43
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.390
the maximum of 90 to stop it flopping around.

44
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.120
And if we pressed the Aki twice we can still see it's got some degrees of freedom on other axes.

45
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.090
So again you can limit it on the y axis.

46
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.450
The interesting here is it doesn't flop over which is quite useful.

47
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.390
And now if we try and rotate it spins around freely on the world or the global z axis.

48
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.780
And you may want to constrain that you may want to say that you want it minus ninety two plus 90 and

49
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.970
then when we try and rotate it it will go one way and then another.

50
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.910
But interestingly when you try and use your axes locks you have to use the bone axes lock so you have

51
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.590
to press Y here to lock it into position and you can see there it won't go any further either way.

52
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.210
And that's the sort of movement that we want.

53
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.990
However it would be much much better if we were working with the bones axes themselves rather than the

54
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.120
world ones because you're going to end up with bones that don't line up with the world at all like this

55
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.600
one here world is going to start to become very confusing when the axes are not aligned.

56
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.070
So what we can do is instead of using world space we've got a couple of other options.

57
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.260
I'm going to skip over pose and local with parents and go straight to local space.

58
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.140
Course it's going to flop over at this point so let's remove our limits and think about them again.

59
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.960
So I'm going to set these back to zero even though they grayed out.

60
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.800
You can still work with them.

61
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.750
So let's have a look at our local axes for this particular bone.

62
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.690
We've got Y Z and X and I'd like you to think for a few moments which one do we need to constrain the

63
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.480
movement of okay.

64
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.000
If you said Why then you're correct.

65
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.640
So let's go ahead.

66
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.050
Let's limit X and limit Z.

67
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.420
We should find now that it will spin around freely and take the one above with us with it.

68
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.480
Excellent.

69
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.580
So we just need to now lock why as we did X before to minus 90 plus 90 assuming we want that 180 degree

70
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.910
movement that we can have.

71
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.110
Now you'll notice that we start ending up with our model flipping backwards and forwards if you try

72
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.450
and go too far.

73
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.190
That's a situation called Gimbel lock.

74
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.960
Hopefully we will avoid that during our animations is just something you need to watch out for.

75
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.830
Now the top one here poses an interesting challenge because we need to lock kids whilst at the same

76
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.290
time allowing it to move along with this bone and that is going to be your challenge.

77
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.550
Okay so your challenge apply constraints to the lower arm bone that we've created.

78
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.940
Make sure the stem bone can move the lower arm and make sure the limits are natural and reasonable so

79
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.280
we don't want a lamp that's too stiff.

80
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.320
Equally we want one that can hyper extend and look silly when we're working with it.

81
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.420
And then finally test the changes one at a time.

82
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.150
It's very easy to get carried away and put lots of ticks and lots of boxes has lots of values only to

83
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.780
find that it's not working as you expected it to.

84
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.340
So as you lock one of the axes check and make sure it's doing what you think it should be doing.

85
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:22.420
So go ahead polls of the year now and apply constraints to the lower arm bone okay everybody welcome

86
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.850
back.

87
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.150
Let's go ahead now hop on over to blender and apply these constraints Hello everybody and welcome back.

88
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.170
So let's go ahead and grab our lower arm bone add a constraint too and we're going to limit its rotation.

89
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.620
So looking at this we could just see if we can limited in its world space.

90
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.260
What would that be.

91
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.420
Well we want it moving in just the X space so limit X that seems to work.

92
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.520
And if we limit the others as well.

93
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.170
Well let's not do them all at once.

94
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.660
So we've already played with this a minimum of nought and a maximum of 90.

95
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.790
Okay.

96
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.050
Let's see what happens.

97
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.040
Brilliant.

98
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.780
So we can move that up and down as expected and of course it moves in other directions as well.

99
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.810
So if we just limit both of those for a moment and go aha there we go it's going up and down it's being

100
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.340
a bit jerky all over the place as we push it round and back into itself.

101
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.650
But if we select this lower one and start rotating there the top one does not follow suit.

102
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.890
So how do we sort this out.

103
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.040
Well again it's to do with the space that you're working in world space.

104
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.290
In this case is not just it's just not going to cut it.

105
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.560
So if we go back to local space we find that it will follow along with everything else that we're doing.

106
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.550
Perfect.

107
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.150
And we need to work on the numbers.

108
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.420
Okay.

109
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:49.600
So limiting it and in this particular case a little tip for you going into your track ball type rotation

110
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.630
when you press the Aki twice really does highlight problems or it rotating somewhere where you don't

111
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.830
want it.

112
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.000
So it seems at the moment its current position is zero.

113
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.730
We cannot get to any further back from that and then it's maximum is 90.

114
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.080
I think that's what's going on here.

115
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.420
So if I lower the minimum to maybe minus 45 does that then lay flat.

116
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.780
Yes it does.

117
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:20.080
And then if we do this one at forty five is the maximum perfect.

118
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.400
That goes all the way up to the top.

119
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.460
I don't want to extending any more than that and no more than that going back now you might say that's

120
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:34.660
a bit too hyper extended and would damage the mechanism so maybe around 35 one direction and minus 35.

121
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.520
The other something like that.

122
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.180
Let's try that minus 35.

123
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.350
Oh let's type in the right number minus 35 and the maximum of 35.

124
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.420
These don't have to be exactly opposites but they're that looks a lot more natural.

125
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.920
I do think that having it all the way output causes issues but there we go that's all sorted.

126
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920
Perfect.

127
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.130
How did you guys get L on applying your bone constraints to the bones themselves.

128
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:10.030
You will find that times that it can be a little bit picky but I do think that having these axes turned

129
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.150
on and working in the local space in this particular instance is going to save you lots of time and

130
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.610
effort trying to get everything working especially having your bones follow one another.

131
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.850
That's very important.

132
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.270
So that's it for this lecture please share your work over in the discussions share any quirkiness perhaps

133
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.640
something really amusing happened when you started linking things together and constraining them.

134
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.170
And I'll see you all over in the next lecture.
