00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,330
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,990
In this lecture we can set up some new constraints that will work with inverse Kana Mattox the original

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,210
constraints that we've set up are no longer working there.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,950
I don't think they're going to be much use for the rest of this project so we'll actually remove them

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,300
from here and then use some i k limits so that we can prevent the lamp looking like it's been squashed

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,480
into itself.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,410
It's horrible when things like this happen.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,220
Let's find out how to prevent it.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,870
Hello and welcome.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,650
Let's first of all turn back on my overlays so I can see what's going on.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,290
Now the constraints themselves that we've currently got on our bones.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,310
Let's go ahead and remove those.

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,180
So beforehand we were limiting their rotation because we were manually moving them.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,410
We don't want to do that that's going to be too costly in time to manage.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,350
So we've removed all of the bone constraints.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,870
The next thing we need to do is give it a different type of constraints and we can do that under the

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,750
bone settings because we've already started playing with this under the inverse can Mattox menu.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,590
If we go in here we've got we've locked it to stop it twisting through itself or twisting the wrong

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:14,790
way.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,850
But what we haven't done is prevented it from actually collapsing through itself.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,790
We've not given it some range of movement.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,790
The first thing I'm gonna do is set it back into rest position.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,360
So we're looking at it once again from the side.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,100
Most of this model is just two dimensional in terms of how it can move this top bit.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,190
However our lampshade can currently just spin around indefinitely and that's going to cause us a problem

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,770
as well we want to limit its rotation.

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,550
Either way as well.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,420
Let's whizz round to the side and let's focus on the upper arm.

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:57,130
At the moment we've got it being able to be rotated sort of 45 degrees one way and 45 degrees the other

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,060
of something like that.

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,420
That's what we picked.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,490
We go to our bone properties and scroll down.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,440
We can limit the X movement.

34
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,690
Notice that limit y and z is currently grayed out.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,320
It is currently grayed out simply because at the top here we've locked it.

36
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,080
If we open them all up suddenly they all appear.

37
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,250
Now we don't want one of them to move quite as freely.

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,820
You can add a bit of stiffness to it as well the stiffness will slow down its movement rather than having

39
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,530
it jerk all over the places.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,750
It's like a dampener.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,750
Let's have a look at limiting the X movement the moment you do that.

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,710
We've got this circle that appears and this is incredibly useful you can see straight away the range

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,540
of movement that you're going to have.

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,440
So if I wanted this to lean forward a little bit more perhaps to that point there we can see that's

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,720
around minus 42 so let's type in minus 40.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,910
And at the moment it's going to lean all the way back to there.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,630
Now let's think about how far we might want it to be able to move.

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,290
We probably want it to align not quite with this but not too far from it.

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,040
So at this point at 90 degrees it would have gone completely straight.

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,780
So let's make sure it can't do that and maybe set it to 75 degrees.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,440
Now what will happen is when we start moving this well we can't do it whilst we're in rest mode which

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,770
is no problem that's come out.

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,440
So who sets the constraints.

54
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,460
Now when we're moving it look about is preventing it from going in and through itself like it would've

55
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,110
done before it starts moving the bones underneath.

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,540
Now this is really critical to making sure that you don't set up a model that can go inside itself.

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,280
And of course this now needs to be repeated but with some of the other bones here as well and a great

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,930
chance to practice these skills in your challenge Okay then this should be a relatively straightforward

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,800
exercise.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,210
We are going to basically limits all of the other bones movements.

61
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,060
So whilst we're using the inverse can somatic system we cannot push the model through itself.

62
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,250
Pause the video now and give that a go

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,830
OK.

64
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,400
Everybody welcome back Let's hop into a blender and finish off limiting our bones.

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,910
OK.

66
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,020
So we've got one of the bones sorted I'm going to now work on the next bone down again I'm going to

67
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,840
pop it in the rest position so I can see what's going on.

68
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,990
Go to the bone properties limits it on x.

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm gonna go minus 40 and 40 the other way as well and just see what happens.

70
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,350
This is the key thing once you've done one of the settings I am going to highlight everything and just

71
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,810
clear the rotation and the movement now.

72
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,200
Excellent.

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,500
Now the rotation is clear.

74
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,730
Let's go ahead and move our lamp around.

75
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,270
Excellent.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,180
So it's not allowing it to go beyond light not quite 90 degrees which I think is a good thing to do

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,720
and it's not allowing these to push into one another and where we live leant back like this.

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,010
Yes that looks pretty reasonable in terms of its range of movements.

79
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,220
Okay.

80
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,210
Pretty good.

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,930
I'm gonna.

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,510
I think I'm going to conquer the lamp shade last this final one here.

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:24,560
We want to limit it on the y axis and I'm gonna set it to minus ninety to plus 90 that basically all

85
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,570
that was more than 90 was an X I match the keypad.

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,150
This is going to mean that as we use this control bone and the top and move it to look around it will

87
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,890
naturally move to a point and then it won't go any further.

88
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,050
But you do have to look at that it will flip around if we're not careful so you do have to be careful

89
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,680
of how you position your bones or your control bones as you're moving your model around this top one

90
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,170
this is going to take a few more constraints we'll start in the x axis.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,900
So let's go ahead and do that let's look at this from the side.

92
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,750
Here we go.

93
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,090
And I want to limit its movement quite significantly as it goes down.

94
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:12,920
So all X first let's move that up not too far from where it is at the moment.

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,510
Let's go ahead and test that

96
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:17,930
Kate.

97
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,710
This is going to be its minimum position so this is a good place to test this minimum limit.

98
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,370
There we go.

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,890
That's the minimum.

100
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,540
Allowing it to move in the x axis and then maximum all the way over here.

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,580
Let's just see what that looks like if we go ahead grab this and move it see there is.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,090
Yeah.

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,370
It might be touching a little bit there but I think that's okay.

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:52,600
And leaning back it can go all the way beyond look all the way up I think straight like that is fine.

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,420
But as you can see here it likes to move all the way around as well.

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,220
We start to get it being a bit funny in which direction it wants to face.

107
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,330
So let's have a look at our limits again.

108
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,980
Let's go ahead selects our bone.

109
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,740
I don't feel I'm going to have it go quite as far I think I can have it go in line.

110
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,450
So that's one of those that one of the things to watch out for here is which axes are you talking about.

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,030
If we have a look at the bones themselves the y axis is rotation.

112
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,860
So it's got no need to move on the y axis I'm going to move that out straight away.

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,020
However we do want to limits on Z and look a Val gives us a 3D dome that this can move around in.

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,450
Let's see if we need to do anything or whether we can have it look around as and when we want.

115
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,640
Let's have it move on the x axis backwards and forwards

116
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,210
Yeah I think that's pretty good.

117
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,580
Let's see what happens with this bone selected.

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,990
I don't think it looking right back on itself.

119
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,990
Maybe minus 18 to plus 80.

120
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,800
So it's got to a reasonable field of view at the frontier.

121
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,030
Yeah.

122
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,440
And that's much much better.

123
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,580
And then if it needs if the lamp itself needs to look at the ground it will look down like that.

124
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,180
That's really neat.

125
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,260
I'm liking how that's coming together.

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,100
It can be a bit picky and these settings that I've chosen aren't necessarily the right ones.

127
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,990
It's important to just experiment with your particular lamp because you're going to have slightly different

128
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,660
dimensions.

129
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,380
Arms at different angles.

130
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,540
You may even have completely different properties that mean you can't follow exactly along with my numbers

131
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,370
but that's fine.

132
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,190
What we have here is a pretty awesome setup.

133
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,290
Our lamps coming together really well.

134
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,100
Think it's time to start talking about animating this and we'll start that in the next lecture.
