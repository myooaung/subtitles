Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture we're going to have a look at creating another scene that
1

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,560
we can work on but can always go back to our original layout as well.
2

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,740
This is incredibly useful as as you progress through making various objects you will want to make variations
3

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,560
perhaps to experiment with something or indeed just to create a different scene and what you don't want
4

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,230
to have to do is save multiple blend files and you also don't want to have to keep resetting positions
5

6
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,840
and moving things around when it's complete.
6

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,820
It's just not necessary at all.
7

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,060
Okay.
8

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,830
So here we have our standard layout our starting layout
9

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,660
The one we've got currently and we're going to create a new scene called Smash in this case and we're
10

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,650
going to be able to set it up and we've moved the camera and everything so that when we have a look
11

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,530
at the final image it looks completely different to the original one.
12

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,050
Let's find out more.
13

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,630
Hello everybody and welcome back.
14

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,160
So in this scene what we have currently is a cube.
15

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,410
Let's go and add a bit more vibrancy to the scene by adding in maybe a cylinder and let's add in an
16

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,110
Ico sphere over here.
17

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,750
And then finally a cone over there.
18

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,120
So we've got a scene that has objects in it we may have already set up some various collections we can
19

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,210
do that now, I'm going to press M and I'm going to name this collection shapes of course.
20

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,830
So we've got the shapes collection that's inside this scene and the scene is called scene and we can
21

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,750
see that at the very top here.
22

23
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,210
If I click on that I can rename it to let's say defaults or perhaps shapes.
23

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,210
You know it's up to you how you decide to name your scenes and what naming conventions you've gone for.
24

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,010
Now say we wanted a different scene but with all of these assets that we'd already made as a couple
25

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,080
of ways of doing that we can create a new scene at the top here to the right of shapes.
26

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,170
We have an option to create new, copy settings, link objects, link objects data and a full copy.
27

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,900
The keyword there is a full copy.
28

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,570
So if we wanted absolutely everything in the scene we could just go full copy it would create a scene
29

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:11,590
called shapes 0 0 1 and we can call this bam or something else depending on what you're doing with the
30

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,220
scene.
31

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,070
And then we can move things around to our heart's content and we can switch backwards and forwards between
32

33
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,470
the scenes at the top here.
33

34
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,210
We can also in the outliner change the outliner's view type and at the top here, we can click on the display
34

35
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,520
mode we can select scenes and then we can also switch between the various scenes and we can also drill
35

36
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,740
in and down into the scene detail as well.
36

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,220
So that's an incredibly useful thing to be able to do when you have got multiple scenes around.
37

38
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,370
The other thing that we can do to change that that's a view layer is that we can copy individual ones
38

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,010
so if we've got another scene a new blank scene I'm going to call this one test copy.
39

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,470
We can go back to one of our previous scenes that say Bam here and select the ones that we want to move
40

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:08,860
go control and C to copy them and then go to our test copy, control and V to paste.
41

42
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,410
Now one thing I want to draw your attention to is that these are all distinct and unique objects.
42

43
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,930
If we move this cube, scale it or rotate it.
43

44
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:27,540
What you will find is that none of the other scenes inherits those changes if we started off with our
44

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,990
shapes and used link objects.
45

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,200
We get shapes 0 0 1 and I'm going to call this linked.
46

47
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:44,830
So we're really clear now if I go back to my shapes and I move them scale them or rotate them.
47

48
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,960
What we find is when we go back to our linked it's exactly the same.
48

49
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,310
So if you've got a blend file that you've put together let's say a building with multiple components
49

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,070
to it and you change it in the source file you can have it update across everything that is linked.
50

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,300
That's probably not going to be a useful case in our scenario where we've got the bowling ball and pins
51

52
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,020
but it's useful to know that that exists that if you change the original would update across all of
52

53
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,140
the rest of the scenes as it stands linked is the only one that will do that.
53

54
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,810
Obviously there are some things that you won't want to update.
54

55
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,440
So this in this case that's not going to be too useful when we start moving our pins around.
55

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,550
Otherwise we'll be changing our default scene as well.
56

57
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,890
And that leads us on to our challenge okay.
57

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,750
So your challenge is to go ahead and create a new scene once you've done that set up the scene where
58

59
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,500
the ball has struck the pins so they might be flying about a little, and name the scenes appropriately
59

60
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,990
so that you know what they are at descriptive name is worth its weight in gold.
60

61
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,160
And then I'd like you to go ahead and share your scene as well.
61

62
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,710
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go. Okay everybody, Welcome back.
62

63
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,450
Let's go create a new scene where we're smashing the ball into our pins.
63

64
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,690
Okay so now we've got our bowling scene all sorted.
64

65
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,540
This is like our standard layout.
65

66
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,490
So I'm going to go up to the top here and just call it standard layouts or something along those lines
66

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,010
you can name it.
67

68
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,960
Of course what you want to name it so mines just going to be standard layout so I know what it is.
68

69
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,440
Let's go ahead and create a new scene and what we can do is we can link options, create a full copy.
69

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,760
I mean there's loads of different ways that we could work from this.
70

71
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm going to create a full copy because then I know I've got absolutely everything there and I'm going
71

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,990
to call this one smash or something along those lines.
72

73
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,550
And then it's just a matter of moving things around to create a convincing look and I've still got snapping
73

74
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,030
turned on.
74

75
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,480
So let's let's move the bowling ball into here.
75

76
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,290
So if it's in that position we would have certainly struck this one so let's move over here rotate it
76

77
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,120
round slightly as if it had been knocked this one here.
77

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,480
Let's put it all the way back here and rotate it around like that.
78

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,220
This one here would have obviously been knocked this one over here.
79

80
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,940
I say obviously it might not have been.
80

81
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,680
Let's just move it around to a happy with it.
81

82
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,530
You can double press R anytime.
82

83
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,040
By the way when you double press the R key it goes into this track ball rotation.
83

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,310
I think we've had a look at that in the past but obviously it does depend on what you're up to.
84

85
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,380
So there we go.
85

86
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,610
This is busted through here.
86

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,370
This front one here looks like it's been missed.
87

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,480
So let's have a look at how that looks from here.
88

89
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,700
That looks like a pretty dynamic shot.
89

90
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,370
Let's move the camera in ever so slightly smash, Lets render that out and have a look and that is
90

91
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,270
pretty awesome.
91

92
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,230
Whether or not it's realistic and oh this is why it's good to render and double check.
92

93
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,140
I would have not seen that this pin was in fact clipping through the bottom.
93

94
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,970
So let's just have another look at this pin here with a look from the side and that way I can make sure
94

95
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,350
that this isn't clipping through the bottom by just moving it up and out of the way.
95

96
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay.
96

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,850
So I think this one here could be moved a little bit out there a bit more dynamics and the bowling ball.
97

98
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,290
I don't want it to go through the floor so I'm going to go shift in Z to say don't move on the Z axis
98

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,380
and let's place it smack bang there in the middle.
99

100
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,560
Let's press render.
100

101
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,050
Okay.
101

102
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,950
I think that looks pretty good.
102

103
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm just going to save my image, So save as and I'm going to call it smash and that's something that
103

104
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,960
I can now show off as a final render.
104

105
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,810
Now there are a couple of other things just looking at this.
105

106
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,540
These are highly glossy surfaces but they're currently not reflecting anything around them.
106

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,400
And also the lighting itself can be done a little bit better certainly perhaps a couple of different
107

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,720
lights.
108

109
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,780
So we don't have these harsh shadows around our objects.
109

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,200
We've already discussed three point lighting of course we could perhaps create a lighting rig around
110

111
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,080
the scene and we've got these shadows.
111

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm not very happy with these shadows.
112

113
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,230
They kind of don't really connect with the objects themselves.
113

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,030
And we'll find out why that is in the next lecture.
