1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,880
And this lecture, I'm adding some hair to my animal and doing some tests renders to see if I can find

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,240
something that's generally in the direction of what I'd like from my animal.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm just going to experiment with the hair first before I start grooming and placing it properly, because

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,920
you can often invest a lot of time in having the hair perfectly in position, only to find that, oh,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,220
it's too long or too short or there's too much of it, or I wish I did it a different way from the start.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,770
So let's find the look that we're going for.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,640
First of all, gonna start off by creating myself new particle system.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,230
Click on my cat first, finding the particle system click.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,550
Plus, I will call this particle system.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,620
Body hair.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,500
Cook on the hair and then change the hair length, I'm going to make my point, too.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,340
That might be a little bit too short.

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,890
This is the part that when they go and add children and stop modifying their hair, we'll lose the ability

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,090
to increase the handling.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,420
So I spent a little bit of time trying to figure out how long the hair should be.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,160
Maybe even point to five.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,580
Don't do a lot of work until you're happy with the length of the hair.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,660
I think what I'll be doing in the next video probably is white painting.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,030
So for now, I'm going to totally ignore how terrible the head and the feet and possibly even the tail.

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,570
Look, I'm just going for the overall body hair structure.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,330
That's fine.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,940
Children interpolated.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,380
And we've got a starting point to put mine up to 30 and 30.

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,850
Now, once again, if your computer is not enjoying having too many, then play around with it when

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,220
you've got a lower value and then see how it looks when you render.

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,400
Speaking of which, let's do our first render.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,990
That's how we're looking so far.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,010
Again, this is Eevee.

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,320
This is without hair just sticking straight out.

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,570
We've got patches in here that whether the Catholic a little bit bold, I find that happens when you've

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,000
got the hair just coming straight out from the body.

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,160
There's a lot more likelihood that you'd be looking directly into the skin or the body of the animal.

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,900
So just pop that down.

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,940
Let me say I'm gonna adjust the color a little bit at this stage so I can start to get a feel for that.

35
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,590
So I'll go down to my material properties, click on new I'll call this body Serial.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,740
And then just change the base color.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,820
I think I said in my previous video I was going gonna go for black, which was really enjoying the look

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,570
of the black cat.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,820
But it's just quite difficult to see, I think, on video when I'm starting to look at strands of hair.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,290
So I'm gonna go for a lighter color, probably more of a brownie ginger color the body.

41
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,250
I'll go brown.

42
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,240
And then I think the hair, I'll get a little bit more ginger in the hair.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,060
Now create a second material plus and click on new.

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,900
I will call this body hair and for the moment I'll leave as principled B.S. the F, but I will change

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,190
that to hair shortly.

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,470
I just want to see generally how things are looking at this point.

47
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,100
I change the base color to make more of a bright orange.

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,090
If I can find a bright orange color for my ginger ninja, it's going to be strolling through the undergrowth.

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,480
Excellent.

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,160
Over to the particle system.

51
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,390
And can you remember where it is that we tell our particle system, use that color?

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,400
It's within render.

54
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,310
We find material and we change that to be body hair.

55
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,080
Now we've got to orange kind of looking.

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,250
Can't let's do another test.

57
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,480
Render again an Avey.

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,530
So she'll be pretty quick.

59
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,280
Okay.

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,090
And you might like that.

61
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,850
Look, you might like this kind of e.v. spike.

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,060
You look like I said before.

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,050
Ignore the fate.

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,460
Not gonna worry about those for now.

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,670
And the face gonna go in and do a little bit of grooming.

66
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,020
Just random type stuff to make sure that it's looking generally the way I want it to.

67
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,130
And I think what I'll do is modify just the tips of the hair particles.

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,320
Go for pretty big brush for the moment, jump on a calm and push everything a little bit back.

69
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,740
So we'll keep the the fullness of the hair.

70
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,460
I sound like a hairdressing ad, don't I?

71
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,930
Like by this shampoo.

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,310
Keep the Faunus in the full rich body of your.

73
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,640
You can tell I haven't had hair for a long time.

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
I don't even know how the ads go.

75
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,120
Anyway, we'll keep the fullness and thickness of the body.

76
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,790
We'll get a little bit of the hair pointing in the direction that the Kate the cat is kind of moving

77
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,870
or facing.

78
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,180
Okay.

79
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,840
Don't put too much time into this.

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,460
Just doing it for enough so I can go and do another test render.

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,500
See how that looks.

82
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,890
Okay.

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,860
That's all now looking in a orderly direction.

84
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,380
And you can see a lot of the the B on a C straight through and this part has been resolved.

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,610
Couple of patches, empty patches.

86
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,600
Ouch.

87
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,700
We'll have a look at those just now and see what's going on.

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,270
Okay.

89
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,110
You can see that we've got this big area where there's nothing in there, if you've got any of that.

90
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,550
You can go and click on ADD.

91
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,810
Make sure you do interpolate or click on Interpolate.

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,150
Sorry.

93
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,360
I will change the count down to just to count down the boob and just pop a couple.

94
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,270
Well they're not really going where I want them to go make my brush smaller.

95
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,360
And you know, I'm just gonna put down a one so I have all these double headers everywhere.

96
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,290
Okay.

97
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,540
And you can say they're following the shape from what we have because we're on interpolate.

98
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,340
So just doing this to show that we can fill in the gaps and make sure we can fill in the gaps.

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,530
Another test, render lots of tests, run a F 12 to do a test render in C have mostly filled in a little

100
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,100
bit more to go.

101
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,560
Very, very uniform with our hair here.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,710
It's not looking realistic as an animal would.

103
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,590
So let's have a look at what we can do.

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,650
There's a couple of options.

105
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:02,320
First of all, we can scroll down within our particle system and find roughness and play around with

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,950
the roughness.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,390
You might want to change the randomness to say point one, get a little bit of randomness in there.

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,650
I'm just going to jump back over into my object mode so I can see what's happening when I do this.

109
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,900
And as we go for that randomness, we've got every single thing has got the randomness of Benice to

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,500
the hairs.

111
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,510
And we do have you can see hopefully you can see in here that the hairs are looking too low.

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,340
Poly scroll up to render, whereas render and find the path and increase these steps to four, five.

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,950
Now we'll do a render X.

114
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,880
I'll do that in the viewport display as well.

115
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,110
Let's see Strand's steps.

116
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,120
Three, four, five.

117
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,420
I might even go higher here if your computer is not enjoying.

118
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,240
Then feel free to stop at a lower value.

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,490
I'll put mine, although after seven to so I can get the strands as smooth as possible.

120
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,750
Do another render.

121
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,220
See if that's changed much.

122
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,250
Okay.

123
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,640
It's got a little bit fuzzier.

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,250
So this is an interesting look at the fuzzy look.

125
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,640
And it's really cool to experiment.

126
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,760
If you want to do something that's more like a poodle look.

127
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,460
Or more like a frizzy animal local, more of a clomping hair look than you can play around with these

128
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,880
values.

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
I mentioned Clomping put clomping the value of, say, point five.

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,290
That will give us a little bit of the hair clumping together and then shape.

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,980
I'll put that 2.5 as well just to see how that's looking.

132
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:18,830
Okay.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,110
Hit F 12 again.

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,520
This is looking really interesting.

135
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,690
If you wanted to make a an animal that was a like a stuffed toy that had what looks like cotton or wool

136
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,290
attached to it.

137
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,820
Is Frogmore Cotton then?

138
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,150
This is a really cool look for that.

139
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,190
Looks like little strands of cotton, doesn't it, particularly when you're scrolling.

140
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,130
So that could be the toy teddy bear if you wanted to make that look really cool.

141
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,170
Make sure you don't follow exactly what I'm doing.

142
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,220
Come up with your own interpretation of this whole exercise.

143
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,780
I'm gonna put the clomping back to zero, the shape back to zero.

144
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,550
I want my cat to have reasonably smooth hair.

145
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,860
But let's have a look at the roughness value.

146
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,750
I'm going to increase the randomness.

147
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,730
Actually, know what the threshold I was saying before that I've got too many things that are kind of

148
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,460
squiggly when I have some of them squiggly and some of them not.

149
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,940
So if our threshold is at zero, everything is gonna be squiggly.

150
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,060
If I put my threshold to one, then nothing should be squiggly.

151
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,720
So put my threshold to say point eight, then we'll have some of them.

152
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,130
Some of the strands of hairs will be squiggly if the squiggly is actually a word.

153
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,550
Okay.

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,840
Cool.

155
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Nearly time for me to have a look at how this looks in cycles and it's going to change to slot two.

156
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,300
This means we can render to the other slot, jump up two cycles in my rendering tab, switch on over

157
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,560
cycles, hit F 12.

158
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,700
It's going to take a little bit longer.

159
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,630
I'll probably speed up the video each time I do my renders.

160
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,350
So it's not accurate indication of how long these things take.

161
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,910
If you're wondering why is Frick's Renda going so quick at the moment, getting super slow but are speed

162
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,910
up each time I do the random?

163
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,590
From now on.

164
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,160
Okay, I like that we've got a little bit of the randomness in there.

165
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,830
I think what I need to do with mine is to increase the number of children, which I will do now just

166
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,960
so I can feel like I'm getting an accurate indication.

167
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,560
60 and 60.

168
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,070
Like I said before, if your computer is struggling with this, then don't push it.

169
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,140
Let's just do another quick render on that.

170
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,340
For me, it's a lot of tweaking.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,970
Render it, tweak it, render it so you can see how it's looking until we get to the point where we're

172
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,170
mostly in the ballpark and then I'll move on to the next stage of grooming.

173
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,060
Okay, so here's my render.

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,940
I'm looking at this bit on the top that I've actually paid attention to.

175
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,080
Not so much down here.

176
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,750
And generally I'm happy with it.

177
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm happy with the length.

178
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,730
I'm happy with the the style of grooming.

179
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,420
When I push it backwards, it makes sense, you know, when I groom it backwards.

180
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,040
So I'm pretty happy with this look.

181
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,450
As I mentioned before, I need to change what I'm going to do for the feet, change what I do for the

182
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,010
face and head and whiskers.

183
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,500
But I think I've settled on a general approach.

184
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,210
Let me just try one more thing to make sure I'm happy with the look of this, which is to switch up

185
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,550
what we're using for our shader.

186
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm going to if I can grab my other window delicately, drag on out a second window, switch into the

187
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,000
shader editor, just move that over.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,390
Blinks.

189
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:55,960
We don't need it.

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,060
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

191
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,590
Currently, we're using a principle B SDF for our hair, going to jump to my material properties.

192
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,950
What are we looking for here?

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:12,880
B, the I'm going to change that to be either the hair B SDF up yonder or the principled hair B SDF.

194
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,050
I'm not going to go into the full power of these things, I'm just gonna tweak them a little bit to

195
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,550
see if I can get the result I'm going for.

196
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,490
So go principled hair, the SDF and you can see when we do that everything goes pretty dark even when

197
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm over in my render view.

198
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,710
Give it a moment.

199
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,430
Give it a moment.

200
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
I've got the color in here, which is quite a dark color.

201
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,100
So I'm going to change the default value color to be, let's see, something a little bit brighter so

202
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,890
we can actually see what's going on in the general orangy range, similar to the color I had there before.

203
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,130
We can see an okay kind of representation, but to see how this looks as a proper render.

204
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,070
So once again, I'm going to do a proper render and speed up things to see how this looks and then jump

205
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,900
back in and tweak some of the values.

206
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,880
OK, I still have some patches where I can see the skin of the animals so long as the hair and the skin

207
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,660
a similar color.

208
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,330
It's not gonna be too much of an issue.

209
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,770
I can just go on patch those those in later on.

210
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,860
I'm pretty happy with what I'm seeing around the mid area, a little bit flat on top.

211
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,990
So see if we can do something a little bit better there as time goes on.

212
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,060
But generally, I'm happy with this direction that we're in.

213
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,710
And I like the fact that when we do this, we've got this natural variation in color where the light

214
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,970
shining on it more brightly.

215
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,180
We've got a lighter color.

216
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,720
We've got a darker orange on the chest of the animal.

217
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,080
So it makes it look like we've got tons of hair type variation in here.

218
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,850
I said not super happy with what's going on on top, but we'll deal with that as time goes on.

219
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,440
Generally, I'm going to call this good enough for the moment and start getting into the next phase

220
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,930
of grooming my animal.

221
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,100
So quite a challenge for you.

222
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,860
And that is to add here to your animal's body.

223
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,820
So experiment with different styles of fur or hair that might suit your animal.

224
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,800
Try clumping.

225
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,710
Try having it longer.

226
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,730
Try having it shorter.

227
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,230
Try having it grooming.

228
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:51,530
Sorry.

229
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,330
Try grooming.

230
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,570
Try having it spiky.

231
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,820
And then to change a shader if you like.

232
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,570
You don't have to.

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,320
I've changed.

234
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,400
It made little bit of a difference.

235
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,510
I quite like it.

236
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,180
Use cycles rendering if you like, but you don't have to.

237
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:02,990
By all means.

238
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,950
You can absolutely use Eevee if you want.

239
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,800
This whole process to go more quickly.

240
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,730
You're not so worried about also precious about having it look absolutely perfect.

241
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,420
Or if you just like the style that Eevee gives to you, which often can give you more of a stylistic

242
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,650
cartoony look as well.

243
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,520
And once you're happy, head to the next lecture.

244
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,820
Well, we'll start to put a little bit more attention into the hair coverage and the feet and getting

245
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,010
the body looking the way we want the body to look.
