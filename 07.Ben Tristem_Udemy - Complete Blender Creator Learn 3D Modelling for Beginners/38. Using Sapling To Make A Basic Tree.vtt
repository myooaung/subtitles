00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome to using sapling to make a basic tree.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.520
In this video you will look at the tree presets see how to add leaves to your tree and sapling.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.290
Learn where The leaves are actually placed on the tree and how to get it looking more like a real tree

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.460
at the base.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.040
So just as an example here we've got is not got any materials on it it's just a plain material there.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.760
But we can see that very rarely would trees into the ground if you look at the base of the tree here

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.170
like that they would more enter the ground something along these lines.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.430
And that's a far better looking base far more interesting as well.

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.650
So let's go explore that now and hop on over into a blender.

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.850
So we've made a lovely bush with a couple of flowers on it over in blender so far and we need to make

11
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.600
a tree now.

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.280
So let's go explore sapling a little further.

13
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.230
I'm going to move onto another layer.

14
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.370
I'm going to go on to led 10 this time I'm going to centre the 3D cursor.

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.120
Oh not with those keys we're shift an S and cursor to centre.

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.340
And let's go ahead and add ourselves a curve and add a tree.

17
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.840
Now again I'm going to make this tree a lot shorter.

18
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.550
I'm going to untop all lock camera to view as well and try and give myself a bit more space on my low

19
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.020
resolution screen here.

20
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.320
Okay I'm going to turn bevel on so I can see it was going on.

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.970
I'm also going to turn up the bevell resolution because this is going to be a large object if if that's

22
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.540
too low.

23
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.700
It's going to look very blocky.

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.160
I'm going to lower the scale down to maybe five or so so I can see it as not too big in the scene it

25
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.050
doesn't need to be too big either.

26
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.100
Now further down here there's actually a load preset a button so if you make a tree and you'd like the

27
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.820
look of it you can always reload the preset at any time.

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.890
And on here there's a couple of options already here have already saved one in fact called starting

29
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.530
tree.

30
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.590
But I really like these see a black coaker been playing with them all.

31
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.040
And I really like the way that comes out and again we're going to just have to all wouldn't want a resolution

32
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.440
of 80.

33
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.150
I'm going to go for six in this case that should give us a bit of smoothness as you can see it's still

34
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.880
quite a big tree so let's lower the scale down.

35
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360
Let's take it down to five or so.

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.100
That's looking pretty good.

37
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.850
In fact I'm still in Cannes review that's come out of Own i'll be able to zoom out and look around.

38
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.490
Okay so that is looking pretty good for the moment.

39
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.450
Now to add leaves to this tree we'd need to hop over to as you probably guess the leaf settings and

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.370
schematic on show leaves and what this is going to do is it's going to add 25 leaves to the end of each

41
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.470
of the branches.

42
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.610
Now we've only got a couple of branches coming out of here so if we go back to the branch growth setting

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.930
up I do apologize the branch splitting section section is on this second level that the leaves appear

44
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.940
so until it's on that second level there won't be any leaves at all.

45
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.730
So one way to boost this and get leaves all over the entire tree will be to increase the levels here

46
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.800
to number three.

47
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.180
But let's before we do that just check the numbers here.

48
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.890
So we've got 40 branches each with 120 branches coming out where K and each one of those hundred and

49
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.630
twenty is going to have twenty five leaves on it.

50
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.110
So I'm anticipating it's a stop blender working for a few months while I do this and your computer may

51
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.080
take a little longer but if so then lower these figures though ago it took a few seconds to do.

52
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.790
We could see straightaway we've got some leaves on our tree and I really like the way that this one

53
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.950
is dropping down towards the ground as well.

54
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.980
I can use that to my advantage right.

55
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.720
Let's deal now with how this looks at the very bottom I'm going to get rid of this render board as well.

56
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.140
I'm finding it a bit distracting.

57
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.350
So down here this comes to a complete sort of dead stop straying to the ground.

58
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.380
We want that to happen we want to have a more natural.

59
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.870
So the first thing we're going to have to do is this is still a curve object so just like you've done

60
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.510
to your bush beforehand on the tree we're going to go out and see and we're going to make a mesh from

61
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.820
the curved data.

62
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.990
Not going to keep the original.

63
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.430
I'm quite happy that we are going to lose that data and now we've done that we can actually go in to

64
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.250
sculpt mode then there's loads of ways of doing this but obviously in sculped mode we can start doing

65
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.330
a bit of alteration if we hop into edit mode before we do that.

66
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.010
You see there's not much geometry down here which means that the standard sculpting is not going to

67
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.670
be that well.

68
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.830
Isn't going to be that precise.

69
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.040
In fact it's just going to move a couple of earths is round so we're going to have to turn on as we've

70
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.170
done before.

71
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.270
We're going to have to turn on the dynamic topology which is going to create more space more geometry

72
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.210
for us as we go nave.

73
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.870
Going to have to be careful as well because you may end up adding too much detail to your tree.

74
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.350
Now down at the bottom here.

75
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.350
Oh that's subtract some disconnect.

76
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.690
Literally go ahead and start adding some detail making a bit bulkier at the bottom.

77
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.780
Excellent.

78
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.090
And we can try something like the snake hook here make it a bit smaller and see if we can pull outs

79
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.880
and then zoom in for this one so I can pull out a bit more or I've got mirroring turned on you can see

80
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.320
how all it's just.

81
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.610
It's 10 at the radius just a little so we can grab some more.

82
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.480
There we go that's starting to look a bit better more like a root system coming out of the tree.

83
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.970
I've got mirroring turned on but that's not too much of a big deal at this point in time.

84
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.410
And now around here were the branches actually are.

85
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.500
It may pay us a little bit to make that look just a little bit more blended around there.

86
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.430
So that when we're looking at the tree later on it doesn't look like these branches are just literally

87
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.080
stuck on.

88
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.240
Now it only matters with the low down ones because I'm probably only going to be seeing that but making

89
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.790
them a little more blended in.

90
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.890
It's going to help massively.

91
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.810
Now obviously be careful how much detail you add cause it will.

92
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.390
Look if you zoom out too far that will happen.

93
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.030
Remember the distance you zoom out will depend on the level of detail of dynamic topology works every

94
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.090
zoom right in.

95
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.370
You can add a little knot in there.

96
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.710
And if we zoom all the way out if we try and do the same thing it wrecks the tree completely.

97
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.930
So there's lots to play about here a lot to do to make this tree look a bit better than just a plain

98
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.590
old stick in the ground.

99
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.750
And of course with that in mind I got a challenge for you guys.

100
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.100
I would like you to finish your scene.

101
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.390
So create a tree for the scene and give the tree and leaves a material.

102
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.130
Make any changes to your scene that you deem necessary.

103
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.710
Remember to keep your samples low whilst prototyping and moving things about and then render your final

104
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.570
scene and share with us.

105
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.550
In the discussions I really do like seeing what you guys have created.

106
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.560
I'm looking forward to seeing this scene all coming together.

107
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.110
Remember to keep those samples low I can't stress that enough.

108
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.650
Don't be waiting around ages just to see if something is in the right position.

109
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.720
Keep them low.

110
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.010
Prototype rapidly go backwards and forwards.

111
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.110
Try it out and then finally turn up the samples for that final scene.

112
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.250
Don't go crazy with it.

113
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.430
We don't need it super high rez or millions and millions of samples.

114
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:46.590
Just get it to a decent enough quality so you can share with us all your creation.

115
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.480
Pause a video now and give that a go.

116
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.400
Okay guys.

117
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.460
Welcome back.

118
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.600
Let's hop over and finish our scene in blender.

119
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.630
Right so let's go ahead and have a look at how this is currently looking.

120
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.210
Well first of all I can see before doing anything else.

121
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.730
I know we haven't assigned any material of some going to do that.

122
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.310
First of all so we've got the tree nested under the tree.

123
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.580
We have our leaves.

124
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:26.890
So if I go to the tree first anger to the material tab I'm just going to add a very basic material and

125
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.140
I'm going to call its branches or chinari or word or something along those lines of them to call it

126
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.730
a tree.

127
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.360
And I'm going to change that colour to a all not an orange but I suppose it could be but a darker brown

128
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.070
case something along those lines.

129
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.120
If you go out and look at trees they're not necessarily dark brown.

130
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.120
They may be whites and with bits on them.

131
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.970
But we are not going to detail it with texture at the moment and the leaves well what colour leaves

132
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.390
do we want do we want an autumn leaf do we want a bright summer leaf.

133
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:05.010
Well I'm doing a midsummer's day in this one so let's call the material leaves.

134
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.880
Is there going to be green.

135
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.310
I'm going to leave it as a diffuse colour but I'm certainly not going to have them.

136
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.490
That's bright and leave it around there.

137
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.630
Of course I can play with the materials and build up a bit speculatory in there as well to give to the

138
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.880
leaves a bit of a shine.

139
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.650
And let's have a look at the tree as a whole that looks pretty good.

140
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.920
Now let's start bringing other things into our scene some going to go to my layer's tab here.

141
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.930
And on the layers management and just see how it looks with the Cameron lighting turned on that's important

142
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.590
and the grass layer.

143
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.020
So my tree itself I want to shift up to the top here so I'm just going to grab it all.

144
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.200
The whole thing had to grab the whole thing and move it.

145
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520
Well I will grab the right thing in a moment.

146
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.810
There we go grab the tree.

147
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.910
I'm still in sculpt mode.

148
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.590
That's why switch over to object mode and I'm going to move that.

149
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.340
First of all just to cross.

150
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.620
So it's roughly in the right place and I'm going to have to lift it up on the z axis itself until it's

151
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.300
just coming through the ground.

152
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.390
Let's switch Becca over to material mode and have a closer look at it.

153
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.450
Of course I could go in in detail things.

154
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:27.060
Now importantly if I'm viewing it from the camera so let's just go to the camera view itself.

155
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.210
Well if that's the camera view the trees not even in the scene so we're going to have to adjust things

156
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.710
so that everything's in the scene itself.

157
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.280
So let's go ahead and add the rabbits.

158
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.230
Excellent.

159
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:45.080
I seem to have a tree layer here is that my Bush whereas my bush situated in this scenes that's situated

160
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.110
about there.

161
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.100
So let's go ahead and move the camera around now.

162
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.250
Lock for camera to view and just rotates.

163
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.540
Well it's getting a bit busy.

164
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.670
Give myself a bit more space as well to see what's going on.

165
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.460
Pull that up.

166
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.160
Now this is all artistic licence at this point.

167
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.980
You can go through as many iterations as you like.

168
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.390
I quite like that for you.

169
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.810
There I think so.

170
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.520
I've done a test that really quickly got a low sample rate.

171
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.060
That's good.

172
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.890
Let's just render that out and see how it looks now I've got all my layers turned on yet either and

173
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.690
I don't need to only see what the whole thing looks like right at this very moment.

174
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.310
I just need to look at the general composition.

175
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.090
Well looking at it quite like this tree to be a bit bigger actually and I'm going to try to scaling

176
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.220
it up because I can't see the top half.

177
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.940
It doesn't really matter what it does to the top half.

178
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.850
In this particular case let's hop back into the 3D view and select our tree which is still there and

179
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.800
just scale it up.

180
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.500
And it's looking better.

181
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.340
I'm going to bring that down.

182
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.540
Back into the ground.

183
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.710
Tell that little bit on the left goes in as well.

184
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.690
Well I'm going to leave for up here probably at the scene.

185
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.070
Right.

186
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.150
That's looking a bit better in the trees more prominent in the scene.

187
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.260
I'm going to render it again and going through this constant iteration cycle What's it going to look

188
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.440
like.

189
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.880
What's it going to look like.

190
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.410
That's very important.

191
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.790
And keeping those samples low.

192
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.840
Okay.

193
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.070
So it looks like the roots going to the ground.

194
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:33.040
I'm going to go into my model now and just edit it in and bring this actually down into the ground.

195
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.900
So I'm going to let you grab the virtex on the end make sure in proportional editing mode and pull it

196
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.490
down until it goes into the ground.

197
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.600
Going to make that just a little small or so arches up.

198
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.100
Excellent.

199
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.500
I am liking that.

200
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:56.420
Now let's go ahead and hop into object mode and scale the tree up again ever so slightly.

201
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.100
Right.

202
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.660
Brilliant.

203
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.590
Let's see now how this looks with the other layers.

204
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.990
All turned on.

205
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.120
So every layer turned on I can see down at the bottom and on the tool shelf as well.

206
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.010
And the layer management Everything's turned on.

207
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.920
Let's do a very quick render and see how that looks now because this has got all of the extra grass

208
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.460
in it.

209
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.820
It is likely to take significantly longer.

210
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.030
No it doesn't have all the other grass in it why doesn't have all the grass and it's probably cause

211
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.070
the particle systems are turned off at the moment.

212
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.940
So the particle systems are part of the ground so I need to find my ground plane.

213
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.020
There it is.

214
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.120
I'm going to go for particle systems.

215
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.530
And here we are they're actually turned off at the moment.

216
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:43.370
So I'm going to turn them all on in the rendered view which is this camera and go and render that only

217
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.950
at five samples again because I want to see what it's coming together like.

218
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.620
Now we can see there straightaway it's taking significantly longer because there's far more detail in

219
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.580
the scene that blender needs to calculate.

220
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.120
However underneath this run out now and see how it looks.

221
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:07.060
And remember this is only five samples it looks like it's going to take approximately three or four

222
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.640
minutes to do so are join you again.

223
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.850
And fast forward to when it's done.

224
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.840
Wow okay so this is looking really good.

225
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.030
I'm happy with its current arrangements.

226
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:26.140
I could critique a few things in here but notice now that the grass is in place one of the great things

227
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.970
about the grass is it's covering up the base of the tree a little more which is great because it just

228
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.400
covers up the little bits of detail that we haven't added.

229
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.200
That's really good.

230
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.200
I'm going to leave this now rendering a higher definition higher sample rate just to get a bit of a

231
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.450
clearer image.

232
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.320
How did you guys get on.

233
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.840
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you have come up with how you've placed your tree what tree

234
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.940
did you go for.

235
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.400
What colour is rabbit etc.

236
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.360
I am really looking forward to seeing these so make sure you share them in the discussions.

237
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.600
And as always I will see you in the next lecture.
