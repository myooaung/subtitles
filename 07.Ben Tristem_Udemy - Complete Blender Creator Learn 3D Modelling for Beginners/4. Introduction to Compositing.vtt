00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.230
Welcome to an introduction to compositing.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.080
So this is all about rendering a background picture and then compositing it with a 3-d render of what

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.130
we've done.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.550
So we're going to bring different renders together into one final render our Compositing is done in

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.450
the node.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.750
Ed we're going to show you how to view your posit changes lives.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.040
Anything you change you can see the effect and then learn how to scale the background image independently

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.860
of the final render resolution.

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.250
You'll see how that can be a bit of a pain if we don't.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.370
So let's go hop on over into a blender.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.040
Right so now we're over in blender.

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.720
The first thing I want to show you is just a recap on the roundelay So if we go over to our properties

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.990
panel Properties window here and go to the render layers tab and we can see we got one render layer.

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.210
Now if we go ahead and go in and render vats with the F 12 key we can see that the cube renders if we

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.160
turn on another render layer and do exactly the same thing or you can go up here to the render menu

16
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.280
render image.

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.740
You'll notice that it renders twice.

18
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.250
And that's because it's rendering each one of these individually.

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.040
So do bear in mind if you've got lots of render layers it will slow down your render especially if it's

20
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.350
an animation.

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.460
So I'm going to get rid of this extra render layer we've created at the moment and go to the node editor.

22
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.710
Now once were any would know editor we did switch the modes to compositing mode and along the head a

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.640
bar it is the second option along on this little sound group of icons along here.

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.920
Now once were in there nothing will visibly change just yet because first of all we don't have use nodes

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.490
selected.

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.340
So let's go and put a tick in that box.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.110
Okay so when we zoom in we can see very similar to the materials Ed will me using that with nodes.

28
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.600
We've got render layers here and it's plugged into the composites node.

29
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.560
And this is what you were getting when you render.

30
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.130
This is your output.

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.150
And in this case the render layer is the inputs.

32
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.010
Now there are lots of different types of inputs and we can add them through the ADD menu.

33
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.950
And if we go to inputs we can see there is a list we can pick from.

34
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.500
Now in this case we want to pick image and if we use an image we can go and find the image that you've

35
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.410
downloaded and prepared for this particular section.

36
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.980
Every game is going to open up looks wonderful.

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.560
And if I plug that in to our composite output when we go and render it will look like that now now it

38
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.770
looks slightly wrong.

39
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.450
Now why does it look wrong.

40
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.820
Lass's because the picture is bigger than the render space we've asked.

41
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.750
So let's go to the render properties and have a look.

42
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.280
So we've got 50 percent of 10 80 and this picture was quite a high resolution.

43
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.970
So if I turn out to 100 Let's just see how that comes out that's going to take a few moments to render

44
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.680
out.

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.380
And we can see that there's more of a picture being shown but not all of it.

46
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.170
And this can be a real pain because I certainly don't want to render a super high resolution if I'm

47
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.340
just prototyping.

48
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.480
I just don't want to do that so I will sort this out right away.

49
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.030
So let's go back to the node editor and I'm going to leave this render layers alone at the moment and

50
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.080
we need to do something with this output.

51
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.750
So we got the input which the image we need to do something before it gets to the outputs and we need

52
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.440
to add in a distortion because we're distorting that image we're changing it.

53
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.720
And we've got a scale option.

54
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.630
And when we put the scale option in there's lots of different choices we can choose from but to keep

55
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.250
it in line with the render output we select a render size.

56
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.720
There are a couple of options here.

57
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.650
In this particular case I'm going to pick crop.

58
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.260
Now it shouldn't matter.

59
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.250
Let's render this scene out.

60
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.150
Again it shouldnt actually matter.

61
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.860
We get the cube there what the rendering settings are set at so thats the whole picture cropped in to

62
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.150
fit the tensity scene so thats absolutely fine.

63
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.930
We can adjust that if we wanted to but thats fine with me.

64
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.350
Now lets turn this down to lets say 20 percent if I was doing a very quick render and lets see how that

65
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.500
comes out and zoom in absolutely fine.

66
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.060
And that was really quick as well.

67
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.130
A lot quicker than the first time round.

68
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.740
Okay so weve got that all set up now.

69
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.740
What else can we do.

70
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.190
We you can do lots of things in this node editor just like you can when setting up material so you can

71
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.380
mix things together.

72
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.300
You can change the r.g. be curb's if you wanted to.

73
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.820
Theres lots you can play with but one of the things that be very useful is anything changing it be nice

74
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.090
to see it live without having to worry about hitting F 12 every time and waiting it for it to render

75
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.780
out.

76
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.960
So how do we do that.

77
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.570
Well we need to add a viewer.

78
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.700
Now if you got noad Wrangler enabled you can hold down Shift control and hit the.

79
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.170
In this case the scale outputs and that will introduce a viewer.

80
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:08.420
As an output type Now what we want to do here is I'm going to get rid of that and go and outputs all

81
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.420
outputs and there's the view.

82
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.530
That's how you added him manually.

83
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.340
And we can just link those together.

84
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.760
Now we don't see anything as yet.

85
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.750
We need a tick on that back drop on the head bar here so there we go we can start to see this and auto

86
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.630
render.

87
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.120
Now you'll notice that this is tiny.

88
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.270
And again it's being governed by this resolution setting over here.

89
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.820
I'm going to turn that back up to 50 percent.

90
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.810
Nothing happens for the moment.

91
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.180
It would be really nice if it auto rendered all the time it sometimes doesn't support back drop on and

92
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.900
off again.

93
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.830
And there we go.

94
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.330
Now it can be a little bit difficult to work out this give myself a bit more space on the screen here.

95
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.140
It can be very difficult to actually work with nodes while the image is there.

96
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.000
So in the properties panel that's the end panel of the node.

97
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.350
Ed we've got a couple of options we can choose from and if we scroll down where we can see back drop

98
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.660
it's now turned on so that's another toggle it's the same as the one down here.

99
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.580
If I use the dropdown so I can see what's going on.

100
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.710
There's a zoom setting so we can zoom in and out which is very useful.

101
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.490
And we've got an offset as well now.

102
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.180
I dont tend to play with the offsets.

103
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.100
I literally hit the move button and then you can move this freely perhaps to a top corner and then we

104
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.220
can work on the nodes lower down if we wanted to.

105
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.140
You can also hit fits and then it all fitted appropriately to the screen determined by the resolution.

106
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.340
And reset back drop.

107
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.920
Well it's not done much in this case but it will reset to is the default position and zoom size et cetera.

108
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.780
So I'm going to move that up to the top corner here.

109
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.100
Okay so we've got everything ready to start playing with.

110
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.990
And I think it's time for a challenge.

111
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.520
I would like you to go ahead and render your first composite.

112
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.430
Now I know you think in.

113
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.480
Hang on a minute Mike you've not told us how to do this.

114
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.760
Well I think you already know if you've already done a lot with the cycle's materials and blending those

115
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.080
together I think you'll be just fine.

116
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.880
So it is very similar to the cycle's material set up.

117
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.990
You will need at least two input notes because we compositing were bringing two things together.

118
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.760
You I would suggest in this case you keep the image and if you've not got it in there and back in the

119
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.890
render layer.

120
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.330
And the output node is a composite.

121
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.130
No just in case you have been playing and I you need to mix those together there's a healthy hint as

122
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.530
to what you will need to do.

123
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.980
Ball's video now and give that a go.

124
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.160
Okay guys welcome back.

125
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.860
I hope you managed to do this.

126
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.390
Let's go render our first composite over in blender.

127
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.450
Okay so we have our roundelay here we've got the scene preview.

128
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.650
Everything's all set up.

129
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.940
And so we need to mix a render liar who is zoom in so you guys can see what's going on.

130
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.970
And he did mix this image here with this render layer here.

131
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.150
Now this is going to probably look horrible.

132
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.090
It doesn't matter at this point.

133
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.440
It's literally to mix these two together.

134
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.910
So if we go ahead and add in a mix node.

135
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.750
Now colour mix.

136
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.310
There we go.

137
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.950
I found the mix of course you could have searched up here for mix.

138
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:28.800
So you've got these two image inputs let's just mix them together and then I'm going to control and

139
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.470
shift click makes.

140
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.840
That's because I've got no Wrangler enabled on the add ons and the viewer itself.

141
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.220
I once what do I want to do here.

142
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:46.680
The viewer needs to be here on the output here view here and scale needs to go to there as well so I

143
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.210
can see what's going on on just an output from here to here.

144
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.360
I'm being daft.

145
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.970
There we go.

146
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.130
So what's going on here.

147
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:58.770
Well it's mixing them together and one's overriding the other let's just see what happens if we render

148
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.310
that out.

149
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.430
Does it do the same thing.

150
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.090
Yes the ones on top of the other.

151
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.070
Now can we mix them together in a way that means we can see both of them.

152
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.210
Let's literally try some options.

153
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.940
Well this is the problem here.

154
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.280
We've got the factor setter one.

155
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.820
So that is no good.

156
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.860
So here we go.

157
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.170
We blend them together we can start to see they come through.

158
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:25.140
And there are lots of other options and will get into some of those in more detail very very soon because

159
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.660
we're going to have to start using more to betray Shehan and division and you'll start to understand

160
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.680
how do you multiply and divide day an image that makes no sense.

161
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.530
Don't worry we'll get to that very shortly.

162
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.370
But if we divide we get a an interesting image it's very bright.

163
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:47.100
