00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,670
Hello everybody and welcome to this special lecture just on the outline.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,050
Now the outline if you move your eyes to the right hand side of the screen is this area at the top here

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,740
we're going to use it lots whenever we're working in blender.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,930
It's great we can select objects by just clicking on them we can double click in order to rename and

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,860
we could also hide and show items from our scene with this little icon.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,820
Now as blenders evolved we've actually lost some icons on the right hand side here that some of you

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,410
might have been used to up until this point.

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,390
And where are they.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,060
Well they're hidden under the filter options at the top.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,110
So let's just make this area slightly wider so we can see everything.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,210
And let's go along the top and what it's all about.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,260
This first one at the top that is all to do with the editor type so we can change it to any other window

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,530
type within blender.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,870
We're not going to do that.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,920
We'll play with the next one along later on.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,930
And this allows us to change the outline to look at different parts of Blender.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,820
Typically we'll be diving in between scenes and view layer by default it comes to view layer which mainly

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,680
focuses around collections.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,490
However scenes is something that you may also be interested in as it breaks things down slightly differently.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's switch that back to view layer for the moment.

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,260
This search box you probably guessed allows us to search for the item we're looking for.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,800
Now when we've got three items in our scene three objects a camera a mesh object called cube and a light

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,080
it's not going to be too difficult to find things however later on when your scenes get more complex

24
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,500
you will definitely be making use of the search function.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,790
Now the filter that I was alluding to earlier if we click on that it gives us a series of options and

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,430
it's just not disappear from it.

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,810
And at the top here we've got our restriction toggles now blender in the past used to have selectable

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,810
there rendering which is the camera icon and this little object here that looks like a screen.

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,360
So if we turn those four items back on and then have a look we see that they're back here.

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,060
Now we'll delve into more details later on on how you're going to use these things.

31
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,840
But a quick run through of these four items we've got this cursor here which allows us to make sure

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,340
we can turn off selections.

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,210
So when you've got a quite dense scene with many many objects in it being able to not select certain

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,410
items is really really useful including the lights and camera.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,380
So often it's useful to turn those off because if your view goes round in front of an object you can

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,380
accidentally have a tense selection for the light back on.

37
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,400
You can actually end up selecting the lights rather than the cube which in some cases would be really

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,230
really annoying.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,850
So you can turn off the selection.

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,800
We can hide them from our view.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,460
However with things like the lights and camera that can be a bad idea because it also removes their

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,480
effects on the scene as well as the icon being a temporary disable.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,000
We have the screen icon which is a global disable is very similar but it will make it disappear from

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,210
all view ports and then the final one here is one that I'll catch you out later on if you've inadvertently

45
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,610
clicked and it's got a cross there rather than the normal camera icon when you go and render out your

46
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,960
scenes later on you just won't have anything there which is useful if you've got something that you

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,950
wants there when you're modelling but not on the final render.

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,140
Now all that we've gone through here we will have another look at with more detail later on as and when

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,770
we need them.

50
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,000
But I know this is going to catch some of you out straightaway early especially those that have been

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
used to blender for a while.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,840
So thought I'd include it nice and early in the course.

53
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,570
That's it for this quick tip and I'll see you all in the next one.
