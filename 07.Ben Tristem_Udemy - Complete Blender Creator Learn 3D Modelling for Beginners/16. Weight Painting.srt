1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,640
Welcome to wait.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,130
Painting in this video you will use weight painting and virtex groups to control where the particle

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,830
system actually appears and where it does not.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,810
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,210
Okay so we have our rabbits that we've rended out here and just using it for a bit of reference material

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,570
for a moment the how over the entire body and is itself.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,230
It is all uniform.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,610
And if you have a look at a rabbit that's not the case there's a big flaw in our particular model that

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm using here are my reference material.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,530
I've got a big fluffy chest on my rabbits.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,920
The hair is definitely longer on the body than it is on the head.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,100
And the shortest place of all is the is has very little hair on there at all.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,690
So we could go in and using the particle at it to go in and try and alter all of these.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,020
But I can tell you first hand that would be an absolute pain to try and do.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,970
But what we can do is set up multiple particle systems and actually apply them to certain parts of the

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,870
body and those particle systems themselves can have certain attributes.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:21,150
So first of all let's hop in to 3-d you know so this is what our rabbit currently looks like now in

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:30,390
order to assign certain areas of our bunny hair to certain parts of the bunny body we will need to set

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,020
up virtex groups and there's a couple of ways you could do that.

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,460
We've already experienced one way where we select the mesh or of the vertices within a mesh and add

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,320
those to the group.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,130
There's another way called weight painting.

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,590
So the first thing we're going to do is create one of these virtex groups.

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm going to go over to the data.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,110
The object data window over here and we've got virtex groups and I'm going to add one end called it

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,650
body.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,330
Now it's called body.

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,830
We can literally hop in to white paints and start painting.

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,520
Now at the moment there's a load of hair in the way.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,770
So what I'm going to do as a long ago is for particle system at the top here and just click the little

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,600
eyeball to hide it.

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,180
And we've got ourselves a Blue Bunny now like before we've got a series of brush types.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,130
So looking here were these are all the brush types you can have add and subtract.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,200
Generally the two that I would use in this case we're adding now it's blue at the moment and I'm going

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,790
to change the strength here.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,130
Two point twenty five.

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,710
Because in general there are four steps there are four colours.

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,880
Obviously there's a gradient in between them.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,850
But there are four main colours and I'm just going to draw straight on the bunny here.

40
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:54,360
The first colour is this tan or turquoise or hsiang Colour.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,780
Sorry zero is this dark blue.

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,020
The next level about 25 percent is shown by this turquoise colour.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,140
Then at 50 percent we have this green colour.

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,360
Then we have a yellow colour.

45
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,430
And then finally a red colour and a red colour donates 100 percent waiting.

46
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,210
Now in general with the hairs themselves in this case I do want 100 percent of the body here.

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,330
That sounds a bit funny but 100 percent of the body hair on the body itself.

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,170
So we would want to colour in the body all red.

49
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,890
Now I'm going to turn the strength up to one so that everything I do is straight away coloured red and

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm going to have to sprink the brush size again using F I can do that and using shift in F I can change

51
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,050
fee.

52
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,720
I would say capacity but the strength of the brush and I'm going to leave that at one for the moment

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,630
as well and the limit selection to visibility tool is also available here.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,010
So I'm going to toggle that was it on or off before I just put a line across there.

55
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,570
I think it was actually OK now it's on.

56
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,630
So now it's off.

57
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,850
We can go around to a side view and paint our model.

58
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,640
Literally just going over it and filling in all the way up to let's say there.

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,730
That looks a good portion I'm going to make the brush size a little larger and move it around here.

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,150
And I'm going to do that area there and the back here now because we've limited selection to visible

61
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,530
turned off.

62
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,750
We can paint right through our model and because it's a symmetrical model that works absolutely fine.

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,540
Only shrink the brush down here and now we're in it at a funny angle.

64
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,490
I'm actually going to turn that back on so that I don't end up drawing through our model I'm just going

65
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:52,340
to colour in the rest of the details around the neck to make sure it's as complete as I want it to be.

66
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,700
That's great.

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Now that's assigned automatically with white paint turned on that has assigned this part to.

68
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,790
Here if we were to create a new group under here you can see the virtex groups under the data object

69
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,730
properties here.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,230
You can see that we can toggle between those two groups.

71
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:19,510
Now finally we will want to go to our particle system and assign this particle system to this actual

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,550
vertex group.

73
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:27,830
So if we scroll down here and we'll get to where it says virtex groups and there are a lot of options.

74
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,970
Essentially the one that we want at this point in time is density.

75
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,190
When you click on that it gives us the two in this case the new one.

76
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,000
I've just created called group.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,310
It gives us the body one.

78
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,060
So we select that and there we are.

79
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,590
We're all done if we turn back on our.

80
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,620
Particle system at the top here you will see that the hair is now wrapped around the body and the body

81
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,310
only.

82
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,740
Now of course at this point we know that there are enough hairs to cover the entire bunny So there are

83
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,400
probably too many hairs at this point in time just around this part of the body.

84
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Now we're going to have to click free edit and remove all the changes that have been done so go Fluffy

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,250
again because I know for a fact that there are too many hairs in this bunny now for just the body.

86
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,220
So we can go in and start editing again so I'm going to get it down to a thousand and I'm seeing twenty

87
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,120
five.

88
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,490
And again I'm just going to render that really quickly and see what it looks like.

89
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,250
That's probably a little sparse as we can see there.

90
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,160
But again that's not how we're going to view it.

91
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,600
Finally sir let's go back to the 3-d view and let's go to particle edits and just comb them around.

92
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,610
So it looks roughly right.

93
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,000
So if we got both sides no we haven't got both sides.

94
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,980
Let's comb them round like this and then go back to render and render the image.

95
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,420
Oh I've done that thing again where I've not hopped out a particle edit.

96
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,030
So now it's looking like that we go and render it.

97
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,690
So it's a hundred children remember it's the renderer here we can see that that's just about right.

98
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,760
There's a little bit around the neck here where it's not quite full.

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,340
So I'm going to try increasing the number of children rather than the number of actual hairs.

100
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,690
I'm going to read render the image and see how that comes out.

101
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,330
That looks much better.

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,650
I'm going to leave it like that for the moment.

103
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,250
Of course I'm free to come back to these at any point.

104
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,320
But the moment you go to freeholder you lose the combing that we've just done.

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,160
Hello it's Michael from the future here just to give you a few more tips on mirroring.

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,150
When it comes to weight painting not included previously but is now.

107
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,450
So the first thing we're going to be doing here is replacing this default cube in our scene with a sphere.

108
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,000
Reason for that is we are virtex painting it would help if we've got a few more vertices to paint on.

109
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,710
Okay.

110
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,660
The first thing I'm going to do in this particular case is duplicate shift Andy.

111
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,060
So they're not linked duplicates and move a sphere back along here along the y axis.

112
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,880
And I'm going to duplicate again to move it this way on the y axis.

113
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm going to duplicate again on the x-axis and duplicate again on the x axis this way.

114
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,040
Okay these two closest to us I'm going to do something with their origins I'm going to put their origins

115
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,370
back at the centre now because the 3-d cursor is at the centre.

116
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,450
I can just confirm that we're shifting and see.

117
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,670
Now I can go ahead and set the origin in the tall shelf to the 3-d cursor and do the same to this one

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,460
that's on the along the y axis as well.

119
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,170
Now this is going to be a bit of hopping in and out of different modes as far as this one along the

120
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:45,690
back I'm going to go into white paint mode and before I start painting and putting a weights on any

121
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,630
of these vertices I'm going to go over to the tall shelf and change it to the options tab.

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,280
Now under the options tab there's an X mirror.

123
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,370
And if we click on that now you can see that along the y axis anything that's on there is now being

124
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,610
duplicated which is incredibly useful when it comes to anything that happens to be symmetrical.

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,270
Now just a warning if you hopped into edit married and tried to move the mesh you might get something

126
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:15,000
like that happening and that is because the exit mirror function that you've just enabled is still toggled

127
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,040
on and then undo that for the moment and carry on with the demonstration and then go back into object

128
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,100
mode and so that this one in the middle go to white paint and once in weight paints what I can do there

129
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,240
is go ahead and all exterior make sure it's turned on me see it and it mirrors along there.

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,650
And then next to this one over here which has an origin in a different place.

131
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,240
So white paint make sure X mirror is turned on and that is also working perfect.

132
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,270
Now let's go ahead over here and paint these final two that are along the x axis.

133
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,050
So we've got this one here and this one here we'll start with the one with the origin in its centre.

134
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,770
Now this is the key to what I'm trying to demonstrate.

135
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,450
If the origin is in the centre when it comes to weight painting what we can do is turn on its mirror

136
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,310
and it will still work so it doesn't have to be along this y axis in order to work.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,610
However the origin does have to be in the middle so that with the origin here it's that y axis that

138
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,180
passes through there that it will be mirrored around.

139
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,890
If we go ahead and select this other one and try and do that what we'll find when we try and wait paint

140
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,150
is there will be no mirroring because what it's trying to do is mirror with a mesh that's all the way

141
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,980
on the other side over here.

142
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,080
However to demonstrate this actually working what we can do is select all of this in object mode this

143
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,230
object this sphere go to our modifiers and I'm going to really quickly go to add modifying go to the

144
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,110
mirror modifier and just make sure it's on the x axis and then click apply.

145
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,390
Now we have.

146
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:55,920
A single mesh object that shares mesh around a common origin.

147
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,970
Now what we can do is go to white paint.

148
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,960
And what you'll see is all it has actually applied the mirror.

149
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,530
Let's just see if it's applying the mirror.

150
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,820
Yes it's going that way.

151
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,110
Let's go back and subtract So we're changing under the tools the brush type we're going to change it

152
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,780
to subtract so we can come in and there we go.

153
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,690
It is working as you would expect it to.

154
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,670
But that's because we're mirroring about the origin.

155
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,730
Whenever you use the X mirror now just a word of warning here sometimes this does work as you'd expect

156
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,280
it to.

157
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,670
And that happens with quite a few things in blender.

158
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,790
The simplest thing to do is just tab in and out of the mode that you're in.

159
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,840
And it usually then starts working again.

160
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,830
And now of course it's time for a challenge.

161
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,760
I would like you to add hair to the rest of our bunny create virtex groups for a head is whiskers.

162
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,920
So think about where they come from and the chest.

163
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,080
Create new particle systems for these areas.

164
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,330
White paint the appropriate areas and assign those particle systems to those areas.

165
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,400
So balls are video now and give that a go.

166
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,400
Okay guys.

167
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,470
Welcome back.

168
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,980
Let's hop straight back over into blender.

169
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,470
Okay so we have the body assigned.

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,150
Let's go straight to n just create the rest of the groups that we need.

171
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:25,780
So there was head and then there was years whiskers and finally chest.

172
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,180
So we're going to have a big plume at the front of our bunny.

173
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,600
Okay.

174
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,090
Brilliant.

175
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,750
And we might have to assign some different hair types at some point.

176
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,950
But for the moment let's actually colour these in this century so we're going to go round to the head.

177
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm going to hide our particle system so it's not in the way and doesn't slow down the viewport and

178
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,480
hop over into the 3-d view.

179
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:55,870
When I go round to the side and I want that side I will press the right keys one day and let's colorin

180
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,770
the head.

181
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,490
I hope we're on the head yet head is selected.

182
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,360
So let's go to Weight paint and literally colour in our head.

183
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,220
There's one thing we're going to have to bear in mind when doing this.

184
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,330
So that's that.

185
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,320
There let's go round.

186
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,190
Oh I didn't have a limited selection turned off.

187
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,340
So let's go through in just whizzo real quick.

188
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,740
That area there.

189
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,180
I should have included most of it.

190
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,960
Okay so let's turn it back on again and go round the top of the head.

191
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,720
And this area here some of to make the brush size a little smaller.

192
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,820
Come in and literally just go over the top of here with the strength that one.

193
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,280
So it's an absolute certainty that that's where I want here.

194
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,120
And I appear to have applied a little bit here.

195
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,980
Now I want to go to.

196
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,580
So we're subtract subtract and just go here.

197
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,840
There we go.

198
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:02,770
So you will have that occasionally when you go backwards and forwards and end up drawing over another

199
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,670
part of the model.

200
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,630
Don't worry if you do it because she can always undo it.

201
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,150
Carrie that's looking pretty good.

202
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,200
There's a tiny bit of tidying here to be done.

203
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,090
Oh subtracts.

204
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,850
She got a much lower strength by the looks of it.

205
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,030
Hey let's spin round once more and just get rid of those final bits.

206
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,580
Of course the eyes themselves.

207
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,160
We don't want any hairs going in the eyes.

208
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,360
So I'm going to lock it into this view again and because it's a mirror what I can do is make sure I'm

209
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,260
painting through the model and going oh I'm going a bit far then we can undo that.

210
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,180
It's make the radius just a little bit bigger initially.

211
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,700
So I can do that.

212
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,480
Excellent.

213
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,230
Okay.

214
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,590
So there's no hairs going to be growing in the base.

215
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,570
But there is a bit of a top here and bottom.

216
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,040
Now in order to do that I'm not going to be able to essentially mirror it.

217
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,640
I will have to do it manually so I'm going to have to have a smaller brush.

218
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,290
And literally.

219
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,910
Limited selection turned on limited selection to visible turned on.

220
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Go around and do that there.

221
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
I mean here.

222
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,270
That's starting to look much better.

223
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,030
And I was around here.

224
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,970
Occasionally you will make a mistake doing this.

225
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,240
I suggest stopping every now and again and going at it again.

226
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,950
Kovats Looking good it's a bit ominous.

227
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,980
Being so close to the bunny.

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,310
Okay let's do this one here.

229
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,330
So we're almost there.

230
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm pretty happy with that especially with the length of hair around.

231
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,940
But then there's the mouth and nose area all gone inside our model.

232
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,370
So fortunately that's roughly the right size for me and I'm going to try this.

233
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,820
It might not work but that's will keep hairs away from the mouth region as well.

234
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,130
Now give us a bit more fidelity with the hairs brilliant So that's the head.

235
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,800
Done.

236
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,970
We need to create a particle system for it.

237
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:13,050
And we are going to go in and create a new particle system and called it head.

238
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:22,820
Now here what we can do is pick the body hair one which looks like that and make it a unique user by

239
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,640
clicking on this number.

240
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,600
So announcer's body has 0 0 1 and we're going to call it head hair.

241
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:35,140
So that gives us the opportunity to not have to recreate all of the settings we had before.

242
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,760
The only thing we will have to do is go down here and go to density and set it to the head which it

243
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:47,150
will now do and we can see there that's that that's much better in fact through not got hair in the

244
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,730
eye socket it comes over a little.

245
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,570
And we don't have any hair around here.

246
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:59,120
Now bearing in mind this hair's going to be shorter so we can make it smaller now go here hair length

247
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,120
and bring it right back.

248
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,630
The density itself is actually going to have to be quite high otherwise because it's shorter we won't

249
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:16,040
see it so let's comb that back and down and around here that's just combed that round.

250
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,770
Spin round the other side and comb that backhand around.

251
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
And down here.

252
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,280
Okay I'm happy leaving a few stragglers for the moments.

253
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,910
That's just make sure they're going in the right general direction and the back of a head of course

254
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,210
comb that down it's always seems funny.

255
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:34,880
Right.

256
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,690
Let's hop into object mode and just see how that looks.

257
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,890
Looking pretty good.

258
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,940
Let's unhide the eyes so we can see what's going on again and just render the image and see how that

259
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,410
looks OK.

260
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,420
We can see the density of the hair is good for the head still a bit of a bald patch here.

261
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,230
So we're going to have to do something to cover that up or do something with that but we can come back

262
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,560
to that in a bit and there's a bit of roughness on the actual rabbit's face around here but otherwise

263
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,690
that looks pretty good in 3D view.

264
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,470
If we look at the front.

265
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,760
Ah I can see actually as we move around I can see a tusk the buff this I and a tough just there.

266
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,960
Some of them to go back around in two parts Collider and just brush that along there.

267
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,740
And it was just here and brush that as well.

268
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:31,890
Of course we can reduce the strength of this brushing as well which will help massively in fact the.

269
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,750
Distance from the face if we lower that a little more we can get a better brush or better style of hair

270
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,080
because it will be closer hugging to the face as we go round.

271
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,760
And of course you can style it round the eyes as well as lots of stuff you can do here to make sure

272
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,190
that the model is nice and clean.

273
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,740
Again that's that bit done.

274
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,800
Let's go around the eye here.

275
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,290
There we go there looks pretty good.

276
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,150
Now we might need more he is actually more.

277
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,230
We can't go back and do it now but the number we might need to increase it to get a better better feel

278
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,570
of it.

279
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,710
But that looks pretty good around there.

280
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,280
And obviously the you do end up with hairs around the eyes too much anyway.

281
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,700
It's a bit fluffy there.

282
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,020
So I think we just need to brush that back.

283
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,420
And again you can go back oh you can actually see that these are a bit tough.

284
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,200
Anyway so if we straighten those out that will flow around the eyes pretty well.

285
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,330
Excellent.

286
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,110
So let's hop into object mode again.

287
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,590
That's a much better appreciation of what's going on there.

288
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:46,570
And of course around the mouth area as well so we just want to keep the hairs basically away from the

289
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,270
mouth so depending on which way they start and go from these and these are as you can see the kinks

290
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,760
there those of the segments so if we just guided to around that's increase the strength from the radius

291
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:04,140
ever so slightly or not that much in fact that's decreased both ever so slightly there we go.

292
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:13,150
Pull that down pull these down and eventually we get ourselves into a lovely position when it comes

293
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,400
to our rabbits fur.

294
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,920
Okay let's go back and render that out and see how that looks.

295
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,210
Oh I've done it again kind of object mode and then render that out and see how that looks.

296
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,780
That looks much much better.

297
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:37,520
So I'm going to speed the video up now as I go through the hairs coming here for the ears themselves

298
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,410
not about when it comes to the whiskers.

299
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,700
So let's sort out a chest and ears.

300
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,200
Okay so finally the whiskers.

301
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,870
So I've got V wisk at area set up.

302
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,370
But this is one of these places where you're going to want to make sure that your particle system we

303
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,820
haven't added it yet so let's go and had whiskers in.

304
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,750
Now I don't need to duplicate a previous particle system here but I do need changes to hair type.

305
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:14,470
And down here said the density are two whiskers going to keep it to these hair in here.

306
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay that's a bit funny.

307
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,430
We've got very long whiskers.

308
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,190
So for a start there aren't that many whiskers.

309
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,110
We will need to reduce the number.

310
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,330
So on a mission.

311
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,590
Oh we can't do it was in particle edit mode on a mission.

312
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:38,110
I'm going to go for 16 and they're not that long so let's go for a length of one maybe less of these

313
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,370
maybe eight.

314
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,570
And let's try different seeds which randomizers it's a little I quite liked.

315
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,520
No one actually.

316
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,610
There we go.

317
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,510
Maybe 10 or so.

318
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,010
Okay so there's lots of also things you can do here.

319
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,920
So they're coming out the very weird angle coming out here but that's not a problem.

320
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,580
So a bit of a discrepancy with the number here.

321
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,920
So I'm going to go back to free edits and remove it.

322
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,750
I've just noticed as like three over the side and whatever the number left is over the other side so

323
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,880
let's hop into object mode and see if we can take it down to 10.

324
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,600
And just change the seed until we end up with the right number on both sides.

325
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,510
I think that's probably the easiest way of doing this.

326
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,690
So you can see some signs that that distribution was quite good.

327
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,530
Looks to be about four on both sides there are.

328
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,370
And now we just need to deal with how it's looking so from the top.

329
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,030
Let's go into particle edit and pull them outwards.

330
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:46,460
And from the front view or the rear view that's go to the front view Yeah that's absolutely fine for

331
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,920
the moment we can deal with more of that later and the fluff itself for the chest.

332
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,040
I haven't actually done that in any detail so let's go to the chest.

333
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,480
It's nice and I'm actually going to go here and go to length and by the chest top of the chest I want

334
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,490
that to grow out a little more on both sides and is going to make sure it has applied to both sides.

335
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,170
Yes it has.

336
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,500
Perfect.

337
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,300
I don't know what it's going to look like but let's go to a rendered image or I've done it once again

338
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,940
go into object mode first and then go to render image and see how that looks.

339
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,570
Excellent.

340
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,110
That's starting to look very good.

341
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,800
I still haven't dealt with this tuft of hair or missing hair at the back here.

342
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,430
But we will worry about that for the moment.

343
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,640
Again we're still in a prototyping phase at the moment but we've got all the different parts of the

344
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,200
hair all sorted out.

345
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,720
So there we go.

346
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,800
We've got that challenge was a bit of a big challenge wasn't it.

347
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,750
But we've got that now.

348
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:56,380
So now go ahead and share your new hairy rabbits with us over in the discussions.

349
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,030
I will see you guys in the next lecture.
