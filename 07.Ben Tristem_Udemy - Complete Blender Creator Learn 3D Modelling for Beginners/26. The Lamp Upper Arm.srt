00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,430
Okay in this lecture we're going to dive straight into a challenge.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,350
So what I'd like you to do is create the upper arm of your lamp.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,600
When you've done that at the appropriate bone to the armature parent the upper arm mesh objects to the

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,950
upper arm bone constrain the upper arms movement we don't want it just twirling in circles or just going

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,880
off to the side check your naming and check your transforms as you go.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,100
The video now and give that a go okay.

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,140
Everybody welcome back.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,430
It's happened over into a blender and create the upper arm of our lamp Okay everybody Welcome back into

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,250
blender.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:52,460
The easiest way that I think we're going to go about doing this is to select all we need to reset some

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,040
stuff here by the looks of it it's gone slightly askew or we've got it in a pose in pose mode.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,700
We have I'm going to switch this so we don't lose any sets that we've got at the moment.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,150
I'm going to go to my pose itself and set it to its rest position because then when I go into edit mode

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,260
everything is where we want it to be.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:16,850
I'm going to select this part of the tail rather of the tail point of the bone and I'm going to go shift

16
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,480
an ass and move the cursor to select it.

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,380
Now we can go ahead or want to add a new bone in there.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,590
I did however want to add something.

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,000
So I'm going to come out and add in a cube.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm going to go into edit mode and scale it.

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,120
You don't have to worry about applying transforms later.

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,130
Let's look at this from this angle here.

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,090
Move it in.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,610
Okay that looks good.

25
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,400
That's a big enough gap there.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,490
Now I am going to rotate this.

27
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:51,750
Looking at it from the side by 45 degrees looking good so far I'm going to grab this face here crosses

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,250
the three key to get there and just extrude up again I'm going to look at this from the side probably

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,760
pop it about there.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,340
Now I'm going to make this deeper so I'm going to grab this lower face and I think if I move that's

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,860
obviously it's just going to move out randomly here press the Z key once Z key twice that's not moving

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,010
out.

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,430
Normal to the face even though I'm asking it to do that.

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,300
Okay.

35
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,110
So since it won't let me move to the normal I will simply extrude to the normal.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,080
And then I can select the edge loop running around our model and finally dissolve those edges.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,910
Brilliant.

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,180
Okay.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,420
So that's how it's done and dusted.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,040
We can add more detail to it later.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,310
I'm going to go ahead hop out into object mode select my armature and go into edit mode here.

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,780
And look at this exactly from the side and we can see here that this needs moving.

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,730
So I'm going to press G and move it down ever so slightly says approximately in the right place and

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,920
then move or create rather a new bone coming up here and we'll probably end up tweaking that as well

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,500
with that bone selected.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I want to come out.

47
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:10,780
Select my new upper arm selects my bone and then control and P parent to the bone.

48
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,940
Now before I do anything else naming etc. I do want to make sure that that is with the rotation post

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,910
mode enabled.

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,350
There we go.

51
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,340
It is moving things around as we wanted to.

52
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,870
But it's also not constrained yet.

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,980
But before we do anything else I'm going to go to the bones properties and call this the upper arm and

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,220
I'm going to do the same for the mesh object itself.

55
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,690
So I'm going to go into object mode again so that the upper arm is just called cube at the moment.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,930
I'm going to call it upper arm.

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,630
Okay.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,060
Brilliant.

59
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,550
So let's go back into post mode.

60
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,930
We need to make sure we've got our arm just selected first and we need to go ahead and add in some constraints.

61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,600
So let's do that.

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,280
Let's add in a limit rotation.

63
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:02,300
Now looking at this I want it moving on the 0 limit rotation.

64
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,110
There we go.

65
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,360
I want to keep it local space which is fine on the x axis.

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,090
I want it moving so I can limit it's on the set and Y.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,880
And again I don't know.

68
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,710
I do want it limited on the Z and let's try minus 30.

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,690
Oh yeah.

70
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,990
Minus 35 plus 35.

71
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:30,390
And see what happens when we try and move it it's limited to there and we'll go up straight at the top

72
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,890
here.

73
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,290
Okay.

74
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,220
Perfect.

75
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,000
Up and down.

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,290
Excellent.

77
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,030
So that's everything.

78
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,400
There they are.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,770
Let's go through and just check our naming.

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,360
There's only two things to really check here.

81
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,270
That's the bone itself.

82
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,570
I'm pretty sure we named yet.

83
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,500
The bone is called upper arm.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,460
Our mesh object is called upper arm.

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,680
And when we go ahead with our arm which are selected and get a pose mode and start moving that it's

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,230
moving as we'd expect to perfect.

87
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm gonna select all of my model and just clear those rotations so everything is back in line as well.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,650
Brilliant lumps coming along really well we're only a few steps away from having this looking really

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,960
nice with the top bits of the lamp on.

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,140
I hope your lamps are coming along brilliantly.

91
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,560
Please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you well in the next lecture.
