Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where we're going to bevel a vertex what does that mean
1

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.490
exactly.
2

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.450
Well it means that we can take an individual vertex and we can create a whole new face from it's like
3

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.540
we have done here.
4

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.110
This is going to be incredibly useful when it comes to our finger holes because it allows able us to
5

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.180
create the necessary geometry for them.
6

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.560
Okay.
7

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.730
So we have a default cube in front of us here.
8

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.070
Now we could practice it with that shape but let's go for one that we're familiar with at the moment.
9

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.890
Let's load in our Ico sphere once that's loaded in.
10

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.760
I'm gonna go tap into edit mode and select an individual vertex and if we go to the vertex menu we see
11

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.520
the shortcut key is control and V to bring up this menu and then bevel vertices which is the operation
12

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.890
we want will give us ah ha.
13

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.970
There we go.
14

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.650
A new face from an existing vertex.
15

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.030
Now that is pretty cool but does it stop there.
16

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.150
Because we can just go go and do our challenge now and add in three holes.
17

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.260
No not quite.
18

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.760
I do want to show you the operator panel that comes along with this.
19

20
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.900
So we've got the amount here that changes the amount of that levelling of the vertex we do we have segments
20

21
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.330
and when you start using segments you think oh well that's that's a cool shape doesn't help us in this
21

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.770
case but that is pretty cool.
22

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.130
But then we start adjusting the profiling you realize oh look at that if we just it just right we get
23

24
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.690
ourselves a there we go sort of a circle.
24

25
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.280
Now the problem with this is that it creates extra geometry locally not over the entire model but locally
25

26
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.550
which changes how these faces work.
26

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.020
And I'm pretty certain if you were to do this and let's say you turn the segments up all the way and
27

28
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.080
manage to adjust the profile so it was indeed circular which is, that's more like it.
28

29
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.550
You think Yeah that's good.
29

30
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
But the issue is the topology is wrong.
30

31
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.640
The layout of the new generated geometry is just not right for a hole that we are going to put our fingers
31

32
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.380
into.
32

33
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.580
It would essentially work but it's just not right in this case.
33

34
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.070
And I think it will cause a lot of issues.
34

35
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.730
So my recommendation and we'll discuss in a future lecture coming up why this is a bad thing but we'll
35

36
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.950
leave it to there is to just leave it as a segment of one then the overall topology remains consistent.
36

37
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.430
We're not adding in a load of detail around a small place on our model which can cause us issues later
37

38
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.710
on if we're not careful.
38

39
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.820
Now there are lots of other options down here we're not going to go through them at the moment but with
39

40
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.590
the knowledge that you've now got you'll be well-placed to create the three faces that we're going to
40

41
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.790
need in order to create the holes for our fingers and thumb.
41

42
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.160
Okay.
42

43
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.190
So your challenge.
43

44
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.150
Quite simple one here.
44

45
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.740
I'd like you to go to your bowling ball and bevel three vertices ready to create our holes. Pause the video
45

46
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.380
now and give that to go. Okay everybody welcome back.
46

47
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.890
Let's go ahead and bevel these three vertices. Okay,
47

48
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.100
So I'm going to go ahead here and open up my bowling ball looking good so far.
48

49
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.300
Now one of the things to work out is where to place these finger holes.
49

50
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:22.030
So I'm going to mark out here where those pentagons are because there going to be useful for my guidance.
50

51
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.620
OK.
51

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.830
So that's looking good there.
52

53
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.840
I think I'm going to use this vertex, this vertex and this one down here.
53

54
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.340
I don't know if they're going to be slightly too close so though that one that one and that one let's
54

55
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.360
just go control shift and B  on all of those and see if that's going to make sense.
55

56
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.000
Actually, Yeah but that looks pretty good when I'm just looking at my other screen here.
56

57
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.660
Those two finger holes are pretty close together as they are normally I'm just gonna get rid of the
57

58
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.810
operator panel.
58

59
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.930
I think that overall that's a good proportion as well when it comes of the size.
59

60
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.520
Yeah I'm liking that.
60

61
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.580
Those are all done.
61

62
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.400
So that's nice.
62

63
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.720
It seems nice and straightforward.
63

64
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.680
This is one of these simple challenges but of course as there is lots to think about because you can
64

65
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.400
place these in multiple locations and they'll look slightly different.
65

66
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.060
Perhaps you've gone for a for it to be here and here and here it's more of an equal actual triangle.
66

67
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.720
Well if you look at your reference material I would have done that if I hadn't got my reference material.
67

68
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.540
I've added that two in here and then I'd have had one that looks like this and it turns out though that
68

69
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.170
would have been wrong.
69

70
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.080
So this is why reference import material itself is really important.
70

71
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.420
So there we go.
71

72
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.880
Mine are all set up ready to make our finger holes.
72

73
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.090
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
