00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,230
Welcome to using images for control.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,870
In this video you will learn how to use images to control your materials with better finesse.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,010
I understand why these control images are black and white and create a simple stage far building.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,490
Once we've understood all of this so why black and white.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,630
All these greyscale images define values on a per pixel basis.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,810
Now the reason why I say values is it does depend on what you're applying the image to what you are

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:40,380
having it control whether that be the factor in a mix between two shaders whether it be something else

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:48,070
that you want to control that basically black represents a value of zero and white a valuable one.

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,740
So black means that there is nothing to do with it.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,950
And white means there's a hundred percent of whatever it is you're applying it to and you map this image

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,550
to your model like you would any other image.

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,610
So let's go explore this now and hop on over in a blender.

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,040
Okay so we're over in blender and I'm going to add some materials to this cube.

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,430
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to lift it off off of this plane.

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,130
This x y 0 plane and just add in a plane.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,590
And that will give us some ground to work on if just inverted that there we go.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,500
So we should now when we hit the render button up here or indeed just switch to rendered view it looks

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,700
like it exists somewhere which is very powerful.

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,950
So let's go ahead and add a material to this cube and underneath use nodes.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,100
Among them a set the colour to an orange Why not.

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,040
Okay so now we've got that there.

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,790
We need to have an image to control something.

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,050
So let's go ahead and open up an image editor and create ourselves a quick image and create a new image

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,550
and I'm going to come call it control texture because essentially that's is what it's going to be.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,210
Let's stick with one two for as always and click.

26
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,500
Okay.

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,820
Now that I've created our image I'm going to now go into paint mode.

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,940
And yes it is working.

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,590
Earlier on this wasn't working for me I had to save my file restart blender and it suddenly started

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,160
working again.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,710
I think the graphical interface just stopped responding or updating or something along those lines.

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,080
It was very confusing but saving my work restarting blender and opening up seemed to have fixed it.

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,040
Anyway that aside I'm going to crank this up to a strength of one because that means the centre of the

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,230
dots or dots or whatever you are doing is going to be pure white or pure whatever colour you've got

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,850
selected.

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,630
And I'm going to make sure that this is white.

37
00:02:52,770 --> 00:03:00,420
Now that I've done that I don't want that size I want slightly larger sun than the blow it's about there

38
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,500
and hits it smack bang in the middle.

39
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,010
Perfect.

40
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,380
That's going to be my control limit so it's white in the middle so everything 100 percent of whatever

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,390
we apply it to will be in the middle and the outskirts will be black.

42
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,470
It won't apply to us at all.

43
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,340
So I've got that texture made I just need to go ahead and save it.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,670
Oh that's make sure I save it in an appropriate location.

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,010
I'm gonna pop it in my resources.

46
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,130
Now I'm gonna pop it in my texture's just in case I do decide to use that control texture.

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,350
Excellent so now I've got my control texture ready.

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,730
I can just get rid of this screen altogether.

49
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,970
In fact I'm not going to get rid of it.

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,070
I'm going to convert it into a node editor.

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay now we're in the node editor.

52
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,900
We can do a couple of things here.

53
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,840
First of all let's make sure that that image is applied correctly to this particular model.

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,720
So I'm going to add in an image.

55
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,680
So let's go.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,220
Texture image texture and will link it to the colour to so I can test it it's not important that it's

57
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,330
there at the moment.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,180
Of course that is working and the reason it's not working is because we've not told blender how to map

59
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,430
the image to the model so we can go about that by unwrapping the model.

60
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:21,180
But let's go and make sure we set up the node structure so that is implicit so blended knows how it's

61
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,020
doing that.

62
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,060
So this vector inputs here we can add something to that.

63
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,140
So let's go ahead here and add an input texture.

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:39,090
Call Ward an act that is explicitly telling blender how that is mapped and we can try these out we can

65
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,480
pop generated in and see what we get.

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,550
We get one dot on the very top.

67
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,750
Number might be what you want.

68
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,140
Brilliant.

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,720
Done.

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,980
If we go normal.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,370
Well it's not going to do anything.

72
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,300
We actually want you v..

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,660
How we can get around this very quickly because I don't really mind how this cube is unwrapped at the

74
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,560
moment.

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,540
Just the fact that it is unwrapped and if we just do a basic unwrap without being conscious about it

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,270
we're likely to get as we can see here.

77
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,660
The image on every single face that exists and I'm happy with that.

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,790
That's absolutely fine for this test.

79
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:20,610
So now we've got our image loaded up we know it's work and we've plugged it in and it's on our model.

80
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,830
So what can we use it for.

81
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,430
Well we can plug it into other parts so we control certain aspects of our model.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,780
Now at the moment or of our material that we've made so at the moment it's just controlling the colour

83
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,980
which is useful but not in this case.

84
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,620
So I'm going to unplug that so we get our orange colour back.

85
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,040
Now I'm going to use it to control the difference between two different shaders.

86
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,350
So I need to add another shader.

87
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,170
Now you can pick a different one from me if you'd like.

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,130
I'm going to pick a glossy shader.

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,270
Add that in there.

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,190
And of course because we've got to shaders.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,850
I need to mix them together.

92
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,200
So how am I going to mix it together.

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,780
That's right.

94
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,560
We have a mix shader.

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,370
Now let's think carefully about the way of linking these two together which order do we need them in.

96
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,670
Well let's just play with these from one side to the other.

97
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:27,330
So in this configuration when the factor is set at zero we get gloss okay when it's 0 percent we get

98
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,000
lost so it means 0 percent of the bottom one.

99
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,970
And when we turn up it's 100 percent off the bottom one.

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:41,530
So in this case if we were to plug in the image texture into the factor what do you think it would do.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,030
Remember where the black is the black is around the outside.

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,270
Now I would want gloss to be 100 percent in the middle.

103
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,630
So we're controlling 100 percent of the bottom one is like this.

104
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,150
We're going to have to flip these around so that the gloss is on the bottom because it's white in the

105
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,420
middle when we go here.

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,560
Colour and plug it in.

107
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,820
There we go we've now got a gloss shader on the middle bit and diffuse on the outside.

108
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,600
Very very powerful.

109
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,610
There are some other ways that we could go about fixing that.

110
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:23,630
For instance if we unplug both of those and we plug them back in how they were before obviously we'd

111
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,220
get the outside being glossy which may be desirable but in this case it's not.

112
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,810
So what else can we do.

113
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:42,070
Well we can invert this image texture so we can add in a colour in Verts observe to search for it.

114
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,390
And the moment I put that into our model we can see that inverts the image and therefore where it was

115
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:57,500
black on the outside it's now white on the outside and black on the inside which gives the same effect.

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,750
The great thing about Add in the inverse is it does give it does actually give us another degree of

117
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,800
control between those two states.

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,530
That is powerful in itself as well.

119
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,230
So now we've added all of these bits and bobs in.

120
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:19,840
There's one final thing to do and we haven't told blender that it is explicitly not a colour channels

121
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,620
not colour information on the image texture it's non colour data and then it it does actually make a

122
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,770
difference to our image.

123
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,050
We go here to colour.

124
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,110
We can see that it's not actually applied the entire black and white realm.

125
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,600
If we go to non colour data it has applied it properly.

126
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,080
Now the technical reason for this is it stops blender from applying colour spaces to the image.

127
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:54,440
And that basically means that instead we want blender to interpret that image as a numeric value i.e.

128
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,150
that zero to one that we were talking about earlier rather than a perceived colour value which can be

129
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,570
different.

130
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,020
We can see it similar in this swap around.

131
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,570
We switch it from colour data to nonkosher data.

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,920
But the actual non colour data gives us exactly what we want because if the value is zero is definitely

133
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,560
black the value is one it's definitely white.

134
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,130
But the steps in between are going to be accurate on a pixel by pixel basis.

135
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,150
Okay so now we've experienced that.

136
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,320
I've got a small challenge for you.

137
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,270
I would like you to create a simple stage.

138
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:42,050
And by that I mean that previewing your models is best done with them on some sort of stage not in nothingness.

139
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,220
A lot of the time we end up producing a lovely model and it's kind of sad.

140
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,430
They're in limbo nothing round it.

141
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,190
So it's good to have it having some sort of presence and a ground beneath the objects is one of those

142
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,940
things and we can use a controlled texture to make that ground a little more interesting.

143
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,830
So what I'd like you to do is create a plane under your building if you haven't done already and using

144
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,220
a controlled texture make it have a circular fade and just see no.

145
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,670
Here's an example of the kind of look that I'm going to be going for with the Gothic church that I'm

146
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,890
working on here of course your building might be slightly different from mess and we've got this fade

147
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:32,360
going around it whereas that used to be quite a jagged square plane it's now nice and smooth towards

148
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,810
the edges at that that white that you can see there that is simply the environmental light.

149
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,270
I've just got it's set up white at the moment that could quite easily be a sky box or something else

150
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,620
if I wanted.

151
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,230
Anyway enough of that.

152
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Possibly now and give that a go.

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
Okay guys welcome back.

154
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,140
Let's pop back over in blender and make ourselves a simple stage.

155
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,750
Right so we're back over here blender and the first thing I'm going to do is hop over to the Gothic

156
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,730
church.

157
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,180
Okay so now I'm in the Gothic church.

158
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,920
Mine's coming along quite well that's my chosen interior slash exterior that I've been working on.

159
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,540
Now I believe that I haven't updated.

160
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,980
And no I haven't.

161
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:27,660
As you can see here some of the textures have been applied and come across for the detail that I was

162
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,510
adding.

163
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,120
It come across quite nice.

164
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,330
I think it needs to be a little lighter than that but that's something I can sort out later.

165
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,820
But I do need to make sure these other bits are set so let's go ahead and complete the challenge and

166
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,550
then come back and just make sure all these other ones have inherited the right material.

167
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,930
Right the first thing to do is well it doesn't really matter in this case which order you do this in

168
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,480
England to select my plane and just unwrap it that's that done the next thing I need to do is give you

169
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,380
the same material.

170
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,890
So let's go ahead bring this out for the materials tab.

171
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,690
I'm not going to call it plane I'm going to call it Ground going to be good name things properly.

172
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:14,150
I'm going to go to the mesh data and also name it ground object data enmeshed data now called Ground.

173
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,120
Okay that's good.

174
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Now I'm going to select the materials added new material and I'm also going to call that ground.

175
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,820
Now it's entirely up to you.

176
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,520
You could assign a grass texture if you've got something here that's absolutely fine.

177
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:35,160
I'm just going to go for a basic sort of a green dark green first like a fake grass and then I may apply

178
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,120
a texture later if I do any outside shots.

179
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,400
It's just for the moment to demonstrate this technique.

180
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,990
So I need to now bring in that texture and use it.

181
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,900
So I'm going to go into the image editor first of all and see if it's in our scene already know it's

182
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,910
not something to go ahead and open and go and find that control texture that I've already made.

183
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,330
Okay that's looking good.

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,360
That's in our blend file now and ready to be used some going to go ahead into the node editor.

185
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,770
And I'm keeping these full screen with a rough idea of what's going on in the background.

186
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:19,430
Now I'm going to want some transparency so I'm going to need a transparence B.

187
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,880
The F that's fine and I'm going to need a mix shader.

188
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,210
So let's go ahead and shaders mix I could search for that probably quicker than finding it.

189
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,030
Okay.

190
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,890
So let's plug them in.

191
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,410
Is this the right way round.

192
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,470
Let's think it's white in the middle.

193
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:45,060
And so we want 100 percent of the diff use where it's the bottom one hundred percent of the bottom one

194
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,010
when it's in the middle.

195
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,120
So these are the wrong way round so that's plugged it in there.

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
Now swap them over.

197
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:58,950
Now we need to bring in texture coordinance and that you've he needs to be plugged into a texture image

198
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,090
or an image texture.

199
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,900
So let's go you ve to vector colour to factor.

200
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,190
Colour to non colour data.

201
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,400
And then finally the control texture.

202
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,800
Let's go into the 3-d view and that is looking almost there but not quite.

203
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,480
If we view it from the top you can see that with non coloured data where the values aren't zero we still

204
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,120
end up with information there.

205
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,170
So we need to recreate this image.

206
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,910
Now I don't mind overwriting the image that I've already got so I'm going to go into the U.S. image

207
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,310
editor bring open the tool shell switch the mode to painting and we drag this black colour from the

208
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:46,230
secondary colour on top of the image that makes everything black and come up the strength and this time

209
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,680
I'm not going to make this circle so big and make it roughly there.

210
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm going to click a couple of times to make sure I've got a nice white area in the middle.

211
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,320
Now that that's done I need to make sure a save my image.

212
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,790
She's now done.

213
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,600
And if we hop back to the 3-d view that is looking much much better apart from its position.

214
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,600
So there's a couple of things here.

215
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,900
I don't think it's large enough for the scale of our church.

216
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:21,480
So in that case I'm going to scale it by two and I'm going to also move it's I think why is that direction.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes to us.

218
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,260
So it's roughly in the middle.

219
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay so that's that part of it sorted and looking pretty good.

220
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,670
What I am concerned about here is not all of my texture's have come across as I had expected them to.

221
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,320
So let's go ahead and have a look at these wall pieces.

222
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,200
First of all so I'm going to save my work fair and open up recent.

223
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,280
There's my wall.

224
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,770
So we've got this is it applied to our model over here.

225
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,410
No it's not.

226
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,030
Okay so I've got all old and ball and I'm going to get a sign that's come across I'm going to save and

227
00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:00,270
how I'm going to make sure I enter the other models and actually assign them this material in here.

228
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:08,260
So if I go ahead and change this material it affects every one of the other ones rather than just the

229
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,210
model itself.

230
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,040
So we'll just test that first of all.

231
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,860
We hop into a rendered mode that's done so I'm going to need to do the doors and the windows.

232
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:26,460
By the looks of things so let's go and do that now to open up our meshes door front door and here where

233
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,800
we've got arch blockwork.

234
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,590
I'm actually going to remove those altogether I'm just going to remove them completely.

235
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,820
Those materials and link in.

236
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,140
The worn material wall.

237
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,810
Then a sign it's so wall.

238
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,970
Have a look and hope for the best.

239
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,480
That is looking pretty good.

240
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,340
I don't think I wanted to delete the one around the edge.

241
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,970
There are deal with that bit later.

242
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:04,300
Okay so File Save and let's go ahead and open up the window as well I think whereas window window window.

243
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,170
There we go.

244
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,840
So again here let's have a look at the materials window wall.

245
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,230
I'm going to remove that completely.

246
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,040
I'm going to go in link in adults or remember the wall before give it a link in that wall.

247
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:23,920
I think from a library going to assign it to my model and I quickly hop in and make sure it's there

248
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,730
it's not quite there something it's not gone to plan.

249
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,580
Have I selected the wrong one.

250
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,520
Probably not.

251
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Ah here we go.

252
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,750
That was the problem I didn't undo the right material.

253
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,180
So that's go ahead link in wall has remembered.

254
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,200
And then assign it's.

255
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,640
And there we go we've got our textural loaded Let's go ahead save.

256
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,790
That's hoppin to our we all got a church there we go.

257
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,310
And well I should just be able to hit renda and see how that's looking.

258
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,190
That is looking pretty good.

259
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
How's yours coming along.

260
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,380
Breathe share in the discussions.

261
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,790
Oh that's the wrong file that's the wrong Gothic church.

262
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,150
That's the old one which I accidentally destroyed.

263
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,230
I should really just get rid of the file now.

264
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,120
Or no.

265
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,870
Got attention.

266
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,660
Here we go.

267
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,290
Look for the camera.

268
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,640
Or it looks like I need to set one up that is looking pretty good.

269
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,070
I long ago set up a camera and render it out.

270
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,250
I'd like you to do the same.

271
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,800
Make sure you're sharing in the discussions.

272
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,170
And of course I will see you guys in the next lecture.
