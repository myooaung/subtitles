1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,650
Okay everybody so let's go ahead and start here.
1

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,280
Go to your browser that you use day in day out and go to w w w dot blender dot org.
2

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,230
Now you'll be able to download 2.8 straight away from 2.8 beta is out.
3

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,160
Very exciting.
4

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,810
I can't wait to get into it.
5

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,450
However there are a few things to work through because when you go ahead and download blender 2.8 you're
6

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,980
presented with this screen.
7

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,410
If you're downloading for another operating system you can switch between them but the installation process
8

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,210
is slightly different.
9

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,710
Now I'm going to require 2.8 windows 64.
10

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,020
Occasionally the blender website might indeed change if that does happen.
11

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,900
Then go to the download tab at the very top and there's an option to try blender 2.8 beta.
12

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,160
If you click on that we get to this screen as well up here.
13

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,500
Now that's going to take a few minutes to download.
14

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,220
And what I tend to do is once it's downloaded I open it up and I extract it to a certain place on my
15

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,440
hard drive.
16

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,430
Now that is different to how you usually install a program.
17

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,650
And since I download these on a daily basis they are released daily.
18

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,150
It is worthwhile checking back here if you're having issues with your particular version and obviously
19

20
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,810
don't leave it too long otherwise you might miss out on some features.
20

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,030
So now that that's downloaded I'm going to open up the zip file itself and then I'm going to drag the
21

22
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:34,250
folder across into My Documents folder where I have a blender 2.8 folder already set up.
22

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,230
Okay.
23

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,220
So that's opened up and I'm literally going to find that blender 2.8 folder. There it is I've already added
24

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,800
it to my quick access bar.
25

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,360
You can do favorites over or onto the side bar on Mac and I'm sure you can do a very similar thing over
26

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,540
on windows.
27

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,710
Now that that's copying across what I tend to do is I go to that blender 2.8 folder find the download
28

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,930
that I've actually got I'm going to go Date Modified to get the latest one here and then I go and find
29

30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,690
the blender on in this case executable on a Mac it would just be the program file and I drag that to
30

31
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:13,070
my taskbar you can drag it to your dock if you wanted to but just be aware that it probably hasn't finished
31

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,220
extracting yet so you do need to wait for that to finish then once the extraction has finished you can
32

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,950
go ahead and launch blender 2.8 you may get a security warning.
33

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,860
I'm going to run the program and off we go.
34

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,150
I'm going to maximize blender and all being well you'll be presented with something similar to this
35

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,440
if you do not have this screen present you may have already tried blend a 2.8 and it already already
36

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,960
had remembered the options that you had you'd actually selected.
37

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,570
So currently this quick setup is what you see if it's brand new.
38

39
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,360
And you can even load in your two point seventy nine settings.
39

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,630
Now as this course goes forward am going to be using what the default settings are here and I will change
40

41
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,490
them later on if I want to.
41

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,590
So one of the big changes is if your experience with Blender you will remember that we selected things
42

43
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,730
with the right mouse button.
43

44
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,250
Now that was very confusing for a lot of newcomers.
44

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,470
And so it's been switched over to left and then we have what the space bar does.
45

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,150
Now I'm going to leave as play at the moment.
46

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,510
And later on I might switch it across to search or perhaps something else.
47

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,960
And that's the great thing about blender.
48

49
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,980
You can swap things about as and when you need them depending on your workflows if you're doing a lot of
49

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,240
animation you probably do want the space bar to be playing.
50

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,430
However when I'm modelling I tend to prefer to be searching.
51

52
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,200
So we may switch that quite early on in the course.
52

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,570
This next one's interesting.
53

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,780
And it depends on how you work.
54

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,330
I like blender dark.
55

56
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,870
That's the scene you see at the moment.
56

57
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,700
If we switch it the blender light is a lot lighter.
57

58
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,420
And what I tend to find is I end up using blender light more on my laptop when I'm out and about because
58

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,890
the lighter interface is easier to see especially if I'm and light environments.
59

60
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,480
Perhaps the sun's out at the moment I'm in my office so I don't want to blast my eyes with bright interface.
60

61
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,600
So I've selected blender dark and I'm going to save new settings.
61

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,530
Now though this is the splash screen you might have experienced if you hadn't gone through what we'd
62

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,020
just done and you'd already install blender.
63

64
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,850
So this is your splash screen we could start a new file here we can open we can recover last session.
64

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,750
I've got no doubt we'll be using that a couple of times as well.
65

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm going to click away from the splash screen we can bring that up again at any point in the top left.
66

67
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,520
We can go ahead and click that little blender logo there not the top top one but the black and white
67

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
one there the monochrome icon and bring up the splash screen.
68

69
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,080
OK.
69

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,920
So before we go any further I just want to do one final thing whilst we're here and go to edit and preferences.
70

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,120
Now Blender is very very customizable so you can change pretty much everything and anything about it
71

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,260
but the first thing I want to do in here and we're going to have a another look at the blender preferences
72

73
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,790
towards the end of the section as well.
73

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,210
But the first thing I want to do is go to interface and under the scale we can change how zoomed in
74

75
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,610
the interface is.
75

76
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,610
Now personally I find it useful to have about one point two five.
76

77
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,420
Well when I say personally I don't mean for me.
77

78
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,380
I mean so you guys can see what I'm doing.
78

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,710
So I've blown up the interface ever so slightly see you if yours is more zoomed out all your perhaps you
79

80
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,060
can't see as clearly on the screen then do remember you can turn up the scale.
80

81
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm going to remember to save my user preferences so I'm going to save preferences in the lower right.
81

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,790
And that will save preferences for all future blend files that you open.
82

83
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm going to close down the Preferences window. In front of us,
83

84
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,710
We have our interface our main interface.
84

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,330
And this is the 3D editor window that we're presented with with our lovely default cube.
85

86
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,860
Unfortunately we're not very kind to this cube.
86

87
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,600
We're going to end up deleting it several times.
87

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,820
However I do like it being there.
88

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,430
Because sometimes I do use it sometimes I don't.
89

90
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,520
And towards the end of this section we'll talk about customizing your interface as well.
90

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,810
So the first thing I'm going to do is introduce you to these icons in the top right.
91

92
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,920
So this is to control the 3D view which you can do a lot of with your keyboard and with the mouse as
92

93
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,190
well.
93

94
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,230
These here have been paramount in me be able to use Blender on my laptop beforehand.
94

95
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,420
Without these here in the older versions of blender I just couldn't use my laptop as efficiently as
95

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,450
I might have been able to do I always had to remember three button 
96

97
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,180
mouse.
97

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,360
I fully recommend having a three buttoned mouse if you've got one.
98

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,730
So using the scroll wheel we can zoom in and out
99

100
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,560
holding down that middle mouse button we can orbit and notice at the top here that little gizmo in the
100

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,160
top right was spinning around as well and we can hold down shift and we can do some panning around our
101

102
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,330
scene.
102

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,790
Now it will take you a while if you're new to get the hang of all of these different controls.
103

104
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,090
We can also change our view by using these buttons at the top.
104

105
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:15,330
So this whole orbiting that we were just doing we can click in this circle and move around if you happen
105

106
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:22,600
to click one of the letters or other dots that are there you will find that it was around and switch
106

107
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,320
to what's known as an orthographic perspective.
107

108
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,640
And if we have a look in the top left of the 3D editor window we see it says top orthographic, So we can
108

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,710
view our object from multiple angles just by clicking on here.
109

110
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,200
Now you can also use the numpad on your keyboard to do that.
110

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,410
If you have a number pad now the other ones here the plus as you probably guess allows us to zoom in
111

112
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,280
and out.
112

113
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:54,960
The hand allows us to pan around our scene and sometimes you may find that when you do that you lose
113

114
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,970
your model like we've just done here.
114

115
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,600
How do we sort that out.
115

116
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,700
Well we can go to the view menu and frame selected.
116

117
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,700
If we had anything selected we did we had the cube.
117

118
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm going to use the scroll wheel to just zoom back out again.
118

119
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,550
And the middle mouse button to orbit around. The next two we're not going to use that much initially.
119

120
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,940
We're going to use the camera view towards the end.
120

121
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,860
This is what you will be rendering.
121

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,060
So this is what the camera sees in our scene and we can click that again to come out of camera view.
122

123
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,140
And this final one is toggle and if we hover over there it's the first time I've hovered long enough.
123

124
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,030
We see that it says numpad 5.
124

125
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,140
This is the switch between orthographic and perspective mode.
125

126
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,440
Now orthographic is very very useful when you're trying to align pieces that are the same size but
126

127
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,830
where perspective can make it very difficult to do so.
127

128
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,310
It basically removes all perspective from the scene, So ig a cube
128

129
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,680
this size is five miles away.
129

130
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,200
It looks the same size in the viewport regardless of how far away is in reality.
130

131
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,670
I'm going to switch about perspective mode and I think that about covers it.
131

132
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,640
And what I'd like you to do just to warm up is make sure you get comfortable with moving around the
132

133
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,980
scene using your mouse or using these controls up at the top right here to move around this cube.
133

134
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,480
This is a fundamental skill that you will have to develop and will practice over and over again as we
134

135
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,190
start modelling in blender.
135

136
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,100
So we've got blender installed you up and running.
136

137
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,130
Ready to go.
137

138
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,930
You've been introduced to the preferences panel and we're take another look at that later on.
138

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,530
I think we're ready to go.
139

140
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,400
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
