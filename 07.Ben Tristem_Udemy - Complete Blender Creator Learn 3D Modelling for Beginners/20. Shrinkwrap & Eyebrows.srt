1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,700
In this video, I'm going to show you a slightly different technique for creating the geometry that

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,220
we can emit our hair from will work on the eyebrows.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,810
I'm going to put in some facial hair as well, a beard, and we'll do a little bit of coloring, as

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,500
we've done before.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,090
Now, I'm not going to show you the whole process of me making the hair and combing it and putting it

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,170
in the right place, because we've done that a bunch of times before and I know you know how to do that

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,770
by now.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,190
So switch over into material view so we can see things more clearly.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,830
Everything becomes black because we lose our coloring information.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,200
We need to be in render view to be out to see that.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,480
See my eyebrows.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,900
They're just following the contours of the brown just above the eye.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,240
And if I turn everything off, let me to show you the geometry that is emitting the hair.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,330
And to do that just up into edit mode and edit mode, scroll in a little bit here.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:55,460
You can see there's just two strips that I've got and not a huge amount of pulleys in this I don't need

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,800
at all.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,480
The main thing is that we get the outside line and you've got good tight control over where the outer

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,100
aspect of the eyebrow is a little bit different to when we're doing the head where it didn't matter

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,720
quite so much.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,830
But we want to really finesse where the positioning of the eyebrow is now going to hide my eyebrows

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,370
that I've created already in order to show you the process of creating new eyebrows.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,490
So first of all, we want to do shift a at a mesh and that mesh will be a plane.

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,590
Just move the plane around a bit.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,490
It comes in pretty big.

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,260
We're going to reduce it down in size, just hitting G y to move forward.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:37,580
Then we'll rotate it and then X 90 to rotate that scale as to scale it down.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,930
We're gonna put it over on one side of the face and then we'll mirror this so that it's we just have

28
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,950
to create it once, which would be nice and efficient, just getting it in the right spot here.

29
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,450
Now, there's a technique that allows us to get it positioned exactly where we want.

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,460
And that's going to be by adding a modifier and the modifier will be a shrink wrapped modifier.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,190
So it's head over to modify properties first.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,160
I'm going to add a mirror modifier so that we are just creating this once and click the pipette and

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,730
then we want to select our head big four head there as our object that we're mirroring on Mary on the

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,510
X axis.

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,780
Obviously, we don't need to worry about clipping at the moment because we're not going to be getting

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,350
our our two eyebrows right next to each other.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,740
Well, I guess if you've got a mono, you might want to put them all the way in the middle like that.

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,000
But for me, thankfully, at this point in my life, I don't have a minor brow just yet.

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,860
So clipping doesn't really matter.

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,550
You can leave clipping on or off, just going to close up that mirror modifiers away.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,060
I've got more space here and look for shrink wrap as our new modifier.

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,530
We're going to add underneath deform shrink wrap.

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,130
Click on that and a side note.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,260
This technique is the same as you would use if you were doing re topology on a character, particularly

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,680
a character's head and the sort of thing that we talk about a lot more now.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Blender character, create a course.

47
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,900
So if you haven't had a look at that and you're really interested, interested in getting deeper into

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,760
creating characters, it's a great course.

49
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,290
Check out the next first.

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,160
Here's to click the pipette once again and will select the target as the head.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,600
Just click straight on the head.

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,700
Head or head hair.

53
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,450
They're pretty much the same for us, aren't they?

54
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,080
And you can see now that we should be the plane or better rename this from plane and I'll call my new

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,910
eyebrows because I've already got eyebrows there.

56
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,790
So you can just call those eyebrows if you want.

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,030
Call my new eyebrows.

58
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:30,100
And after we've done that, back to what I was saying before, we can now click on our geometry.

59
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,380
We've got G to move as we move it around, it will glue to the face and a quick insert.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,520
You also need to have snap turned on up in the middle of your screen.

61
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,040
The little magnet makes sure you've got snap turned on.

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,540
And there a couple of settings that we need to look at here with you now modifier itself.

63
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:51,190
So if you have a look within the shrink-wrapped, modifier down the bottom here, you can see on surface

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,010
we want to have this above the surface and then put an offset so that it sits away from the head so

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,880
we can actually see it.

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,160
If you don't have an offset, then it looks like it often is underneath the skin and it's hard to see

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,150
as you're working on it.

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,140
Sanghas set mind to, let's see, point zero zero one.

69
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,580
That might be a little bit too low.

70
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,710
Let's set it two point zero one.

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,700
I think that's nice.

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,580
Yep, that's pretty good.

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,200
Happy with that.

74
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,650
And the other thing we want to do is click on this page button or uncage.

75
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,980
And when we click on that, we will see the end result of where I've gumtrees going to end up.

76
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,460
So we just see what it is that we're interested in the final result, which is cool.

77
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,930
Let's get this first piece in position.

78
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,980
And the next step is for us to enter into edit mode from edit mode.

79
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm going to click to so that I mean edge selection, select this outer edge, hit E to extrude and

80
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,980
then as I drag it, it's creating a new face and it's gluing to the side of the head exactly what I

81
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,310
want.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,890
Looks pretty good.

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,420
I'm just going to create another one, a two extrude and then move along, rotate a little bit r to

84
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,130
rotate and you can see there's a little bit of the head poking through and that's easy.

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,580
We can solve that by adding a loop cut just to add a little bit more geometry.

86
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,990
And as you know control are to add a loop cut.

87
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,370
So I'd say if you add the amount of geometry that makes sense so that it's mostly in the same position

88
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,880
as the head.

89
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,770
But don't stress about it too much because remember, we're going to push this underneath the skin a

90
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,010
little bit at the end and we're also going to hide the emitter.

91
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,210
You'd want to make sure you don't have any floating heads, any floating eyebrows that clearly aren't

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,340
touching the actual head itself.

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,240
Now, going to move the vertices around a little bit.

94
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,740
So one to get into vertex selection mode.

95
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,720
And I currently have proportional entity on its O on the keyboard to turn that on and off.

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,570
And I forgot to mention as well, we want snapping turned on and I tend to do snapping snapped to face.

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,360
So you can see a little magnet is snapping on off and then we can click on Face to make sure it's snapping

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,200
onto the face.

99
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,930
I find this little bit cleaner than snapping two vertices.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,820
Yeah.

101
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,970
That seems to be working.

102
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,900
So one to get back into vertex selection.

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,690
And I'll just move these around a little bit.

104
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,960
Like I said before, proportional editing, I've got on when it is on, it allows you just to get a

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,070
little bit more control.

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,430
I think just control the size of it with your mouse will up and down.

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,080
So I'm going to do a little bit of finessing here.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,090
I'll just turn the speed of the video up.

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,740
You just want to get it.

110
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,460
So the obviously the eyebrow geometry is where you want your eyebrows to be coming out.

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,180
Back now into object mode, and I'll go over to my modifiers and make sure that we have applied the

112
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,940
mirror modifier first so that it mirrors.

113
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,790
Click on apply, and then, as we've done before, into our particle properties, click.

114
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,730
Plus, I'm going to rename this to be new eyebrow's.

115
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,130
You could just call yours eyebrow's if you so desire.

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,380
And then we want to click on hair.

117
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,870
And from here, you pretty much know the process.

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,480
You want to play around with the number of hairs.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,310
I've put mine to 100 to see how it looks.

120
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,040
Also, the hair length, probably a little bit too long at the moment.

121
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,650
I'll try.

122
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,210
Point to them from now.

123
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,420
Just kind of finesse it down a little bit.

124
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,690
Just so it's in the general ballpark.

125
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,300
And we need to add children, make sure that when you are looking at any rende of you that you turn

126
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,440
off show emitter or when you're trying to look at it, how it will look in object mode.

127
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,870
And I'm just going to do a little bit of brushing and grooming.

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,020
Again, same process as we've done before.

129
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,890
So I'm not going to go into too much detail on this.

130
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,420
And at this point, I'm just going to switch over to the eyebrows I prepared earlier so you can see

131
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,990
what I've done.

132
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,580
There are important thing.

133
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,620
Make sure you turn off the show emitter when you're particularly when you wanting to render it just

134
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,770
in case you don't want to see that hanging around there.

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,620
We've done that before.

136
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,140
And another thing that we want to do here is if you go back into your modifies, looking at shrink wrap,

137
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,690
modify, just make sure that the hair is below the surface.

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,210
You can do that a couple of ways, either by making a negative offset, which is what I've done here.

139
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,320
I've got an offset of minus point zero zero five.

140
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,870
While it's above the surface, or you can just set it to a different positioning such as inside.

141
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,490
So it's below the surface.

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,180
So you can play around with those values then.

143
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,990
And we've talked just recently about strain size.

144
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,040
I found with the eyebrows.

145
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,100
I need to have them a thicker strand than I was expecting.

146
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,360
So just playing around with the let's see, scrolling down here.

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,980
Where have we got it?

148
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,250
Okay.

149
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,830
Here shape.

150
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,330
I ended up going with a diameter root of two and a tip of two as well.

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,740
Just so it was a little bit thicker.

152
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,970
Again, something for you to play around with in conjunction with how many children you've got.

153
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,420
For me, I've got around about value of twenty using interpolated just clicking into Rendi View here

154
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,930
so you can see there's a thickness to the eyebrows and it's not too thin and too, you know, too tiny.

155
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,340
Okay.

156
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,850
Enough about eyebrows for the moment.

157
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,470
I'm just going to click on beard and jump over an edit mode so you can see what I've done here.

158
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,250
Now if you've done any retail apology, it's really a similar process.

159
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,100
Don't worry about having it perfect for mine.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,150
I wanted to create reasonably clean geometry, but again, it's about the edges.

161
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,260
Get the edges in the right position and have the geometry hugging the face.

162
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,130
So create yourself a new if you've got any facial hair you working on.

163
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,930
Obviously, if you don't, then don't worry about this.

164
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,100
But create yourself a new object, a new plane, as we did with the eyebrows.

165
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,990
Rotate it.

166
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,580
Scale it.

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,680
Get it into position.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,700
Mirror it.

169
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,400
And then go through the process of extruding and joining everything up and so everything else, you

170
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,960
know how to do in terms of the grooming and the positioning and the coloring of the hair.

171
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,280
But I just wanted to show you in this video a different technique for creating the geometry, using

172
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,530
the shrink-wrapped modifiers so that we can glue that geometry to our existing head and then we can

173
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,430
get a lot of control over the exact edges for where our hair is being admitted emitted.

174
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,960
So the challenge I've got for you is create your eyebrows, any facial hair, if you've got some or

175
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,580
need some, and then please do share with us, render a final render of what you've come up with in

176
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,120
the discussions, because I'd love to see it.

177
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,710
Okay.

178
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,220
Great stuff.

179
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,250
I'll see you in the next lecture.
