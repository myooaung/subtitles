Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,760
This is a quick tip about clipping.
2

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,770
There are two types of clipping in Blender.
3

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,530
There's the viewport that we currently work in and there's the camera itself.
4

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,760
So first of all let's work with the viewport.
5

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,270
We've got a small piece in our scene so when we zoom in what eventually happens and this probably has
6

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,900
happened to you already is that you end up losing half of your object.
7

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,230
It's fine in orthographic projection because technically you never really get any closer to your model.
8

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,150
You're literally just zooming into it.
9

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,500
But when we start panning or rotating around our model we can end up with not being able to see it.
10

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,950
So we'll cover this viewport clipping straight away and we can see it's actually here in the view.
11

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,130
So you need to open out your side by your properties panel here with the N key.
12

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:00,450
Go down to where it says view and then we've got a couple of options and we can see here we've got the
13

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,300
clip starts at 10 centimeters.
14

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,580
And what it means is at the moment we are closer than 10 centimeters so we're seeing inside our model.
15

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,000
If I was to lower that down to one centimeter There we go.
16

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,900
We can see our model.
17

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,290
We can zoom in and zoom out and eventually it will start clipping again when we're really close.
18

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,990
And this is one of the things where you'll need to adjust this occasionally depending on what scale
19

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,830
you're working at.
20

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,020
And because we're working quite small at the moment you will end up with clipping issues.
21

22
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,450
Now if we were making it a model that was in the millimeters what I would advise at that point well
22

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,990
is to make your model larger than it really is.
23

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,750
And remember to scale it down at the very end.
24

25
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,640
That just means your work flow in blender so much easier to manage because if this was much smaller
25

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,830
you just it just doesn't work as well as you'd want it to.
26

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,430
Right.
27

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,470
So now we've got the viewport set up.
28

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm just going to save that so those settings are saved in the blend file itself.
29

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,350
Now the next thing I need to do is the cameras because if we have a look at the camera itself.
30

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,400
Oh well I don't see anything here.
31

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,080
In fact the chest piece is very small so let's see what happens if we go ahead and press shift and
32

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:18,430
the grave key and start coming in and in and in and in and we can see everything pretty well.
33

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,140
That's awesome.
34

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,570
So the camera doesn't seem to affect us so much when it comes to small objects.
35

36
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,400
However the cameras nemesis is long distance when things get big.
36

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,530
So whilst we're talking about clipping I feel it's appropriate to do the camera as well.
37

38
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,520
And so what we need to do is click on the camera and then go to the cameras properties.
38

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,110
So once we're in the camera's properties you'll see there's a clip starr and a clip.
39

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,460
And so very much like we were experiencing before.
40

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,530
If I was to move this, Oo let's move in a little closer.
41

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,430
I'm going to use the scroll wheel to slow down the moving if I can.
42

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,700
Nope still going crazy quick.
43

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,120
There we go.
44

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,860
So moving slowly we'll get to the similar, similar sort of point where it starts clipping in.
45

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,990
So if I wanted to fill up my frame so that when I render my model it comes out that's the problem you
46

47
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,520
see if I was to go ahead and hit F 12 to render something it would look horrible.
47

48
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,110
It would not be right at all.
48

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,710
So let's close down that and adjust the clip starts again to one centimeter.
49

50
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:26,280
Then we see everything then we can go ahead and render it with the F 12 key or of course you can go
50

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,210
to the render menu and go to render image as well.
51

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,050
And that's much better.
52

53
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,750
That gives us the opportunity to share our models much much easier especially these small ones. Now
53

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,970
as we go out to the whole scale of the chessboard that won't matter so much anymore unless you were
54

55
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,180
to bring your camera in on an entire board to one corner of the board and then you might also experience
55

56
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,830
this clipping issue as well.
56

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,760
So there we go.
57

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,500
Those are the two places that you have to watch out for clipping and the camera.
58

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,550
Well when you're looking through the camera we use the camera settings when we're looking in the viewport.
59

60
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,850
Well that's the viewport settings.
60

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,050
Got to love the different options that you have in Blender sometimes.
61

62
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,060
So there we go there's the end of this quick tip remember if you've got clipping issues either a short
62

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,640
distance that should clip starts and if you've got something much larger we can see that the viewport
63

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,930
has 100000 centimeters right the camera only has 10000 centimeters so I believe that's a kilometer in
64

65
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,900
the viewport but only 100 meters when it comes to rendering and through the camera itself.
65

66
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,150
So that's something to bear in mind that you may be able to see a scene in your view ports.
66

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,340
Yet when you render it it doesn't look like it's all there and 100 meters isn't that far if your rendering
67

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,930
something much larger like a cityscape or even just a moderate scene.
68

69
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,500
So there we go.
69

70
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,060
There's your clipping distances.
70

71
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,130
Hopefully you won't be caught out by them in the future and they'll see you all in the next lecture.
