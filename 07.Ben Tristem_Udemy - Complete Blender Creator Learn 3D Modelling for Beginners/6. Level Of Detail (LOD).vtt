00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.010
Okay so we are almost there where we can start actually making stuff in blender.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
But there's a couple of things that we have to do first.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.510
The first one is a level of detail.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.450
So welcome to level of detail or Lord elodie as its abbreviation.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.610
Now in this video you focus on representations of the right size and shape.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.490
But just a block worked models.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.990
That's very important because that allows a week iteration of your models.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.680
Remember higher detail often requires more processing time too.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.220
So not only do you have to input more time but there are more vertices to be calculated in a scene.

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.160
The actual rendering time later on will take longer as well.

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.410
So Lord at numbers and letters.

12
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.370
Well we get a lot numbers are quite a common thing and they range from the highest detail Lodz zero

13
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
or the base meche and it goes up in numbers.

14
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.180
Solod ZERO often refers to the highest detail model sometimes called the base model.

15
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.140
Now to avoid confusion with this we are going to use letters.

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.210
Okay now bear with me on this it will become clearer as we go because we are starting and being nice

17
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.780
and lean with low poly box models.

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.270
We don't know what the highest level of detail model we're going to create is at the moment.

19
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:41.910
So the letter aiza elodie and he represents the lowest polygon model with b c d etc. increasing in detail.

20
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.700
Now you do have to watch a time versus your level of detail so the level of detail and time are usually

21
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.560
directly proportional to one another.

22
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.770
The more detail contained within your model it's likely it's taking you longer to produce that model

23
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.520
in the first place now when fleshing out a seam and prototyping you probably want quite a few assets

24
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.780
and you want to do that quickly and you can test models in you and your scene when you set things up

25
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.540
nice and quickly that is very important.

26
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.000
We don't want to get bogged down creating an assets that may never be used in a scene or we don't like.

27
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.200
So you decided to make a bench in the church or at home if you decided to make a sofa.

28
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.450
Well you can test the model and make sure it fits properly.

29
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.220
Let's say let's take a sofa for a quick example.

30
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.590
If we decide to well I want a three seat sofa rather than a two seat sofa.

31
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.100
Well if you've already spent all that time modelling a two seats over you might be able to expand it

32
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.190
and work around it.

33
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.050
But if you put it into your scene in the first place a low poly representation of it and then decided

34
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.620
Well no I want the three you can do that really quickly without having binning your your asset that

35
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.970
you've created.

36
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.930
And of course binning the time that you've used to create that now lower level of detail versus the

37
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.380
time taken example.

38
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.080
Now these are only rough guidelines don't take these accurately because some models can vary significantly.

39
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.290
But what is important when we're talking about the polygon level here is that we are each polygon is

40
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.930
actually doing something.

41
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.650
It's not wasted.

42
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.700
Geometry.

43
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.210
So we got levels.

44
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.530
ABC indeed etc..

45
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.230
An example here of around two hundred two thousand twenty thousand and two hundred thousand polygons.

46
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.160
Now the time taken again this is approximately will depend on the model but you will find that you can

47
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.090
you can mock-up something very quickly that's our block model and is just a representation of the item

48
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.630
the right size and shape in around 30 minutes or so maybe less if it's a more simple one or maybe a

49
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.340
little more.

50
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.380
If it's a little more complex and from that you can start to derive more and more detail.

51
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.150
So a slightly more detailed one may take you a couple of hours.

52
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.610
Highly detailed one may take you a whole day to work.

53
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.970
And then finally of course we can all spend weeks on a project but we need to make sure that if we ever

54
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.600
go up to Certainly the level C and that we need at that level of detail you may find that you're going

55
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.750
to create something that sits at the back of a room that's far away from your camera angle and therefore

56
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.240
never needs to be that detailed.

57
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.190
So each polygon counts in this example and the time taken includes other art work.

58
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.820
That is very important because if we don't have the time included to make the other art work we're just

59
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.690
talking about meshes now on the basic level of detail.

60
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.690
It is unlikely going to have anything else but maybe a base colour.

61
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.890
So your model very rarely would you add textures and things like that all on at that level.

62
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.830
Once you go up to B.C. you're going to start to want to make normal maps diffuse maps will go into those

63
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.900
in much more detail later on in this section.

64
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.850
Okay guys so it's Challenge time.

65
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.750
I'd like you to list your models now.

66
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.310
You already have a series of assets that you want to create so we can refer to that list.

67
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.660
But we need to bulk it out a little more.

68
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.380
So what assets do you need.

69
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.630
That's very important because that is different from what assets do you want.

70
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:33.480
So if you were making a room the walls are a necessity a certain item in the room a small object is

71
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.740
something you may want in a scene to add a bit more detail to add a bit more nuance to the scene.

72
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.650
Now which assets will help bring life to your scene.

73
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.390
What's in the room that you're creating That's gone that add to make it look lived in or used.

74
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.910
Remember at this point we really all a break.

75
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.510
Complex models down into components.

76
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.180
This is both for easy a building and modification.

77
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.070
So go ahead pause of the year now and go through and think carefully about what you're going to put

78
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.500
into your scene.

79
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.030
Okay guys.

80
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.000
Welcome back.

81
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.730
Well I'm going to go through my scene now that I'm creating and think about carefully what I need in

82
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.120
my scene what I wanted my scene.

83
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.070
Anything extra That's going to help bring a bit more life to the scene itself.

84
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.990
Whether or not I've got a few ideas in my mind of course this is the ideal time is where we want to

85
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.650
be nice and quick so we can model things and get the idea coming to life.

86
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.410
And finally I'll be having a look at what is complex and actually can be broken down into components

87
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.290
so it is easier to build easier to modify and in general work with.

88
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.530
Okay so back over to that trillo board that I was working with earlier I've removed that duplicate old

89
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.920
profile of a bit cheating her having Where least it was down to 10 anyway.

90
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.330
So I've broken my first four into what I need and what I would like to have in my scene.

91
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.150
So it wouldn't be a church without an altar in it.

92
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.180
I certainly need some blank walls.

93
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.800
In fact the blank wall was the wall the window the large windows and the archways et cetera can all

94
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.340
be classed as structural items.

95
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.410
So I've done a bit of colour coding here and um I'm halfway through.

96
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:33.270
This is how I'm managing my project here as such I'm using the cello and I'm using some colours so the

97
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.370
blank wall is actually part of a modular.

98
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.850
And I've got some labels here now I'm going to explain to you my thinking behind this so I don't know

99
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.670
actually what the end item will be but I'm taking a guess at the moment as to what level of detail I'll

100
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.480
be going to with these particular items.

101
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.530
So in this case a blank wall I'm figuring is going to be pretty low detail it's at worst it's probably

102
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.990
going to be a one two three four five six seven eight it's going to be a stretch.

103
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:09.180
Basically it's also part of a component modular is actually part of the building now I could build the

104
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:16.200
building as one big mesh but that would create problems further down the line if I needed to alter something.

105
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.460
I'm a bit stuck at least if I've made it out of components.

106
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.480
It's much easier it's old song about Add a component and moduli it into that.

107
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.510
And the same with the larger windows I'm going to make those surveys slots in with the building.

108
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:37.470
Now that I can imagine the large windows requiring a high level of detail because they are going to

109
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:44.280
be one of the perhaps one of the focal points as I'm looking down the church towards those large windows

110
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.110
that tend to exist at the end.

111
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.030
I'm probably going to want some high detail in them so they look awesome.

112
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.360
Otherwise I would lose out on that.

113
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.060
And again it's that component and modular and we can go down and we can see what's come here that the

114
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.480
floor tiles I may vary them from area to area archways again.

115
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.060
They're actually part of the building structure so lots of these things as you can see are modular and

116
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.100
I can put them all together.

117
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:15.390
Now unsurprisingly the things that give the scene the most life and vibrance are probably things I want

118
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.890
to have in the scene not necessarily need at this point.

119
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.420
We cannot construct this building without some fundamental building blocks.

120
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:30.090
However there are certain things I would like to add in later in things like her carpet or a rug on

121
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:36.480
the floor mats some candles of course if you making another interior you might go well I've got a desk

122
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.700
in the room but there's nothing on the desk perhaps I need a pot in there over it.

123
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.890
If you're modelling a kitchen Well you can make it look really stark but real kitchens have lots of

124
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.690
clutter in them and those are things that models that you probably want to have in your scene but not

125
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:57.570
necessarily need at the moment to get the general layout feel so it's important to make that distinction

126
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.670
at this point in time.

127
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.240
Now there are a couple of things that I've also thought about a long distance away so I'm thinking not

128
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.040
sure at the moment.

129
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.330
I'm only going to be wanting to look from probably the batla Church to the front or the front to the

130
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:12.690
back.

131
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.670
I'm not sure which way round these things are towards the altar basically looking from the doorway of

132
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.130
your major one long corridor like I drew earlier.

133
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.210
Now the altar itself is going to be low.

134
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.340
Detail doesn't have to be high detail because we're going nowhere near it.

135
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.170
So that's why it's only a medium.

136
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.440
And then the ceiling.

137
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.620
I'm not actually sure if we're ever going to see the ceiling.

138
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:40.650
So there is a case point to not modelling at all but you can put it in there's a low poly model and

139
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.230
that's probably as far as we're going to take it.

140
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.610
How did you guys get on how did you structure your scene.

141
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.310
Did you come out thinking well hang on a minute.

142
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.470
There are tons of models I want and only a few that I need.

143
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.660
Often I can have filled this model list up with tons and tons of other items.

144
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:06.690
But it is important to help focus on what you really need for your scene to work how a prototype is.

145
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:12.790
You don't want to be going ahead and modelling tiny items in your scene when you've not even get.

146
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.340
The fourth thing laid out yet so please share what you've come up with in the discussions and I will

147
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.790
see you guys in the next lecture.
