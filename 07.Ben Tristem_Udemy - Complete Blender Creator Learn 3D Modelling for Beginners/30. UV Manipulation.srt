00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,280
Welcome to you v. manipulation in this video.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:12,290
You realized sometimes the Smarts a unique project is 99 percent of the way there but something is not

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,190
quite right.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,560
It could be that a face is being projected the wrong way around.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,520
It could be that it's just unwrapped in slightly the wrong order.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,900
Now we move on to more manual control with scenes later on.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,500
But if it's almost there you might be able to work with what you've already got in front of you without

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
having to worry about anything else.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,040
So we'll be using the U V image editor to change individual parts on your mapping.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,710
So let's hop straight on over into blender.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,110
So I'm going to be working on my corner piece at the moment.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,320
My Gothic church it's selfless just have a quick look at it.

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,400
My new Gothic church after accidently destroying the old one is coming along nicely.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,410
And when we hop into rended mode we can see here that's the corner pieces.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,450
Sometimes they look okay because they're a different colour.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,060
That's absolutely fine.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,290
They look okay.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,410
But around these this window down here for instance of us zooming down there it just looks horrible.

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,400
In that instance so what we need to do is give these a texture.

20
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,150
But there are slightly more complicated shape than we've dealt with in the past.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,840
So let's go ahead and go back and open up that corner.

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,930
I'm going to open up the U.S. image editor so I can see what we're working with.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,150
And I'm just going to hop into edit mode and do a smart u v project.

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,190
And there we go.

25
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,420
We've got r u v map there.

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,390
Now what we don't have is immaterial yet.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,040
And instead of repeatedly creating the material over and over and over again what we can do is go ahead

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,090
and link.

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,210
We can't do that whilst we're in the edit mode.

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:07,330
So let's go and link and then go up to my meshes and then to the wall was the ball the first piece we

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:15,160
put it on it was yes and then material and grab the wall material and then the materials properties

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,220
we just need to assign it we can see it's linked bill currently has no users.

33
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,710
So let's go and click on that.

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:28,200
And there we go we've got the texture on our model and it's looking pretty big at the moment.

35
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,210
Now I've already counted my brick work and I know that there are going to need to be 12 bricks but it

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:40,690
can be very difficult with the u v map to work out where the bricks are extra so I load the image in

37
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,040
here.

38
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,190
Hop into edit mode.

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:49,530
Now I've got what looks like some of these pieces look like they may be upside down.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,760
So looking at I'm just speculating here but we've got this edge loop around the bottom that shows us

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,740
the business under the ground and parts of it are up and parts of it down.

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,720
So let's hop into face select and just.

43
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,310
So that one's up that one's down.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,430
And what will happen is if we start moving the U V.

46
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,020
So if we go over to the V Ed and selects all of the points there we start moving things up and down.

47
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,990
You will see that one side gets up and one side goes down.

48
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,710
And if we whiz round the other side does it do the same.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,670
I'm guessing not because of the layout here.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,240
So once again move up and down.

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,040
So that seems to be working in a reasonable manner.

52
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm guessing this edge does the opposite.

53
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,360
Yes it does because I can see it's opposite.

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,460
It's upside down over here.

55
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,000
So there's a very quick way we can fix those problems and that's by selecting the face that you want

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,360
and just rotating it by a hundred and eighty degrees.

57
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,460
But not in the 3D editor.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,010
And he did move over to the other window first so let's go over it over here and rotate it by 180.

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,140
I'm going to do the same here.

60
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,980
There is select that face go over the u v image editor and then rotate by one a.

61
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,970
And I don't know the other face that was moving the wrong way so I think it was this one here.

62
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,700
So let's go in grab a note.

63
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,390
It's was this one here so I grab that and again rotate it.

64
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,860
Now I have just noticed a little red and Mark has appeared.

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,910
That is a pin.

66
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,170
You do have to be very careful with pinning it can ruin your day if you do not realize it has happened.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,170
So I'm just going to highlight all of my geometry again and we see here that one of the points there

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,750
has gone red.

69
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,890
That means it's pinned.

70
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:58,620
Now under uv's we can pin and unpin with P and Oulton P And those themselves are very powerful We're

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,080
not going to use them at the moment.

72
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,170
So I say we actually want to unpin So make sure that that is selected and then oltz MP and we can unpin

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,360
that I'll look at wire that's not actually unpinning I presume that's a pin that we put there that's

74
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,480
another pin in the E.

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,280
That's what a pin looks like.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,160
I I'm guessing I've not actually highlighted the right one.

77
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,630
P other riego is cleared at that time.

78
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,340
Don't know what was causing that before.

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,110
But sometimes you have to try it out.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,920
So this face here is also upside down so I have selected it over here.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,850
Rotate.

82
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,150
And rotate by 1 80.

83
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,060
In the U V image editor.

84
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,010
And I think I'd probably have to do this bottom one as well although this bottom one doesn't really

85
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,180
matter because we're probably Oh no it does matter because we will see at the top of any of these pieces.

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,620
Let's go in select those in the image editor and rotate that one again by one.

87
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,810
Now we should see when we select everything and start to move things up and down we should see that

88
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,390
it all moves at the same point this time.

89
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,390
Now you can see there's a mis alignment and that's to do with the placement of these.

90
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,840
Now we can move any of these about's very easily.

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,010
So I'm going to make the 3D view a lot smaller there.

92
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:25,370
And now I'm going to see if I can align these bits here so I'm going to go in to face select and select

93
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,210
this whole face here and see if I can move it.

94
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,680
I can move in as you can see I can map it to any area.

95
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,770
Well be nice though as if it snapped exactly to the other bits that make up this section of wall.

96
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,400
So I'm going to turn on snapping.

97
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,150
And it's already on virtex Snap and that's almost head off my screen there.

98
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,630
So you've got the magic magnet and the snapping type virtex.

99
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:59,280
Now when I try to move it it will snap to the appropriate one and it's right next to it's have texture

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,320
is going to flow across.

101
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,270
We could have it share exactly the same texture.

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,190
It's on the other one but that be a waste of our texture at this point.

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,360
And that is pretty good.

104
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,980
I'm happy with that.

105
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,110
But the one thing I'm not happy with is its position.

106
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,640
There's not enough bricks and what we can do here is move the entire object down to this cursor.

107
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,690
So I'm going to highlight everything and move the u v map down.

108
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,800
I peered out snapping on that's causing problems but to move it down so it's in the corner not can.

109
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
Not exactly.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,910
Doesn't matter so much.

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,230
But just roughly in the corner and then under my set the pivot point to that 2D cursor and scale up

112
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,010
from there.

113
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,820
Now if we watch the euv image editor and the 3D view as was scathing we can see that we're adding more

114
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,810
bricks and the top isn't really changing but we're adding bricks in from the bottom so that is one brick

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:08,980
two bricks three four five six seven eight nine 10.

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,880
11.

117
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,210
Twelve.

118
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,430
Okay so that should now match up with the rest of our model.

119
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,070
So let's go and save that and check it.

120
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,060
We've applied this let's look around first.

121
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,810
Yeah that's looking okay.

122
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,500
Let's go to the Gothic church.

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,110
Or your interior if you're working on something different and one may switch over to textured mode rather

124
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,610
than material mode sorry.

125
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,360
Aha.

126
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,840
And that is looking much better.

127
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,740
One of the issues that we can see is there's a tiny bit of misalignment here whether or not that's an

128
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,920
issue at this point in time.

129
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm not going to call it an issue.

130
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,790
However it is something that we need to pay attention to.

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,330
It looks pretty well aligned here.

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,390
It actually looks like the wall texture may have a different number of bricks in it which is why it's

133
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,010
getting misaligned in places because the it is perfectly aligned with the archway itself.

134
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,830
And it I think we need old to some of the other ones to a standard this one look doesn't look right

135
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,090
as well.

136
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,380
So we've got a few other ones to modify.

137
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,610
So they all line up and I'm going for 12 blocks in my case and if you're using completely different

138
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,800
texture obviously they will be different numbers as well.

139
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,900
But that's coming together really nicely now.

140
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,330
Ann is not making it look so horrible.

141
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,730
There are a couple of other pieces that I will need to make sure are unwrapped suitably and a texture

142
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,160
applied to them an appropriate texture applied to them and of course with that in mind I have a challenge

143
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,190
for you guys.

144
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:57,070
I would like you to manipulate your uv's So get your brick work texture aligned across your basic building

145
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,570
blocks the ones that require the brickwork texture on.

146
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,410
Of course now it doesn't have to be perfect to this point but get it close enough.

147
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,270
Remember we're still working at a relatively low level of detail starting to look pretty good even at

148
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,970
this low level of detail.

149
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,710
But we don't want to go over the top with trying to align things absolutely perfectly.

150
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,620
When things are still subject to some change balls a video now and give that a go.

151
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,900
Okay guys.

152
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,860
Welcome back.

153
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,140
Let's go through manipulating some more uv's.

154
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:39,270
So I am has she quite happy with not faffing around with these particular textures at the moment in

155
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,010
time.

156
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,470
They're good enough as place holders and I'm only going to be of minor tweaks and as a say I may even

157
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,810
change just texture so I don't wanna faff around with that.

158
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:56,840
But this at sure large object here and these here might actually be worth texturing now.

159
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,200
These are not separate objects I have built them in.

160
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,030
This scene itself.

161
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
So that means I need to do all the unwrapping etcetera.

162
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,910
In this main scene and the reason of course why they are not linked objects is because they're bespoke

163
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,030
to this particular scene.

164
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm very unlikely to use these parts anywhere else so let's go ahead and unwrap and use a smart yuryi

165
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,820
projects and then you're into edit mode on that and unwrap the model.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,150
Duly disliked everything.

167
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,320
First try again.

168
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,160
There we go.

169
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,670
So now we've done that.

170
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,750
I'm going to have to have a look at the 3D.

171
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,790
Have a look at the image editor and we were on renderer result.

172
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,990
This is always confusing when that happens.

173
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,910
So I have a couple of roof parts here and these two triangles.

174
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,040
In fact in this case I'm going to open up my cinderblock which is a linked.

175
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,620
Object there and in fact and apply but not to everything I've got.

176
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,590
Be careful here.

177
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:11,130
I only want the cinderblock texture on these faces that I can see so it's worthwhile actually resetting

178
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:20,430
the euv Completely and then going ahead here and doing a face select and selecting the faces that I

179
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,410
want so those ones are fine.

180
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,180
The rest is a roof piece.

181
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,160
There are some internal faces that I need so I'm going to grab those as well.

182
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,830
So that's those done and we've got some on the other side.

183
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,490
Or have we.

184
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,580
No we haven't got any on the other side so that's fine.

185
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,580
That's all we need to unwrap for the brickwork texture we need to unwrap the rest of it for anything

186
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,570
else and the other side is very similar.

187
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,430
We don't need to worry about the other side asshole.

188
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,900
And we've also got a right angle triangle at the top there and that we will need to unwrap.

189
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,530
I probably won't do that in this video are do that outside.

190
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,990
It's a very similar process to this one.

191
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,890
So now that we've done that what we can do is apply the material which is the wall material which is

192
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,310
fine now is applied it to everything on our model.

193
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,750
That's okay we can go and change that later but we see here it's applied.

194
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,320
This all skewed.

195
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,820
So what we can do there is go over to our u v map.

196
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,850
What we have an unmatch So let's go and unwrap.

197
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,160
So there we go we've got a much better use we unwrap we just need to move these around so there are

198
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,310
a more appropriate angle.

199
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,830
So ominous us first of all selects in face select.

200
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,600
Oh that's great.

201
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,260
I've whizzed round to the other side of my model.

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm not editing this.

203
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,490
This is a link to one.

204
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,910
I need to go over here severiano That's my confusion.

205
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,930
Some to select this lot first and in the movie images that literally rotate it round until it's facing

206
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,290
the right way we in which case it's going to be like that.

207
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:06,570
I can now move that to the lower corner as we usually do and then scale it up around and set the pivot

208
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,810
point for the 3 the sorry the two Dhikr I keep forgetting that.

209
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:18,420
Now I'm just going to move the corner without snapping turned on so that's roughly over the 3D cursor.

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,640
Then I'm just going to scale up.

211
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,860
Now I could literally scale this up until they match.

212
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
And in this case I think they do there.

213
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,410
So let's quickly zoom in and have a look.

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,100
I've missed it slightly there.

215
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,010
Is that it.

216
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,700
No we need one more layer of bricks.

217
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,380
There we go.

218
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,250
So you can do.

219
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,910
Oh I know I don't think I've got the right number of bricks here at all.

220
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,150
And you know what I think I'm going to get it close.

221
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,550
But not perfect because again we can manipulate that around later as well.

222
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,050
Now I'm just trying to work out why it's gone a bit skew way off.

223
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,850
Nice thing.

224
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,310
I think it's the extra corner a bit down at the bottom the extra.

225
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,560
20 centimetres or so.

226
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,960
Part of the wall there but I'm happy with that.

227
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,460
I just think the make sure that is then adjusted on the inside as well.

228
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,860
So here I said that's it.

229
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,980
And it looks absolutely atrocious and needs to be more like that so that's turned snapping back on.

230
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:34,190
Turn it off again for moving you up in a place in the top corner because it's easier to work that way.

231
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,850
And then I need to move the 3-d cursor but because it's position on the image isn't critical to working

232
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,290
anything else out.

233
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,400
I can pop it down here instead.

234
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,550
And scale it from there.

235
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:56,780
And we need the scale it from 3-d cursor of course so let's select the pivot point as the 2d cursor

236
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,980
I will get that right one day and I'm going to scale up from there until they run once again roughly

237
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,000
match.

238
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,260
Which is going to be about that.

239
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,880
Oh no not there at all about there.

240
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,490
You rotate they'll look about the right size there.

241
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,940
So yeah I think the issue there is the extra 20 centimetres or so that's in there.

242
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,180
But looking at it from afar I don't think we can spot the difference at this range.

243
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,930
I certainly can't tell the blockwork isn't consistent there at all.

244
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,880
It's made the roof look quite interesting actually because it's scaled them up.

245
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,030
Now I'm going to go ahead and do my other parts as well and will have a look in a moment at the finished

246
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,710
model.

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:43,710
Okay so I've gone around my model and I have altered a few bits and bobs and is going to go take a saw

248
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,980
immaterial mode so we can just have a quick look after this area here and this is the one the U.S. map

249
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,540
that we're looking at at the moment and I've matched up to the bricks.

250
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,940
I'm just going to leave this pseudo tiling on the air on the roof.

251
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,860
There obviously is different directions there but it gives it a little bit of interest.

252
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,690
I wonder if anybody will spot the difference between the tile house anyway and I've changed the colour

253
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:12,990
of the door archways that terracotta colour was a bit bright.

254
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,450
Now the rest of the.

255
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,070
Image itself.

256
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,670
The rest of the church is improving slightly.

257
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,080
I've got those bits lined up and I also went through and just sorted out the alignment here best I could

258
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,330
as well because that was quite a bit off and if we were close she would see it and it works reasonably

259
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,450
well from the inside at the moment as well.

260
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,280
How did you guys get on.

261
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:41,240
Please share your newly textured churches or interior environments in the discussions and I will see

262
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,360
you guys in the next lecture.
