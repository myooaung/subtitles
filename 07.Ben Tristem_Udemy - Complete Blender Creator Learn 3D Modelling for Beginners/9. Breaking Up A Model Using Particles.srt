00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,030
Welcome to breaking up a model using particles.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,720
So falling apart.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:13,200
Unfortunately blender needs to be told how to break something up it's not going to do it automatically

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,710
which often means we need to create geometry to reflect the part of the mod or parts that we want to

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,320
fall apart or snap or break or dissolve or what sort of effect we want from Blender.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,960
Now there are a couple of ways of doing that now manually.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,750
Now this is often the most and time consuming.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,510
And it is not advised we've constructed the wall manually that's one way of building up something in

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,840
order to bash parts.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,700
Obviously if that was a whole building that would be quite time consuming to model each individual break.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,720
Not only that but it would take a lot of computational time as well.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,710
That's a simple model the actual brick wall that we've got so far.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,660
But if it was more complicated it would just not be advisable to go down that route.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,350
Now it may actually give you the most accurate model or the most control over your model as well.

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,850
But there's an argument to say when you don't need to use the physics Well let's not use it and let's

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,580
just use the physics on the bits we need to do and perhaps annamay the other bits otherwise.

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,120
Generally anything to do with falling taking something apart breaking apart is actually going to use

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,300
the particle system to help break up a model.

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,380
And we'll explore that in a few moments.

20
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,590
Now physics can then be applied to the pieces themselves that we've generated and we're not going to

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,820
do that in this particular lecture but we do that in a future one very soon or the particle system itself

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,350
and once the particle system starts behaving physically well then we can have lots of fun with it now

23
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,970
affecting the particles themselves.

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,840
Now the way that particles are affected by the physics is controlled in the particle system tab is not

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,880
controlled in the physics itself.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,130
In fact the mesh itself the one we're going to take part in a moment doesn't have to have any physics

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,680
applied to it at all.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,200
Now other objects that interact with those particles do need physics.

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,770
So we're going to have a look at the particle settings in more detail and we're also going to look at

30
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,790
the collision physics data as well.

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,180
So let's hop straight on over and play with particles and exploding things in blender.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,290
So were over in blender here.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,770
And let's start playing with this cube.

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,240
Now if we're destroying anything we want it to break into multiple pieces.

35
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,850
And like we have done before let's give this cube some pieces for it to break into.

36
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,930
In this case it's going to be quite regular.

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,490
I'm literally going to go to a subdivision surface modifier.

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,990
So we got here and we're going to increase the number of subdivisions.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,910
Now I'm not going to apply the modifier at the moment we shouldn't have to do that unless it's absolutely

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,280
necessary because I'm just going to use a particle effect to move things out now in the future he wanted

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,800
to make this particular or the bits that blow out individual objects.

42
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,780
Now that's where you would actually have to apply servais are separate objects.

43
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,250
Okay so we've got a ball here.

44
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,620
Okay.

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,280
Brilliant.

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,350
Let's add a something for particles to collide with like a plane.

47
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,360
And I'm just going to scale that up.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,380
Okay so now that's scaled up let's add the particles in so selecting the US is a cube that's let's call

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,330
it ball.

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,390
So selecting the ball I'm going to add a particle system to it.

51
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,000
And I'm not going to do anything else.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm just going to press play so often.

53
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,560
And we can see what happens so these particles are being generated.

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,240
And if we have a look at the particle settings themselves we can see what's going on.

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,770
There are a thousand particles being generated between frame 1 and two hundred.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,180
And they've got a life of 50.

57
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,370
So we're not going to see any of these die within this particular scene that we've got set up at the

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,210
moment.

59
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,940
But if I set the end value to let's say one hundred fifty we're going to see that some of these are

60
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,650
falling.

61
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,160
Here we go.

62
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,310
They just die at this point which is at 50 frames.

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,320
They just start disappearing now in a moment when we actually attach that and make this sphere explode

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,120
while that all mean is basically it pauses it no longer has a particle.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,410
So that part of the mesh just stops doing anything really.

66
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,720
Now one of the things that you can do to make sure this is optimal is have a look at the number of faces.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,000
So we've got our our selected here we have a look at the number of faces it has we can see it's three

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,910
hundred and eighty five.

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,200
So the number of pieces we can physically break this ball into is three hundred eighty five and no more

70
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,680
so we don't need any more on this emissions value than three hundred and eighty five.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,110
It would just be a waste.

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,630
The other thing we can do here is increase the lifetime so it actually lasts at least as long as the

73
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,410
scene.

74
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,900
Now the other thing that we can do here is have a look at this start value an end value.

75
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,870
Now I'm going to increase the start value to frain 10.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,850
So no particles will exist until frame 10 but they will still last 200.

77
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,640
So some of these 385 won't actually exist in this particular scene that we've got set up because it

78
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,370
only gets to frame one hundred fifty.

79
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:36,370
Now if I set the end of the particle generation down to 10 that means that all of those three hundred

80
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,340
eighty five individual particles are generated instantaneously at frame 10.

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,470
And I'm going to leave it like that for the moment because that's more of an explosion.

82
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,600
Something else would be more of a houseboat in evaporation.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,050
So we've got a couple of other options down here but before we start hearing with those.

84
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,220
You may notice that the actual particles themselves are falling through the frame.

85
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,060
Now this plane that we've got set up here we don't want that to happen.

86
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,770
We want them to hit this plane.

87
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,380
So let's go ahead and look at the physics now.

88
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:14,600
Ordinarily you'd add a rigid body to this for things to collide with but it's not a rigid body these

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,410
are particles.

90
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,510
So we need to select collision instead.

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,660
Now when we select collision you can see that some of these particles are going to switch back to the

92
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,990
spheres so we can see them.

93
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,490
All of these particles are bouncing in and around and they're not really being dampened they're just

94
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,080
continuously bouncing which seems a little bit unrealistic.

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,680
Usually they would come to a settling point.

96
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,830
So going back to the plane itself that we've added the colation to notice with not mucked around with

97
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,350
any physics to do with the actual particles themselves we don't have to do that.

98
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,540
What we do have to do with however is play about with the collision settings.

99
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,430
So if we have a closer look we can see that the whole left hand side is all devoted to particles wiegert

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,820
particle Perman ability stickiness.

101
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,400
We can kill the particles.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,750
Now that just basically means as soon as they strike that surface.

103
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,330
Stop and do nothing else but that can cause other issues as well but it's a great starting point.

104
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,260
Now we've got dampening and friction.

105
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,800
So let's play with each one individually permeability.

106
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,730
Well the higher that is the more of these particles that will pass through.

107
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,470
And that's a great way of if something impacts something else if you want it to basically vaporize and

108
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,980
disappear so there's less the brewery or something along those lines stickiness and dampening a very

109
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,300
very similar in what they do.

110
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:46,160
So the stickiness is as you can probably guess how sticky the surfaces dampening does dampen the bouncing

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,460
and the movement of particular particles.

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,180
So we can see it's coming to a rest.

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,350
But when they eventually come to a rest we'll look at that they're still sliding away and this is where

114
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,820
the friction comes in.

115
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,580
So we can increase the friction factor and play with these until we're happy so we can have a high damp

116
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,220
and low friction and then there we go.

117
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,830
They come to settle down.

118
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,420
Now we're not actually seeing anything happen at the moment with this sphere so let's go ahead and do

119
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,370
that now we've set up the particles.

120
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,690
Let's actually have the sphere explode and see what happens.

121
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,280
So go to the modifier tab on this sphere or the ball that we've got set up and I'm going to add in explode

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
modifier.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,830
And hopefully I'm okay.

124
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,950
So this is too long to set it back to 100 frames the end 100.

125
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,050
Okay.

126
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,650
That looks pretty good.

127
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,130
I like that it's a bit too bouncy but will leave it as it is for the moment.

128
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,960
Plenty of room for improvement.

129
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,090
Now look at that the particles themselves are all rigid and quite uniform.

130
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:54,170
That's not something we want so we can go back to the particle settings and change things.

131
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,090
So let's go to the particle settings.

132
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,370
You will also notice by the way that this is you know these bits as dug into the surface there's nothing

133
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,520
we can do about that at the moment.

134
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,630
They'd have to be individual objects to not dig into the surface like this because it literally around

135
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:17,100
each of the particles themselves the faces that were on that ball and now sort of.

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,650
So centred around.

137
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,320
So let's have a look at the other settings.

138
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,980
So we've dealt with emission so I'm going to turn that were not off.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm just going to hide it by clicking emission.

140
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
The little arrow next to it.

141
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Velocity valve that's a great one as you can probably guess with velocity.

142
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,530
It gives us a speed at which this thing's going to explode.

143
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,830
So while if I said that's 10 that's going to be quite a violent explosion.

144
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,330
And they go everywhere but you can still see that's pretty uniform in its explosion.

145
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,430
Now in this particular case we can look down and see there's actually a random option here.

146
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,270
So if we increase this random it's going to increase the random velocity and therefore make it a bit

147
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,010
more scattered.

148
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:05,080
In this case it's basing it from the emitter the normal explosion of terror value of 10.

149
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,060
We don't want that.

150
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,110
It's probably going to end up a bit smaller in this case.

151
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,810
There we go.

152
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,550
So that looks much much better already now.

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,260
But the other thing is these pieces are still kind of stuck upright they're not bouncing off of the

154
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,240
surface as I would expect them to.

155
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,170
Now we can sort of round them hide the velocity for the moment.

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
There's lots of other things you can play with here.

157
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,360
But essentially we need to turn on rotation and set it to dynamic.

158
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,330
So rotation are affected by collisions and effectors and effectors just other things that affect the

159
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,580
particles some of the turn on dynamic.

160
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,420
And we can see already.

161
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,910
Every time it lands and they bounce they tumble.

162
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,680
Now this isn't dampened enough at the moment sarm going to hop back to the plane go to the physics and

163
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,890
she can turn up the friction I said dampening its sort of movement along the surface hasn't dampened

164
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:04,740
enough sun and increase that number to increase the random amount as well so you get some stopping before

165
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,480
others.

166
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,390
So to see what's happening there.

167
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,110
Yes.

168
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,660
That's much much better.

169
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,920
So let's go back to the particles and longer select the ball again.

170
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,340
So there's a couple of other things that we can do here.

171
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,190
I'm going to scroll down all the rest.

172
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,500
In fact I'm going to hide them as we go so rotation we can play about with the physics settings themselves.

173
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,390
I'm going to leave those as default for the moment because I don't think it's going to add anything

174
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,180
to this particular set up a rendering.

175
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,600
Now this isn't going to be important at this moment.

176
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,870
We've got material but the material itself is really going to come from the actual ball that we're exploding

177
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,150
and nothing else going to hide the brender tab.

178
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,550
That's absolutely fine.

179
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,040
So the next thing we really need to look at is the field awaits.

180
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,820
Now this is telling blender how there's a load of things here we've not seen before.

181
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,190
I'm only focussing on the gravity for the moment.

182
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,570
The others are from force fields and other effect oars.

183
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,760
Now the gravity itself we can change how our particular particles are affected by gravity.

184
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,320
How cool is that.

185
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,940
So you can actually make a particular explosion last longer by changing its gravitational effect.

186
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,630
Obviously this is going to look less realistic if you wanted everything in the scene itself to be affected

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,020
in the same way.

188
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,640
Now if we remember from before the actual rigid body world settings as we saw it here but we also had

189
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,670
a gravity setting.

190
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,810
So we wanted a value that was point one of what it was before.

191
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,410
I'm just going to go down to minus one in this case.

192
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,550
We then get a much similar effect as we had before.

193
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,570
I'm going to set that back to minus nine point eight one.

194
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,390
Otherwise I'll wonder what is going on later Ron.

195
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,270
Okay so we've learned quite a bit now about particles and how we can have them explode our model or

196
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,040
at least separate individual parts out.

197
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,700
And that leads us on to a challenge.

198
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:10,790
Okay so I would like you to go ahead and shatter a sphere so set up a scene with at least three objects

199
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,380
in it.

200
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,660
And that is going to be a ground plane a cube and an exploding sphere.

201
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,690
The sphere is peaches should bounce off of the floor and stick into the cube.

202
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,740
And here's just a quick example of what I am going for here so you can see the the actual sphere is

203
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,030
exploding.

204
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,620
This.

205
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:38,020
The shards are digging into the top of that cube and they're just bouncing and dissipating on the floor

206
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,960
itself.

207
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,070
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go.

208
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,790
Okay guys welcome back.

209
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,210
Let's go do this challenge and hop on over in a blender.

210
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,180
Okay so I've opened up a brand new blender fast so we need a cube check.

211
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,670
We need a ground for everything to happen on Oh gone too far.

212
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,490
Let's go plain and I'm going to scale that up by a silly amounts or just minus.

213
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,860
Then what happened there scale 100.

214
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,110
There we go absolutely fine.

215
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,510
So now we've scaled that up we've got this we've got one final thing to add.

216
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,250
And I did say sphere so I'm going to actually go for an eco sphere because that's made out a triangle.

217
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,350
Pretty cool.

218
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:22,900
Okay.

219
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,150
And it's already got a number of pieces.

220
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm only going to subdivide that one.

221
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,300
So let's go in add a subdivision surface modifier.

222
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,930
Excellent we got a good start.

223
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,510
Okay so the next thing we need to do is add let's have a look at the number of faces.

224
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,620
Two hundred forty seven.

225
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,000
So I'm going to add in a particle system with two hundred and forty seven particles are going to set

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,190
the start at 10 the end 10 so all explodes at once.

227
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,860
And I'm going to set the velocity I'm going to leave it a one but at a randomness of two.

228
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,660
Okay.

229
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,120
So that's that bit sets.

230
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,190
Not gonna play with anything else there.

231
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,400
And I'm happy with the gravitational settings.

232
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,280
So I'm going to start it playing and we can see what happens here.

233
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,720
They all explode.

234
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Perfect.

235
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,780
So the next thing that I will need to do in this case is start with this plane here and I might add

236
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,150
a collision to it.

237
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,040
Excellent.

238
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,050
They're bouncing.

239
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:27,630
Let's go to the plane itself I'm going to set both of these at point five and I'm also going to increase

240
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,910
the randomness here as well.

241
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,660
Just so that the particles are all affected slightly differently.

242
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,870
And when you have to have a slightly longer.

243
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,200
There you go.

244
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,400
Otherwise we don't see a thing and they all disappear.

245
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
Why did they all disappear.

246
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,590
Because the particles themselves have a short lifetime so let's scroll back up and go to the admissions

247
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,130
settings and Lifetime and was set to at least 100 so they don't disappear on us.

248
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,210
So here we go.

249
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,010
Bounce bounce.

250
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,790
Excellent.

251
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,130
Someone go to the modifiers tab and make it explode.

252
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,980
Hopefully anyway.

253
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,990
There we go.

254
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,250
Still a bit bouncy.

255
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:12,750
Okay so we can go back to this plane itself and with the collisions we can go to the physics tab and

256
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,580
I'm going to turn up the particle dampening so they don't bounce quite as much and ascent all the way

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,910
up to one.

258
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,830
So we should get quite a dampen thing but with the randomness here a few bits there ago will bounce.

259
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,320
And that's absolutely fine.

260
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,390
The friction level is the.

261
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,100
Okay yep.

262
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,970
Things aren't sliding at all.

263
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,140
Excellent so I'm happy with how that's working here.

264
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,580
So I'm going to.

265
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,540
Well what's next.

266
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,060
Do they need to collide with this cube itself.

267
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,880
So let's go to collisions and obviously they're bouncing crazily off of there and I'm literally going

268
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
to turn at the stickiness.

269
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,410
I could kill the particles actually.

270
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,280
And then they would stick straight in.

271
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,030
But the problem with that is if this cube were to move or hey that's so cool when that happens and select

272
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,710
the cube.

273
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,000
If we move the cube they stay in place and they're not affected whereas at the moment as you can see

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,900
it while they're killing them off at that point that's unkill the particles with them.

275
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,930
Unkilled they actually still interact with this particular cube.

276
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,570
So we can have the cube brush through this debris of we wanted.

277
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:23,700
So anyway so at this point it may be worthwhile turning up the stickiness and turning up the dampening

278
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,660
and the particle friction all to one then they sticky in as they land rather than doing anything else

279
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,620
perfect.

280
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,410
So the final thing I want to do here is give the cube rigid body physics so it falls.

281
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,300
But of course it needs to interact with this plane as well but have just shifted about.

282
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,040
So let's also give that rigid body physics but of course make it passive.

283
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,900
Okay.

284
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,170
So now everything should fall literally into place.

285
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,600
But something weird is happening so these are bouncing off of the ground.

286
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,910
But not no longer are they sticking to my cube.

287
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:06,170
Now I have had this a couple of times when I practiced and I reset the physics simulation.

288
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,170
I haven't saved yet that's always a good thing to do when you're playing with physics.

289
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:17,190
So I literally had a look at this and turned the rigid body off and on again and that fixed the particular

290
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,620
issue I was having.

291
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,430
ST That's all I've done there I've turned rigid body off and on again and it's stuck.

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,350
I got really confused because I tried filling about with all settings but if necessary turn the rigid

293
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,110
body settings on and off again.

294
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,960
Now just remember when you do that you can lose your rigid body settings.

295
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,370
Now I haven't set anything up specific at this point but if we had loads settings in here that's not

296
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,710
gonna be necessary.

297
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:50,010
The fastest way of fixing it I would save my scene itself and reopen it if I was locked into a confusing

298
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,620
situation where things aren't being stuck in.

299
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,850
But there we go we've got our debris scattering around sticking in the top of our cube and this having

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,390
real world physics as well.

301
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,620
In fact at this point we could start it off just a little.

302
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,260
Well let's actually start it a little higher and slightly rotated.

303
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,340
So actually hits the ground at a slight angle.

304
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,990
So let's go ahead and play that.

305
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,340
There you go.

306
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,690
It's rolling around.

307
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,640
Perfect.

308
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,850
How did you guys get on.

309
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,370
I'd love to see your results remember to share your work over on the forum and I will see you guys in

310
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,560
the next lecture.
