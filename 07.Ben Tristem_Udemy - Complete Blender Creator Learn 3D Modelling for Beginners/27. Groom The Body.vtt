00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560
This lecture, I'm going to spend a bunch of time grooming the body hair of my animal, trying to get

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.720
the paws and the tail and the body and the neck looking a little bit more the way I want it to look.

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.890
So let's get started.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.560
There's a few things we need to do to groom the body of our animal and get it prepared so that the body

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.940
is different to the head in terms of our fur particle system.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.980
And I'm going to give this to you as a challenge.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.250
I want you to groom your body every every body.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.570
That's a little bit of a joke.

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.000
Granted, not a good one, but a joke nonetheless.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.180
Use white painting and vertex groups to isolate your body, your animals body hair to just the relevant

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.510
parts.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.200
We've done this before, so you should be pretty clear on how to go about doing that.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.360
Groom their hair so it looks just how you want it to.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.620
This is the body hair and the feet hair.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
And as I was saying before, the feet can be part of the body particle system or a separate system.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.450
That's up to you.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.940
I'll probably include the feet as part of my body particle system and just reduce the length of it and

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.280
groom it in a way so that it makes sense for my particular animal.

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.260
And one point as well as I have talked about before.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.200
Also, if you wanted to create patches or spots or stripes on your animal, then you could set up multiple

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.040
vertex groups and you could paint those areas with the relevant fur.

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.520
So you have one color fur, say, the lighter color that you paint in certain areas, and then you go

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.960
in and patent stripes or circles or dots or whatever, it is relevant to your animal, particularly

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.470
on the tail.

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.440
You can have stripes on the tail as you go down the back of the town.

26
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.660
That would be just multiple vertex groups.

27
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.950
For me, I'm just going to do the one vertex group and probably have my cat to be a ginger ninja.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.290
So there is the challenge.

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.060
Take your time to work on that.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.700
And when you're done, I'll see you back here and I'll go through my approach.

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.560
I'll start by setting out vertex groups.

32
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
So in my object data properties, click on the plus button here.

33
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.900
Rename this double click to be body hair.

34
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.400
I think that's a good one.

35
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.850
And then jump over to the particle system all the way down the bottom.

36
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.830
We're looking for vertex groups.

37
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
Density will click on the little select to their annual selected body hair.

38
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.680
Currently, nothing is painted, so we need to jump to white paint.

39
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.350
And I find this easier scrolling up.

40
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.040
I'm I'm I'm just going to hide my particle system by clicking on the real time display modifier and

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.540
viewport.

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.230
There we go.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.590
And this will make things go quicker.

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.910
While I'm wait painting.

45
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.710
I'm going to make my brush huge.

46
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.440
Just quickly paint the entire animal, because what I'll do is unpainted the couple of areas that I

47
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.120
don't want the fur to be.

48
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.790
I find that's quicker than painting the whole thing and trying to act, you know, not paint the face.

49
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.650
OK.

50
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.340
Change a brush size, put the weight all the way down to zero.

51
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.210
Now we're going to paint the blue area, which says no hair shall go here.

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.950
Put extra attention into your ears if you're following the same process as me.

53
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.770
That's the area that I find I often miss just a little bit over the years.

54
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.750
Then we have this random hair poking out is kind of like old man nasal hairs if you know any old man

55
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.290
in your life.

56
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.940
They often get those weird kind of nasal hairs that just randomly come poking out of old man's noses.

57
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.160
Not speaking from experience, mind you.

58
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.240
Just, you know, making a casual observation.

59
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.340
And if you want, you can do a little bit of blur just around the edge, so it's smooth.

60
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.470
I don't find this makes a huge difference because we do have quite a bit of Scrabble going on with our

61
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.070
hair anyway.

62
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.690
So it doesn't matter so much.

63
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.080
Can I?

64
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.070
Let's turn our particle system back on and see.

65
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.510
There we go.

66
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.780
Good.

67
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.050
Couple of those four random weird has to come through.

68
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.440
As I mentioned before, that could be a white painting thing or it could be something else.

69
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.510
If we go into our particle edit, you can see that we still have all these hairs on here that were generated.

70
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.160
Just when we do our white system, we're saying ignore those ones down this and I find them distracting.

71
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.000
So I'm just going to go through and either reduce them in length or cut them.

72
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.630
I'll start off by cutting them just to give me a head start.

73
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.650
You don't have to do this.

74
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.000
But like I say, I kind of sometimes get a little bit confused when I go into this view and think,

75
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.630
hang on a minute.

76
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.250
And why are there hairs all over the face?

77
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.960
Object mode.

78
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.920
Next up, I'll focus on these couple of little bald patches that mostly when the camera is looking directly

79
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.110
at it, I need to make sure that it's groomed so that we OK.

80
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.020
There's a big gap there.

81
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.830
That's the problem.

82
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.190
That's out.

83
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.180
A few more hairs.

84
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.160
Make sure that my interpolate is on and count at one.

85
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.450
So just drop some hairs in here.

86
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.360
Just the hair restoration process.

87
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.890
If only it was this easy in real life, huh?

88
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.200
Just cruise around the animals, see if you can find any more areas that you think that's going to be

89
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.550
a problem and fill up those bald patches years.

90
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.540
Take a look at that.

91
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.130
Looking reasonably good.

92
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.200
Might need a little bit of grooming.

93
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.150
So let's start operation grooming, push things the way we want them to be.

94
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.920
Now, obviously, if you want to have a really slick look on your cat, let me just quickly do that.

95
00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.250
I'll put to my path selection and brush everything very close to the skin of my cat, jumped back to

96
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.830
object mode.

97
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.340
You see, that gives a much slicker look much more brush down, which I think for a lot of cats is relevant.

98
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.690
A lot of shorthair animals.

99
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.460
That would be a more of a relevant look, son, do that, because I do think having a bit of a puffier

100
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.790
look for this creature is going to work for me in this instance.

101
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.380
So looking super angular.

102
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.620
Here, let me do a quick rendered as if that actually truly is angular or if that's just in the low

103
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.310
res view.

104
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.750
OK.

105
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.430
It's not too bad.

106
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.320
Pretty happy with that.

107
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.710
OK.

108
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.810
Let's pay attention now to the legs and the feet.

109
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.920
I'm just going to quickly go through this and groom mine so it looks more sensible.

110
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.920
I'll probably just cut the long ones over to a hair cutting, particularly underneath the feet.

111
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.340
But just a little bit of macro cutting here.

112
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.580
First of all, and then shorten the length.

113
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.990
Groom in the right direction.

114
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.170
And I think that will be enough for my cat legs.

115
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.670
Generally, I put a fair bit of time and effort into one of the legs and then use that as a little bit

116
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.010
of a template for figuring out how to do the other ones.

117
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.990
I want to show you this little bit here where you can see we've got a number of his going in, all seeming

118
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.080
like they're ending at the same length that creates this weird kind of blob of hair, that kind of effect

119
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.260
there.

120
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.970
Usually that's cause when we've got only one particle that all the information is coming from.

121
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.300
So we've got all the children doing exactly the same thing in a large area.

122
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.170
So I find what is best in that case is just to go in and add a couple of other hairs nearby and then

123
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.110
we get less of that sort of weird clumpy look to it.

124
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.250
OK.

125
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.790
It's looking better to test Rendon to see how that is coming along.

126
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.890
OK.

127
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.830
Generally, it's looking neat and tidy at this back like here, literally a bald spot on the front.

128
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.530
And then a bit of bald spot, the middle area.

129
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.180
But the general grooming is okay.

130
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.800
Probably a bit too long on the poor underneath as well.

131
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.760
So I'll go tidy that up and then I'll go ahead and do my other paws as well.

132
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.450
Okay.

133
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.370
I thought I'd finish my cat and I was already to wrap up this lecture, but then I decided just to see

134
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.380
what would happen if I smooth down all the hair.

135
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.550
Just gave her a macro kind of smooth, smooth, smooth and see what happens.

136
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.540
And I kind of like to look better.

137
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.000
It makes the cat look a little bit more athletic, I think, rather than my cat was starting to get

138
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.190
a little bit too hairy, a little bit too puffed up and looking a little bit out of shape.

139
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.740
So I'm going through and just kind of smoothing down a little bit closer to the body so that I can retain

140
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.650
a bit more of the original sculpting contour that I had.

141
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.600
But the couple of processes that we've gone through, puffing out the hair versus having it close to

142
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.770
the body, it's a good way for you to look there and see what sort of look you want to go for your cat.

143
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:35.730
If you find that it's too close to the body, nakedness, jump over into the puff tool, puff it up

144
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.840
a little bit, give a little bit of that full body depth to the hair.

145
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.050
Do.

146
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.490
If that's what you're after.

147
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.490
So I think that's it for me for this lecture.

148
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.640
I've got the cat looking pretty much how I want it to look and will jump over into the next one, pay

149
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.450
little attention to their head and whiskers.

150
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.830
Okay.

151
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.290
Great work.

152
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.010
See you again soon.
