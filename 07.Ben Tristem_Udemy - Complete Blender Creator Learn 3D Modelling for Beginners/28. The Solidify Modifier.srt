00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,950
Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,980
So in this lecture what we need to do is have something that is infinitesimally thin like our lampshade

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,570
currently is something to get rid of my default Cuban add in a plane.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,760
So the plane has no thickness.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,310
It doesn't really exist.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,960
It is literally just a mathematical surface that is infinitesimally small.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,920
Now how do we give this thickness.

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,170
And by the way this is another benefits.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,570
If I turn on black face culling and exported this plane into a game engine it would be invisible the

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,000
other way round.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,660
That's really annoying.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,460
In fact we can just demonstrate that even further by adding something else just on top of it and going

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,520
GZ lift up scale in so we can definitely see through our objects.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,590
But if we select our plane go to the modifiers tab and we're going to generate some geometry.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,180
We're going to solidify now the solidify modifiers going to give us lots of different options.

16
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,430
Let's start with the thickness.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,330
We can make this thicker and thicker.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,980
But not only down but up as well now.

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,560
Sometimes you have to watch your normals when this happens but we can see at this point we've given

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,550
ourselves and thickness it's a real solid object.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,740
And this is one way of really speeding up your work flow because you don't have to worry about extruded

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,240
things if this is the case it can be a very rapid way of working.

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,920
We can clamp it in places to make sure that it doesn't extrude too far.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,500
We have vertex groups.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,500
Now we've not covered them properly yet when we get to vertex groups it means that you can thick in

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,400
some parts of your model and not others by controlling what vertex groups this modifier affects.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,360
We've got options here to do with the creases and then we've got an offset here offset the thickness

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,290
from the center.

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,070
So if we have a look at regretfully from the side we can see it's currently minus one minus one what

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,490
well it just means that it's at one side of the origin.

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,060
If this were 0 it would be in the middle.

32
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,250
So separating out from the origin itself and you can see it's equidistant from the origin every time

33
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,400
it's expands.

34
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,650
And of course offsetting it to one shifts it's the other way.

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,610
So it's not really a value of negative 1 to 1.

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:41,030
It's saying Are you one side to the origin or the other or are you straddling it in some sort of fashion.

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,470
And that can be incredibly useful depending on what you're trying to make.

38
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,320
Sometimes you will want it to just extrude away from a surface and not either side of a surface.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,850
It's entirely up to you how you use that's flipping the normals where we're not going to need to do

40
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,310
that in this case but if we did want this effect where it looks like we can see through the box we can

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,550
certainly do that.

42
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,060
And of course that does recall about face coming to actually be turned on even thickness can be really

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,270
useful when we have more complex surfaces than just the plane.

44
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,100
It make sure that it doesn't get very thin around places where the sharp turns.

45
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,720
And as you can see there's a warning here.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,030
Don't just turn it on if it's not needed because it will slow blender down because it has to do some

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,420
calculations.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,540
High quality is a similar option very much like the even thickness it will slow down your computer if

49
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,410
you're not careful.

50
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,200
In this particular case with a plane it's highly unlikely you're going to need it and you're probably

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,490
not going to need it with the lampshade either either with these unless you're doing something really

52
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,450
really fancy.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,390
Phil room is an interesting one.

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,280
It basically means that the rim If it's unchecked you can just see we've created two planes that isn't

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,480
really the desired effect that we're looking for today so I'm going to turn Phil room back on.

56
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,250
But it also gives you an option through only the rim which can be useful for boxes because then once

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:12,720
you've got this you can add another solidify modifier on top of it and make this new box thicker look

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,490
at that.

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,870
So you've generated a whole new mesh just by using a plane.

60
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,660
And that's one of the advantages of this type of modelling where you're progressively developing a simple

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,350
shape.

62
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,740
It's not really hands on you're generating your geometry by tweaking sliders rather than physically

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,730
putting vertices in specific locations and the both options are incredibly valuable to know about because

64
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,210
this has an amazing workflow we can go ahead and all we need to adjust at the moment is this one vertex

65
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,110
in the corner.

66
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,520
And let's just say we wanted to move it in and make this shape.

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,730
Well we've done it.

68
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,280
We didn't have to mess around with inserting extrude thing or doing anything like that.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,210
Now whether your model's made out of mesh data like our plane is here or it's made from curves the solidify

70
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,730
modifier will still work.

71
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,490
And with that knowledge it's time for your challenge and your challenge is to add thickness to your

72
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,410
lampshade.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,830
Now when it comes to this.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,280
Yes you could just apply the solidify modify and be done with it.

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,530
But do play with the thickness play with some of the other options do you want it adding thickness to

76
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,500
the outside to the inside.

77
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,430
He's up to you how you set this up.

78
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,820
I wouldn't just leave it is default.

79
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,020
I would explore the various options that you've got because it can change the look of your lampshade

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,590
itself quite dramatically.

81
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,850
I found when doing this challenge that if I add my solidify modifier and have it on the outside rather

82
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:50,840
than the solidifying happening on the inside it tends to make it look not as I would expect it to are

83
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,920
in my head.

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,630
I have modeled the outside of it so far so I want it's basically solidifying inwards rather than outwards.

85
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,430
Otherwise it doesn't really look like I intended it to.

86
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,960
And if that ends up looking bigger overall but whatever you end up doing go and add thickness to your

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,370
lampshade possibly an hour and give that's a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

88
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,090
Let's go and use the solidify modifier to add thickness to our lampshade

89
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,430
Hello everybody and welcome.

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,780
So we need to make this lamp at the top or the lamp shade at least a bit more solid.

91
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,060
So let's go to our modifiers.

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,550
I'm going to hide away my screw and then add in solidify.

93
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:47,880
Now already changes the look and feel of the shading coming round and the overall model so before I

94
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,060
do anything else here I am going to add in the subdivision surface and I'm not going to have it at this

95
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,830
point.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,430
Notice lower down.

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,530
It's subdivided what we've already done.

98
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,160
If I lift it up we get a much different result.

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,500
So where you place this does make a difference.

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,960
So I'm going to screw first that I'm going to subdivide I'm going to leave at relatively high.

101
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,210
Now this is going to be a focal point so I want that and then I'm going to solidify and let's have a

102
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,770
look at the options here.

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,180
Now I do want to make sure that it looks like it's got some depth to it before.

104
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,550
If we just turn it off you can see quite clearly push the right button.

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,020
It's just a thin nonexistent piece of lamp.

106
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,670
How can we turn it on.

107
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,230
It does suddenly start to look more tangible.

108
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,070
Now what we do need to do here is just make sure it looks the part so we can increase the thickness.

109
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,170
And notice it's growing outwards now at a certain point.

110
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,810
That's just going to look too big.

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,910
We could also grow its inward so we could do minus all not minus five.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,220
But that looks pretty cool minus nought point five.

113
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,460
So let's just bring that back so we can see here when I'm holding down the shift key.

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,120
We can have it grow outside or inside of the already made geometry.

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,540
Now the one thing to watch out for if you're putting thicknesses at negative is you may if we go to

116
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:29,130
solid view and go to the options here blackface culling going to make sure here that we're not pushing

117
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,970
geometries through itself because you can end up with it looking invisible if we're not careful.

118
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,180
And that's no good.

119
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,730
So in this case it's behaving itself even though we've got a negative thickness showing a slight scaling

120
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,830
itself through itself.

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,210
In fact this particular view in solid shading is giving me a much better appreciation of how thick we

122
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,660
need to have it that is too thin.

123
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,080
This is too thick.

124
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,000
This is going to be somewhere in between.

125
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm starting to settle around the point nought one that it already had maybe a little bit more as a

126
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,840
minus point one we got minus point one or minus nought point one.

127
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,880
There we go.

128
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,670
So that's looking pretty good and if we go into wireframe we can see that we've got lots more information

129
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,420
there now because it's it's added geometry SATs it's thickness to it and solidifies a great way of making

130
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,840
sure that objects that are just thin films actually have some geometry to them really useful with physics

131
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,260
as well.

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,560
By the way because then there's more for something to interact with.

133
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,410
Now I don't think there's any other particular settings that I need to adjust here.

134
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,540
So are filling the room.

135
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,800
Obviously we don't want it looking hollow around the edge but it does change the shading.

136
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,310
This is always a good way of quickly checking if you sharpened up this edge here.

137
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,780
What would it look like in fact it doesn't look much more defined like that.

138
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,160
So with the amount of geometry on has it comes around this edge.

139
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,240
It kind of blends around it looks like it's lovely and smooth as it goes round.

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,720
However if that wasn't there or we put an edge split modifier it would look much much sharper and I'm

141
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,790
not sure which which version I like.

142
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,410
Probably something in between to be quite honest which our next modifier that we're about to learn about

143
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,450
will certainly help with.

144
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,210
So that's how my lamp is coming along.

145
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,970
Please share your work over in the discussions.

146
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,610
Looking forward to seeing it in fact you can always render it out at this point in time if you wanted

147
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,220
to.

148
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,620
I don't know if I've got enough lights in my scene to do it on mine or if it even the camera's in the

149
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,550
right position.

150
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,580
Doesn't look like it is in fact let's let's render out what we've got so far my camera is not in the

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,460
right position so let's make sure it is awesome and let's just render that sounds.

152
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,520
It doesn't really matter what stage your modelling is at at the moment is always good to render things

153
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,250
out and have a quick look now I would argue at this point in time that perhaps my render settings need

154
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,160
a little bit of a tweak my resolution I think is set just a little bit too high.

155
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,950
You can see here that the bulb the original bulb that we had has dropped all the way down here.

156
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,530
But you know what for this particular render that's not too bad and that's all I need that really is

157
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:24,160
all I need that I don't need any extra information that covers what we need to see so I'm just going

158
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,690
to cancel the render and then it will pause where it is and then we can just have a look.

159
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,070
Yes that's coming along really nice.

160
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,890
They are like for a lot remember to share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in

161
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,730
the next lecture.
