00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,100
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,060
In this lecture we are going to focus on Poe's mode where we can grab our bones that we've created and

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,070
move them in turn.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,880
The model will move as well which is really cool.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,080
And obviously we've got a few issues with it passing through itself but we'll cover those later on.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Let's go find out more about postmarked Okay so we left off here earlier and we've got everything parents

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,860
ID all do we.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,660
So let's just have a quick look at everything.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,220
I'm going to make the outline a little bit smaller for the moment so we can see our properties window

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,500
a little bit better once we're in there.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,870
I'm going to select my armature.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,980
That's important.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,680
And then up the top here we can switch from object mode not to edit mode like we were doing before when

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,690
we were at adding more bones and changing it around I'm gonna go to post mode and we can grab this top

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,550
one here or the bottom one noticed there highlighted below.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,180
If you've got more than one selected take note of the different colors just like with objects around

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,340
with selecting them the lightest color is the active selected.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,750
So if we select this one here and rotate it we see our model moves around as Reid expects it to brilliant.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,880
We grab this one at the top here.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,590
Something went wrong with the parenting.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:27,250
So I'm gonna make sure this is the bone select it we can come back out into object mode select our objects

22
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,650
select our bones again go control them P parents it to the bone go to pose mode and now does it move

23
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:43,930
it does indeed causes the mirror modifier to play a bit funky which perhaps means the are empty is not

24
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,280
parents it's the right place and making sure that selected again and then to go out into object mode

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm going to select the empty select the armature and parent sets that will clear the previous parents

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,610
if there was one there and then when we go to post mode when we move things around because the mirror

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,980
is following the bone we don't have any funky distortion happening with it there we go.

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:13,930
So now we've got an appropriate hierarchy of parenting and we've set up the pose mode isn't this exciting

29
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,610
we're starting to actually get our model moving and becoming alive.

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,150
Now the great thing about post mode is it does allow you to move your model around position position

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,020
it in funny angles and of course this doesn't really work at the moment because we've got geometry going

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,900
inside one another and we need to sort out some sorts of constraints to stop that from happening but

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,260
the other thing that this is allowing us to do is put things into funky places.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,270
Now the downside of that is how do you return everything to normal.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Well I've mentioned this in the past but it's a great time at the moment to start playing around with

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,780
posing.

37
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,540
But if you want to reset things there's one very easy way of doing it.

38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,530
Now at the moment all we've done is rotated things so what we can do is highlight our entire armature

39
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,330
whilst impose mode and go alternate.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,530
Ah that will undo any rotations that we've done if we've done some scaling which you can also do in

41
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,200
pose mode.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,410
We can use Alton s and if you've moved your model around and want to reset it you've guessed it.

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,510
Alton.

44
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,910
And it will go back to where it was before so that's a great way of resetting what you've been working

45
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,300
on to its standard form.

46
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,980
Now you can of course change what's known as your rest position so let's have a look at that.

47
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,800
Let's go over to our armature and we'll see at the very top here we've got Poe's position and rest position.

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,990
So if we move our armature here just rotate it down.

49
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,680
If we click rest position it will go back to how it was before we did anything else.

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,450
And that's really really useful.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,660
However if you've not realized that you've got a rest position turned on and you try and do anything

52
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,230
you just get errors popping up which is useful cannot change pose whilst rest position is enabled stress

53
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,300
position.

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,570
It does vary from model to model.

55
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm going to have my rest position look roughly like this but with the rest of the lamp how we've drawn

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,150
it so far however in a character you might have them in a T or in a pose a t pose is simply where they

57
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:24,270
stood upright with their arms stretched out so they looked like a giant T and then a is very similar

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,510
just that arms are down about 45 degrees so your wrist position is really important and we can go back

59
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,770
to our post position and we go just by selecting and moving.

60
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,290
Now you may be wondering well perhaps my model isn't in its rest position at the moment.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,210
How do I get it there.

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Well what we can do much like applying transforms is we can apply positions.

63
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,620
So if we go ahead and let's say rotate this by a no no I'm gonna do 45 so I can put it back again.

64
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,820
If that was going to be my rest position of the lower arm what I could then do is either go up to pose

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:08,550
and go to apply control and I apply the pose as the rest pose we go control a bring up the same menu

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
or if you like searching we can search for pose.

67
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,320
And here we go.

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,170
Apply poses rest pose.

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,280
Now when we do that whenever we go back to our rest pose.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,090
There we go it's there.

71
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:26,140
And we can move our model any which way we want like so and we can always go back to the rest pose whenever

72
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,800
we need to.

73
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,530
However that's not what we wanted.

74
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,220
So in order to get ourselves back again we can apply it to the other way as well.

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,920
So what we can do and just to check posed positions or awkward rest positions over here we can go ahead

76
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,930
go control a apply visual transform to the pose and then we go back to the pose position.

77
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,170
What's happened there.

78
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,400
Well we didn't have anything highlighted so let's try that again control and a apply visual transform

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,970
to pose.

80
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,060
Then when we go back to pose position we're back where we were before finally because I want to alter

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,240
this all around again I'm gonna get rotates by 45.

82
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:11,350
Wrong way some will go minus on that and press enter and then finally go control an A and apply the

83
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,270
pose as the rest position.

84
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,680
Okay so that's it for this lecture we've covered pose mode switching into it's making sure that we have

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,530
got things that we think repair and set correctly parents it there we go that's all sorted now.

86
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,530
And we've also gone through Po's position and rest position you're going to find that very useful as

87
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,560
we move forward as it's going to become very useful when we start adding in our animation.

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,040
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
