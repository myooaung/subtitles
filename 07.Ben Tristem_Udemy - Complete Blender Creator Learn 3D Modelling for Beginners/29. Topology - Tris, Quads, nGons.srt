Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on topology.
1

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:16,120
We're going to focus mainly on triangles quads and other angles so anything with five six seven eight
2

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,010
sided faces.
3

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:24,880
And we're also going to have a look at the layouts of particular mesh data we can see here that we
4

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,660
have two spheres and they're both spherical but they've got a different topology they're laid out completely
5

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,260
differently.
6

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,700
So let's go all the way back to our first one here.
7

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,530
Let's have a look.
8

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,910
But the main difference between a triangle has three sides a square or a quad has four sides and then
9

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,120
n gon has more than four sides.
10

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,880
Now that's pretty self-explanatory just by looking at things.
11

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,860
And if you've been playing around with Blender for a while or a lot of 3D software you often hear that
12

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,490
and ngons are bad and triangles are bad and you should try and stick to quads as best you can.
13

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,380
And predominantly That's true but I wouldn't go out of your way to create your model just using chords
14

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,940
if there's a quick way of doing it that doesn't involve that.
15

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,650
In fact there are several subtracting modelling techniques that you can use.
16

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,570
We take parts away from your model and then trying to make everything back to quads again would be a
17

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:33,080
real pain in the backside and would just not be worth your time unless you wanted to progress your model
18

19
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,520
further.
19

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,250
So let's have a look and see what happens in the background with these particular objects.
20

21
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,860
So I'm going to select everything and go control and T.
21

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,180
This will triangulate all of the faces.
22

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,200
This is what's really going on in the background regardless of what you think you're doing all of this
23

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,020
has to be converted to triangles in order to render it.
24

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,120
So this is just exposing roughly what might happen if you render your model or if you export it to a
25

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,800
game engine.
26

27
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,110
This will be happening so let's have a look at what's happened.
27

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,510
I'm going to switch across to edge select so that the edges are just that little bit bolder than they
28

29
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,650
were before.
29

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,360
So here we can see that the triangle has been made into a triangle it hasn't changed at all and we have
30

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,530
a look at the rest of the model itself it looks like it's just split the quad straight across and the
31

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,940
same is true of the cube.
32

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,410
You can see here it's been split pretty evenly.
33

34
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,290
This one here.
34

35
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,430
Well it's kind of been split a bit random along the top.
35

36
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,510
We've had no control how that has been splits up.
36

37
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:50,420
You may have preferred it to be split up into five triangles along the top and have the pole in the
37

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,750
middle.
38

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,560
Very similar to how you have a pole at the top of this u v sphere.
39

40
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,870
If we have a look at the U V sphere Well the top parts of it is triangles any way.
40

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,000
And the rest is a series of quads.
41

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,740
But now that everything is being triangulated you can no longer access the rings running around the
42

43
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,600
U V sphere that used to be able to access and you cannot do any loop cuts.
43

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,680
This is the power of remaining with a quad.
44

45
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,300
So if we go back to everything being quads should just take a couple of undo steps to get there.
45

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,290
There we go.
46

47
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,710
We should now find that I'm able across these quads here but not over the top all the way around on
47

48
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:42,710
my cube and essentially because this is a three sided cylinder and this is a five sided cylinder it
48

49
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,120
will act the same both way so if I go control and are we can add in loop cuts on this side.
49

50
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,890
We cannot go any other way though it would look like you can cut up but that's just because we've added
50

51
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:03,180
these new loops and by doing that we can only do on this one face the cube however is a completely different
51

52
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,620
matter.
52

53
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,060
I can add in many many loop cuts all the time and continuously.
53

54
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,870
And the reason for that is because every time I add one it keeps the quads consistent and that means
54

55
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,630
you can continue cutting up your cube again and again and again.
55

56
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,900
And that's true of subdivision as well.
56

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,960
You get a smaller version of what was once there and that's the important and critical thing when it
57

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,710
comes to using the subdivision surface modifier.
58

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,110
And if you're animating something you can have it deform in a predictable manner stopping things pinching
59

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,700
together and looking horrible.
60

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,980
I'm expecting this one to behave exactly the same as the one over on the side here.
61

62
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,820
We should be able to put a vertical cuts just here but nothing will run around the model.
62

63
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,030
See you quickly end up with being unable to select various parts of your model quickly because you can
63

64
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,010
no longer loop around them.
64

65
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm not going to cut up our UV sphere or just follow the same pattern as everything else.
65

66
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,380
And finally the icon square.
66

67
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,060
Well there's not a hope at all.
67

68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,240
Your course you can manually go round and select things.
68

69
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,880
I mean it does look like there's a nice cut across the middle a nice straight division that you could
69

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:26,490
do roughly there to cut this sphere in half but these two spheres are a great example of topology.
70

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,940
They're both the same shape they're both spheres.
71

72
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,960
However if I turned on shaded mode into smooth shaded you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between
72

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,700
these two.
73

74
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,760
If they weren't so low poly This is obviously a lower poly sphere than this but you cannot see the underlying
74

75
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,050
topology at this point.
75

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,480
You certainly can.
76

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,060
When we reveal it.
77

78
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,020
And that can make a big difference.
78

79
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:01,860
So in summary overall it is generally better to make your models have quads in them rather than triangles
79

80
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,950
and ngons
80

81
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,480
However that's not a hard and fast rule.
81

82
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,150
And often there will be times when you just cannot avoid having a triangle in your model or if you could
82

83
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,760
avoid it it wouldn't be worth the time trying and that's going to be very useful in the upcoming challenge
83

84
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,360
and your challenge for this lecture is to create your queen.
84

85
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm going to give you a bit more guidance.
85

86
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,490
I suggest starting from a similar base maybe the bishop is about the right size.
86

87
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,370
You have to do some changes but it is a relatively good starting point for the Queen.
87

88
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,820
Of course you could build it up from the ground using the base piece.
88

89
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,220
Now try and get good topology when it comes to the Crown itself.
89

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,880
I will be using a triangle at the very top but I'm going to make sure it blends nicely to the quad underneath
90

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:48,960
it.
91

92
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,000
So it looks like one giant face rather than its changing angle all of a sudden.
92

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,030
So go ahead pause video now and go and create your queen Okay everybody Welcome back.
93

94
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,840
Let's go ahead and hop on over into blender and create our queen okay.
94

95
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,900
Everybody welcome back.
95

96
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,880
Let's go ahead and make our queen so in order to do this I'm going to go and open up something that's
96

97
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,510
very similar to the Queen the bishop and it's obviously been moved.
97

98
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,070
That's one thing to bear in mind when you move all your pieces around.
98

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,610
Well guess what you'll have to make sure you reopen them.
99

100
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,640
You can't shortcut your way through.
100

101
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:38,310
Now the first thing I'm going to do is save as and obviously save it as the queen once I've done that.
101

102
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,170
We can go in and do a couple of other namings.
102

103
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,400
So I'm going to name the bishop or the mesh object queen and I'm going to delete the notch itself.
103

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,540
It's going to need to be visible in order to delete it.
104

105
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,750
And then it can go the next thing I need to do.
105

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,410
I'm going to whiz round to the side turn on my staunton  Bishop now that i have got the image turned
106

107
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,250
on I'm going to go down to the material properties and as we can see here we're using the storm from
107

108
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,880
Bishop in the background so we can actually go to our shading tab as we've been doing before we've
108

109
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,650
got a Staunton Bishop PNG.
109

110
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,960
You can see a group of nodes has been set up here in order to show that image.
110

111
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,960
So what we can do is go ahead and open up the correct image.
111

112
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,360
I want to go to my reference material and open up the queen.
112

113
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,350
And there we go.
113

114
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,590
And we can see that they're roughly the same size as one another.
114

115
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,990
Which is why I've picked this.
115

116
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,030
However they are a slightly different shape.
116

117
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,520
So I'm going to select my bishop at this point and go to its object properties and in the viewport display
117

118
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,450
set it's a wire so I can see through it for a moment so I can adjust things once I've done that.
118

119
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,220
I can have a look from the front how long I need to make sure I can select through my model in order
119

120
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,690
to do that.
120

121
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,490
I'm going to click this button at the top here show whole scene transparent and that should enable me
121

122
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:10,840
now to hop into edit mode and select the appropriate vertices in order to move them around and we can
122

123
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,810
just come out quickly to make sure that everything is selected which is and hop back in again.
123

124
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,310
Now I think in this particular case I'm going to select everything but the very top bit no.
124

125
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,270
No I'm going to select it a bit further down go G and just lift it up and then select this next bit
125

126
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,720
here.
126

127
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,150
G and lift it up again.
127

128
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,820
So it's in the rough right place here and then it's just a matter of selecting things and moving them
128

129
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,910
to the appropriate place.
129

130
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,550
Now this is the great thing about using predefined geometry.
130

131
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:53,230
You get to an end point much much quicker than you would have done just making it from scratch.
131

132
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,100
However you still do have to be careful because you can run into this situation.
132

133
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,920
We end up taking too long modifying what's already there.
133

134
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,170
And I think that may be the case with this crown I'm not quite sure at the moment whether it's just
134

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,350
going to be a pain to do or whether I'm just going to have to redo any of it.
135

136
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,420
So I think it's going to be fine.
136

137
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,820
But the Crown is a different shape it's going to flare out as it comes to the top of the Crown.
137

138
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,890
And obviously we've got these triangles running around here as well.
138

139
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,880
And we do need to think that this is a three dimensional object.
139

140
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,500
So once we've got the rough proportions we're going to have to put some extra loop cuts in to make sure
140

141
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,810
that the Crown comes out at the right angle.
141

142
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,810
Now I'm going to suppose that this bit is actually much lower down than it looks.
142

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,080
And then I can make it much wider as well.
143

144
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:55,570
So about there and I don't know if I need all the extra detail I've currently got here.
144

145
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,210
This bit needs to come out a little and I think this one hand just needs to be further down and then
145

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,030
bring it down a little bit more.
146

147
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
Okay.
147

148
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,220
Yes I'm liking the look of that.
148

149
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm going to turn back on textured mode and I'm going to have a look at this top bit here and hide the
149

150
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,140
Staunton Queen I'm also going to name it whilst I'm there.
150

151
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,420
OK.
151

152
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,100
Save that and turn off showing everything as transparent.
152

153
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,300
And look we've got a viewport clipping issue that's a sore that's outs as well so I'm gonna open up
153

154
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,570
the properties panel here the sidebar and change the clip starts.
154

155
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,190
So one centimetre I should be able to zoom in much better.
155

156
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,880
Okay so the final thing I think I need to work on in lots of detail is this crown parts at the top.
156

157
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,520
And I think I can get away with adding a loop cuts in roughly there and then adding another one in a
157

158
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,390
bit further back and then manipulating that bit there.
158

159
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,320
So let's go ahead.
159

160
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,520
Go G, Z and move that down so that can actually be part of the Crown itself.
160

161
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
Now I don't know.
161

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,480
That looks a bit steep to me.
162

163
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,410
Let's go round and make a few alterations to it
163

164
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,580
G,Z and lift that up.
164

165
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
There we go.
165

166
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,740
That's looking pretty good.
166

167
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:25,460
Now comes the point where we need to start thinking about whether or not we're using triangles and whether
167

168
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,160
or not some of this is a bit redundant.
168

169
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:33,450
I'm going to dissolve this edge running round here, Yeah that's much better.
169

170
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay.
170

171
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:42,100
So we need to have those spikes coming out of the Crown and I could make them out to quads that would
171

172
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,420
that wouldn't be an issue at all.
172

173
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,260
I could literally grab all of these edges.
173

174
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:56,800
All of these faces sorry and just extrude them up and out and then scale them in at the end or it could
174

175
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:03,160
make them into triangles now and just extrude that middle edge going up has lots and lots of options.
175

176
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,500
I could subdivide them all and grab the middle vertex and pull it up.
176

177
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's see what that looks like.
177

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,950
There are so many options here.
178

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:19,240
It's possible that all of them are viable and there's not going to be a wrong one that's so important.
179

180
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,140
It's so easy to forget there's always going to be multiple ways of doing something.
180

181
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,790
I'm going to change my pivot point to individual origins.
181

182
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm going to switch our transform orientation to normal and I hope that's going to enable me to go and
182

183
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,510
H.
183

184
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:44,320
No not extrude to move these bits out on their normal was brilliant that's worked perfectly okay.
184

185
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,130
There we go.
185

186
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,170
Now looking at this.
186

187
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,920
This may look a bit odd having these triangular faces here when everything else literally every other
187

188
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,940
surface of this model is not triangulated.
188

189
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,910
So let's just make sure that it's not going to look odd.
189

190
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's switch over into lookDev mode and come out and yes it does look at this.
190

191
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:11,010
We've got things that are triangular at the top which is fine it's fine it being that shape but it really
191

192
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,930
does need to be flat rather than the shape it currently is.
192

193
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,550
So back to the drawing board there.
193

194
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:25,500
So I'm going to remove the subdivision that I had made and now we need to look at it in a slightly different
194

195
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,100
manner.
195

196
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,220
I think I'm gonna have to put a loop cuts not down the entire model necessarily.
196

197
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,910
I could do I'll be an awful lot of extra geometry just fill this one little bit at the top.
197

198
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,520
See there's so many different ways that you could approach this I'm not going to do that.
198

199
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm not going to add all of the extra geometry when it's just not necessary what I am going to do instead
199

200
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:58,450
though is I'm going to select all of these faces running round which I can use a face loop select for
200

201
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,810
and with that face loop selected.
201

202
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,870
You think you'll be able to do exactly what we did with the vertices a moment ago and just extrude out
202

203
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,490
based upon the normal by.
203

204
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,520
It's not going to work it's just going to lift it up.
204

205
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,140
So the way around that is to select alternate ones.
205

206
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:25,150
We could a checker deselect in order to do that and then extrude those up by certain amounts one looks
206

207
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,380
like it's too far.
207

208
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:37,210
So maybe point two point three point four I'm gonna go point five here and then do the same but not
208

209
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:46,270
before scaling down to zero and then we can do the same to these other ones to extrude point 5 and scale
209

210
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:53,230
down to zero select everything and remove doubles okay.
210

211
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,460
So what we should find now is when we look at this even though they are triangles we don't have that
211

212
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,040
split down the middle that we did before.
212

213
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,850
We can just confirm that by having a look in Look Dev mode with that turned off and excellent.
213

214
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,880
It looks like one giant piece in this particular case.
214

215
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,130
Okay that looks really good.
215

216
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:19,430
I'm going to just finish up by having a look back at our model and looking at this base bits because
216

217
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,650
I've just assumed that that is going to work.
217

218
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,750
And I have missed a couple of bits here so I'm going to go G.G. lift that up slightly and pull it out
218

219
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,340
because it's a much bigger piece and I'm going to do the same for this area here.
219

220
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:46,030
So I'm going to select these and lift them up and scale them out slightly and the same goes true with
220

221
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,320
this bit here's a scale that out and lift it up as well perhaps even scale it in a little at that point.
221

222
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,900
Perfect.
222

223
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,270
That looks like an awesome piece to join our board.
223

224
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm going to hide the reference image.
224

225
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,060
One final time come out and have a look around.
225

226
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,360
Excellent.
226

227
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,940
How did you guys get on.
227

228
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,660
I'd love to see how you made your Queens especially that bit at the top.
228

229
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,000
There's numerous ways of creating those spikes around the queen's crown.
229

230
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,500
Looking at it now I think there might be a bit high but I'm going to leave it for the moment knowing
230

231
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,410
of course I can adjust it later if I'm no longer happy with it.
231

232
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,620
Please share your Queens over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
