00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,670
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,880
In this lecture we're going to animates our camera so that gives the whole scene much more movement

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,350
Hello everybody.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
So let's first of all think about what we want to do.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,240
This is more of a refresher we played with the camera animation over in the chest section so a quick

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,540
refresher on how to do the camera movement.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,630
First of all make sure the camera is the selected item when you go ahead and animated.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,130
Let's bring out our key frames.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,990
So I'm gonna go ahead not only make the timeline appear let's bring this up but also the property side

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,230
bar so we can key things in.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,770
Remember one of the first things you'll need to do is key in the original location so we have a look

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,620
through the camera so we know what we can see and then we can go ahead and we can key in the position

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,610
and the rotation and maybe the scale as well.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm going to play with the scale myself but also walls to here it's a good idea to play with these settings

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,380
to understand that.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,130
Okay.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,540
Z's going to move the camera from the left and right.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,770
Y is going to make everybody feel sick and X is going to lift everything up and down.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,560
Now if you've done this your your actual fields themselves will turn orange to say it's different from

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,430
the key that you've made clicking back on any other frame will reverse it.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,350
And if we go back to frame one you can see it is as it was before and then it's just a matter of going

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,840
to a new frame say here frame 50 shift in grave to move the camera I am fully in for this type of movement

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,920
more than anything else it allows you to move around your scene very quickly and set things up and to

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,920
press the IV key to key those in and then it's just a matter of going backwards and forwards to making

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,180
sure what you've done there look at that as we pan out is consistent and what you want it to be not

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,270
only in its speed in its transition but where the overall position of your characters and scenery actually

27
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,980
is one of the things you'll notice here and we will see this in the challenge it happens to me as well

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,280
is as we're panning round the objects is no longer center to our scene now we can use constraints to

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,040
control the camera as well but the other thing we can do is midway through so we had out to frame 50

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
is unlit she going to adjust the z value to bring it back in line now you don't want to do this too

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,400
much it can be incredibly annoying adding unnecessary key frames much like geometry but now when we

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,370
go ahead and play it we'll see that it will maintain more or certainly be more in the middle of our

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:37,140
animation as we go through whereas before it was sliding out into one side which is fine if you're trying

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,540
to convey movement but we're just panning around an object that is one of the ways that you could do

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,090
that.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,490
Now one of the other things you'll notice here is that you're going to say Mike Where where are my key

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,850
frames.

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,250
I can not see them at so now this sometimes does happen if you want to see them again we can go to our

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,250
summary we notice here that nothing is actually on the summary itself which means we don't have anything

40
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,800
selected we need to select the camera again just because we are looking for it doesn't mean it was selected

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,870
here we go now selected we can see our key frames.

42
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,030
So that does happen.

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,110
That's one of the things to watch out for.

44
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,920
So rearmed with that knowledge.

45
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,890
Here's your challenge

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,390
okay.

47
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,740
So your challenge is to animate your camera having it follow your lamp now I'll leave this up to your

48
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,050
creative decisions how you want to follow your lamp through the scene you'll see how I do it in a bit.

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,460
So go ahead pulls a video now and give it go okay everybody welcome back.

50
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,050
Let's hop on over into blender and animator off camera.

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay everybody so it's a matter of animating the camera to make the whole scene look a bit more dynamic.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,430
Now at the moment we can't see anything else in the hierarchy because we've still got a look filter

53
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,900
applied at the top here.

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
So on the click of a little cross make that disappear.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay.

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,380
Now we can go ahead and find our camera or we can search for it.

57
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,550
I think getting in the habit of searching for things is a good habit to have.

58
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,680
It means that you're going to be able to find things naturally rather than having the habit of searching

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,510
for them manually.

60
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,190
Let's go ahead selects our camera and have a look through the eyes of our camera.

61
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,680
So at the moment if we were to go ahead and render this video it would look something like this we would

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,040
see the camera looking at the lamp and then the lamp would leave the frame and we wouldn't see anything

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,520
else.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,450
So just like the bones themselves we can animate all of the properties of the camera if we wanted to

65
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,150
including its field of view.

66
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,000
So what I think I want to do here and of course we can tweak this and refine it as we go is I want to

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,380
make sure that I've only focused down here on the camera's position itself and of course I can move

68
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,500
it around with the shift in the grave key and we can use that to actually align our camera.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,770
So the first thing we need to do is go right back to frame one and then we can go to its position information

70
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,990
and the rotation location information.

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,690
Now we're in pose mode at the moment and we've got our overlays turned off and so we would know that

72
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,770
was the case if we had our overlays turned on.

73
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,960
Now I can select my camera as the active item then I can key its position in.

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,490
So that's fine with its starting position but straight away we can see that as we start progressing

75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,740
by frame well wherever we are here by frame 40 is pretty much left.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:39,970
So let's just reframe our camera let's move it out to let's say here in Key that's in.

77
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,360
Now this might be horrible by the way.

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,370
And it's going to leave there.

79
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:51,080
But as we move round for I think we need to modify the why didn't I.

80
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,210
Anyway so about here it lands parts on the way to there.

81
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,380
We want it probably seeing how high it's getting so it's landing about there and then slipping off.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,880
So again we can shift in grave key and move this around slightly and key.

83
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,420
That's it.

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,540
And remember now we can transition between the first one and the second.

85
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,140
And this is where you start pulling up your issues so we can see here that this is pretty good.

86
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,920
We pull out now.

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,670
This is bad framing.

88
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:34,520
By the time we're jumping in the right place which is nice we're losing most of the frame there so we

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,080
can do some things to mitigate that.

90
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:44,870
But look here as we pull the camera back we're not leaving much space to the left hand side which is

91
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,980
a type of methods that you can use to infer the movement of your character.

92
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,550
Much like if you were taking a photo of someone running you wouldn't put them up against the side of

93
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,500
your frame you'd leave space in front of them to run to.

94
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,590
And we really want to do the same thing here.

95
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,700
So it might be worthwhile at this point as we pull back actually shifting the camera around and we can

96
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,420
just play with the rotation here thinking about the camera's rotation.

97
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,220
X is up and down.

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,810
Why is it makes you sick.

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,830
And Z would be from the left to the right.

100
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,470
So what we can do here is once again click on the frame and pull the camera across more to infer the

101
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:32,620
movement and then we can key that rotation in so now it pulls back as we would expect it to.

102
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,870
Perfect.

103
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,580
Then we're jumping.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,120
He's out of frame and he's landed and then we need to decide what we're going to do as it comes around

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,390
here.

106
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:49,370
Now the major movements are ones to do first hit and bounce and end so he really wants to be close to

107
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,010
our character at this point so I'm going to move the camera in nice and close and we may even wants

108
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,760
to add a bit where he's looking at us.

109
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,040
But let's leave it something like that for the moment and keep those positions in and let's see how

110
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,520
it looks.

111
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,560
Not in frame for some of it now here where he's looking at us.

112
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,490
He's no longer looking at us.

113
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,880
So might be a good idea at this point to move the camera to a position where he is looking at this as

114
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,280
at this point we're being looked at.

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Let's move the camera into the appropriate position which is about here.

116
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,840
Now this may to be too fast to transition and you've got to watch out when you're moving the camera

117
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,200
around that it doesn't look too jerky.

118
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,120
That kind of feels okay.

119
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,700
Let's go to full screen mode with everything off and zoom in a little bit to get more of an appreciation

120
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,530
of what will be happening.

121
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,830
I do think he should look at this at the end as well.

122
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,960
That's one of those tweaks that we can do yeah.

123
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,220
I'm I'm liking that that's not too quick in its movements.

124
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm liking how it works as a bit to fix there but otherwise that's pretty smooth.

125
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,580
Brilliant.

126
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,930
How did you guys get on.

127
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,820
I hope you'll get your camera animations all sorted out.

128
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,650
He didn't have any issue moving around just scene and keeping things in frame.

129
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,170
Get ready to show your work.

130
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,300
We're almost at the stage now where we can start rendering out our animation and I'll see you all in

131
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,110
the next lecture.
