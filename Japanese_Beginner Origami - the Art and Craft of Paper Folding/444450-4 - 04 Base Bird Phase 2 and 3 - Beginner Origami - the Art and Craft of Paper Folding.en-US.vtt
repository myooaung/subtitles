00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.425
Next is the bird base.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:14.010
But the second phase this time to start e going to want to take

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:22.030
your ear or other brute beasts the first face and fault the edges to the center crease.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.674
So, so that that followed looks like that.

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:32.200
He can do the same thing with age.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.560
So we should be able to open up the clock.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.060
Ticks, you can flip it over.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.930
This should be able to open up

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.120
that top triangle down,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.620
please.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.980
Somebody very important failure takes we gonna do the same thing with the other side.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.060
They have increase x2 going to open it up.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.500
The top layer. That top layer,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.845
or the dark points on the crease.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:33.215
Turn it sideways if it helps.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.485
And you're going to squash, squash.

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.450
Another tip is you

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.840
should be able to open it up.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.260
So take

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.100
a little pocket

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.435
here also.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:07.860
To say that help.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.940
Towards the middle.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.130
Birthday, face

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.550
to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.970
face three.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.390
You're just gonna take that positive sense. Very simple.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.750
So it should look like a kite.
