00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.759
There are many different types of paper you can use in origami.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.670
My favorites are standard origami paper,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.850
which is available at most Kraft and hobby stores or

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.165
online and even including some origami books,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.455
don't use thick paper like construction paper because it doesn't foldable.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.570
And thin paper might rip.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.970
Origami paper is usually a square pattern piece of paper may for folding.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.080
Another good one is printer paper available everywhere.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.075
Thicker paper is better for boxes,

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.770
and thinner paper is better for flowers.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.225
For animals, just use the standard thickness paper.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:50.630
You can use a bone folder or a skewer to make sharp edges or just use your fingernail.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.755
Using your thumbnail or index fingernail works the best.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:59.825
You can also use an exact a knife to cut or just scissors which are safer.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.570
You don't need to cut pre-made origami paper

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.900
unless the instructions call for a rectangle or a triangle.
