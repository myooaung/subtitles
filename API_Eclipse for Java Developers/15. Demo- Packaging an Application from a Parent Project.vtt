00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.410
[Autogenerated] let us now close those two projects.

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.190
Since we do not need them anymore.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.130
We are just left here with our l O application.

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.340
Let us make a last test that is create a package for this ello application.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.220
We are going to create last run configuration may

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.920
even build the new configuration.

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.610
We are going to call it a low application by Ikeja.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.540
The base directory is the parent directory.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.690
The goal is package.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.140
Let us apply and runner this goal.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.860
Once again,

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.320
the reactor is invoked and all the jaws of our project have been

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
added to the different target directories.

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.830
Since the yellow application is only a parent project,

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.340
there is no target application in this directory.

16
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.430
But there is one in a low application service with the service that

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:17.000
Joe and another Warner in the Application Service imp project with the yellow applications of this imp, the jar file that has been created
