1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,740
[Autogenerated] Now what we want to do here is Creator,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,090
the class message service.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,980
You know, back a job order tomorrow.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,840
Service finish.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,230
And in this class,

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:28,800
we will have a single method public ________ that get Miss Ager return head.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,790
Oh, well, the and what we would like to do,

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,230
of course, is used this service in our area.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,520
Well,

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:49,120
class message service message service equals new message service

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,390
and replace this string here by message service.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,590
That good message?

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,410
Of course it doesn't work.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:00:59,800
Why?

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,360
Because message services declared in another project,

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,040
then the first project where the other world class is.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,790
What we need to tell Eclipse is that these first project

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,140
is depending on the message service.

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,920
To do that, we can see, like the properties of this project.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,840
But in the bill path Adah,

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,160
the project message surveys as a dependency to the

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,040
first project we just created.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,250
Now, First project knows message service.

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,460
So if I ask you cliffs to fix the imports of this

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,500
class by using control shift Oh, as a shortcut,

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,170
it will be able to import message service.

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,010
And if I runner the year world class by clicking on

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,890
this button it will work properly.

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,690
So this is how you can declare dependencies between your Java project.

30
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:10,000
Go to the properties of a project on the bill path here, project Abba, you just add the project you need as dependencies to this project.
