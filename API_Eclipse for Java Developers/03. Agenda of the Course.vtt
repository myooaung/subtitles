00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.780
[Autogenerated] that is, quickly see your agenda for the schools.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.660
The main goal is to show you how to set up Eclipse to write Java code,

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.170
simple Java code and complex multi modules,

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.540
multi project Java applications.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.290
So first we will see how to set up the Java A C environment.

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.110
Then we will have maven to handle Java Project first,

7
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.860
a simple Java project,

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.510
and then we're going to put several modules with a parent poem on the like.

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.130
In it, you will see how you can handle your source code base,

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.720
using it on how to connect to get remote.

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.990
Repository za.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.560
How to connect a clips to databases servers like my sequel on how to

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.000
set up Eclipse to write complex Java E applications.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.930
Now for that,

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.040
you need to have notions about Maybourne about get about

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.500
databases and about Java E applications.

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
So if you're not familiar with all those notions,

18
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.940
you can check the eclipse guided to locals by told the Gen Today

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.760
it's a two part calls available here on parasite that will show

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.860
you all the tips and tricks you need to know to use the Java

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.140
editor from Eclipse efficiently.

22
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.220
You can also check The Maven Calls by Brian Hansen will show you the

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.920
fundamentals of Maidana that you need to know they are two excellent

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.150
courses by Paolo Perrotta Available on Get That will show you very

25
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.380
precisely how to use git.

26
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.740
And there is also Java e The Big Picture by Antonio Goncalo

27
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.090
Alvez also available here on per site.

28
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.010
Watching those coasters is not a prerequisite for watching these eclipse calls,

29
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.760
but if you do not know anything about maven get and Java E,

30
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.570
you might want to start there.

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.910
As for the Eclipse Guide, a tall,

32
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.400
taught gentle A did an amazing job at checking every details

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.530
off handling Java source code using eclipse,

34
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.180
all the tips and tricks and shortcuts and templates,

35
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.680
everything is in it, so I will not be talking about those points.

36
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.000
This course is really about setting every clips, the topic that has not been covered by Todd
