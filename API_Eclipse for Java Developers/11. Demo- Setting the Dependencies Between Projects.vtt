00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.900
[Autogenerated] letters First, fix this bomb.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.990
Since we just created this project, there is nothing in it.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.900
So we are going to copy paste elements from it.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.310
I think I'm going to copy Paste.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.340
All this than this project is a look service.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.390
Fine.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.030
Now we need to update this project as we did previously.

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.170
Maybe an update project to fix the version of Java from the

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.090
default versions of a five to the current version.

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.030
And over eight, that is check.

11
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.900
We have I were interface here and here.

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.040
The implementation Creating a dependency from Aero Service

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.010
employees to a row Service is really easy.

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.670
In fact,

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.590
all I need to do is other dependency from this bomb fighter to the other.

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.410
The group I d is order that Hamada the artifact i d is a low

17
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.980
dash service on diversion of is zero that one.

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.600
If I do that, I can see that the competition problem is sold.

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590
And if I open the maven dependency node,

20
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.430
I can see that the eclipse pra Ginna automatically

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.540
created these dependency from me.

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.440
This dependency has been created because the right version off the

23
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.410
artifact this aero service depends on er has been found opened in

24
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.970
the current workspace of Eclipse.

25
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.580
See, for instance,

26
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.160
I change a the version of this bomb to the zero dot to for Shana.

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.680
Then I now have a corruption in this project.

28
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.640
If I check the problems here,

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.660
I can see that the artifact ello service job zero that wanna is missing.

30
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.180
So this project cannot be compiled.

31
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.500
Let us set it at zero.

32
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.820
That Warner, we can do something more letters, For instance.

33
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.340
Package of these Aero Service Project Creator.

34
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.640
A run configuration.

35
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.610
Maybourne.

36
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.960
We're going to call it a low.

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.510
So it's the base directory is the Yellow Service project.

38
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.880
And the goal is just installed at us a plier.

39
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.240
And run this goal.

40
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.260
We can check here how this goal has been executed and the

41
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.630
insult phaser has been properly executed.

42
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.530
The ello,

43
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.820
their service zero Wanda job has been installed in the local repository.

44
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
So now if I, for instance, closed this project,

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.500
my aero Service imp project will compiler correctly.

46
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.620
Who is the dependency declared as a dependency toward the ello Dar service.

47
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.880
Darcy Rondo.

48
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.920
Joe, that is present in the repository.

49
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.750
If I reopen er the project now,

50
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.280
the dependency is again on the Aero service project.

51
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.540
Now, if I change the version off this ello service project,

52
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.140
for instance,

53
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.830
zero to now this aero service in project will reconfigure itself

54
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:37.000
automatically to point to the right dependency that is, in my maven repository and not on this project in eclipse.
