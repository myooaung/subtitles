00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.430
[Autogenerated] So let us see all that inaction A

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.140
Let us create Deploy and Runner, A web application.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.010
We are going to use the Tomcat applications over.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.680
Of course, other application servers might differ, but not too much.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.370
Most of the time, the configuration in eclipse will works the same as Tomcat.

6
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.750
So we are back in our eclipse workspace.

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.720
Er on.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.070
Know that we are now in the Java e perspective,

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.230
not in the Java Sea perspective anymore.

10
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.120
As we can see on the top right of this window.

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.670
The first thing we want to make sure is that we have the right

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.880
beginner to connect to the Tomcat application server.

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.500
It takes place in the window.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.140
Menu preference is, um and let us filter this with the server keyword.

15
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930
Here we have the server.

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.730
Noda with the three sub options are on the What we want to check is the

17
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.990
runtime environment Here We do not have any runtime environment.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.500
Configure the letters Adwan and from this panel Ola,

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
we can see all the default application servers are readily

20
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.480
available in this distribution of eclipse.

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.870
So we have a nice set off Tomcat version za geronimo

22
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.890
basic java e runtime servers are.

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.830
Those are very older Cloud foundry Ivy Emma with blue mix and whips for

24
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.220
application server object Weber with the Jonah's Application Server,

25
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.400
which is not supported anymore.

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.250
Or a caller with glass fish tools or a called Cloud

27
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820
Tools and Web Logic Server tools.

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.940
A J Bus.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.680
And while flyer from Red Hat, Roszina and a Safety,

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.540
we are going to user Tomcat Naina.

31
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.860
So we see like this wall.

32
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.420
Now click next and hear.

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.940
Eclipse is asking us to point to a Tomcat installation directory.

34
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.220
So I have prepared here a Tomcat directory with the default installation of

35
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.480
Tomcat that this copy paste this path directly to hear,

36
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.320
select and installed a J.

37
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.410
R E.

38
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.430
We already have.

39
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.960
Ah, default Java ater J D.

40
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.300
K.

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.960
Installed.

42
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.420
So let us click, Apply and closer said ex Jessica age here.

43
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.090
And we are Don't we can now click finish in the serve a run time environments.

44
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.640
We have now a reference to the Apache Tomcat Version nine application server.

45
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.000
By the way, if you need to install the Tomcat version,

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.480
Anna,

47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.710
you can just download it from the Tomcat that Apache that order your

48
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.460
Ella here you just have to click on the Tomcat.

49
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.360
Nine downloader on download, for instance,

50
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
the dot the J's IP distribution just here.

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.500
This is the distribution I am using in this module.

52
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.720
Once you have downloaded this archive,

53
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.000
all you want to do is unzip it in any directory and declare that directory within eclipse.
