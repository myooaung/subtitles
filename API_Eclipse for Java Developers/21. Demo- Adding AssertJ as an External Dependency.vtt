00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.950
[Autogenerated] now suppose that I'm not happy with this assertion framework.

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.650
The assertion in jail unit are in fact not that great on.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.940
There is a very good assertion framework in the Java space called assert J.

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.450
By the way, a ser jay is an open source project available on get hub.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.540
You can check it at the following address.

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.630
So how can I use a ser jay instead of J Unit,

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.380
where what we need to do is to set up a dependency

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.740
between message surveys and this framework?

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.240
As for J So let us go back to the properties of this

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.050
project as I enter and this time,

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.710
assert Jay is not known as a default library within eclipse.

12
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.820
So from there we can do several things so we can add it as an external job here,

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.260
navigate to the right directory,

14
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.520
and I have propelled wall now and select the jaw off as a J to declare

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.340
it as a dependency of our project on this would work.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.900
But it will be a little tedious if we want to put this Asir

17
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.110
J dependency to more than one project.

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.750
So let us delete it like that.

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.840
We can also create directly a library.

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.940
Use a library here next.

21
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.510
Here.

22
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.800
I do not have any library declared so.

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.270
Letters.

24
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.040
Dica, Wanna click user library here?

25
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.720
We're going to get a new library called Assert J.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.140
OK, add external job to this library.

27
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.590
Put the aso Jake or with the right version in it, playing closer.

28
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.490
And now we can select this assert J library as a dependency of our project.

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.820
Let us apply and closer get reader of this assertion used the assertions

30
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.510
class from Answer J and say that acid that Messager easy call to the expected

31
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.020
message which is expected with the control shift.

32
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.430
Oh, shortcut.

33
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.420
We can get reader of the unused import in this class.

34
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.540
Just run this test once again here.

35
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.890
And of course, the result will be the same.

36
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:39.000
So this is how you can define the dependency in user libraries in the Crips on add those user libraries as dependencies off any Java project
