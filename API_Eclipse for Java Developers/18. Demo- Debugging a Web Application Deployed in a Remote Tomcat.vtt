00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.440
[Autogenerated] a little soap earner.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.060
The source code off our user list.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.640
Sublette at the break point on the first line here.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.680
There are several ways to do that.

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.780
We can use the pop up menu in this blue margin here.

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.770
And then we have Tugger break points there or easier.

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.350
We can just use the shortcut control shifts be like that.

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.990
This little blue bullet here shows us that we have a break point on this time.

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.750
And now what we can do is Runner.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.240
I will Web application.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.440
There is no main method in a Web application, so you cannot run it like that.

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.090
Off course.

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.550
You need a browser to launch a request that will

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.900
execute the code of this survey it.

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.060
So let us switch to our browser on.

16
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.590
Let us refresh this uses least pager by pressing a fiver and you can see in

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.260
eclipse this green ball showing that I will application is blocked on this

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.940
line precisely where we put our break point.

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.200
If we switch back to our browser,

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
we will see that Roma is waiting for information from the

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.100
server and this is expected because I would Tomcats over is

22
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.520
currently blocked by the D Burger.

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.900
So it is not able to send any HTML information to this brother.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.630
Let us switch back to eclipse.

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
If six to advance one liner up to here,

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.870
we can have information on the Mary Variable.

27
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.100
For instance.

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.880
This is a user age 32.

29
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.250
We can do the same on James and Patricia.

30
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.110
If we do the same on Jonah, it doesn't work.

31
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.540
Why?

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.960
Just because this line has not been executed yet,

33
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.340
and this viable has not been created yet.

34
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.880
Let us continue to run this Web application by pressing F eight Now,

35
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510
we are not in debug mode anymore.

36
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.040
No Tomcat thread is blocked.

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.630
So let us switch back to our server on.

38
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.920
Now we can see that the page is properly displayed in this browser.

39
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.660
So this is basically how you can connect to a remote tomcat.

40
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.300
It is building on a special java protocal builder onto C p i P.

41
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300
So you need to provide an I P address on the port to connect to it.

42
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.620
And you need to launch this Tomcat using the special option J p D A.

43
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.090
By the way, if you want to final control on this Tomcat Moder.

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.620
You can also check the documentation from within

45
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.990
the katarina dot But batch filer, let us scroll a little,

46
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.730
and you will see that here you have several options J p.

47
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.880
D.

48
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.930
A.

49
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.670
Transport address.

50
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.560
Suspend an obs to finally tune the way you want to debug your Tomcat.

51
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.860
So this Caesar,

52
00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:03.000
how you can de burgh an application from eclipse in a remote Tomcat installation.
