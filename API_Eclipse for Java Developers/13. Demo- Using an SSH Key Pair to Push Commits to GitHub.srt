00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,070
[Autogenerated] let us add some more content to our user class.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,030
We are going to add a a constructor and shift s generate

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,090
constructor using the name and age fielder.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,090
And we are also going to keep the empty constructor.

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,360
Since we do not want to make hibernates Onda like fail, let us come in.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,610
This added the constructors are income it And it turns out that having to

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,860
enter a password every time we want to push stuff toe our git repository is

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,150
quite annoying And for some security reasons,

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,580
we do not want to record.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,170
I will use the name and password inside the Eclipse configuration fight.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,440
There is another solution to provide credentials to get Herber on other git

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,740
remote repositories which is to come with a key and use Ssh!

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,150
So let us do that.

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,350
We are going to delay the push configuration we just created a we already

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,770
have configured in our get up settings are an ssh key And what we are

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,520
going to do on this repository interface is,

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,040
for instance, click the cloner or download button here,

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,220
select here user is his age and copy to clip board the SS age.

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,860
You are I for this repository.

20
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,660
Let us go back to eclipse First are we need to.

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,440
Terry Cliffs were to find our private key.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,940
This is Donna in the preferences of here.

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:52,240
Siddiq Tina is this age as message to add the private key here?

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,740
My private key is there.

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,100
Open it now.

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,240
It has been added to the list of the known of private keys by eclipse.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,190
By the way, if you want to generate a private and public key pair,

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:13,410
you can do that from within eclipse, using the optional apply and closer.

29
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,890
And now we need to configure push once again,

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,960
change A The s s age stuff appears here automatically.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,910
Here, you need to select the ssh Protocol.

32
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,940
If it is not correctly configured by default,

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,800
you do not need to enter any password here.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,890
Click finish advanced and we are presented with the same

35
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,720
configure push window that we already saw letters at old

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
ranches and at old tags here.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,440
And click finish.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,990
If your key is configured er to be protected by your password,

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,000
a cliff's would have asked you toe enter that password previously.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,140
Let us say that Bush here is the report for the push Operation A.

41
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,730
Let us close this and check on the project The commits for

42
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,550
the master branch the other the constructors commit has been

43
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,640
properly added to the repository.

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,790
So this is much moral easy to user.

45
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,080
You can just Freedy push and fetch and walking to see the fetch

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,990
operation in just a minute without having to enter password.

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:45,000
Since the eclipse get pro Ginna is able to Delia with private and public key pairs are on the SS age protocol.
