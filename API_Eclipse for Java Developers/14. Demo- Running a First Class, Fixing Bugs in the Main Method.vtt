00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.920
[Autogenerated] Let us now see how we can run Java code lettuce.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.980
Add content to this main method.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.320
A.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.200
We are going to use this very Andy template to

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.260
generate a system out the printer n and,

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.590
of course, printer in the famous message in the world.

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.580
How can we run this coder?

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.640
Well, we have various ways to do it.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.340
First, we can just click on the main method here.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.050
Select the pop up menu from this main method.

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.460
A look for the run as optional and select Runas

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.090
Java application that is Do that.

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.680
It will display a message in the council view at the bottom of

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.340
this perspective with the L A World message.

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.500
I could have ridged this option also with the pop up menu from the

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.640
class in a package Explorer ruin as a job application.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.110
The run on server option would not work for this class.

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.540
We will see these option er in another module of these girls.

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.570
We have, of course,

20
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.640
the same result and I could also have chosen a this button from the toolbar

21
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.340
runner ran Isa Java application here for the exact same result.

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.070
Since they set a world class has already been run.

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.750
I can also directly select it from the favorite part of this menu.

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.110
A little world here.

25
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.100
And in fact, if I just click this button directly,

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.130
it will select the first option off the menu,

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.040
which is the real world option.

28
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.890
Now, suppose that this main method has not been written correctly.

29
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.960
For instance,

30
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.540
suppose I am a C developer and then see the main method returns and ent,

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.740
which is not the case in Java.

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.310
Well, here I have a direct error message.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.110
If I say that the main method should reach on an end,

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.000
then the compiler will get me in there.

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.740
Oh, which is this method must return a result of type it.

36
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.440
So this error would priven this coda from being run from the compiler level.

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.830
But suppose I forget to put here for instant the square brackets and this may

38
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.670
3rd that takes a ________ instead off an array of string.

39
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.840
Now I cannot run it anymore from the rent as menu.

40
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.980
This option a range of application does not appear anymore and

41
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.250
it's the same also here I cannot run this hello world

42
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.570
application If I try to run it from here,

43
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.570
I will get this message telling me that there is no main method in this class.

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.040
This can be a very confusing error because I have a

45
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.310
feeling that there is a main method in it.

46
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.350
But in fact,

47
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.710
since it does not follow the requirement off the main method of the

48
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.750
javelin wager it is not recognized as such by Cripps and a cliffs will

49
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.290
not be able to launch it as I would like to do.

50
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.910
So let us put back the square brackets, run the method again.

51
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.550
And now, of course, it works perfectly well.

52
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.250
On the same goes if I forget.

53
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.200
For instance, the static keyword here This time this method is called main,

54
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.830
but it is not the normal main method of a job application.

55
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.570
And I do not have the runners Java application

56
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.190
option available in the menu anymore.

57
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.370
So if you're trying to run something and that it does not work,

58
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.350
check and double check the way you've written your main method.

59
00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:02.000
The aero is probably coming from here. So let us put back this static keyword here
