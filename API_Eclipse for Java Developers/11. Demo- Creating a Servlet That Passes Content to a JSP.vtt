4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.090
We can have a quick look at it.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.790
It is just a plain a job.

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.910
Bina with two properties.

There is Creator serve late in this projector.

10
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.870
We can do that with the pop up menu of the project or

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.120
with this icona on the task bar.

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.380
We are going to put it in a organ that promote that Web app

13
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.550
back Asia and call it user At least Servette.

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.970
Next, we are going to bind it to the U A.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.390
Rela user dash list.

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990
Okay, All the rest is finer.

17
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.490
Let us click Finish.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.280
It is simply fire a little.

19
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.870
This eclipse is able to create the skeleton A of a survey.

20
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.910
It he's do post method.

21
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.280
It's finer and we're going to change to do get method.

22
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.960
So both the several it is making a query on the database.

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.460
Er, we are not going to connect it to a really database,

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.720
but we are just going to create a list of users.

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.930
Are let me copy,

26
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.630
paste it real quick and put those users are in the list areas least Mary James,

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.390
Patricia and John.

28
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.740
There's put that in the least colder users are.

29
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.970
We're going to bound this list to the request we Crist set.

30
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.520
Attribute User list users are and forward the request on

31
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.920
the JSP that we're going to create.

32
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.640
Request that get request dispatcher to the users least dot jsp on Call

33
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.650
the Forward method with the request on the response.

34
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.690
So basically this of lead is faking request on the date

35
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:16.000
of a ZA creates a list of users on past this list of user using the request to a JSP.
