00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.930
[Autogenerated] Now what we want to do is of course,

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.200
to marriage a the development we made on this

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.140
special branch to the master branch.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.070
So to do that, we can check out this Master branch,

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.230
select the commit We want to marriage a on merged disk.

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.540
Um, it just like that.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.260
Of course,

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.510
since those two branches have different version of the same user class

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.190
conflict occur on This is exactly what I wanted to show you.

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.540
So if we check the user class,

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.560
we have this well known gets in tax with the first part coming

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.870
from the Ed Branch on the second part coming from the devel

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.760
branch that we created earlier.

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.240
So let us see how we can solve this conflict.

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.540
We can select the user class in the package.

16
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.040
Explorer, go to the team of Shona of the pop up menu.

17
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.680
Select the merge tool here, which is a built in Tula within eclipse.

18
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.940
This merciful view is divided into three parts.

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.740
The first part of the structure compare on the Java structure

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.360
compared The second part is the current commit.

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.220
We are watching you which is the a C zero commit If

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.340
we check on the Easter review,

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.480
we can see that this commit is indeed the head commit.

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.240
And the second part is the A 64 commit.

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.770
That is,

26
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.920
if we check on the history view the devil commit that were trained to merge.

27
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.340
Now the question is,

28
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.260
what are we going to select from which commit here

29
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.930
the private in ager we want it.

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.740
So let us copy this part to our current commit.

31
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.510
We want also the gate agent and said Agia and we want to keep the two string.

32
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.080
So let's just select IQ like that that is closer.

33
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.850
These you and save it on that We can see on the user class

34
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.870
that we have a clean class with both changes from the Devil

35
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.140
branch and the head branch.

36
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.530
So there is coming this team commit stadia.

37
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.640
The changes are the conflicts has been sold.

38
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.670
Commit.

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.050
So now how are classes cleaner?

40
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.100
The conflict has been sold.

41
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.390
We can continue by maybe removing these to stream a third er

42
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.240
and add a new on with both feels name and age so that our

43
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.000
user can be properly displayed.

44
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
A let us commit this last modification have

45
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.960
deterred the to string method commit.

46
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:58.000
Check the history here and we can see thou that the Devil Branch has been properly merged into the master branch.
