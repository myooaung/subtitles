00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,250
[Autogenerated] Once you've done that,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,100
you may need to fix the configuration off this Java may even eclipse project.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,740
There is no error Schoener in this package explore view.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,880
But if we check the properties off this project,

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,200
you may see that so many moments are missing.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,620
So letters fix that.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,300
So to do that you need to see,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,340
like the project pop up menu and go to the properties are

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,470
optional Java Bill's bath and in a source option here at

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,810
the different photos You see, that maven is complaining,

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,240
for instance, because the SRC test java is missing.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:51,840
So letters at this folder create new folder SLC test java next finish.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
Now it has been created.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,220
We can also create a cell.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,990
C main resource is our finish and it's all see,

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,860
this resource is those are the full standard

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,330
folders that maven is using toe work.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,590
A property that is creek Okay,

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,860
apply apply in closer and now Maidana should not complain anymore.

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,750
The error message that was present on SLC to Java is not here anymore.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,500
So you see that importing a maven Java project from a remote repository is a

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,470
lot simpler than importing a plane device you project.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,720
The odds are that most of the time the project you will

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,070
need to import are indeed maven project.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,960
The only caveat is that you need to install the right

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:54,000
begin before doing that because it is not present in the eclipse installation by default.
