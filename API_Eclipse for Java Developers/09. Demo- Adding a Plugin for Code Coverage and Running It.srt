1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,050
[Autogenerated] Now suppose we want to add a nonstandard The

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,960
play Ginna a plug in to the May even build process That is not

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,940
part of the standard maven lifecycle.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,060
Very classical example is toe other for instance,

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,090
some good coverage and the resists for our test.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,240
There is a breaking for that called Jack a coup.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,170
So letters Adah this begin.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,560
No, the Jackal.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:31,880
Copra.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,340
Gehna, is this Warner?

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,430
Let us Greek.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,740
Okay, this begin has been a data.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,860
We need to add some configuration to eat.

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,890
Let's may copy Paste it quickly.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:53,630
This is this Warner and Executions XML supplement with one execution element I

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:00,720
d Prepare agent and goal Prepare Agent Let us say that for Jack a code to

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,980
generate its report we need to first launch maven verify then launch the

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:16,500
special Jack Cocoa Gold Cold Jack Ako report So for that we can create a new

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,170
configuration May Vonna new configuration.

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,120
Let us call it Jacko Report The base directory is of course our

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,920
project The golden We can begin by cleaning the target directory then

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,520
a called the maven Very fight fazer then a called the Jackal Co report

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,110
Gola apply runner These gold and we can see in the console that

24
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,540
everything is running properly.

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,600
First, the clean a maven goal has been colder.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Then the prepare Agent Jack A Gogol under standard.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,550
The resource is compiler.

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:12,480
Test resources test Compile and test major gold in that order.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,710
After that, the package lifecycle phase is colder.

30
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,690
Who is the maven?

31
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,930
Jar goal!

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,210
And then the Jackal Co report Goal has been called.

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,740
Let us reduce this console.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,570
Check the target.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,340
Subdirectory.

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,540
We have this site note that has been created with the Jackal Co reporting it.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,940
Index, Let us open this in our default system editor,

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,940
which is the Chroma browser, by the way.

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,700
And we have the jackal co report that is displayed in our package.

40
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,180
There is this ello service class and we can check the class with

41
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,960
the code coverage that has been computed by Jack.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,380
Oh,

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,010
So this is a way to add a play Ginza to the maven palmer dot xml a

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:16,000
specific play ginza for specific tasks and to create a run configurations within eclipse to launch them
