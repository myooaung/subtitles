A letters quickly wrap it up.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.010
Well,

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.720

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.260
Tomcat and to interact with Tomcat.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.540
We created a basic Java ee project on the Maven Java E project,

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.970
which is most of the time what you will be doing if you're

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.770
working in a really production environment.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920
And we configure the crepes to launch this project,

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.020
using Tomcat to start and stop Tomcat and to launch it in debug mode way.

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.490
So how to use the Cliff's graphical user interface to create

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.970
some of the elements of a Web application?

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.030
Er we saw the serve.

15
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.240
Let the html file on the Djebbour silver page filer.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.060
It's basically the same for Web servicers and arrest service.

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.690
Soza, you So how to launch Tomcat on how to debug it?

18
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.120
And you saw that in two configuration a development configuration with their

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.710
local tomcat installed on the possibility to de burgh your web application in a

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.500
remote tomcat using the debug features off the JV M.

21
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.610
And at last we saw how to package the war filer to deploy a Web

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.430
application using the warp again off may even.

23
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.000
And since this is the last Majola off this course,

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.840
it is also time to rub this course EPA.

25
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.280
What did you learn in it?

26
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.270
Well, we covered quite a lot of ground.

27
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.400
In fact, this cause was all about eclipse for Java.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.430
Deborah Poza,

29
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.790
you saw the most useful tasks you have to master as a Java developer.

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.360
Using eclipse Configure Java project Choose the right J D.

31
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.940
K and change it if you need it.

32
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.340
Create a project with Mariana.

33
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.690
Megan is really a de facto standard nowadays in the Java space.

34
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.190
So learning how to use may burn through your I d is really a

35
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.290
most use get for source control management get is also a de

36
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.960
facto standard in the Java space.

37
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.340
So we saw that how to use git through the Eclipse graphical interface,

38
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.150
including interacting with get Herber interacting with databases of without

39
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.110
having to launch external tools to do that Very useful on at last create de

40
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.040
burger on package Web applications using both the Java e pra Geena of a creeps

41
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.910
on the Java e maven Pugin that we have any Crips.

42
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.460
That's it for the schools.

43
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.840

information on the jealous base.

46
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.380
And you can also check my open source projects on my get up account,

47
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.570
including many Java things.

48
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.590
Thank you for watching this course.

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.000
