00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,130
[Autogenerated] Okay, so I think we covered the quite a lot of ground.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,740
So let us wrap up this module.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,500
So what did you learn in this module?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,550
First of all, you saw how to configure a maven project in eclipse.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,260
It is rather technical.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,770
There are several steps to consider.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,730
You learned how to choose which installation of maven you want to user you.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,820
So how to configure maven and especially where it

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,640
should go and look for its repository.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,350
And if you're in a company environment in a professional environment,

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,950
those configuration points are bound to be set up by your team.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,190
We saw how to run a specific maven.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,640
Goals are standard maven goals like maven test or maybe unpack Asia

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,620
and also maven goals that are broads by pro Ginza.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,370
And we saw a very classical example, which is the cut coverage J.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,040
Cocopa, Gehna And we also So how toe end Aled, a parent project way.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,240
The several modules, our example was very simple.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,920
We had only two modules to consider,

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,190
but it can be easily extended too much more complex configuration.

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,040
And with that I think we are done with this Majola.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,270
Thank you for watching it.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,140
But I hope to meet you again in the next ______ of this calls,

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:40,000
which will be about how to handle get from within eclipse. Thank you and see you in the next module.
