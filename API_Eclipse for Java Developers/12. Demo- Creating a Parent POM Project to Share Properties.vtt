00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.800
[Autogenerated] now,

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.770
the last thing we need to see is that we have two projects ello,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.500
service and groceries in the second.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.880
Wanna depends on the first one, and they are obviously sharing common properties.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.430
This set off property, for instance,

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.440
is common between themselves and the play Ginza declared in this implementation

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.150
project should definitely be common to those two projects.

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.520
In fact, when you create very complex application projects using may bona,

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.880
you may have 10th or hundreds of artifacts in your project.

10
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.740
And you have, of course,

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.960
common configurations that you need to share among all those projects.

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990
The solution to that is well known.

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.220
A.

14
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.270
It is to create, in fact, apparent project with modules with maven modules.

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.880
That will depends on those parents.

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.910
And this is what we're going to see now for that working to

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.340
first create a new maven project project.

18
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.960
We're going to skip the archetype selection.

19
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.470
We do not need that order.

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.650
That Moammar artifact I d.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.290
Will be ello application A.

22
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.090
And the version is going to be zero that one.

23
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.280
And instead of selecting jar as a package,

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.290
Gina, we are going to see wrecked Mama since a parent bomber is a bomb packaging.

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.210
Let us click.

26
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.090
Finish.

27
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.940
We have our l o application A And since it is a bomber maven project,

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.920
it does not have any source directory or anything like that.

29
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.800
Reason why these SRC directory does not appear as a

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.590
source directory In this package,

31
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.830
Explorer View letters opened this bomber do some little clean up and now we

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:12.000
are friends going to add a I were a low service project as a maven module off this hello application Parents project.
