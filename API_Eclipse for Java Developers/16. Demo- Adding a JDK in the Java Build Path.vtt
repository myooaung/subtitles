00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.870
[Autogenerated] So let us change that.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.090
For that, we can just go up.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.440
One level in the installed jar is here.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
Here we can see that we only have Ah one J.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.150
D.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.900
K.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:28.990
Let us Adah adjudicate eight Next click directory here the Java J Decay

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.300
and choose a Jessica eight here Eclipses happy because it found all the

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.200
necessary filer for the JK Click finish on.

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.180
Now I have installed both energetic a nine and

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.720
energetic eight lettuce Click a Bleier, go back to the execution environment.

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.060
And now if I check the Java SC 18 here,

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.170
Eclipse will tell me that it knows Energetica eight with a perfect

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.110
match for this So I can just select these dedicate and select here

15
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740
the Jedi canine for Java issue night.

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.330
I can do that for all the versions of Java up to Java to let us apply in closer.

17
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.040
And we can now choose agenda a C eight using the J.

18
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.180
D.

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.630
K that we just declared.

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.150
We could also use alternate gyre he here and choose directly one of the J.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.280
D.

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.930
K.

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.020
We have declared a and from this button here we have access directly to

24
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.800
the installed diary that we just saw a minute ago.

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.380
That is Cancel that and keep this J d.

26
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.740
K selector to conduct our development using Java eight.

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.050
Now we have a Java age project,

28
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.710
but we are not quite down because at this level we can see that we

29
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.210
still have the module path and a class path.

30
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.480
And this is a job a nine feature.

31
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.450
We do not want it in a Java eight development.

32
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.390
To change that,

33
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.320
we need to visit the Java compiler option here that has applied the changer,

34
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.600
which is data.

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.380
And from there we can set.

36
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.940
How eclipses going to compile our projects.

37
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.300
And we can see on this warning Messager that we are trying to compile a

38
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.320
Java nine project using a Jedi G eight installation,

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.360
which is of course not compatible.

40
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.100
So let us select here, wondered eight To get rid of this warning message,

41
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.940
let us click.

42
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.410
Apply in closer Eclipse is asking for full rebuild since we change

43
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.580
the version of the compiler which is normal.

44
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.410
And now we have a Java eight project.

45
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.040
By the way, if I check again ah,

46
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.140
the properties of this project and change the bill path that is used.

47
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:08.000
You can see that we do not have this module path and class path here anymore, whether in the libraries there or in the project pain.
