[Autogenerated] EC lives, they find that several notions.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,900
The first notion it defines is the notion of workspace in a jail.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,510
Er workspace is a directory on your disk.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,970
They can be as many workspaces as you want at a given time.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,350
Only one instance of Eclipse works in a workspace,

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,820
and one instance of a cleaves can only work in a single

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,990
workspace a workspace can contain and can handle.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,570
Several projects on those projects are going to share common

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,240
properties defined at the workspace level.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,770
So one workspace is one folder, and one project is one sub folder in a workspace.

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,540
Suppose we have a workspace gold workspace.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,310
Inside these workspace, there is a hidden subdirectories called dot meta data,

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,350
which contains a version dot any configuration filer.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,730
It also contains the dot log file with the messages

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,490
Eclipse rights in case of errors, and there is also a dot log fire.

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,250
They can be also many subdirectories in these dot meta data directories

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,520
created by Eclipse itself or by one of its many plug ins and then the other

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,490
subdirectories For the Projects Project Wall Project to project three product

19
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,720
for and insider projects of directories.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,880
There is one subdirectories called the dot sittings subdirectories,

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,460
which is a hidden subdirectories and 25 dot class,

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,980
path and DOT project.

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,340
Those elements contains a project level configuration.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:07,000
We are not going to open them. Usually you do not need to change or edit those files or subdirectories by hand.
