00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,500
[Autogenerated] let us see now how to add a dependencies

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,540
are toe an existing maven project.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,480
I just added some content here l A service which looks like the service we

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,270
created in a previous Majola and also a test class which unfortunately does

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,360
not complied because I do not have these Sergi and J Unit Framework

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,210
declared as dependencies of my project.

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,050
Of course, I could add them as eclipse dependent Caesar,

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,630
just as we did in the previous Majola.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,850
That would work.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,520
But this is not the right way to do it.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,940
Since we are dealing with the Maven Project,

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,130
What we want to do is to add a J unit and a surge A as

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,780
dependencies through the pom XML through the Maven,

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,340
a dependency handling mechanism.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,640
So let us go back to the Bomb X and Ella.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,540
Of course, I could type in a directly the dependencies elements and stuff in XML,

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,100
but I can also use a maven Add dependency from the

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,240
pop up menu of this Palmer ex Mnla.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,880
I am presented with this other dependency pain er with a

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,080
search engine here but which is disabled.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,130
Since the index downloads are themselves disabled.

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,040
This is the default state of this pain when you open it for the first time.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,810
So the question is, where can I enable this index downloads that is closer.

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,690
This Baena, go back to the window preferences here, filter.

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,940
The Maidana options are select the maven route optional.

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,760
And here we can tell Maybourne to download repository

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,040
index updates directly on start up.

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,530
Let us apply.

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,960
Playing closer.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:20,720
We can add a dependency by typing in a here J unit, for instance.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,350
Now,

32
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,570
you may also observe that nothing is displayed in this search results window.

33
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,630
Let us cancel this and checked one last thing in the May Virna prefer answers.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,230
Um, here, when you click on the user settings are you have this re index.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,500
But Erna, if you see nothing in the search results window,

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,180
you probably need to click this re index,

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,480
but IRNA it will trigger the downloading of the

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,700
index off the maven repository on.

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,390
You will be able to search for artifacts in it directly from a clips.

40
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:12,000
And by the way, since the index is rather big several 10th of megabyte, it may take a while the first time you download this index
