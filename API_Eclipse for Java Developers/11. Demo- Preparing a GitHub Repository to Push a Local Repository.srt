00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,160
[Autogenerated] Let us see now how we can push this

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,370
repository to a gettable repository.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,200
That is a cloud repository.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,340
Basically, what we're going to do and what I'm going to show you,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,780
is the same as pushing toe any repository get.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,740
UB is a well known and popular repository for open source projects.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,250
So I think it's interesting to see this example will get help.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,120
So for that, I'm going to open my get up account, create a new repository.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,170
Let us call it sample, Get for oversight.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:48,190
This is a simple repository for my Prue oversight

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,040
cause eclipse for Java developers.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,990
A.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,040
Of course, it is a public repository.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,600
I do not want to initialize it with a read me because I

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,430
am going to push some content to it.

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,590
And creating a read may would create a first comet in this repository

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,780
which will create problems with this push operation.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,240
So let me create this repository.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:30,000
It's pretty fast, and I am going on this page to copy paste this u R l which is an http s Euro
