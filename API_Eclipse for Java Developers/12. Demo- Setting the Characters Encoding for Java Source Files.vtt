00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.530
[Autogenerated] before we go any further,

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.260
we add content to this class and we try to run it.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.340
I would like to show you two elements.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.000
First, I'm going to see, like,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.940
this class and to open the properties of this class,

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.720
I can select them from the pop up menu.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.540
Right Click and the tub down.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.500
Though option in this huge menu is the properties of Shanna or I can use

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.140
directly the shortcuts Al to enter toe open the property panel for this class

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
And what they would like to show you is that by default,

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.840
the text file, including for Java source code in eclipse is in fact wronger.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.530
It is inherited from the OS you are using on my windows machine.

13
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.550
This is CP 12 52 on it should be utf eight now I could click

14
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.580
other here and select utf eight like that.

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.760
But of course I don't feel like doing that for all the Java classes.

16
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.830
All the Java source code I am going to create what I would like to have is

17
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.680
eclipse create dot Java files in utf eight by default.

18
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.290
So let us keep this as the default cancel.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.900
In fact, to do that, you need to go to the window menu here.

20
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.230
Select preferences are you have all the preferences of

21
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.710
eclipse here and there are many.

22
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.360
In fact,

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.160
every time you install a plug in a vase pregame that can add content to the

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.540
set of preferences are so let us filter for encoding.

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.140
We need to go to the general content types off Schoener,

26
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.360
select the text option here and then choose default

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.200
encoding utf Dash eight Just here it will be inherited by

28
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.780
all the text generated by Cripps.

29
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.540
Andi are many including html XML, CSS, etcetera.

30
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.300
Let us update apply in closer And now if we check

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.210
the properties of this fighter,

32
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
it will be utf eight by default on all the Java source code that

33
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.440
we're going to create will be a utf eight.

34
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.890
Also,

35
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:35.000
this is Mandela's a range of our because the fact that the dot Java fires are you tive eight is in the specification off the language
