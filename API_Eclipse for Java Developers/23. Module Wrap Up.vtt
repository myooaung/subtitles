00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.690
[Autogenerated] Okay, So what did you learn in this module?

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.480
Well, first of all,

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.310
you learn how to find your way in the a Cliff's graphical user interface.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.620
This interface is complex.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.720
There are many elements in it,

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.600
but you do not necessarily need all of them to handle Java applications.

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.540
You set up several things up.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.420
First of all, a Java environment compatible to the eclipse you have.

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.630
Ah, remember, not all the cliffs can be launched by any J.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.740
T.

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.380
K.

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.320
So you need the right Jay decay.

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.900
To launch the version of Eclipse, you have a second.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.670
You saw how to create Java projects in a crepes.

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.500
For the moment, we concentrated on Java A C projects.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.360
But don't worry.

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.640
We are going to create maven projects on Java e projects.

18
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.850
In the rest of the schools, you saw how to add dependents,

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.450
Caesar either between projects inside the same workspace or with external

20
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.340
jaws imported as user defined libraries or simple jars.

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.930
And you saw also how to generate a job from your project and all along with

22
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.870
saut troubleshooting because it's always annoying to have to look for

23
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.040
another message on the Internet to make things work.

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.400
And with this I think we are done with this Majola.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.770
I hope you found it interesting.

26
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.830
Thank you for watching it.

27
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:45.000
In the next module we will bring maven on stage and see how we can deal with dependencies and project building using maven.
