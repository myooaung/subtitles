00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,430
[Autogenerated] Hello.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,990
I'm very glad to welcome you to the school's eclipse for Java developers.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,510
A.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,400
My name is juicy and you'll begin by setting up a Java A C

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,390
development environment with a clips.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,210
The Java I D offer is not that big image of a space,

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,680
but we still have three tools to choose from to develop.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,970
Our applications are the first one is called Net Bonanza.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,540
It used to be developed by Sun Microsystems,

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,590
which used to Stewart's Java back in the days of it

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,040
has then been developed by Oracle.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,180
When over called both the Sun Company and then given

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,030
to the Apache Foundation by Oracle, Net Beans is freely available.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,090
It is an open source software very I quality great

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,890
stool to build Java applications.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,160
Then we have Inter J.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,960
Developed by company called Jetbrains are there is a free open source.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,570
Apache 2.0 licensed community edition of this tool and an

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,790
ultimate version with more features,

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,880
more elements in it that is a paying A software.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,740
And then, of course, there is Eclipse,

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,200
which is the flagship software off the Cliffs Foundation,

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,850
a cliffs used to be developed by the IBM Company and then has been

24
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,190
given to the Eclipse Foundation or wide ago.

25
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,340
Now the question, you may ask is,

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,920
which of these software should I choose to develop Java applications?

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,330
The question is very complex, in fact,

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,870
and it really depends on what you want to do.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,640
And if you want to spend money in an I.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,850
D.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,240
E or not.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,360
Currently, the most widely used is with no doubt eclipse.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,500
It's used by more than half of the Java developers,

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,460
which is country more than six million people in the world.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,890
Net.

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,290
Baines is used by probably something like 10 to 12% of the Javadi

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,440
Ripper's on Jetbrains ER has a share of about 30 to 35%.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,940
Now.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,370
Those figures are not very precise.

40
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,150
It's in fact,

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:34,000
very hard to measure the Rosa and to tell what is the market share off old of those ideas
