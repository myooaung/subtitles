1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,210
[Autogenerated] now suppose that we do not want to run

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:12,910
our tests using the Eclipse utilities, but directly by launching maven test,

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,940
which is the gold used in a made in space to render tests.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,410
We have two solutions for that.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,090
We can use the pop up menu from the pump filer here, Reynosa.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:31,140
And here we can execute this palm fighter, which is not really executable.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,440
We, the available goals cleaner generates also is installed on test.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,240
So if we ran a maven test here in the console, let us open this one.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,220
We're going to see the execution off maven test the running of our test,

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,740
which is a success.

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,020
But suppose that we want to do something that is not

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,810
readily available in this menu.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,640
Like maybe unpack agia or maven Deb Roy on the special repository.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,290
We can also create for that a runner configuration honor from

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,650
this menu here run configurations here.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,760
We already have the ello service task that we just

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,430
executive We're going to create another one for that May

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,170
even build a new launch configuration.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,870
Let us create maven a package.

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,490
For instance, the base directory is the Yellow Service project.

21
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,480
The goal we want to execute is the package.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,740
Golda, if we want to add to provide, we just need to fit in this box here.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:50,780
And we can also add perimeters here that does.

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,480
Bleier run this coder.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,590
And this time on the console,

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,240
we can see that all the life cycle of the maven builder has been executed.

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,640
Resource is compiled.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,570
Test resource, Sirs, This compiled test,

29
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,110
which is a success, and then package by calling the maven job begin,

30
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,380
we have created ello service Dash Zero that want the job

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,090
in the target directory of our project.

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,000
Let us check that here.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,850
Indeed, a new directory has been created.

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:42,000
A Let us refresh the content and the aero service dash 0.1. The job has been properly created in this directory.
