00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.740
[Autogenerated] Now what we want to do here is Creator,

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.090
the class message service.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.980
You know, back a job order tomorrow.

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.840
Service finish.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.230
And in this class,

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.800
we will have a single method public ________ that get Miss Ager return head.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.790
Oh, well, the and what we would like to do,

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.230
of course, is used this service in our area.

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.520
Well,

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:49.120
class message service message service equals new message service

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.390
and replace this string here by message service.

12
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590
That good message?

13
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.410
Of course it doesn't work.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.800
Why?

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.360
Because message services declared in another project,

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
then the first project where the other world class is.

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.790
What we need to tell Eclipse is that these first project

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.140
is depending on the message service.

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.920
To do that, we can see, like the properties of this project.

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.840
But in the bill path Adah,

21
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.160
the project message surveys as a dependency to the

22
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.040
first project we just created.

23
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.250
Now, First project knows message service.

24
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.460
So if I ask you cliffs to fix the imports of this

25
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.500
class by using control shift Oh, as a shortcut,

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.170
it will be able to import message service.

27
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.010
And if I runner the year world class by clicking on

28
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.890
this button it will work properly.

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.690
So this is how you can declare dependencies between your Java project.

30
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:10.000
Go to the properties of a project on the bill path here, project Abba, you just add the project you need as dependencies to this project.
