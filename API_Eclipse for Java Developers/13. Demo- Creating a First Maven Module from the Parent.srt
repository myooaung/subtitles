00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,240
[Autogenerated] So this is a a maven module linked to this

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,690
parent project we're going to skip once again,

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:20,140
this archetype selection, Anna, and creates a low application service.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,120
I am going to call it like that just to make it different

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,170
from the existing Aero Service project.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,630
Next, the group idea is inherited from the parent project.

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,530
On the same for the version.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,840
Finish this ello application service appears here as a project at

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,040
the same level as the Ello application project.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,890
But in fact,

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,560
it has been created in a subdirectory off the ello application directory here.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,090
Now we have the same problem off this Java five declaration A.

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,980
Let us check the Palmer of this module.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,690
Letters do some clean up.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,340
We can see that the ello application, a parent project,

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,660
has been declared as such.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,850
And we only have the artifact i d.

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:23,000
Of our applications of it project that Opie is here. Since the Group I D and the version are inherited from the parent
