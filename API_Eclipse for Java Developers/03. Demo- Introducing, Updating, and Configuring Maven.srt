1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,070
[Autogenerated] And now let us jumping the demo off this Majola let

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,440
us create riel maven projects within Eclipse.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,980
We will first create Defour projects using artifacts.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,120
And then we will study the relationships between several maven

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,740
project within the same eclipse workspace.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,500
We will see how to download the source code off maven

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,140
dependencies as longer they are available old,

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,430
and we will also run maven goals.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,130
So we are now back in the eclipse i d e.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,540
And before we see how to create maven projects,

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,840
let us check the maven configuration of eclipse.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,740
It takes place in the window.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,800
Menu preferences.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,120
Options are it is open this painter more here,

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,580
we can filter on May Berna and we have all the options Maybourne has to offer.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,720
The first we want to check in the installations a configuration

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,680
in which we can see that these version of eclipse comes with an

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,050
embedded version off May Virna,

19
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:24,700
version 339 If we check the user settings are we can see that the default

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,780
repository where Megan is going to re called all the artifact dependent

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,090
Caesar on Braganza is this Wallner hidden dot m two slash repository

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,630
within a you personal home directory.

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,570
Now these configuration works perfectly,

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,590
Wailer, as you can use it for this Majola.

25
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,240
But I am going to show you how to change it.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,610
First, I am going to declare a custom version off.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:05,100
May Virna Letters Adah this version A click directory here and directly

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,170
go to the right directory Which is this Warner click?

29
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,230
Ok, here we have a 350 version off.

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,830
May even installed a Let us click finish and select this

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,640
version as the one we want to use.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,500
Click Apply.

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,430
It was go to the user settings.

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,220
Now change the settings that XML that we want.

35
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,140
Maybe 12 user.

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,330
So letters browser.

37
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,700
Let us go here in the cough directory.

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,150
I have my own setting that xml that I won't maven to use.

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,110
Let us open this.

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,840
You can click the update Settings are if you wish,

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,940
But now you can see that the local repository that is used

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,040
by this installation of Megan is deep.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,980
Megan Repository, where I stole all the artifacts begins on the like.

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,690
It is quite important to do that,

45
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,540
especially if you're in a company environment where those repositories are

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,440
most of the time in standard places on development machines.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:31,000
Let us apply in close, and now we have a properly configured maven installation within eclipse.
