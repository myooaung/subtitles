00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,940
[Autogenerated] so eclipse on databases.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,550
How does it work?

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,640
Let us first see the big picture of the organization.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,830
You know that Eclipse is a Java software on as search.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,900
Connecting to a database for Java software is built on J D B C J D B C.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,270
Stands for Java Database connection.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,840
It is a standard AP I available in the J.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:29,960
D.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,890
K from the very early versions off the jetty K.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,100
So as a job application,

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,120
ANA Eclipse needs a J BBC driver to connect to the

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,130
corresponding database server.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,930
J D B C is an a p.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,260
I mostly made off interfaces.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,940
There is no implementation in it,

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,750
so you need an implementation particular toe each database server toe.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,040
Implement these jdb c a p I.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,340
So the first step is to install this jdb see driver in eclipse so

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,510
that it can connect to the database server you need.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,790
Then, when this is done, connection can be created and used on.

21
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,630
The connection is made of basically three parts first year L and 2nd and 3rd,

22
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,870
a user name and a password to connect to the database just as a side note.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,570
If you're not familiar, with J.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,710
D.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,310
B, C or database of proclamation in Java,

26
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,820
you can check several JD busy courses available here on Parasite.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,440
Let us first see more precisely.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,880
Our things are organized.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,980
You probably remember from an earlier module that all the

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,630
projects you can create within Eclipse arsed older in sub

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,670
folders off a workspace root folder.

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,040
In these workspace, there is a sub folder hidden called dot meta data,

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,150
in which a cliff's stalls various technical information.

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,090
This is where the J BBC driver off the database that you

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,880
want to use is going to be stored.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,400
Of course, several J D B C drivers can be installed within a clips for Instant,

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,600
my sequel, Post Gray Secret Server, Oracle Database Server on the like.

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,100
So these J BBC driver installation is made at the workspace level,

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,290
and this made available in all the projects from this workspace.

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,600
Once you have a project that you want to connect to a database,

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,700
a particular connection to a particular database of server

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,430
instance will based old at the project level.

43
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,600
So if you have several projects connecting to the same database instance,

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,200
you want to create one connection per project.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,000
This is how things are organized. Other workspace level
