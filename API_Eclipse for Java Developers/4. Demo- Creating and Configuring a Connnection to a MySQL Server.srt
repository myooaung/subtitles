1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,910
[Autogenerated] for the moment, these database instance is empty.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,660
There is no table it.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,930
So what I want to do first is to connect to these

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,840
databases and create the right table.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,370
For that,

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:21,650
we're going to use a special view available in Eclipse Window Show view,

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,940
other, which is the data source Explorer.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,340
Let us open the view.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,380
These you could appear anywhere on the perspective.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,180
So if you want to drag and drop it from one place to another,

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,040
you can just do it like that as usual.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,390
And by the way, if you are using the Java e perspective of Eclipse,

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,830
the data source Explorer is already opened.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,640
In this perspective, let us switch back to the Java.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,080
Is he perspective?

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,770
For the moment, this data source explora is empty.

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,690
What we're going to do is create a database connection

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,840
from this node here Buffet menu new.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,440
What we want to create is a connection to my sequel server.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,450
And we are going to call this my sequel Connection profile max equal per site.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:20,810
Click.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,380
Next.

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,230
There is no driver available here.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,640
This drop down list is empty.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,740
So let us click on this button to create a new driver definition.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,250
What we want to create is a J BBC driver to the 5.1 version of my Sequera.

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,560
So let us create this one.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,080
Switch to the journalist here.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,330
There is just a placeholder telling us the name of the fight we are looking for.

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,820
So at this point, you need to know where.

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,490
For instance, in your maven repository,

32
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,840
your my sequel Jdb see driver he's located.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
It is located here, so I can just open it.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,140
I can get rid of this Warner switch to the properties of this driver.

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,440
The connection your Ella will be to local host slash per site.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,310
The database name is per site.

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,960
The user i d is also parasites.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,700
And by the way, the password is also parasite.

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,190
Let us click.

40
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,840
Okay?

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,250
We are going to save the past Werder in the eclipse configuration file,

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,360
which is not necessarily very safe.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,590
And we can test the connection here.

44
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,120
The connection is okay.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,320
Meaning that eclipse has found the right driver

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,720
that the database is open running.

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,680
The your ella is correct.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,840
Database name is correct and the user and password are also correct.

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
Let us click next.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,780
We can review here.

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,620
The different properties we set up, they are all correct.

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,790
So let us click.

53
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,090
Finish here.

54
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,880
Now we have a database connection in a available here.

55
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:25,000
And if we open the parasite Noda, we see this key Mazza, the parasite user as access to and see that there is no table in this database.
