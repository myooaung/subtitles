2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.990
What did you learn?

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.260
A.

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.120
In this majora Well,

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.630
you learn everything you need to know to properly work with git

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.340
within eclipse without using the common liner.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.040
Now there are still things that are not implemented in the eclipse interface.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.630
So being able to use get through the common line is still very useful.

9
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.760
You So how to conduct the main gate operations of using the eclipse interface?

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.030
You.

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.330
So how to create on configure git repository?

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.780
How to commit?

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.230
How to create a branch on how to use the merge tool in a conflict situation?

14
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.040
A.

15
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.300
You also So how to configure a remote git repository from

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.270
within the interface and configure,

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.890
push and pull operations between your local repository and

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.910
this remote repository You also So how to deal with

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.620
credentials are the classical https, user name,

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.240
password,

21
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.330
clear and shoals and also the ssh protocol based on the use of

22
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.870
private and public it and you also so at last,

23
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.930
out to import a Java project from a remote git repository.

24
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.950
Locally in two cases, a plainer Jeff I see project all the most useful one,

25
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.850
which is a maven Java project.

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.100
By the way, all the repositories we saw in the examples are still in.

27
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.820
Get tub.

28
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.750
I do not plan to delay them, so feel free to use them if you want to practice.

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.490

about connecting eclipse to databases,

34
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:14.000
