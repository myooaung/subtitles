[Autogenerated] letters first introduce How Eclipse and May Virna work together?

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.900
A clips supposed Havana using a beginner.

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.750
Now the good news.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.250
Easa,

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.140
If you have downloaded eclipse for Java E developers are you

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.020
already have this plug in installed Eclipse also comes up with

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.670
an embedded version off May Virna.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.120
So if you have downloaded these version of eclipse,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.730
you also have downloaded a version of me.

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.990
Even this is very useful.

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.900
If you want to fiddle around to play with Eclipse and may

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.600
even and see how things at work now in a really

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.970
development production environment, this is not how you want to work.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.680
You want your own version of may even properly configured for

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.670
your professional development environment.

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.690
Eclipse exposes most off maven functionalities

17
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.580
through the graphical user interface, and we're going to see that now.

18
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.760
This module does not cover maven itself.

19
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.580
So if you're not familiar with maven fundamentals,

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:24.000
you can consider watching the caused by Brian and Son Maven fundamentals available here on proper site
