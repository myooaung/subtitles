00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.960
[Autogenerated] Now that we have set up a connection to our databases,

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.640
let us see how we can launch sequel queries to it.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.620
For that, I am going to create a fighter in this fight folder,

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.070
and I'm going to call it create.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.140
That's equal.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.210
The Sequera filer is a known of filer by Eclipse,

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.940
and you see that we have a special editor for those

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.800
of sequel fights here we can see, like the connection on this filer.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.230
It is subject my sequel of five that Wanna the name My Sequera

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.020
Poor site on the connection to the database.

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.470
Prefer site A clips tells us that we are connected

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.760
and in the photo commit ______.

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.940
So from now on, we can type in a sequel Coda.

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.690
So let us create a table called User Way.

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.160
The primary key, called I D,

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.380
is going to be an end primary key on the photo increment,

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.000
then a name which going to be a bar car of 80 for instance,

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.310
and an age which is going to be in it.

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.040
We can execute this statement directly from within this viola pop up menu.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.760
We have three options are execute all executes,

21
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.140
reacted text or executes directive text as one statement,

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.420
Let us choose this.

23
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.340
Warner,

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.710
on executing these sequel query automatically opens another view called

25
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.940
the sequel results View with the status off our query.

26
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.750
Our create table juice inquiry has bean successfully executed on the database.

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.160
If we check back in the data source Explorer, refresh the stable note.

28
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.550
Now, we indeed have the user table that appears here with the different columns.

29
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.240
We have created letters.

30
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.710
Save this vile er.

31
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.090
Now that we've done that,

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.130
we can use our creators a class to create a set off users in our database.

33
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.740
Let us run this class pop up in you Reynosa.

34
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.140
Job application.

35
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.940
Check the consoler.

36
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.250
These message at the end of the executioner is just the execution of the batch.

37
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.760
We have one liner created per batch liner, which is expected.

38
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.800
And now if we check in a data source Explorer,

39
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.400
we can select the table,

40
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.640
pop up menu data and click edit to see the content of the user table

41
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.240
With the four users that we have created in our code.

42
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.780
By the way,

43
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.020
we can also use this table view to interact with the

44
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.140
table and to create detain it.

45
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.540
If I click on new row here, add a user Jenny Fair, 39.

46
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.420
Now Onda Michaela, 21.

47
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.160
All I need to do is say the result.

48
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.080
The message in the sequel results view tells me that the two

49
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.110
insertions have been made a and if I refresh tissue,

50
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:32.000
the two generated primary keys are are appearing in the I de Colombia of this table.
