[Autogenerated] remember that Java e applications are not stand alone.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.840
What does it mean?

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.970
When we saw Java s E examples,

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.690
we wrote a main method and plastic lives to execute

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.830
these main method a Java e application.

6
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.840
Ana is not run like that.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.990
Each runs a in an application server.

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.640
So it means that in a Java e application, I do not have a main method.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.910
The main method is in fact, in the application server.

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.620
I do not see eat as a developer.

11
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.620
They are lots off application servers around.

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.100
Think about Tomcat by the Apache Foundation glass fish developed by

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.840
Oracle J Bus developed by Red Hat who have logic.

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.320
Also,

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.860
they loved by Oracle webs for by IBM and many others are so to be able

16
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:11.000
to run the application we are working on a eclipse needs to connect to one of the servers and use it as a runner
