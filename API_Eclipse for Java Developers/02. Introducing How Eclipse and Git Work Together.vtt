00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.970
[Autogenerated] So let us talk about eclipse and get first of all,

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.590
eclipse supports.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.740
Get through the use of a pro Gehna that is,

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.140
in fact installed in the default installation of Eclipse itself.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.040
So if you have downloaded the eclipse for Java E developers,

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.650
you do not need to download anything more.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.100
Everything you need a tow work with git is already in your eclipse installation.

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.990
Eclipse also comes with an embedded version of Get.

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.480
So you do not need to have any separate installation of git.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.000
Most off the get functionality za I exposed through the

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.740
graphical user interface of eclipse.

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.560
And this is what we are going to see you can still

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.990
use Get through the common liner.

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.020
If you're familiar with that, it also works perfectly well.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.600
By the way, if you're not familiar with get itself,

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:14.000
you can check out to excellent courses are available here on Parasite How get works and mastering it made by Polo Perata
