1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,640
[Autogenerated] so the first step is to connect Eclipse Toe,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,040
an application server,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,120
and the application server we are going to use as an

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,480
example is the Tomcat application server.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,430
A clips needs a plug in for each application server

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,610
around and sometimes a different play gin for each

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,320
version of such an application server.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,770
Now the good news is that eclipse for Java E developments

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,080
comes with already installed a Ginza, so we will not have to download those.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,610
If this is the case,

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,920
If you're using special application server not supported by default by Cliffs,

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,150
then you need to go to the marketplace and download the right plug in.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,830
Once this is Donna,

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,430
a connection to an existing server instance toe on existing

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,250
server installation must be established.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,460
Let us see the big picture of the eclipse on the

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,740
application server organization.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,970
As you remember, A Cliffs works with a special folder called The Workspace,

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,740
in which all our project folders are going to be stored.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,900
In that folder,

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,990
there is a special dot meta data he didn't folder in which the different

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,140
connections to the well known application servers are is to order.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,720
And once this is done,

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,140
each project can be connected to a given instance of an application server,

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:42,000
so the organization is exactly the same as the jail BBC organization we saw in the previous module.
