1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.440
[Autogenerated] let us now create First Java e project.

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.950
For that,

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.750
we're going to use the pop up menu off this Project Explorer

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.140
view off the Java E Eclipse Perspective.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.490
New project.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.360
It is open at this one.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.440
We have, ah, one note that looks interesting, which is the Java e note here.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.490
But in fact we're not going to use the project in it.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.250
We are merely going to use the Web Noda there and the dynamic Web project.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.230
If you want to create a web up, this is the type of project you want to select.

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.540
Let us speak next.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.720
The name of the project will be first.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.650
Web app will keep the target from time as Apache Tomcat version.

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.040
Naina, this is finer.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.340
If you have other runtime declared at the eclipse level,

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.900
then they will be made available here from this drop down menu.

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.210
The dynamic Web module version is three that wanna, which is fine.

18
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.890
If you want to downgrade this version, you can do so with this drop down menu.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.840
And the default configuration is also fine.

20
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.090
We cannot click finish and the the first Web app project is being created.

21
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.590
Let us open it you can see that this project is a little more

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.190
complicated than a plain Java SC project.

23
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.240
We have several Noda.

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.620
The first wana is the configuration of the Web application

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.540
with all the elements you can create in it.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.520
The second wall no is for the Web services.

27
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.430
On the rest,

28
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.400
servicers deployed er with the service endpoint

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.460
interfaces on the web service of themselves.

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.450
We have them the Javari source Soza with the SRC folder in

31
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.870
which the Java Code we're going to write with beast order

32
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.430
on the libraries are Noda, Wister, gvk and you patch it on Canvey nine library.

33
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.450
Then if you have JavaScript resource is there will be declared here.

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.360
The Bill Noda is to store the compiled fighter off This Web

35
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.020
application on the Web content will hold the HTML pages.

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.240
Jsp JSF five imagers, odio, ex cetera.

37
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.220
This is the first way of creating a Web application on what we can do

38
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.540
is check the properties are here of this project.

39
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.140
Select Project facets here and check the facets that

40
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.920
have been selected for this project.

41
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.470
We can see the dining week Web module three.

42
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.960
That's one Java wondered eight and javascript wondered.

43
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.000
Zero on this button. Here we can see that the runtime selected is the Apache Tomcat who v nine.
