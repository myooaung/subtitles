00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.350
[Autogenerated] So, in fact,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.540
behind the curtain on many things that happened here,

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.050
an instance of Tomcat has been configured and

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.640
launched and added to this service you.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.640
Our Web application has been deployed in this Tomcat Web server

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.800
on the browser has been launched in eclipse.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.790
Let us make a modification to our pager.

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.460
This is our welcome page.

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.200
You can see that quickly.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.290
We were replication transited from the state,

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.200
synchronized republish and synchronize again A.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.540
If we refresh this page,

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.130
the new message is appearing so automatically When a

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.300
modification is made in the web application,

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.950
this web application will be reloaded in Tomcat.

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.970
Here we have a very simple way replication with just a single HTML page.

17
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.340
So reloading it in Tomcat is very fast.

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.220
If we have a bigger web application, the with many classes,

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.060
many services this reloading might take a few seconds.

20
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.560
Reloading automatically on a modification may not be what

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.610
you want to configure that all you have to do is double

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.970
click on this Tomcat Web server.

23
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.980
Here it opens the overview configuration of the Web server.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.600
And here in publishing, you just need to click this button.

25
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750
Never publish automatically.

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.510
You can save this configuration by pressing control s.

27
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.010
And now that it's modify this Messager Nice welcome pager.

28
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.370
You see that the server on the Web application stays a in

29
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.880
the Republic state And to trigger the publication A you

30
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.280
need to click this button here, publish to the server.

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.360
Let us do that.

32
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.440
The server is now synchronized with our way replication.

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.000
Reloading. The page here will show the new state of our HTML page.
