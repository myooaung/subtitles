Well I come to this course.

00:03.670 --> 00:09.430
Great to have you on board discourses about javascript a great language which you have to learn if you

00:09.430 --> 00:12.760
want to do anything on Front-End web development.

00:12.930 --> 00:17.920
Now you won't learn Javascript in this course though there are great courses out there which will teach

00:17.920 --> 00:23.260
you javascript but we will dive into the most popular frameworks for javascript.

00:23.260 --> 00:27.910
I will give you an introduction to these frameworks and you will not only learn how these frameworks

00:28.000 --> 00:32.970
think and work so that you can then choose one and dive deeper into it and Avro courses.

00:33.370 --> 00:35.860
But then that's very important in my opinion.

00:35.860 --> 00:41.590
You will also get an overview over the javascript world and I will hopefully clear up some of the confusion

That can be hard to navigate this jungle of turn's packages libraries frameworks what is all of that.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.840
While this course we're going to go through that.

00:59.970 --> 01:03.020
And by the end of the course you should have a much clearer picture.

01:03.190 --> 01:07.840
And since we have introductions to the three most important frameworks you should be able to make an

01:07.930 --> 01:13.160
educated decision into which framework you want to dive deeper and you will also know why.

01:13.180 --> 01:15.570
Using that framework might be a good idea.

01:15.580 --> 01:16.790
So let's get started.
