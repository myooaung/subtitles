Over the last lectures we learn a lot about how we can use that template created by the Selye and how

00:07.830 --> 00:13.670
we can split our view code over multiple files how we can put our components into their own dot view

00:13.670 --> 00:18.900
files and how that of course makes it much easier for us to focus on the individual components and even

00:18.900 --> 00:21.960
use more features in DS to view files.

00:21.990 --> 00:25.830
Now feel free to play around we have to start new files and use the features you learned about in the

00:25.830 --> 00:27.360
chase for like samples.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.760
They should work here too.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.650
And you even can use case sensitive event names.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.760
Now if you want for your custom events.

00:33.930 --> 00:40.200
But I know when I go into the single page application direction because right now yeah we use only one

00:40.200 --> 00:45.870
page to then use a couple of different components to build that page but we're not able to switch between

00:45.870 --> 00:46.520
pages.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.380
And with that I mean give the user the impression of switching pages.

00:50.640 --> 00:57.000
So that is what I will do in the next Electress when we introduced the router a nice tool which allows

00:57.000 --> 01:00.540
us to well route the user to different pages.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.220
So to basically change your L and load different components depending on the you are el.
