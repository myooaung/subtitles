00:02.970 --> 00:05.590
So we've talked a lot about all the modules and how do you upstarts.

00:05.670 --> 00:11.820
Let's go back to the EP on HBO fall which is responsible for displaying what we see and as I mentioned

00:11.880 --> 00:13.670
we have these curly braces here.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.960
That is how we can output dynamic content.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.640
It's called Stringer Appalachian because it just renders text a string to the dawn.

00:21.750 --> 00:27.430
That being said you could also outpoured something like a one here which is not a string because it

00:27.450 --> 00:32.730
can be cost to a string you can be converted to a string which is why we now see one here.

00:32.970 --> 00:36.180
But let's stick to the app we created in the view chair.

00:36.210 --> 00:43.560
And we actually as part two there we started by having a name property and Deadwood be max or your name

00:43.560 --> 00:44.460
of course.

00:44.490 --> 00:48.720
Now in view chase we had it in this data object in reaction.

00:48.750 --> 00:49.010
Yes.

00:49.020 --> 00:54.810
We first started storing this in a variable and then in a state in angler we simply work with these

00:55.140 --> 01:00.750
component classes and store the data we work with as properties of these classes.

01:00.750 --> 01:06.720
So here name now we can go back to the template change just to name because that's the name of the property

01:06.720 --> 01:07.630
we stored.

01:07.680 --> 01:14.160
And if we save this we now see Max here as a heading so we could of course all that changed is to a

01:14.160 --> 01:18.950
paragraph to have a normal paragraph element which displays Max.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.710
This is how we can work with that application.

01:21.850 --> 01:25.200
Is how we can output data with string tribulation.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.660
There is another way of putting data though and it will come back to this way.
