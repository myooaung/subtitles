Over the last lectures we started with the basics of chess and how we can output data and react to changes

00:10.410 --> 00:10.980
and all.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.370
Well listen to events.

00:13.410 --> 00:17.590
There are two other common use cases which I want to cover right now.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.610
Lists and conditional output.

00:20.610 --> 00:21.800
What do I mean with that.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.200
Let's start with the conditional output.

00:24.510 --> 00:27.900
It's a common test that you got some parts in your page.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.480
What you don't want to display all the times for example a warning message if the user enters a wrong

00:33.480 --> 00:35.270
value or something like that.

00:35.490 --> 00:42.480
In this case you don't want to display the warning message all the time but only if wrong input was

00:42.510 --> 00:44.130
entered.

00:44.130 --> 00:51.720
Here in this case we could say that we want to display a number paragraph below to name where we say

00:51.810 --> 00:53.300
name updated.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.870
But of course only if we did click Change name before.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.990
Now to make sure that this is only shown once he did change the name I'll use a number directive command.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.990
Mujeres understands the if.

01:07.080 --> 01:14.600
Now as the name suggests this allows us to conditionally show or not show this part of the damn year.

01:14.940 --> 01:21.210
So between the quotation marks and the value we assigned to we if we defined a condition and here we

01:21.210 --> 01:26.640
can write some basic javascript code or we could call a method which returns true or false.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.700
Whatever we do.

01:27.750 --> 01:33.780
The only important thing is what ever we write between these quotation marks has to return true or false.

01:33.790 --> 01:34.870
In the end.

01:34.890 --> 01:42.900
So what we can do here for example is we can check if name equals and then as a string with single quotation

01:42.900 --> 01:45.620
marks max which would be our starting value.

01:45.780 --> 01:48.930
If that's the case we know that the name hasn't been changed yet.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.060
So in this case and that's just a ternary expression here because we can't write the if statement in

01:54.060 --> 01:54.720
there.

01:54.900 --> 02:02.070
But if this is the case all return false I relies on return true because I only want to display name

02:02.070 --> 02:05.140
updated if the name is not Max.

02:05.160 --> 02:11.250
If it doesn't we had Enter world and we still see Max but if I click Change name we see name updated

02:11.250 --> 02:11.820
too.

02:11.970 --> 02:17.500
And this is how we can use a conditional statement or how we can use the if to conditionally attach

02:17.520 --> 02:20.260
or detach elements to or from the dawn.

02:20.310 --> 02:23.090
And that's important if we inspect.

02:23.160 --> 02:28.930
Does name updated part here and I'll quickly reload the page with control enter.

02:29.190 --> 02:34.920
So if we inspect let's say Max we see that here we get the paragraph below we get the button and then

02:34.920 --> 02:37.070
we get this marker in between.

02:37.170 --> 02:40.160
But we don't see this name updated.

02:40.300 --> 02:45.000
Partir this paragraph is not visible because that's important.

02:45.150 --> 02:48.430
View Chase doesn't make it transparent or anything like dead.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.810
It's just not added to the DOM.

02:51.110 --> 02:57.560
As soon if I click Change name now you see it was inserted their name updated.

02:57.690 --> 03:04.680
So the if really adds elements to the dom or if we were to somehow get this condition back to false

03:05.020 --> 03:06.440
remove them from it.

03:06.750 --> 03:12.990
And that of course is very important to know and to keep in mind and a really great feature of ukase.
