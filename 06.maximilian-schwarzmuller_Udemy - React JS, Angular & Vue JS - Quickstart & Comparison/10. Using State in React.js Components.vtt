In the last lecture we learned about the ESX way of writing such components.

00:07.150 --> 00:14.000
Now when I use state to state I need to add another method to my component deconstructive.

00:14.080 --> 00:20.230
Now that's a reserved method name constructors that iOS 6 feature and that basic needs to function which

00:20.230 --> 00:24.170
is called whenever a new instance of this class is created.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.710
When is such an instance created.

00:26.950 --> 00:34.350
Well here when we tell react to use this app component then re-act will instantiated for us.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.950
So therefore the constructor does its thing.

00:37.030 --> 00:40.040
It receives something the props.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.020
And now we need to call in the constructor body which gets executed whenever we create a new instance.

00:46.180 --> 00:52.020
We need to call super props super Just cause the constructor of the parent class.

00:52.030 --> 00:58.640
So if the re-act component since I told you that react manage just as prop's property for us and merge

00:58.640 --> 01:01.430
us all the props we pass it automatically.

01:01.570 --> 01:07.330
If we do set up our own constructor we need to call the parent constructor to allow re-act who still

01:07.330 --> 01:09.110
do this merging.

01:09.130 --> 01:14.130
After this we may run any code we want but here there is one thing I want to do.

01:14.260 --> 01:18.000
I want to set my own state to do this.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.870
I'll use a number property provided by the re-act component to state property so we have this process

01:24.990 --> 01:29.100
for data from outside and does state for data from inside.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.570
You could say data you may change inside of it.

01:32.670 --> 01:37.750
This state is a javascript object which manages your state.

01:37.890 --> 01:45.530
Perhaps all this a javascript object but managed by re-act for you here in this javascript object.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.360
Simply Now one to set up key value pairs.

01:48.360 --> 01:54.720
For example my name and you can set up any state you want here name now needs and initial state.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.210
Because we're in the constructor.

01:56.310 --> 02:00.000
So we're setting the state as it should be right at the start.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.090
You could set this to max to a string Max.

02:03.360 --> 02:10.650
But since we know that we get the state from outside via property we can also say prop's which is passed

02:10.650 --> 02:13.890
to the constructor name and that's important.

02:14.040 --> 02:20.790
You shouldn't try to change to prop's but using props to set the initial state as we do here is totally

02:20.790 --> 02:22.230
OK.

02:22.230 --> 02:25.950
Now with that we store the name and drop in state.

02:25.950 --> 02:29.650
So now we can use this state name instead of this Propst name.

02:29.730 --> 02:33.980
If I had control enter this still works.

02:34.040 --> 02:39.290
Now however we can change the state whenever this button gets clicked.

02:39.290 --> 02:45.590
So I'll add my click listener again and now I want to call a new method so I'll have to create it all

02:45.590 --> 02:52.500
name it change name and new method in my class here and then change the name.

02:52.520 --> 02:59.840
I know need to call a special method giving to us all to buy the re-act components plus it's called

02:59.900 --> 03:10.240
Set state and I need this to access my CLOS itself and set state takes one argument an object and in

03:10.240 --> 03:12.390
this Optik we set the new state.

03:12.400 --> 03:18.320
So for example here today we want to set name to Anna and then react we'll take this object and merge

03:18.400 --> 03:25.780
with the old state and if we had more props in there like for example D.H. that wouldn't get overwritten

03:25.780 --> 03:27.720
if we only changed the name down there.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.460
It will only override the state which we do set here.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.810
So it will override name.

03:32.830 --> 03:37.210
So now with that we set a new state we output the state here.

03:37.300 --> 03:43.020
All we need to do is we need to call change name and we do that by calling this change name.

03:43.030 --> 03:46.650
This is required because the render method is all part of the class.

03:46.660 --> 03:53.140
So we need to call this to access a method of this class and no Also important indeed change a method

03:53.350 --> 04:01.450
we're using this now if you know javascript you know that this can be tricky because if you use it on

04:01.450 --> 04:07.180
a click listener like here and to click listeners so the user event the dom in the end is what caused

04:07.180 --> 04:08.070
this Meffert.

04:08.230 --> 04:11.840
This will not refer to this class at runtime.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.610
It will refer to whatever calls this method.

04:14.830 --> 04:22.780
So we need to call bind this year to make sure that we clearly tell javascript that this should always

04:22.780 --> 04:26.090
refer to this clause to the context we're writing the code in.

04:26.230 --> 04:32.980
Even at runtime if that's something which is totally unclear again that is a very important code concept

04:33.070 --> 04:39.750
off Javascript definitely dive into some javascript course to understand how this works.

04:39.760 --> 04:47.360
Now with this change if I now had control and for now watch Macs if I click Change name now it changes.

04:47.380 --> 04:52.220
We're finally there but now embracing the re-act way of doing so.

04:52.970 --> 04:55.340
Let me summarize what happened here.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.140
To fully understand how this works and how re-act now updates to Dom.
