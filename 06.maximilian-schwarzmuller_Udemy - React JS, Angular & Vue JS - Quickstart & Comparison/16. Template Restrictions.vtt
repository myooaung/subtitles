00:02.400 --> 00:09.360
And The Last Lecture we successfully made at an event but only after we made sure that the event we

00:09.370 --> 00:13.350
met and listened to is all lowercase.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.190
The reason for this is how templates your work how aged HTML works.

00:18.410 --> 00:22.570
The dorm by default is case insensitive.

00:22.910 --> 00:36.500
So user clicked like this didn't work because here we emit user clicked with a capital C but in the

00:36.500 --> 00:43.730
dorm we can actually only listen to while a case insensitive names so user clicked was emitted with

00:43.730 --> 00:48.320
a capital C because we did this in javascript which of course is case sensitive.

00:48.320 --> 00:54.180
But in the template here this doesn't exist so we couldn't listen to it.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.470
And that is actually a restriction which we will get rid of later in the section when we dive into a

01:00.470 --> 01:03.510
different way of working with this when we leave.

01:03.620 --> 01:08.720
Yes Fertel and work with a different work flow for now that's just a restriction.

01:08.720 --> 01:14.520
This type of template here and there is a different type will have a look at later has.

01:14.810 --> 01:21.770
So just make sure that the events you are admitting here listening to our case insensitive or are all

01:21.860 --> 01:23.910
lowercase therefore in the end.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.700
But with that we're able to listen to our own events send our own data to components and use components.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.190
Again a better and easier way of using them will be presented soon.
