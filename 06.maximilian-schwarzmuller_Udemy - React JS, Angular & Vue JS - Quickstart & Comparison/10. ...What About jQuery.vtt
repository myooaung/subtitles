Throughout the section we had a detailed look at angler reactant view.

00:07.590 --> 00:12.440
And what about Shakeri in the getting starting section of this course.

00:12.490 --> 00:18.640
I kind of showed you why we might want to use a framework like view to replace Cheikh worry and that

00:18.650 --> 00:25.720
Shakeri has some limitations and that is true but that doesn't mean the cheek worry is absolutely out

00:25.720 --> 00:26.820
of the game.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.730
It really depends on your needs.

00:28.840 --> 00:34.090
If you have anything which is a bit bigger then I'm not talking about big single page applications.

00:34.120 --> 00:41.740
I also include multi-page applications where you change a bit more things on the page if you have anything

00:41.740 --> 00:42.540
like that.

00:42.640 --> 00:49.600
Then Shakeri might not be the best tool for the job because it is manual state management and the fact

00:49.600 --> 00:55.210
that you manually have to select elements add them remove them and manually make sure that everything

00:55.210 --> 00:58.740
works together fine could quickly become cumbersome there.

00:58.810 --> 01:03.020
However if you never had a problem with that you can of course stick to cheat Querrey.

01:03.220 --> 01:09.940
And also if you have a very simple use case maybe you only want to show a modal and then hide it or

01:09.940 --> 01:11.180
something like that.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.510
Then Shakeri might also be all you need.

01:13.510 --> 01:21.190
You don't have to go with frameworks like view Engler or react but they are great options for ever pages

01:21.250 --> 01:27.630
where you use a bit more Javascript and certainly if you plan to create a javascript driven the front

01:27.640 --> 01:34.330
end so a single page application then check where he will quickly reach its limits and the frameworks

01:34.330 --> 01:39.600
present that this course will offer a much nicer way of creating such applications.
