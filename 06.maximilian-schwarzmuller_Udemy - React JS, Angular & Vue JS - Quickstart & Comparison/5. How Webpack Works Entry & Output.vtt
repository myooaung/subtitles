WEBVTT

00:02.780 --> 00:05.570
Not we understood what the development server does.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.050
Let's have a look at a web.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.850
Because there seems to be important.

00:09.020 --> 00:15.110
As I explained it's the bridge between us writing nice code over multiple files and using nice features

00:15.650 --> 00:18.510
and still getting code which runs on all browsers.

00:18.900 --> 00:26.540
Welbeck is a great tool but it offers enough content for a course entirely focusing on webpage.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.570
So I will only briefly walk you through what it does here.

00:30.650 --> 00:36.820
The web that conflict yes file which reopened here is the core part of your web page workflow because

00:36.900 --> 00:43.190
dessous where you configure how your workflow works basically wetback.

00:43.290 --> 00:50.240
The webpage configuration has four important pieces to of it being very important to two very important

00:50.240 --> 00:55.780
ones our entry and output you have to think about web page like this.

00:55.910 --> 01:01.940
It always starts at one or multiple files but you specify here as an entry point.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.870
Typically only one filed though and then it will analyze this file.

01:06.890 --> 01:12.680
So here we tell it to start in the source maned or chase file and with analyze I mean it looks at the

01:12.680 --> 01:15.260
file and it analyzes.

01:15.290 --> 01:18.080
Which ever files this file imports.

01:18.200 --> 01:25.790
So did WePay knows which files this fall depends on so that we can write multi-file modular code and

01:25.790 --> 01:30.430
split our code over multiple files where Pech will analyze which files we use.

01:30.440 --> 01:38.120
So here it would see we use two packages view in view router and we use four of our old files and we

01:38.120 --> 01:41.950
specify where these files can be found here with relative paths.

01:42.010 --> 01:45.550
Now where pigsties dead end will then chomp into these files.

01:45.560 --> 01:51.620
Both the packages like to view and view router package and our own files and if it for example chump's

01:51.620 --> 01:57.260
into the user view file it will also see that here we import yet another file so it will have a look

01:57.260 --> 01:58.670
at this fault too.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.390
And this way it works its way through all our dependencies and builds like a tree like structure starting

02:05.390 --> 02:13.250
at one root and then with multiple branches to include all the files we in the end use.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.130
Now that that's the entry point.

02:15.410 --> 02:16.570
We don't need to define it.

02:16.580 --> 02:21.210
Once you have analyzed all the files you should bundle them and we tell it.

02:21.260 --> 02:26.180
Where should you place the spandrel the bundling process happens automatically so we don't need to tell

02:26.180 --> 02:31.280
it that but we need to tell it where does should be stored and how it is named.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.220
We do that here.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.720
We specify the Poth and this has to be an absolute Poth which is why we use this node as helper Poth

02:38.750 --> 02:45.870
resolve which will just build an absolute Poth surname as a variable referring to the current directory.

02:45.920 --> 02:53.540
So this basically creates a path which points to this dist folder public partier is required to tell

02:53.540 --> 02:57.440
where Peg where should the assets be loaded from.

02:57.440 --> 03:02.960
Seen from the index age HTML file on and since the index age timeout finds it's an hour root directory

03:03.050 --> 03:04.840
and not within the disk folder.

03:04.850 --> 03:07.770
Does a slash dist and not just slash.

03:07.970 --> 03:13.220
If DNS HDMI file would be placed in this folder it would just be slash.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.070
And finally how should you name this file.

03:16.370 --> 03:22.910
Let's rename this to bundled J.S. and run any ever build again.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.870
What you will see is that.

03:24.890 --> 03:32.830
Now when this finishes in the disk folder we can delete the old bullet of Cheras fall.

03:32.830 --> 03:37.700
We now got this bundled js file and the source map.

03:38.140 --> 03:42.230
So Design is how we define how the created file should be named.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.750
Of course it would have to adjust it in our index HDMI file too.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.550
Let's refer to bundled dog chase here too so that it works again.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.120
These are the two most important parts.

03:53.260 --> 03:56.440
Import excuse me entry and output.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.640
Let's next to have a look at the average two parts.
