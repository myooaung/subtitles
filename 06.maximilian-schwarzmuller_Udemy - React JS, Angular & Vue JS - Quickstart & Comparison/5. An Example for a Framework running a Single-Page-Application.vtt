00:02.760 --> 00:07.540
And The Last Lecture we had a look at the multi-page application and I finished by telling you that

00:07.570 --> 00:10.080
if you enter a course you are allowed in.

00:10.090 --> 00:16.450
So by entering discourse dashboard something will change before we had different pages for a search

00:16.480 --> 00:20.250
and for overview of course by topic.

00:20.270 --> 00:25.090
Now there is the course dashboard and now watch my refresh.

00:25.090 --> 00:32.580
I can hear if I click on announcement's it doesn't change if I click on course content it doesn't change.

00:32.710 --> 00:36.100
Here we now are in a single page application.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.770
So we even have a single page application here which is part of a multi page application a part of you

00:41.770 --> 00:47.710
to me is a single page application you could say the course dashboard part everything here will happen

00:48.070 --> 00:51.070
without the browser reloading the page.

00:51.220 --> 00:58.240
Even if I start a video there it won't refresh the page it will load that browser window he or they

00:58.270 --> 01:02.290
will load the video player here I should say that go back to dashboard.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.450
Again we're still on the same page we got.

01:05.620 --> 01:13.670
So now we get a much bigger app driving days experience your driving does cause section here.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.330
This is a single page application.

01:15.370 --> 01:21.900
I can switch pages and you do see that your updates announcement's content Q&amp;A.

01:22.180 --> 01:29.410
You see that it updates and still it doesn't load a new page because again we get back one page for

01:29.410 --> 01:35.470
this whole core section by you to me and everything else has now changed dynamically by javascript in

01:35.510 --> 01:38.950
the Eudemus case your Baia angular one app.

01:38.950 --> 01:42.800
This is how we may use it to create a single page application.

01:42.970 --> 01:48.100
And as you see you can mix them with a multi-page application but you can also have clear separations.
