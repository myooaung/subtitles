In the last lecture we added the router and we set up basic routing.

00:06.670 --> 00:11.280
But right now we're only able to navigate by changing you or else manually.

00:11.380 --> 00:16.750
We probably also want to add some links so let's add a navigation here a Dave maybe.

00:17.080 --> 00:24.730
And here I will add new link by adding router link and Navjot components shipping with the new router

00:24.730 --> 00:29.770
package now router link then simply takes.

00:29.950 --> 00:37.060
Well caption it should have like for example at home then a number one for the block page and a final

00:37.060 --> 00:38.910
one for the account page.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.300
And to tell us where this link should lead to.

00:42.430 --> 00:51.780
We need to bind the two property and you can either bind it dynamically with rebind colon and then referring

00:51.780 --> 00:55.440
to some property or something like that which holds that name.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.840
Or if you just use two.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.910
Without you we bind you simply enter a string here.

00:59.910 --> 01:05.600
So for example just slash for home and for you have would be slash blog.

01:05.670 --> 01:10.510
So you are path as you probably recognized and then slash count.

01:10.570 --> 01:17.430
Of course the path you specify here has to match the paths you defined here.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.460
Now with this if you had save again you see we got the links here and now we can navigate by clicking

01:23.460 --> 01:27.000
them and that is how easy you can add router links.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.540
Now what about that hash tag in the you are here.
