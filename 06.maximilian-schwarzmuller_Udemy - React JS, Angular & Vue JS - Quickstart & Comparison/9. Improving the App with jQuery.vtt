00:02.610 --> 00:06.780
I'm back in the application you created and I want to improve it by adding cheek.

00:06.930 --> 00:12.390
And low Dasch Let's start with Che Querrey and let's Singhalese search Cheikh we in Google here.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.300
Let's go to check with dot com.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.290
If you click on download you could download it stored it locally if you're working locally that makes

00:19.290 --> 00:20.180
sense.

00:20.430 --> 00:26.010
But we're using Chia's fiddle and dare I want to use a CDN which basically has a link pointing to some

00:26.010 --> 00:28.170
other server not owned by us.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.400
Where does codas then download it from.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.690
We can find links if we scroll down here using Ciccarelli with a CDN.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.120
If you click on code or check with dot com here we can find links to Sabean's I'll use version free.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.830
Of course you may use different ones.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.950
One and I will use the uncompressed code.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.180
Copy the link address and back.

00:47.220 --> 00:48.200
Yes Fertel.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.220
I will simply add does import.

00:50.310 --> 00:56.820
So let's add a script tag here to the HDMI code and lets add a script import to shake query.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.940
The average code doesn't change.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.370
Now we can use Cicconetti.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.460
And if you never used to check the code I'm about right might look strange to you.

01:05.490 --> 01:11.130
I will still not dive deeply into Cheikh worry though because this is not a cheap quick course and Shakeri

01:11.190 --> 01:14.310
offers enough content for whole courses.

01:14.310 --> 01:18.570
So this is simply just using it to show you how we can improve this code.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.040
If you want to learn more about Shakoor we have a look at coerces focusing on that.

01:24.140 --> 01:31.310
So let's use Chiqui we can use Ciccarelli to easily select elements in a Dom for example instead of

01:31.310 --> 01:33.230
using Document selector.

01:33.290 --> 01:39.950
We can't just use dollar sign which is the most popular function introduced by Chickaree dollar sign

01:39.950 --> 01:46.070
and simply select elements in the dorm by using a CSSA electoral asked document query selector did.

01:46.280 --> 01:52.960
However if we use dollar sign that thing we store in input l button L and so on.

01:53.060 --> 01:57.000
It's no longer a normal javascript HVM l element.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.490
So the average code won't work anymore now.

01:59.720 --> 02:05.380
Instead it's a Cheikh where you object you could say with some additional meta data information.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.270
So we get X this year.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.560
As I said the error code won't work but that's no issue because actually we can improve the Aberg code

02:12.550 --> 02:13.350
too.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.240
For example for admitting an event listener click listener.

02:17.240 --> 02:23.450
Specifically we can simply use the click method and remove the first argument.

02:23.450 --> 02:28.880
Now click is available on button L because keep in mind Pattni is such a Ciccone object since we got

02:28.880 --> 02:35.810
access to it with the dollar sign method so click is one useful function introduced by Shakeri and as

02:35.810 --> 02:39.510
a side note if you want have a look at all the functions introduced by Shakeri.

02:39.590 --> 02:47.690
Go back to Shakeri dot com here and go to API documentation and there you'll find a list of all the

02:47.690 --> 02:52.820
methods introduced by Shakeri And if you click on them you'll get information on how it works.

02:52.820 --> 03:01.040
So back to our code we have our Click listener and we still tell Shakoor now to execute ads to do now

03:01.040 --> 03:09.140
in there we still extract value however not with value but with well a method called Val here and we

03:09.140 --> 03:14.840
have to use it because input l also was fetched via a dollar signs so we have a Chakri object there

03:14.840 --> 03:15.720
too.

03:15.740 --> 03:22.280
I can still use trm because user input still just is a string and a new traduce just a new object that

03:22.280 --> 03:23.050
is OK.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.190
We pushed to new Optik on the array.

03:25.340 --> 03:31.640
But here when we create a new element this works differently with men using check werie we can write

03:31.640 --> 03:41.320
much less code here so we can create this new To-Do list item by simply saying dollar sign.

03:41.720 --> 03:49.610
And then in there actually not selecting element bias's selector but that's a different use case of

03:49.610 --> 03:52.890
d.j where the method you're creating HVM own code.

03:53.030 --> 03:57.820
So the normal itx here and in between the user input.

03:57.830 --> 04:04.340
So let's concatenate this string here like that and let's add user input in between.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.220
Now this alone won't create the element we can now call append to.

04:09.260 --> 04:13.230
To append this newly created element now to the DOM.

04:13.340 --> 04:19.160
So here I want to append that to an ordered element and this already enables us to remove this line

04:19.480 --> 04:22.660
dys line and this line.

04:23.030 --> 04:27.960
We still need to make sure that we add the data set and event listener though.

04:28.340 --> 04:30.560
So I will bring append two into a new line.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.100
It still is.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.180
Attitude is.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.460
First line here.

04:33.510 --> 04:38.750
I'm sure splitting it over multiple lines to make it easier to read and I will therefore now also add

04:39.050 --> 04:42.800
the attribute method which allows us to add our own attributes.

04:42.800 --> 04:49.550
Here I will set data set id which is just what is set with data set thought Id here before and that

04:49.550 --> 04:55.510
does equal to myu to do Id with Dad you can remove this line.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.250
Finally I want to add a click listeners all at the click method and I want to execute.

05:00.320 --> 05:09.200
Remove to do here and we can remove this line much shorter already with check query not that creates

05:09.290 --> 05:12.660
a new element that to the attribute and to click listener.

05:12.830 --> 05:15.290
Let's have a look if we hit Control enter here.

05:15.350 --> 05:20.500
Clear to console and say why Malke still seems to work.

05:20.540 --> 05:25.270
We add to the array Whew clicking on it won't work though or it will work.

05:25.280 --> 05:31.600
But actually as you see it won't clear the array because there we still need to do some work in a remove

05:31.600 --> 05:35.780
to do we get to event but we actually don't need it here like this.

05:35.780 --> 05:41.810
Instead we can get access to the element which we clicked on by using dollar sign and then as an argument

05:42.240 --> 05:48.650
this does is a reserved keyword in javascript but when used in a Ciccarelli function like here it will

05:48.650 --> 05:50.780
give us access to the event target.

05:50.900 --> 05:58.580
Again as a Chiqui object then so that's the clicked Elyot and since we get this we can retrieve the

05:58.820 --> 06:01.660
item id by accessing etcher again.

06:01.790 --> 06:05.570
The function we used here to set this status had ID.

06:05.570 --> 06:09.230
Now if I passed just data set ID without a second argument.

06:09.450 --> 06:12.230
Well then I simply retrieve it.

06:12.250 --> 06:16.700
So now this gives me the item idea again and therefore the average code should work too.

06:16.710 --> 06:23.700
But we can improve to code down here instead of selecting the parent node and then remove child.

06:23.710 --> 06:28.630
We can simply call remove on clicked apply itself.

06:28.630 --> 06:36.590
Now let's open up the console again let's add by milk and answer questions.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.280
And now if I click on it you see.

06:39.300 --> 06:43.390
Now we only have by Moken the array and now we have an empty array.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.820
So now the app works just as it did before.

06:47.040 --> 06:54.140
But boy is that a lot less code a lot leaner code much easier with Cheikh worry.

06:54.150 --> 06:59.330
Now lets also add low dash in the next lecture before we don't have a look at what else we could improve.
