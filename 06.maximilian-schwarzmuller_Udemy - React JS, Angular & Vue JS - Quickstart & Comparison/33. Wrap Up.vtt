00:02.630 --> 00:04.260
With the addition of the router.

00:04.370 --> 00:07.440
This concludes this basic introduction to view chairs.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.540
We could dive much deeper.

00:09.560 --> 00:15.470
But keep in mind the purpose of this module of course is you only give you a first impression of the

00:15.470 --> 00:16.190
framework.

00:16.190 --> 00:19.910
A quick introduction UJA has offered us more features.

00:20.060 --> 00:25.420
And of course we only briefly touched on how we used the view Selye of this workflow.

00:25.580 --> 00:30.620
As I mentioned you can use all the features we learned about in the chairs for examples here in the

00:30.620 --> 00:36.680
local set up to and even more futurists and that if you want to dive deeper beauty s dot org is a real

00:36.680 --> 00:38.390
great resource to dive deeper.

00:38.390 --> 00:44.510
It has a great documentation and you may of course also take my full complete guide on view chairs which

00:44.510 --> 00:50.390
is more than 16 hours long and completely guides you from view chairs and even some advanced things

00:50.390 --> 00:54.910
like view X which is a state management plug in for view.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.430
So would be nice seeing there but I'd say let's continue to the section where we learn more about where

01:01.540 --> 01:08.270
Peg and does development work flow why we need it and so on before we dive into the other frameworks.
