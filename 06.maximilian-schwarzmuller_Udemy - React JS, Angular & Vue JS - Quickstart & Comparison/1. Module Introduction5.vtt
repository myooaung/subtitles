00:02.670 --> 00:04.510
Welcome to this course module.

00:04.620 --> 00:09.650
In the last module we had a look at the future as we learn how that works.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.820
Now when I dive into react.

00:11.820 --> 00:19.860
J.S. Riak chaos is a never very popular framework and it was developed by Facebook Facebook itself uses

00:19.860 --> 00:24.480
it a lot on the Facebook page you're probably visiting a lot now.

00:24.510 --> 00:28.020
There it is not to use as a single page application.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.050
Instead we have a full stack application.

00:30.120 --> 00:35.880
So the server returning multiple views for different or else baduy actually has its use on a lot of

00:35.880 --> 00:39.310
these pages to control big parts of it.

00:39.370 --> 00:45.900
However reactor Yes all is capable of running single page applications so both as possible just like

00:45.900 --> 00:47.450
with view yes.

00:47.880 --> 00:54.720
In this module we're going to dive into re-access learned from scratch and whilst we learned you will

00:54.720 --> 01:00.360
probably see some similarities to view chess but also a lot of inferences.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.070
And hopefully this will also give you your first clue on which one you like more.

01:04.080 --> 01:09.000
But however of course we'll will have a competition of all frameworks at the end of the course.

01:09.210 --> 01:12.400
So let's dive into reactivates now.
