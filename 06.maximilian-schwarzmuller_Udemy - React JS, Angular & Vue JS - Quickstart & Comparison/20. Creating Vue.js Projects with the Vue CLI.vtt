00:02.960 --> 00:07.370
Thus far in this module we always use chase Fedele to develop there.

00:07.490 --> 00:13.460
Or maybe you used your local set up and created each team L5 a script file import the script into H

00:13.460 --> 00:16.390
G M L and also at CDN import there.

00:16.580 --> 00:23.720
Now whatever way you chose that might be fine for simpler apps it might also be a fine for multi-page

00:23.750 --> 00:31.760
applications where you want to create individual viewed as solutions for your different pages and note

00:31.760 --> 00:34.590
you're of course not limited to the Cdn and this approach.

00:34.610 --> 00:41.740
You can click on installation on the official view chase page and simply download view Cheras here.

00:41.750 --> 00:46.610
The production version for example and put dead imports dead into your local set up.

00:46.910 --> 00:54.110
But if you plan on creating a bigger application specifically a single page application this approach

00:54.110 --> 01:00.740
of having multiple pages with individual employees of you Chason your little tailored solutions per

01:00.740 --> 01:05.840
page of course doesn't work to begin with because on a single page application you only have one page

01:06.440 --> 01:09.920
and then you probably will read much more code.

01:09.950 --> 01:16.070
Since you host your full front Front-End in javascript or you run your complete front end in javascript

01:16.430 --> 01:21.950
so you will quickly bloat that single script file with lots and lots of code.

01:21.950 --> 01:27.590
Now granted you could import many script files but then you would still have to take care about the

01:27.680 --> 01:28.960
order of these files.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.590
The order in which you import them manually so that also isn't great.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.780
That's why we will now dive into a better workflow.

01:37.780 --> 01:44.750
A better development environment for beggar view Cheras applications specifically single page applications.

01:44.780 --> 01:49.780
We're going to use views Sea-Lion you can simply google for that and should find it on.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.040
Get up here.

01:51.070 --> 01:57.440
No the view Seelye does sound bigger than it is but it is a very nice tool for quickly setting you up

01:57.440 --> 02:00.040
with templated workflows.

02:00.050 --> 02:05.270
So with out of the box functioning workflows of course you could if you know how to do that.

02:05.270 --> 02:08.840
Also set up your own workflow and build it from scratch.

02:08.870 --> 02:14.380
But if you quickly want to get started with some pre-built solutions the view Selye is a great tool.

02:14.390 --> 02:18.680
Now on the Get up page of the Seelye you will find instructions on how to install DC.

02:18.710 --> 02:23.600
Real simple we're going to do this in the next lecture and then how you may create new projects with

02:23.600 --> 02:29.120
it based on some templates of which you can find a list on this get her page.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.430
So here's a list of official templates you may use and we're going to use the web pick simple template

02:34.550 --> 02:41.140
in the next lecture to have a simple starting project using well-packed as our built tool.

02:41.150 --> 02:43.020
Now here's an important note.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.590
Well-packed workflows what's happening here.

02:46.640 --> 02:52.920
If you're asking yourself this question let's just continue and does Marchal in the Marchal there after

02:52.970 --> 02:58.630
though I'll have a brief look at what Web page is what it does and why we do need it.

02:58.670 --> 03:05.120
So if that's totally new to you that upcoming module might at least be a good starting point to well

03:05.180 --> 03:06.980
tell you what's happening here.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.430
But with that let's jump into the next lecture.

03:09.470 --> 03:13.800
Let's install the Seelye and set up an example workflow with it.
