00:02.490 --> 00:03.820
To start with.

00:04.050 --> 00:11.550
Yes I'm back in J.S. Fedele ask before if you don't like tasteful you could use a local set up however

00:11.550 --> 00:19.450
I will say one thing right away react genius doesn't work in a local set up out of the box.

00:19.620 --> 00:27.180
You need some as six features and you need a trance piler like Babel to make these features work in

00:27.390 --> 00:28.470
all browsers.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.430
And it also adds one special thing.

00:31.480 --> 00:38.060
Chase x 2 which I will come back which will also need the trans piler like be able to work.

00:38.290 --> 00:42.900
That is why I recommend going with chairs full for now or later in this module.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.840
Will of course also have a look at a local Setubal workflow.

00:47.100 --> 00:54.060
So let's get started in chess fiddle since it uses as I just mentioned ESX to work as it should to work

00:54.470 --> 01:02.640
and since it needs this extra feature we should switch from javascript here to be able to decompiler

01:02.640 --> 01:09.390
being babbel so that we can use this special feature I'm referring to after we did this we can simply

01:09.480 --> 01:13.640
search for re-act chess to find it here.

01:13.660 --> 01:21.500
The Facebook Facebook page and then click on Dock's installation to well install it here.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.910
You also find instructions on how to set it up locally.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.930
Again we will do this later.

01:26.940 --> 01:33.390
So for now I will scroll to the very bottom to find the Cdn links to again fetch the packages we need

01:33.480 --> 01:36.330
from a server and then use them.

01:36.480 --> 01:42.930
I will use DS to imports the first two which are optimized for development with some extra messages

01:42.930 --> 01:44.550
warning messages and so on.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.360
And we actually need both links here.

01:47.430 --> 01:50.290
We can now just drop them into Geass fiddle.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.960
And why do we need two packages.

01:53.130 --> 01:56.020
Because reactors simply split over two packages.

01:56.130 --> 02:00.900
One for the core features of react and one for the interaction with the DOM.

02:00.900 --> 02:05.940
You could say and I guess you can tell by the name which package is responsible for what.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.350
There are two imports added.

02:08.370 --> 02:15.330
Now let's create a first basic app and data will actually look like how we did it in future years will

02:15.420 --> 02:20.280
create a day of year with an idea of app and that name is totally up to you India and you could choose

02:20.280 --> 02:21.790
any name you want here.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.810
In chess you can't just type hash text app and tap.

02:26.160 --> 02:30.420
And now we want to control that idea with react.

02:30.420 --> 02:35.590
However here we will already see a first major difference to view chess.

02:35.760 --> 02:43.050
We can now simply use react on this is exposed by the second import and there the render method which

02:43.050 --> 02:51.960
allows us as you guessed probably to render something to the Dom to HVM else so to say the render method

02:52.260 --> 02:59.790
takes two arguments the first argument is what do we want to render the second argument is where do

02:59.790 --> 03:01.570
we want to render it.

03:01.620 --> 03:08.470
Now what can be HVM Alico though it isn't aged him all the code but I will come back to this.

03:08.520 --> 03:17.200
We could say piece a paragraph Max to output Max as a name and of course choose whatever you want to

03:17.230 --> 03:17.960
output here.

03:18.070 --> 03:23.220
And if you're already thinking well what HMO code in javascript What's that.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.610
You're on the right track.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.890
I will come back to what that is in the next lecture.

03:28.930 --> 03:32.270
The second argument as I said is where do we want to render this.

03:32.410 --> 03:35.070
And we want to render it inside of this div.

03:35.260 --> 03:41.590
So we have to pass a reference to this actually was simply selected with document COLLAERY selector

03:41.590 --> 03:42.440
for example.

03:42.460 --> 03:49.240
So normal javascript code and your hash tag app in the string and I'll just bring this to a new line

03:49.360 --> 03:50.660
so that it can read it.

03:51.070 --> 03:54.840
If we now add control enter we see Max you're on the right.

03:55.150 --> 04:03.730
And if we inspect this here like that you see that it indeed outputs this paragraph with this special

04:03.730 --> 04:05.810
attribute with Max in between.

04:05.890 --> 04:14.230
And that at all is kept death with the ID app dead as a first very basic re-act app.

04:14.230 --> 04:20.530
And now let's talk about this thing here which certainly is not normal Javascript code.
