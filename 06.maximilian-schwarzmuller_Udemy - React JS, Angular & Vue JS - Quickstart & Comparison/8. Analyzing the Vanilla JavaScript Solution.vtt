00:02.780 --> 00:06.060
All the last lectures we create are basic to do application.

00:06.150 --> 00:13.350
We got very little HVM code but quite a bit of Javascript code which makes sense because we have a very

00:13.350 --> 00:19.180
dynamic application here and we create and remove elements via javascript.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.140
We need to get access to these elements then we need to create new traduce here one issue is the idea

00:25.140 --> 00:26.980
it is not truly unique.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.600
We could fix this by using the timestamp but still not the great greatest way of doing it here.

00:32.730 --> 00:39.670
Then we create the element manually in a script we have that we store the ID in the dorm.

00:39.680 --> 00:47.130
Attached to this element and then we remove to do like there's also getting access to the target removing

00:47.130 --> 00:48.430
it manually.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.350
And what's this all works.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.480
It is a lot of code.

00:51.480 --> 00:58.290
We route route there and managing the state for example finding out which to do we deleted already got

00:58.290 --> 00:59.960
a little bit complicated.

01:00.100 --> 01:06.000
And I guess you can imagine this getting more and more complicated if you add more functionalities like

01:06.000 --> 01:09.570
being able to load it to do for editing or something like that.

01:09.570 --> 01:16.230
So data's live on the shell script might not be everything we need if vanilla javascript is not everything

01:16.230 --> 01:17.290
we need.

01:17.310 --> 01:24.690
How could we improve to code with some libraries some javascript libraries for example Cheikh Who are

01:24.690 --> 01:24.940
you.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.460
Orlow dash.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.460
Now what is a javascript library.

01:28.530 --> 01:35.670
A javascript library is simply a third party package of javascript code which gives you a lot of typically

01:35.700 --> 01:37.020
functions.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.620
Objects you can use to make your life easier.

01:40.770 --> 01:47.610
So the editors of the library already wrote an optimized a lot of code you would have to write otherwise

01:48.000 --> 01:52.910
so that you can use simplified function of achieving the same you that before.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.400
But now with less code allowing you to focus on your business logic and since you use less code to also

01:59.400 --> 02:04.000
write less error prone code that is what a library does.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.730
And here I only mention two.

02:05.760 --> 02:11.220
Of course there are many many many javascript libraries for different types of jobs and different types

02:11.220 --> 02:14.520
of things and we'll have a look at these libraries.

02:14.640 --> 02:23.190
So let's improve our existing application with the two libraries we see here to always see why using

02:23.190 --> 02:26.180
libraries like these might be beneficial to us.
