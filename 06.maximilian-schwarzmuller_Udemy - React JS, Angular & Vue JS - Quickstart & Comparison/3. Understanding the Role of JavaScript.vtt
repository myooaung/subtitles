What's the role of javascript in today's world now as a side note Javascript can be run on the server

00:09.270 --> 00:10.030
with node.

00:10.050 --> 00:13.290
J.S. that's another roll of javascript.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.600
A role I won't have a look at in discours because this course will focus on the front.

00:18.630 --> 00:19.940
Javascript development.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.440
The most typical use case of javascript use search and also the use case where we have all these frameworks

00:25.440 --> 00:26.580
and libraries.

00:27.090 --> 00:32.460
So let's understand how javascript works or why we use it to begin with.

00:32.670 --> 00:39.390
We're sitting in front of our machine where the client were visiting a Web page and we do so by typing

00:39.390 --> 00:44.170
some you are into our browser and therefore sending a request to the server.

00:44.370 --> 00:52.050
Now server means any kind of server running any kind of server side language for example ph ph is Peter.

00:52.060 --> 00:52.690
NET node.

00:52.710 --> 00:56.420
JS or Oulds a Ruby on Rails Python and so on.

00:56.610 --> 01:00.900
That doesn't matter for course the server side language doesn't matter at all.

01:00.930 --> 01:05.750
We will have a look at the front end of javascript speaking all dead.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.610
Right now we only sent the request.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.090
But of course you want to get back a response.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.770
So we probably received such a response by the server.

01:13.920 --> 01:19.750
And typically this response holds HVM I'll document some HGL code.

01:19.770 --> 01:27.360
Our browser can parse to create to Dom the document object model which basically is the parsed HGL code

01:27.450 --> 01:29.430
rendered by the browser.

01:29.430 --> 01:36.090
Now typically we don't just get back the HDMI code but this code might include some styling or javascript

01:36.420 --> 01:42.420
or might reference some external javascript father which art and also downloaded and that's the interesting

01:42.420 --> 01:44.130
part it includes.

01:44.130 --> 01:51.530
It probably includes javascript of some sort and Shabbas script runs on the client.

01:51.570 --> 01:58.140
So where our server side language is here run on the server and therefore are done at the point of time

01:58.140 --> 02:00.330
we get back the response.

02:00.330 --> 02:06.330
Javascript is still able to run once we are on that page and that is why Chamis script is so popular

02:06.330 --> 02:07.010
these days.

02:07.110 --> 02:14.070
Since it runs on the client it is able to execute code without sending a new request without us reloading

02:14.070 --> 02:20.190
the page so we can change the page after it has been loaded and that allows us to create great user

02:20.190 --> 02:21.380
experiences.

02:21.480 --> 02:27.780
Whenever you see a modal open up on our page or whenever there is something dynamic whenever the page

02:27.780 --> 02:34.430
changes at runtime there is a high chance the javascript is responsible for this that you actually did

02:34.470 --> 02:41.400
receive a new page by the server but instead that parts of that page were changed by challe the script.

02:41.430 --> 02:46.950
Some see as asset classes might have been changed or whole new elements were added or removed to and

02:46.950 --> 02:48.530
from the dorm.

02:48.540 --> 02:55.260
This is what javascript does and it is easier to use like this where we have a service side set up which

02:55.260 --> 03:01.590
sends us back pages where we use javascript to enhance the user experience or we will have a look at

03:01.590 --> 03:03.000
this later in the course.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.500
There even is a pattern which becomes more and more popular where javascript runs our entire front end

03:10.800 --> 03:16.950
creating a single page application where we only get back one page from the server and then javascript

03:16.950 --> 03:22.270
does everything on the front end and we only send occasional behind the scenes requests of the server.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.310
But more on that later.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.000
But that is the role javascript plays.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.610
It allows us to change something about the page after it has been loaded and therefore it's an important

03:32.610 --> 03:39.210
piece in building an awesome user experience because it is very react very fast and very instant.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.250
Now that's the role of javascript.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.250
Let's have a look at the javascript the world next.
