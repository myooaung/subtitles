00:02.640 --> 00:07.530
Well there wasn't a lot of things to go through but it's key to understand how the anger starts and

00:07.530 --> 00:08.900
how it works.

00:09.030 --> 00:15.950
Now in March we also got imports and providers and I haven't talked about these now as I told you angler

00:16.230 --> 00:18.420
may consist of multiple marshals.

00:18.420 --> 00:24.780
Here we only have one but actually we only have one custom monohull so one in our project.

00:25.020 --> 00:32.230
The angular framework itself also consists of many tiny modules which expose certain functionalities.

00:32.250 --> 00:38.550
The idea behind this modular system is that you only import what you need and therefore the bundle which

00:38.550 --> 00:44.160
is created in the end decode which is created in the end is as small as possible as things you don't

00:44.160 --> 00:45.800
need can be left out.

00:45.900 --> 00:51.530
Here we get free imports by default browser module formats module and HTB module.

00:51.570 --> 00:55.640
And as you can see all these modules are imported from angular packages.

00:55.950 --> 01:01.200
The browser module actually is the only module we definitely need to have a running application.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.370
It contains some core functionality to start and load and run our app and it exposes some basic features

01:08.430 --> 01:11.070
we probably use in most English apps.

01:11.070 --> 01:18.360
You will see them in the late Electra's forms module unlocks some form specific features you don't necessarily

01:18.360 --> 01:23.100
need this if you never work with any input elements or something like that you can probably remove it

01:23.100 --> 01:29.570
and also remove the import and HTB module is added to give you some H2-B related features.

01:29.580 --> 01:33.140
So a ways to send HTP requests to a server in the back.

01:33.150 --> 01:37.950
And that also might not be needed if you don't send such requests.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.390
So data is what we have an imports.

01:40.410 --> 01:47.860
Providers are connected to a novel concept into which I won't dive in dis introduction services.

01:48.060 --> 01:53.520
Now services are an advanced concept in angular and therefore of course part of my complete guide on

01:53.520 --> 01:56.330
Englad for example but vidis basic introduction.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.480
We don't really need them.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.760
They're not part of the core syntax.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.980
So we're now we may just ignore this provider's array here.
