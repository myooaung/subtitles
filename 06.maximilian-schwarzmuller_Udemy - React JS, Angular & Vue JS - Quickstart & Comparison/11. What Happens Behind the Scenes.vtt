00:02.880 --> 00:10.180
In the last lecture we use state to finally be able to change our state and therefore our name from

00:10.180 --> 00:11.470
within the component.

00:11.710 --> 00:14.860
But there's one thing which can be really confusing.

00:14.890 --> 00:21.610
We learned that we need to call re-act dorm room render again to update the dorm but we still only call

00:21.610 --> 00:24.070
it one time here at the very bottom.

00:24.130 --> 00:26.160
So why does this still work.

00:26.160 --> 00:34.060
That if I click that button it changes even though react arm doesn't get called Well it changes because

00:34.270 --> 00:40.730
we call sets state here and what state said state does behind the scenes as it forms react.

00:40.750 --> 00:46.630
That's something about this component changed and therefore it re-act will basically call render the

00:46.630 --> 00:49.390
dom so react on render again.

00:49.390 --> 00:50.710
So we don't need to do that.

00:50.770 --> 00:56.890
We can conveniently just work with our data change the state and so on and re-act will recognize that

00:56.890 --> 00:58.250
we changed a state.

00:58.300 --> 01:04.050
The state is something which may get changed and therefore which may impact the way our dorm looks like.

01:04.120 --> 01:10.450
So re-act will reconstruct or dom and render it again and reactionless will do this in a very efficient

01:10.450 --> 01:11.040
way.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.430
It only changes what needs to be changed.

01:13.480 --> 01:18.220
So it doesn't really render everything it just compares to old Dom to the new one.

01:18.220 --> 01:23.860
And it actually diasters word shaly with a word child on just like view chased us to make this very

01:23.860 --> 01:24.460
efficient.

01:24.490 --> 01:29.920
So it doesn't need to parse the actual Dom but simply just parts just a virtual copy of the old Dom

01:30.100 --> 01:35.960
and the virtual version of the well nuda arm and then only changes in the real Dom what changed.

01:35.960 --> 01:43.300
The two word build arms that is how reactivates works how we use components and how we use that state

01:43.570 --> 01:45.880
to be able to change components.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.160
That certainly is different to beauty.

01:48.160 --> 01:55.690
Yes it's just reactivates logic and it's best to just keep thinking in this reactor's logic if you want

01:55.690 --> 02:00.720
to use re-act chase with that core thing out of the way.

02:00.730 --> 02:06.240
Let's go back one step and let's learn more about how we can actually style everything here.

02:06.250 --> 02:10.080
Change styles dynamically and also how we may use conditionals.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.670
So if blocks to only render content at some times and how we may output lists.
