00:02.830 --> 00:08.200
Well I come to this section which is about the future as the first framework I want to take a closer

00:08.200 --> 00:09.250
look at.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.940
We actually already used it.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.230
And the Getting Started section.

00:13.240 --> 00:19.000
Now I want to dive a little bit deeper into it and explain more thoroughly what we actually did and

00:19.000 --> 00:25.510
the Getting Started section in which our features view chairs Holts now important viewed as has a great

00:25.510 --> 00:27.550
documentation if you click on get started.

00:27.550 --> 00:32.500
So that is a good place to then dive deeper because of course I will only touch on the basics here.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.620
This is no complete view chess course and that is just something I want to add here too.

00:38.740 --> 00:43.950
I do have a complete course on view chess here on you to me in case you are interested.

00:44.050 --> 00:47.820
But that aside let's go to the installation again.

00:48.190 --> 00:50.800
And let's grab this CD and link again.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.090
Just as we did in the Getting Started section.

00:53.470 --> 01:00.810
I will continue using K as failure but we will leave that for the section to all to work locally.

01:00.850 --> 01:07.090
Especially when we don't dive into single page applications but for a start does it just nice to quickly

01:07.090 --> 01:07.960
get started.

01:08.050 --> 01:14.440
Of course feel free to create your local HMO file and your script file import the script file into the

01:14.440 --> 01:15.530
index file into it.

01:15.610 --> 01:19.530
Well fight excuse me and you can replicate the same locally.

01:19.900 --> 01:27.970
So here I prepared a James fiddle and as before let's just enter a script import here and import view

01:27.970 --> 01:29.640
chairs so that we can use it.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.440
That's everything we need to get started.
