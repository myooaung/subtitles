WEBVTT

00:02.490 --> 00:07.170
In the last lecture we created our first project with the N-G new command.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.720
Now I opened it in web store.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.640
The idea was in this course again you may use Microsoft wishlists studio code as a free alternative

00:14.940 --> 00:18.150
or editrix like Sublime Text or Adam.

00:18.240 --> 00:24.860
Now that CD project folder which was carried by the Seelye And as you can see it's far from being empty.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.710
No worries though it's easy to work with it.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.890
Let's go through the folders and files which were created.

00:30.990 --> 00:34.100
The folder is used for end to end testing.

00:34.130 --> 00:36.880
No one covered us here so we may just ignore it.

00:36.900 --> 00:44.310
No module's as in react in future module simply stores all our dependencies so all the package has views

00:44.670 --> 00:50.010
that STA angle of FREYBERG itself but also a couple of development dependencies and other dependencies

00:50.070 --> 00:55.300
off the angle of framework the source folder is where we will actually work in and.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.900
Well there are a lot of files.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.400
But I will come back and explain what these do.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.030
No worries.

01:00.090 --> 01:02.610
We need to work with just some of them.

01:02.820 --> 01:07.980
Now the falls down here something configure our project and typically you don't need to change anything

01:07.980 --> 01:08.470
there.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.200
You can change something about the anger or Sealab project how your editor behaves.

01:13.260 --> 01:18.210
And interesting of course the package touch base in which lists all our dependencies and development

01:18.210 --> 01:23.760
dependencies as you can see quite a lot but that is related to this workflow we need for Angle or where

01:23.760 --> 01:28.820
we need to compile typescript which is why you find that here and some other things.

01:29.220 --> 01:32.300
So let's close data lets focus on the source folder.

01:32.400 --> 01:38.550
As I said this is where we will write our code specifically we mostly work in the app folder there and

01:38.550 --> 01:43.610
here we can see this app component which is one of the key features or things of an angle or app.

01:43.610 --> 01:47.430
I will come back to it to quickly walk you from the folders and files.

01:47.580 --> 01:53.550
Assets is a folder where you could store images or any of the assets you want to use in your anger project

01:54.150 --> 01:57.600
environments is a folder where you can define some environment variables.

01:57.630 --> 02:01.310
If you don't know what that is probably don't need it to put it like this.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.610
The other files here are also some configuration.

02:04.710 --> 02:07.080
The index HDMI of course is important.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.740
It is a single page which gets surfed with that.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.360
Angular is really great at creating single page applications.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.620
Actually that's the only thing it can do.

02:16.620 --> 02:22.560
So this is our single page and we don't really need to work in that index HVM outfall we create our

02:22.560 --> 02:24.320
app in our files.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.970
Here's one important thing though.

02:26.040 --> 02:32.340
This app root tag which is not a normal HVM I'll take two which I'll come back to the main Katia's file

02:32.340 --> 02:35.460
is important because it holds the code which gets started first.

02:35.550 --> 02:37.260
And that's just something you need to know.

02:37.260 --> 02:42.960
This is to code which gets first executed when your code in the end is bundled and compiled and shipped

02:42.960 --> 02:44.270
to the browser.

02:44.280 --> 02:50.160
And what this code basically does is it starts our angular app again and we'll come back to this starting

02:50.160 --> 02:54.600
process and how an angler or app actually works in the next lecture.

02:54.850 --> 03:01.380
Phil simply add some Poley folds up or allows you to comment in some Holyfield's you might need to make

03:01.380 --> 03:08.020
it work across all browsers but by default it should work fine and well Stout's don't see CSSA important

03:08.020 --> 03:11.360
file which allows you to Clovelly define some styles for your app.

03:11.370 --> 03:15.450
So if you want to set up some styles which are applied to your whole app that would be the place to

03:15.450 --> 03:16.310
do it.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.890
Enough about these Fahd's let's focus on this app folder and I understand what the app component is

03:23.250 --> 03:29.430
what the module is and how it all works together and how the angle or app actually gets started.
