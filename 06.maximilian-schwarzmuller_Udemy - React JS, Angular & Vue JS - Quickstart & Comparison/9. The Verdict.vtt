Over the last lectures we compared these frameworks and I prepared a couple of topics we had to look

00:08.600 --> 00:11.570
at to see what the frameworks are good at.

00:11.570 --> 00:17.990
Now if we have a look at this final slide it looks super simple view chances the winner followed by

00:17.990 --> 00:20.480
react is that the case.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.400
It's not that simple.

00:22.400 --> 00:28.480
First of all we have to keep in mind that you have to weigh the topics I presented there.

00:28.610 --> 00:35.480
The hard learning curve of Angler might not matter to you hard doesn't mean impossible.

00:35.660 --> 00:41.000
It might be worth taking the effort because what you get really is an awesome framework.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.090
Personally I like angular a lot.

00:44.090 --> 00:50.570
Additionally the fact that it isn't suited for a multi-page application that might also not matter too

00:50.570 --> 00:51.240
much.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.090
Maybe you didn't plan to use it there.

00:53.090 --> 00:59.420
Maybe you plan to create a modern single page application and medium size to big application even and

00:59.420 --> 01:03.880
then angler's perfectly fine word that even is the winner here.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.200
So that is how you should read it.

01:06.230 --> 01:13.040
Don't just have a look at the slide and say OK two minors and well only two green pluss.

01:13.180 --> 01:14.300
That's a loser.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.020
That's not how it works.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.500
On the other hand you might say future ass is definitely my choice because it's easy to learn and it

01:21.590 --> 01:27.590
exactly fits the job I need it for and I don't care about the fact that there aren't that many jobs

01:27.830 --> 01:33.710
because I only needed for my personal project or I already have some clients I can surf because I'm

01:33.710 --> 01:34.780
a freelancer.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.890
That might be valid results or that might be valid conclusions too.

01:40.160 --> 01:48.410
So take the slide and take the last lectures as a starting point of your own analysis and also make

01:48.410 --> 01:54.470
sure to go through the modules where I give you a brief introduction into each of the three frameworks.

01:54.470 --> 02:00.590
If you enjoy working with them well that's worth more than any slide I can present to you because of

02:00.590 --> 02:00.790
you.

02:00.790 --> 02:05.390
For example I started working with angler and decided I really love typescript.

02:05.390 --> 02:10.910
I love this project set up then the learning curve argument here probably doesn't matter for you or

02:10.910 --> 02:16.460
probably is even wrong for you because you have an easier time learning it than other people might have.

02:16.590 --> 02:19.310
And the same of course is true for view and react.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.590
Play around with them.

02:20.630 --> 02:21.780
Try them out.

02:21.890 --> 02:27.950
Then decide which one you want to dive into deeper and also keep in mind you can always learn more than

02:27.950 --> 02:28.980
one framework.
