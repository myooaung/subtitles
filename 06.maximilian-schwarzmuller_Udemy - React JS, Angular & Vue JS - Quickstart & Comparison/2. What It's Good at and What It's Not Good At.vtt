Before we dive into saying look there is one key difference I have to mention compared to the two frameworks

00:08.840 --> 00:16.670
we covered before there we always started in as Fedele kind of showing how you can drop it into any

00:16.670 --> 00:18.590
existing HVM Ellen Page.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.380
You could do that though for the future.

00:20.390 --> 00:20.620
Yes.

00:20.620 --> 00:26.660
And we actually just simply grab two imports from a CD and in our case throw them into a page and start

00:26.660 --> 00:32.750
using the framework on that page and therefore that could be one of many pages in your application.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.050
Now angular is a bit different.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.120
Engler is a framework which allows you to create single page applications and it is really great at

00:41.180 --> 00:41.950
this.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.410
However you when we have a look at multi page faults take applications and you one of frill angler into

00:48.410 --> 00:50.120
one of your single pages.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.690
It's not so great at that.

00:51.770 --> 00:54.410
And actually that's just not one of the main floor.

00:54.560 --> 01:01.730
So if that is the use case you're looking for you have an existing application using node or BHP or

01:01.790 --> 01:06.840
any server side language and you render a couple of views to the user.

01:07.190 --> 01:13.550
Angular is probably not your right choice because with that you really only create single page applications.

01:13.850 --> 01:21.370
Part of that is that with an user or to create an angular app you need quite a complex set up since

01:21.470 --> 01:28.120
angler a typescript a superset to javascript and therefore it's not that easy it's not just one import

01:28.130 --> 01:30.860
you add and then you can start using angular.

01:30.860 --> 01:34.690
So that is the reason why it might not be your number one choice.

01:34.730 --> 01:40.250
If you look for the average use case having multiple pages but for single page applications it's an

01:40.310 --> 01:41.430
awesome framework.

01:41.570 --> 01:43.020
So let's dive into it.
