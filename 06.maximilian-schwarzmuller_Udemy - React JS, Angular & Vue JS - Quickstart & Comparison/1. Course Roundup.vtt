Great to see you made it for the course now that you made it to this video you get a first introduction

00:07.050 --> 00:12.480
to the three most important and most popular javascript frameworks you can learn as of today.

00:12.550 --> 00:19.070
A regular react and do you know maybe you already got a favorite if it's angular or view.

00:19.090 --> 00:24.060
I'd be very happy to welcome you in my complete guide courses here on you to me which I have for both

00:24.060 --> 00:29.880
these frameworks where I dive much deeper and will teach you everything about these two frameworks.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.360
But even if it's react that's totally fine.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.800
The goal of this course was to an able you.

00:35.820 --> 00:38.790
She was a framework or she has multiple frameworks.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.160
As mentioned earlier you can learn more than one.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.520
You can always specify and want but also know a second one.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.920
Nothing wrong with that.

00:45.930 --> 00:48.600
It might even improve you as a developer.

00:48.600 --> 00:55.800
The goal of this course was to kind of take away some of the issues or the complexity you face when

00:55.800 --> 01:01.410
starting as a front end developer you have all these tools and you have all these frameworks and libraries

01:01.440 --> 01:06.530
and you don't know where to get started now I hope that now that you went through this course you'd

01:06.530 --> 01:08.080
know where to get started.

01:08.130 --> 01:13.660
You know why we use libraries and you know why we use frameworks and why we use tools like web pick

01:14.130 --> 01:21.050
why we might use language is like iOS and typescript to make our life as a developer easier during development.

01:21.300 --> 01:27.690
And I hope that you get an impression on which framework might best suit your needs but also during

01:27.690 --> 01:33.570
the introduction sections which framework he liked the most and then definitely go with that framework

01:33.840 --> 01:35.310
and dive deeper into it.

01:35.430 --> 01:37.950
I'd be very happy to welcome you and Ambra courses.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.190
But whatever your choice is all the best to you by.
