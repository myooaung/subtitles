00:02.530 --> 00:07.340
In the last lecture we add we're here to make our code leaner and easier.

00:07.510 --> 00:09.500
And death is nice.

00:09.580 --> 00:17.260
But Jake worry is only one available library a library which focuses on accessing the dorm working with

00:17.260 --> 00:18.720
the dorm.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.930
Now we can also use low dash.

00:20.980 --> 00:25.390
So just search for Lotus to go to Lotus dot com and Lowder's.

00:25.390 --> 00:29.420
It's a javascript library which offers a lot of utility functions.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.550
You can learn more about all these utility functions if you visit the documentation.

00:33.820 --> 00:38.200
It gives you a lot of functions to work with arrays collections of strings and all these things for

00:38.200 --> 00:45.180
example and you can simply download it here for a local development or since I want to use a CD any

00:45.180 --> 00:50.110
or to go to Cdn and then choose for example the core package.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.170
Coord up Mendota.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.120
J.S..

00:52.120 --> 00:53.370
Copy that.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.090
Go to your HMO code.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.160
Also at this import the order doesn't matter here but it would matter if you want to override some functions

01:02.170 --> 01:03.560
Cheikh where you offers which.

01:03.670 --> 01:09.060
Well typically Leibert shouldn't override each other functions but yet the order to you know theoretically

01:09.240 --> 01:10.840
does matter.

01:10.840 --> 01:17.800
Now with Lowder's at it we can actually have a look at the documentation and Heera this one specific

01:17.800 --> 01:19.650
utility function I'm interested in

01:23.170 --> 01:32.170
and that last year under utile unique ID it creates a unique ideas to name SAS.

01:32.180 --> 01:37.930
So now we can use that to create this truly unique idea here.

01:38.030 --> 01:40.460
You use Lotus by using a underscore.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.070
That's where the name comes from Zobel.

01:42.140 --> 01:48.560
This might look strange to us actually is a valid javascript function names are just like dollar sign

01:48.560 --> 01:51.560
was for Shakeri low dash does underscore.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.400
Now is accessing the low Dasch object so to say.

01:55.550 --> 01:56.880
And there we can.

01:56.930 --> 02:05.420
As you see your execute unique ID so unique ID and we could give it our own prefix we don't have to

02:05.420 --> 02:06.110
though.

02:06.500 --> 02:17.490
If we now had control enter and open up the console let's add by milk again and let's add on surre questions

02:17.490 --> 02:18.830
a final time.

02:19.080 --> 02:26.250
If we have a look at these objects we see we do have unique IDs here incrementing numbers and therefore

02:26.400 --> 02:29.280
I can of course still remove these items.

02:29.280 --> 02:36.120
This still works ask before but now using a natural library loader to get this utility function and

02:36.120 --> 02:42.350
then hopefully shows you how we could improve this application by not just using vanilla javascript

02:42.450 --> 02:48.480
or in the end we are of course using vanilla javascript but also adding some third party libraries to

02:48.690 --> 02:53.910
improve our life here and to make our code a cleaner and therefore easier to manage.
