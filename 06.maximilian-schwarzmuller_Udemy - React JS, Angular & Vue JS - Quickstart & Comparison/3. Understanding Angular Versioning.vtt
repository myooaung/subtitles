One important note about this module in this module I will cover angular and angular.

00:09.620 --> 00:13.530
It's not angular one which is now referred to as angular.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.380
Yes but it is angular to four.

00:16.390 --> 00:22.110
And whatever the latest version is because from angler to you on the dangler team switch to just name

00:22.110 --> 00:24.480
it angular instead of angular too.

00:24.610 --> 00:27.380
It will have new versions every six months.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.500
So Angler or became Englad for it in March.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.790
Now it will become angler Fyffe in October and so on.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.390
Now we won't have many breaking changes with each update.

00:37.520 --> 00:43.610
So that is why if you watched this even if Angle 5 is out you still learn English here you still learn

00:43.610 --> 00:44.330
the basics.

00:44.330 --> 00:47.480
It won't change fundamentally with that.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.660
Let's dive into it.
