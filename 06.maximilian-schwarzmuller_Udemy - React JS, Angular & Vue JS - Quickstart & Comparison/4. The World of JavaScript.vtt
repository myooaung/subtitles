00:02.510 --> 00:04.770
We learned what the role of javascript is.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.740
Now let's have a look at the world of javascript.

00:07.740 --> 00:14.640
We have vanilla javascript in the center of this world and with vanilla javascript I mean javascript

00:14.640 --> 00:20.580
without any libraries without any frameworks or any other tools we might know and we will learn about

00:20.580 --> 00:21.490
later.

00:21.840 --> 00:29.250
I'm referring to as 5 javascript javascript does have different words and as 5 simply as the word is

00:29.280 --> 00:34.430
supported by most browsers there is a more recent word in a way little ESX.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.320
I'll come back to this later too.

00:36.350 --> 00:38.850
He has six is not supported by all browsers.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.360
So you typically don't write iOS 6 code and run it like this in browsers nowadays.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.760
But again more on this later.

00:45.810 --> 00:51.740
Let's build a basic app with vanilla Chava script to find out what the restrictions might be and why

00:51.830 --> 00:55.200
this might not be everything we need to build this app.

00:55.200 --> 01:03.630
I'm on Chia's fiddle dot net and JS Fertel dot net simply is just editor in the web so to say which

01:03.630 --> 01:09.070
you don't typically use to build real applications but which is a nice playground where we can write

01:09.100 --> 01:16.170
HVM all javascript and CSSA code and therefore we can simulate the case that we have a server which

01:16.170 --> 01:21.560
sent us back a page single page here and let's write some age HTML code.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.580
The question is which do we want to build.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.320
And I'll start basic creating a simple app.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.820
I want to create a very basic to do app.

01:29.130 --> 01:34.830
So let's start creating this app in the next lecture and then we will gradually enhance it.
