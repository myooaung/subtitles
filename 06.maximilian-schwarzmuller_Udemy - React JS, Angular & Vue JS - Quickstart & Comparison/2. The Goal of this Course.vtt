You might be an advanced javascript user and even know what frameworks are and which role they play.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.270
Or you might even know a specific framework like a singular.

00:33.270 --> 00:35.720
So be really an advanced developer.

00:35.910 --> 00:42.570
But still that whole world of javascript and all these packages and tools we have there might be confusing

00:42.570 --> 00:43.280
to you.

00:43.560 --> 00:50.640
