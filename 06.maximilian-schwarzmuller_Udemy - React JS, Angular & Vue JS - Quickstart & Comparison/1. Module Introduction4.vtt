00:02.630 --> 00:09.020
Welcome to this module in the last module we had an introduction to view chess and the end of this module.

00:09.070 --> 00:18.400
You use Debussy or I to create our local development environment you could say project with web peg

00:18.430 --> 00:21.650
as a build tool to allow us to split our code.

00:21.670 --> 00:27.940
Overall multiple files to use some nice extra features like these dot view files which were parsed by

00:27.940 --> 00:29.260
web page then.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.810
And to have this development's server.

00:32.290 --> 00:34.090
Now why did we use it.

00:34.090 --> 00:41.530
Why didn't we just import de-valued and JS framework package into our of H.T. mail file and write code

00:41.560 --> 00:43.440
as we did on a fiddle.

00:43.450 --> 00:47.620
Why do we need workflows like shown in the last module.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.500
What does a web page do for us and how does iOS 6 fit into this picture.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.050
Let's take a closer look at all these questions.

00:55.150 --> 00:56.200
In this module.
