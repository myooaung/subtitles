WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:07.630
Now before we dive into the first framework we will work with in the US courts view chairs.

00:07.830 --> 00:12.880
Let's understand which prerequisites these frameworks have from a challenge perspective.

00:13.170 --> 00:13.560
We have.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.180
Do you react in anger.

00:15.510 --> 00:21.830
And as we already learned we got multiple warnings of jealousy that we could use.

00:21.930 --> 00:28.740
We have ears five ears six and typescript and we have all the other things like coffee script which

00:29.010 --> 00:31.800
is a superset but not very popular these days.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.590
So I'll stick to these free E-6 sometimes need a local workflow.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.630
So we need some tool like baby that combined with the web peg to Trents pilots ears 5.

00:42.660 --> 00:47.930
Because again it won't run an all or in typescript case in any browsers.

00:48.060 --> 00:52.730
So which framework supports which language or needs which language.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.540
Let's start with the view.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.630
It works absolutely fine with iOS 5.

00:57.690 --> 01:03.660
So you can write all the code in a language which will work like this in the browser so you don't need

01:03.660 --> 01:07.050
to transpire compile or do anything with that.

01:07.110 --> 01:12.330
You might still set up a workflow to optimize your code bundling it if you want to split it or multiple

01:12.330 --> 01:18.380
files or optimize identify it but you won't need to train a pilot UJA us all.

01:18.390 --> 01:20.170
It works great with ESX.

01:20.210 --> 01:25.920
It supports both languages and if you want to use some new iOS 6 features definitely feel free to do

01:25.920 --> 01:26.320
so.

01:26.370 --> 01:32.250
You will need to add local workflow then of course it also works with typescript but that is more difficult

01:32.250 --> 01:33.120
to set up.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.750
There is no official support but some packages you can add.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.760
Not super trivial but theoretically doable if you already know types Kimpton you are a big fan.

01:41.790 --> 01:46.320
You can search for articles explaining that and it is doable.

01:46.330 --> 01:50.090
How about react react will work with ease.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.990
5 but that is not really the way you create re-act applications.

01:55.030 --> 02:01.500
It is not supported or documented that well and it is not how you write re-act apps these days.

02:01.630 --> 02:04.630
You can start with that if you absolutely have to.

02:04.630 --> 02:10.930
You can stick to it but it is strongly recommended to use iOS 6 instead and therefore you will of course

02:10.930 --> 02:14.980
need a workflow which transpires it so that it runs on all browsers.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.100
Typescript on your end.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.700
Yes you can set it up just like with Chaz.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.530
There is no official support.

02:20.530 --> 02:21.630
It is a bit harder.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.160
You can dig into it though if you want to.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.320
Angular.

02:25.420 --> 02:28.740
Now here we can use as 5.

02:28.810 --> 02:35.650
Theoretically there is a way but no that's no fun at all and the same for ESX it won't work fine with

02:35.650 --> 02:37.450
any of the two languages.

02:37.450 --> 02:44.140
Instead you typically write your angler applications with typescript and you will see that for angular

02:44.230 --> 02:50.290
setting up a typescript workflow or a or a workflow using typescript is actually pretty easy in the

02:50.290 --> 02:52.710
end since it offers a tool for that.

02:52.990 --> 02:56.780
So that is what you will work with in this course too with typescript.

02:56.830 --> 02:58.140
Once we reach angular.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.140
No worries.

02:59.140 --> 03:03.850
You don't need to know ESX or typescript to follow fruiterer's course.

03:03.850 --> 03:09.940
The things we use here will be pretty easy to pick up and to understand if you do plan to dive deeper

03:09.940 --> 03:11.140
into one of these frameworks.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.650
Though it might be worth a thought to pick up more knowledge on that.

03:15.730 --> 03:20.940
However the courses which teach these frameworks might also add or provide a basic intro.

03:20.940 --> 03:26.110
For example my complete guide on angler has a section explaining the basics of typescript.

03:26.470 --> 03:28.450
So dead already prerequisites.

03:28.450 --> 03:32.880
This is frameworks have or the language they use again for this course.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.370
Basic javascript knowledge is all you need.
