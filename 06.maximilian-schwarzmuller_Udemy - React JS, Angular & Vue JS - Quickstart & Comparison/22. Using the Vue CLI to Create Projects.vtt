00:02.520 --> 00:07.740
As mentioned at the end of last lecture I now want to install these Seelye and we see the instruction

00:07.740 --> 00:10.050
here on the official Get up page.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.860
We have to run and install minus.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.250
She views Seelye.

00:13.260 --> 00:20.850
So let's do this and PM install dash she views Seelye now on Mac and Linux you may need to put a pseudo

00:20.850 --> 00:22.700
in front of this for it to work.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.820
And I'm then prompted for my password after I did enter it.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.260
And that might not be the required for you.

00:29.290 --> 00:34.500
It will install DC like globally on our machine so that we can use it everywhere on our machine which

00:34.500 --> 00:39.330
is great because we will only use to see eye to set up new future projects.

00:39.330 --> 00:44.790
So it's not directly related to the future as it isn't involved in it compiling or in the bundling of

00:44.790 --> 00:46.020
our view chase code.

00:46.020 --> 00:49.580
It's only used to create these projects based on templates.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.940
So let's finish this installation.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.090
I'll be back once I'm done here on my machine.

00:55.020 --> 01:00.970
The installation of the slide just finished for me the next step is to navigate into a folder where

01:00.970 --> 01:04.270
you want to create your new future project.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.410
I already am in such a folder.

01:06.430 --> 01:11.740
So now we can run view in it and you can find the command on the official Get up page if you want to

01:11.740 --> 01:12.660
look it up.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.900
Then the template name and then the name of your project.

01:15.910 --> 01:21.550
So as I said I'll use the web peg simple template that is this one here.

01:22.210 --> 01:26.740
And then you may choose any project name and that will also become the name of the folder where this

01:26.740 --> 01:28.310
project is placed in.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.280
So in this folder it currently at.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.680
There will be a new folder which is created and that is which will hold the actual project.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.450
So I will name it.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.920
View framework intro.

01:38.050 --> 01:40.490
But of course you're free to choose any other name.

01:40.750 --> 01:46.030
And this will now install this template and ask you a couple of questions you can't answer them with

01:46.120 --> 01:48.850
yes or just hit enter all the time if you want.

01:48.850 --> 01:55.630
You can decide on whether you want to use SAS which is simply SEUS as preprocessor if you don't know

01:55.630 --> 01:57.320
what it is you probably want to enter.

01:57.370 --> 02:02.530
And here to use normal C S S and with that d project was created.

02:02.530 --> 02:05.240
Now you need to use C.D into that folder.

02:05.470 --> 02:10.900
And Iran NPM installed to install all the dependencies which dependencies you might ask.

02:10.930 --> 02:16.880
Well the U.K.'s for example but also a couple of builds tools which are used in this workflow.

02:17.050 --> 02:22.510
So you see we're leaving the world of now just importing one single line view chase and then writing

02:22.510 --> 02:23.060
or code.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.160
But no worries.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.990
Most of the dependencies we install here are actually only required by web peg and so on.

02:29.080 --> 02:35.110
To finally allow us to write our code over multiple files in a very modular way and then bundle all

02:35.110 --> 02:41.560
these files together in the end so that we ship only one script file to our single page which will host

02:41.560 --> 02:46.030
and run our full front end code or complete single page application.

02:46.030 --> 02:50.330
But more on that in the upcoming module on WePay and so on.

02:50.350 --> 02:58.110
So they installation finished and now you can run NPM run def a built in script to run your project

02:58.660 --> 03:02.260
and this will open up the app on localhost 88 you like that.

03:02.260 --> 03:08.380
That's just a demo app shipping with the template but this will be the app we're going to work on starting

03:08.380 --> 03:09.340
in the next lecture.
