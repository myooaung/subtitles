00:02.360 --> 00:07.820
And The Last Lecture we had a look at this dot view fall and I told you that it's a great way of creating

00:07.820 --> 00:10.220
components in future US and it is.

00:10.510 --> 00:16.700
And indeed this apt art view file in the end only creates a component even though it might not look

00:16.700 --> 00:17.850
like this.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.170
We export a different object.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.170
The name is not really required here that's optional.

00:23.210 --> 00:24.820
Then we have our data method.

00:24.860 --> 00:30.920
And by the fact that it's a method you can already see or tell dead we don't have a normal view instance

00:30.920 --> 00:31.690
here.

00:32.150 --> 00:35.270
And then this template here basically is just a template.

00:35.270 --> 00:40.450
What we before had to specify here as template as a string.

00:40.460 --> 00:45.500
Now with that string we had some restrictions which don't apply anymore because as I mentioned in the

00:45.500 --> 00:52.070
last lecture this gets parsed during development and therefore transform to javascript during development.

00:52.430 --> 00:54.420
That is the great thing here.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.500
So we have our component here in the end.

00:57.890 --> 01:05.810
And when we import this year the render function simply does one thing it replaces everything we control

01:05.810 --> 01:06.240
here.

01:06.260 --> 01:13.190
So everything in this day with the idea app with the contents or with the template and the code of our

01:13.190 --> 01:14.860
apt odd view file.

01:15.350 --> 01:22.670
And that is why if we have a look at the running application and we open the elements tab here that

01:22.670 --> 01:30.220
is why we see in this day with the idea up all the content of our DOT view file is what Amanda rendered

01:30.410 --> 01:33.100
in display is controlled by.

01:34.100 --> 01:38.940
And in the head section as a side note you can see the stylus getting in check that as I mentioned.

01:39.330 --> 01:44.140
So that is what we do with Dot you Fahd's we create such components.

01:44.270 --> 01:50.330
One important note here about the data method you might not recognize the syntax you might have expected

01:50.330 --> 01:53.130
to see something like this function.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.270
Now you could write this code and it would run perfectly fine.

01:56.390 --> 02:00.860
But as I told you to set up we're using here allows us to use e as 6.

02:01.070 --> 02:05.480
And actually this is as sake's Sendak's for a function in an object.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.730
You can write it like a method like so just the name of the method the name of the property and then

02:10.730 --> 02:13.610
parentheses without the colon function thing.

02:13.640 --> 02:19.430
That's one of the nice features this workflow gives us we are able to use next generation features today

02:19.640 --> 02:24.370
but at the end everything will be transported to either five so that it runs in the browser.
