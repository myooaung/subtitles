Bag and Shea's fiddle here we improve the app by adding Cicconetti and low dash.

00:08.680 --> 00:13.450
And I think you can already see why adding libraries to your app might be a nice thing instead of just

00:13.450 --> 00:16.560
sticking to vanilla javascript and writing everything on your own.

00:16.960 --> 00:23.080
However this course mainly is about the different frameworks javascript offer us and we haven't had

00:23.080 --> 00:24.530
a look at these yet.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.690
We only used libraries and libraries are frameworks all come back.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.720
The difference in a second.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.830
We can still improve our app.

00:32.860 --> 00:39.910
Because whilst it is leaner and we do use less code here we still have to write quite a bit of code

00:40.150 --> 00:46.670
to simply add and remove some elements to and from the DOM and to managed to stay to store these ID

00:46.670 --> 00:53.080
in the dorm and this is absolutely fine for smaller apps or if you only want to enhance tiny things

00:53.080 --> 00:55.340
about existing HVM all pages.

00:55.630 --> 01:03.010
But for bigger applications you might still hit that border where this becomes too cumbersome and we're

01:03.010 --> 01:06.310
managing the state becomes very difficult.

01:06.310 --> 01:10.790
That is one of the major things frameworks solved for you.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.810
So let's have a closer look at this.

01:12.820 --> 01:19.240
We had a look at libraries and at last you we recognize that we can still improve our app that is the

01:19.240 --> 01:22.180
thing framework's try to do for you.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.850
We typically have angular react in view.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.310
Of course there are over javascript frameworks too but these free are probably the most popular ones

01:30.550 --> 01:32.870
and the best ones the most modern ones.

01:32.920 --> 01:39.800
Right now what's the difference between a framework like angular and a library like low Dasch or Cheikh

01:39.800 --> 01:48.460
where the libraries typically fix certain problems Jake where he is a lot about working with the DOM

01:48.970 --> 01:55.000
low Desch gives you a lot of utility functions for working with arrays or treating the unique ID but

01:55.000 --> 02:01.870
still the overall how you create your application is something you have to decide.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.510
Fromberg does more than just giving you some utility functions or focusing on one area.

02:07.540 --> 02:13.630
A framework typically gives you a structure on how you should write your app and takes care about a

02:13.630 --> 02:19.600
lot of the low level nitty gritty details which you would have to do otherwise.

02:19.660 --> 02:26.400
For example adding or removing items to and from the dorm that is a task typically done by the framework

02:26.470 --> 02:34.870
automatically so that you have still vanilla javascript as a codebase but a certain structure on how

02:34.870 --> 02:40.720
to write your code to easily get features like adding or removing elements so that you can focus on

02:40.720 --> 02:42.710
your business logic even more.

02:43.090 --> 02:48.430
Let's see it in action and you will quickly understand which benefits frameworks offer you.
