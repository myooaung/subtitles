00:02.640 --> 00:08.180
And The Last Lecture we learn how we can fire an event and then it doesn't really work the way we wanted

00:08.180 --> 00:09.230
to work.

00:09.230 --> 00:16.760
Instead we should embrace react J.S. components to compose our application because components allow

00:16.760 --> 00:23.480
us to write our app in a very lean and well maintainable way.

00:23.600 --> 00:30.830
And then we will also learn how with components we can fix this issue of having to call re-act Don render

00:30.950 --> 00:33.580
multiple times on our own.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.380
So let's refactor this code to create a component and there actually are two ways of creating components.

00:40.550 --> 00:47.040
Just writing a function which then makes up a component or using the ESX class statement.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.110
We will see both.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.470
I will start with the function though.

00:50.660 --> 00:54.530
Now we already have a function here but that really doesn't help us here.

00:54.680 --> 01:00.920
So I will create a new function at the top and I will name this function app.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.680
You don't have to name it but it is a good convention.

01:03.680 --> 01:10.880
You name your root component where you will nest all over components you may eventually have an app

01:11.300 --> 01:13.230
and it definitely is a good command.

01:13.250 --> 01:18.280
You should follow to have a capital start in character DA here.

01:18.350 --> 01:25.820
So that's my app function and this function needs to be one thing it needs to return the genius X we

01:25.820 --> 01:27.520
want to render to the DOM.

01:27.650 --> 01:32.600
So we need to return basically what we set up here in the element.

01:32.930 --> 01:38.960
This code here just structured it a bit differently to make it look nicer.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.930
So that is what we need to return in there.

01:41.960 --> 01:48.620
Does GSX code with that I can remove the change name function.

01:48.620 --> 01:55.430
For now it won't work anyway so I'll remove to click Lisner here too and I will keep the name for now.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.500
Put it in front of the function here.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.700
Remove that element down there and keep react on the render.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.680
However here I don't want to re-enter the element.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.270
I don't have that anymore.

02:07.460 --> 02:15.830
Instead And now that's nice syntax I will use my app like a HVM element a self-closing element and this

02:15.830 --> 02:19.510
is a feature provided by react by Julius X..

02:19.730 --> 02:23.250
This is how we can use our function as a component.

02:23.330 --> 02:30.260
Again the thing we want to use as a component like this needs to return some j as X code or some code

02:30.260 --> 02:34.210
which can be used to well create our dorm in the end.

02:34.250 --> 02:39.660
If I had control ENTRAR Now you Zied updates and it looks like before the button would work.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.130
But now we're using our first basic component.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.910
Now let's learn more about this component before we make this spot of work again.
