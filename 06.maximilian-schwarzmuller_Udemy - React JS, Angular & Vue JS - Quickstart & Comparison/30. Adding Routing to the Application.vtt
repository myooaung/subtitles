00:02.640 --> 00:08.770
So let's turn our application here into a simple single page application using the view router to allow

00:08.770 --> 00:12.580
the user to actually visit more than just local host.

00:12.580 --> 00:18.030
ADHD but maybe all the wizard slash blog or slash account.

00:18.490 --> 00:24.940
So to do that we need to install a new package and I will do this in a new tab of my command line of

00:24.940 --> 00:25.840
my terminal.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.420
This is just an integrated terminal in my idea.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.780
It's the normal Mac terminal.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.480
And then I will use NPM And that's important.

00:33.480 --> 00:37.260
Make sure you are navigated into this project folder though.

00:37.270 --> 00:45.030
So then you can run an install to install a new dependency add a dash dash save to save it in the package

00:45.030 --> 00:51.290
or Chase as a production dependency and then the package we need to step view dash router package does

00:51.490 --> 00:59.050
as an official package by the View team which allows us to add a routing functionality to our view application.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.320
So it already was installed.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.230
Now we can set it up and we do it as the main door.

01:04.270 --> 01:13.900
JS file first of all I will import the view router from the view router package we just installed and

01:13.900 --> 01:17.020
now that we imported it we have to use it.

01:17.020 --> 01:21.990
So we have to tell you chaps hey we want to use this plug in which it is the end.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.720
We do it by using our view object which you can import from your.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.660
And then running use.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.260
And here we simply use the router which we imported here.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.840
So with that we enabled the router.

01:34.930 --> 01:39.750
Now we can start using it and as a first step I will set up a couple of routes.

01:39.910 --> 01:47.220
We do this by creating a new variable and constant just the ESX feature you could use Lahr.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.360
The special thing about constants that you clearly state that this will never change and I don't plan

01:52.360 --> 01:54.670
on changing the routes during runtime.

01:54.670 --> 02:01.180
So Consta routes is an array now and each route is a javascript object.

02:01.180 --> 02:03.670
This object has to follow a certain pattern.

02:03.790 --> 02:08.860
It needs to define the path to begin with the Potthast part after your domain.

02:08.920 --> 02:15.010
So for example slash block to stick with the example I mentioned before then you need to specify which

02:15.010 --> 02:18.140
component you want to load of the user with it's just path.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.080
And here I don't have a fitting component yet.

02:21.250 --> 02:24.550
So let's create a new component in the components folder.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.510
I'll name it.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.520
Block that view.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.950
And here I will add a template

02:33.010 --> 02:39.260
where I'll say a blog and then simply this is the blog.

02:39.330 --> 02:46.190
And now we can specify this year if we first import it by importing block

02:48.740 --> 02:54.990
from components block and view file and then specifying blog as a component.

02:55.050 --> 03:00.180
So just like we registered a global component by passing the object here we now register this component

03:00.180 --> 03:03.000
S-D to be a loaded component for this path.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.570
Is route.

03:04.980 --> 03:12.390
Now I will duplicate this so that I also have an account and this account component also needs to be

03:12.390 --> 03:13.380
created.

03:13.560 --> 03:18.400
So I'll create my account you file where I'd say template.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.770
And now that's something I also have to do here.

03:20.790 --> 03:23.830
We have to have one wrapping element as a set.

03:23.850 --> 03:30.830
So let's put the two block elements into a div at the same here and account here will save their account

03:34.440 --> 03:40.000
and then have a paragraph maybe where say your user account anything like that.

03:40.230 --> 03:44.890
Now with that does our account component created.

03:44.890 --> 03:52.790
So now I can import account from a counter view and I will refer to it here.

03:52.870 --> 03:57.770
I need one last and that is the default route for just an empty path.

03:57.820 --> 04:05.610
And here I still want to load the user component that of course also means that I can comment out or

04:05.760 --> 04:11.100
I can also leave it here as global component definition but I will change my applet view file because

04:11.100 --> 04:13.220
right now we're not using the routes anywhere.

04:13.230 --> 04:16.590
We still only render our app user component.

04:16.590 --> 04:24.000
Now here I want to comment this out and instead now want to use a special Capone and shipping with the

04:24.030 --> 04:31.590
viewer out package we installed the router view this is the place where the view will render to component.

04:31.590 --> 04:34.830
It needs to render due to the route we're currently on.

04:34.920 --> 04:40.140
Now with that we can go back to the main dodgiest file and having our routes here is nice but doesn't

04:40.140 --> 04:44.130
do anything to tail view she that it should use these routes.

04:44.280 --> 04:51.220
I will create a new constant the router and here we instantiate the view router we import here view

04:51.240 --> 04:57.270
router now takes javascript object to be initialized and we at least need to set up our routes here.

04:57.420 --> 05:02.840
So we need to set the reality property which it will recognize and set it equal to all routes constant

05:02.840 --> 05:03.910
here.

05:04.680 --> 05:12.720
With this you can now hit save and it won't do anything because now we create at the router we finally

05:12.720 --> 05:14.890
need to add a two hour view instance.

05:15.030 --> 05:21.270
So here you can set the router property which you chaps will recognize and set it to our router Constand

05:21.360 --> 05:23.440
which holds our initialized router.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.420
Now with Dad if you would save.

05:25.710 --> 05:32.250
You see we're still on our page the same page we were before but if you enter and ignored as strange

05:32.250 --> 05:38.100
hashtag for now if you enter this block here you'll see the block page if you enter the account you

05:38.100 --> 05:39.380
see the account page.

05:39.510 --> 05:46.230
And if you go back to user page notice that the disease that has paragraph's always visible because

05:46.230 --> 05:48.920
we placed it here below the route review.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.400
Now how can we add links to our app and what is this hash tag doing.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.230
More on this in the next lecture.
