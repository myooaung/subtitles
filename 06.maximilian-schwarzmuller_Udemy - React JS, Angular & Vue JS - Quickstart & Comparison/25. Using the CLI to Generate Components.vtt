Now that we practice these basics let's dive deeper into this single page application aspect.

00:08.570 --> 00:13.750
We already do create a single page application because we only have one page does in this age HTML file

00:14.390 --> 00:21.380
but we need some routing just like we had it in the avor modules to see how we can actually give the

00:21.380 --> 00:26.740
user the impression of switching between pages before doing that though.

00:27.020 --> 00:34.340
Let's again work with a bit more components so I'll add new components and I'll show you a way I haven't

00:34.340 --> 00:38.930
used before in the terminal and that's just a normal terminal here.

00:38.930 --> 00:40.690
Integrate it into my ear.

00:41.060 --> 00:48.800
We can use the angler's Seelye with Engy to generate new components for us the commanders energy generate

00:49.310 --> 00:56.380
then component or a shortcut and G G C and then the name of the component.

00:56.390 --> 01:03.410
So here let's say the thing I want to create is a user component so name it.

01:03.470 --> 01:10.580
User what this will do is it will create a new folder here with all these files it automatically uses

01:10.580 --> 01:14.480
this external HDMI an external source as file approach.

01:14.480 --> 01:19.970
It also gives us this testing file which you may remove for now and that gives us some boilerplate you

01:19.970 --> 01:24.790
may ignore this on in a thing that's kind of for advanced concept we don't need it here.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.640
So I'll simply get rid of it and you could leave it there.

01:27.650 --> 01:28.860
It wouldn't hurt you.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.380
I don't need to constructor too.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.530
So that's my basic component here.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.830
And as you see it just outputs user works here.

01:37.100 --> 01:43.430
Now that was a quick and easy way and one other thing that I did for you is it added user component

01:43.820 --> 01:48.540
and import to your app module so that you can forget this.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.550
So that's a nice and easy way of using these Seelye for generating components.

01:52.550 --> 01:54.380
Now let's work with that component.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.420
And let's actually create a number one.
