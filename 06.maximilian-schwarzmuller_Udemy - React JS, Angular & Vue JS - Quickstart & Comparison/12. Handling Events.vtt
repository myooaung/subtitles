In the last lecture we learned what Hodas string of jubilation works and how we have that connection

00:07.020 --> 00:08.450
the types could follow.

00:08.690 --> 00:12.930
Let's now improve this app and let's add some events we can react to.

00:12.950 --> 00:17.610
So add to that we had in the Alber modules to where else they change name.

00:17.630 --> 00:22.400
Note unlike in react or view you don't need a root element.

00:22.430 --> 00:28.310
So one element which wraps all the elements of template since we have this extra template file this

00:28.340 --> 00:30.410
already kind of serves as a wrapper.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.420
So here we can write normal HVM all without any wrapping elements.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.560
So here we have the bomb.

00:35.570 --> 00:43.430
Now the question is how can we react to a click event in future as we head the on and then click in

00:43.430 --> 00:46.850
re-act we used on click in angular.

00:46.850 --> 00:48.630
We use parentheses.

00:48.720 --> 00:55.520
Kollek parentheses is a syntax recognized by Angella and then between the parentheses you have any normal

00:55.540 --> 00:58.110
Dom event without d on.

00:58.190 --> 01:02.360
So on click becomes click on mouse enter becomes mouse enter.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.840
So here we have to click event and now we can execute any code.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.900
Any basic javascript code no block statements no multi-line code or of course simply call a method.

01:13.100 --> 01:20.900
So what we could do here is we could simply set name to Anna your and if I now save this we already

01:20.900 --> 01:26.330
have a functionality that if I click this button the name changes to enter soop resemble.

01:26.570 --> 01:31.620
Of course we could all call a method so we could call for example on change name.

01:31.630 --> 01:36.890
It's kind of a convention to have on and then the method name in angle angler but you don't need to

01:36.890 --> 01:41.440
name it like this you can choose any name you like here and then go to the app component file.

01:41.450 --> 01:47.570
And besides the property I'll now add a method to this class and methods are just added like well like

01:47.570 --> 01:53.740
using this iOS 6 like some text where we have the name parentheses and then the body of that method.

01:53.870 --> 01:59.390
Here we could refer to that name with this name because we're in the class now we have to use this to

01:59.390 --> 02:02.850
refer to properties of the class and set it equal to.

02:02.980 --> 02:09.230
And I like this if I do this and now save this code and keep in mind Engy surf has to be running for

02:09.230 --> 02:14.830
all of this and it is in that average window here it will automatically recompile this and therefore

02:14.840 --> 02:18.990
Now if I reload the apple it actually reloaded automatically.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.610
That still works even though I'm now no longer executing this in line.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.850
But I'm calling a method which does this.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.970
And typically you call them effort here especially if you have more complex code to run.

02:29.990 --> 02:32.700
You don't want to put that code into a template.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.500
Well that is how easy you can react to events and update the DOM due to that event.
