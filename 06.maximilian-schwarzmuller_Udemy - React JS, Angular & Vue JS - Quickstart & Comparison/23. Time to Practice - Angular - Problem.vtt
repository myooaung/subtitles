Overdo last lectures you'll learn a lot about Engler.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.420
Time to practice it.

00:06.580 --> 00:12.900
Here's the same exercise you've solved in the view and the react genius module of course adjusted to

00:12.900 --> 00:15.320
angler as a first task.

00:15.330 --> 00:20.100
I want you to output an array of hobbies and provide some people hobby so that you can see something

00:20.100 --> 00:21.800
right from the start.

00:21.810 --> 00:27.930
The second task then requests you to add a new hobby button and the input there the user can introduce

00:27.930 --> 00:28.760
new hobby.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.220
You can of course check whether it's a valid value if it's empty or not.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.030
That's totally up to you.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.080
Then I want you to make the hobby's clickable so that we can remove them once we collect them so at

00:40.080 --> 00:45.310
both to click listener and some logic to remove the hobby from the from the array.

00:45.510 --> 00:51.410
You don't need to get as creative as antibiotic re-act Exxon-Mobile with folder and so on.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.210
But again and yes just asm code which makes sure that hobby is gone.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.660
Then I want you to add hubby delete that paragraph.

00:59.820 --> 01:03.930
Which is only shown if at least one hobby was removed.

01:04.140 --> 01:10.770
Again be creative on how to solve this problem then simply add a hobby counter paragraph or you output

01:10.770 --> 01:19.110
the overall length of the array and then I want you to add some dynamic styles and classes to style

01:19.120 --> 01:22.510
the hobby counter depending on wherever.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.540
We have three or more hobbies.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.910
Be creative about that you're totally free.

01:26.910 --> 01:33.780
You can just use Angie's style as a hint or their respective directives for a change in class or mix

01:33.780 --> 01:35.150
both however you want.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.860
I will show you both in a solution.

01:37.200 --> 01:44.280
Finally outsource your hobbies Cod's list items into a new component which you then repeat.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.260
So that's your task.

01:46.260 --> 01:50.970
Have fun with it and the solution with you will see my approach to solving this.
