In the last lectures we learn a lot about how we can bind Daedalus listen to events how we can use directives

00:08.560 --> 00:15.280
like energy class or NGF one thing which is import which I mentioned before is that start in front of

00:15.280 --> 00:16.810
NGF and and.

00:17.050 --> 00:23.170
I told you that the stars added to structural directives so directives which change the structure of

00:23.180 --> 00:24.000
the dorm.

00:24.340 --> 00:28.320
So why don't we add a two entry style entry class.

00:28.330 --> 00:31.310
DS change something about the dorm too right.

00:31.720 --> 00:38.410
Well not really with structural changes I really mean the addition and removal of elements you style

00:38.410 --> 00:41.220
that antique class don't add or remove any elements.

00:41.350 --> 00:46.540
They just change properties of some elements and that doesn't really influence the structure of the

00:46.540 --> 00:48.000
dog right.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.800
Or the overall flow of Dom didn't change.

00:50.920 --> 00:56.680
That is why Engy class Engy style and all other directives which really don't add or remove elements

00:56.860 --> 00:58.360
don't need to start.
