00:02.460 --> 00:08.950
And The Last Lecture we create our first opponent with a dot if you follow our own dot view fall.

00:08.970 --> 00:15.780
Now I want to create a number of components on climate info Doc View in their Allegan add a template

00:16.380 --> 00:25.130
and I want to say here is some important information UJA us is great.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.630
That's my template now in the script section.

00:28.890 --> 00:34.440
I don't need to add anything so I can leave out the script section because well I don't have any dynamic

00:34.440 --> 00:35.100
content.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.150
We can't just have a template.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.540
I'll also leave out the Style section because I don't want to apply any specific styles so you can only

00:42.540 --> 00:46.550
have a template but that is what you need to at least have a template with.

00:46.560 --> 00:53.120
Again only one root node note HDMI node inside of it as we do here the paragraph.

00:53.190 --> 00:59.160
Now with that invoke that view Fogg's created we could add it as a component as we did here as a global

00:59.160 --> 01:07.110
component which is usable everywhere or we say no I only want to use it in another component and only

01:07.110 --> 01:08.410
in that component.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.690
In this case let's say that would be the user view file.

01:11.790 --> 01:19.410
We can go into that file and we can add components as a property of our view instance and number property

01:19.410 --> 01:21.440
recognized by the U.K.'s.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.420
And here we can set up key value pairs where the key is to select or we can use a template and we can

01:27.420 --> 01:32.400
then only use that selector in the template of this component where we added it as a local component

01:32.400 --> 01:37.660
therefore and the value is the object which serves as a component.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.640
So here I'll set a string as component selector app info maybe.

01:43.950 --> 01:49.540
And now I want to import my objects an import statement at the top.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.260
I'll import info from dot slash in that view file since I'm in the same folder.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.590
A relative import is all I need.

01:57.590 --> 02:06.180
So the sign info as a value here and now I can use app info in the template of this component and only

02:06.180 --> 02:07.860
in this template of this component.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.940
If you save it should again reload the page and you see the important information here.

02:12.970 --> 02:15.970
View Chasse's great.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.100
There's one thing which you might notice.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.880
It's also using a taluk style.

02:20.950 --> 02:21.620
Why.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.720
Let's take a closer look at the next lecture.
