Before we have a look at how we could further improve our application.

00:06.930 --> 00:09.980
Let me talk about these libraries a little bit more.

00:09.990 --> 00:16.790
We saw two libraries here and there are way more libraries for all kinds of things you can do with Javascript.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.080
So how do you find these libraries How do you find out which one you should use.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.820
Well there is no simple answer to this.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.120
Typically it works like this.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.690
You know you want to add a certain functionality.

00:28.770 --> 00:35.280
For example you want to work with dates a lot and you don't want to write code for formatting or transforming

00:35.280 --> 00:36.490
dates on your own.

00:36.660 --> 00:42.670
Well then you would just search for javascript dates or javascript dates library and then you could

00:42.690 --> 00:44.390
find a library like moment.

00:44.430 --> 00:49.350
JS would just elaborate focusing on date specific utility functions.

00:49.390 --> 00:50.880
Tell us how that works.

00:51.030 --> 00:58.140
And there are as I just mentioned libraries for all kinds of things you can create in javascript and

00:58.230 --> 01:05.220
libraries are an integral part of javascript since they make your life so much easier and allow you

01:05.220 --> 01:11.250
to focus on your business logic instead of having to reinvent the wheel all the time and then maybe

01:11.250 --> 01:12.500
also doing it wrong.

01:12.510 --> 01:14.720
You might not be writing optimal code there.

01:14.820 --> 01:18.340
That is why libraries exist and why they are super important.
