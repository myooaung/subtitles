Now what have you learned how we can work with user interaction change styles up short lists and stay

00:09.350 --> 00:11.080
in the shallow world.

00:11.150 --> 00:14.170
It's time to create at least one extra component.

00:14.210 --> 00:18.980
Typically he would create more because we already have kind a lot of logic and a single component which

00:18.980 --> 00:20.070
isn't that good.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.730
But I want to keep it to one component for now.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.910
Of course feel free to improve this and create multiple components in a single component.

00:28.910 --> 00:33.530
I want to be able to output a user name and when it clicked this username I simply want to frozen alert

00:33.650 --> 00:35.230
and output that name in the alert.

00:35.270 --> 00:39.740
So what we did in the view chase example again of course sticking to that example to make it kind of

00:39.740 --> 00:41.120
comparable.

00:41.120 --> 00:49.120
So for this I need a new component and for this new component I'll actually use a function now I promised

00:49.160 --> 00:54.240
we will soon leave Chez fiddle and then move to a local environment move multiple files so that our

00:54.250 --> 00:57.250
components are also split up over multiple files.

00:57.320 --> 01:04.220
I will name this cavorted username uppercase you to follow the convention and there this is a functional

01:04.220 --> 01:04.660
form.

01:04.670 --> 01:09.530
So here we received the props and we're not able to set the state which is what I want.

01:10.220 --> 01:14.890
As you learned if you have such a functional component all you need to do is you need to return J is

01:14.900 --> 01:15.590
x.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.350
So your dad would be the content of one output.

01:18.350 --> 01:21.970
Now here the question is which content do you want to output.

01:22.130 --> 01:29.200
And I simply want to output a paragraph in there where I simply output my username so prop's username

01:29.220 --> 01:31.760
maybe this is what I want to output.

01:31.760 --> 01:37.210
I can now use this component here in my template.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.510
Maybe right at the top before I even change any names here.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.390
I want to use my component as it learned.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.240
I can't just use user name like this.

01:46.260 --> 01:53.240
Self-closing element because I created the year as a function and you can use your functions which follow

01:53.240 --> 01:57.700
this convention and return J as X as components and react.

01:58.130 --> 02:01.000
Now here we use the username Propp.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.320
So we should set this when we use to component.

02:04.430 --> 02:05.660
We should set the user name.

02:05.660 --> 02:10.040
Q For example Chris you're passing a string.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.870
And why don't we even duplicate this.

02:12.920 --> 02:13.990
This whole line here

02:17.950 --> 02:20.050
to set this year to Annah.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.590
If I had control enter we secrets and Anna.

02:23.630 --> 02:26.110
Now of course I wanted to be able to click on this.

02:26.120 --> 02:31.730
And for that we need to be able to pass data from our component to the parent component.

02:31.730 --> 02:39.550
Now I will do it as a second but let me first explain you why using this functional component here actually

02:39.560 --> 02:43.100
is better than the iOS 6 class here.
