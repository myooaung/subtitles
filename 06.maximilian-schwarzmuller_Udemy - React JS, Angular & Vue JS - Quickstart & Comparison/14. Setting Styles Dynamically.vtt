In the last lectures we learned a lot about conditional slates and how generally that all works and

00:08.040 --> 00:09.050
react.

00:09.060 --> 00:14.850
The key takeaway of course is you're always writing javascript's you're so used to Jolly's good features

00:15.030 --> 00:19.430
as we did for the last with the map method and so on.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.610
Now what if we want to style things.

00:21.870 --> 00:29.750
What if we want to change the style of our individual list items here depending on if they are or that

00:29.780 --> 00:36.890
or even number maybe like we didn't view chaos example we can do that very easily since we are in javascript

00:36.890 --> 00:37.200
here.

00:37.230 --> 00:45.600
I can just go to my list item and then simply add style NOW style also takes single Koli braces.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.920
And now here we can write javascript code.

00:49.920 --> 00:56.610
Now the style is set up here however also has to be a javascript object so I need to pass a javascript

00:56.610 --> 01:02.370
object to that style property to basically haloed which styles want one set.

01:02.670 --> 01:07.280
So inside my single curly braces I'll pass another pair of curly braces.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.520
And don't mistake that with the double curly braces syntax from future.

01:10.530 --> 01:14.160
Yes it's just that I need to pass an object here.

01:14.250 --> 01:20.430
So in that style I might have a background color and that needs to be camel case since we're in javascript

01:20.430 --> 01:20.980
here.

01:21.120 --> 01:30.010
Alternatively Rapidan single quotation marks to use background color with the dash and then may be red.

01:30.030 --> 01:33.780
So the string for hit Control enter and add new elements.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.660
These elements have a red background.

01:36.720 --> 01:45.180
Now you can also outsource is of course you could set my eyes style here to a javascript object in a

01:45.180 --> 01:50.580
separate constant and this case could also be a variable of course and set background color.

01:50.580 --> 01:58.890
Now using the difference in text to read like this and simply passed that year between a single quotation

01:58.910 --> 02:04.880
actually braces your eyes style just to make this code code a bit more lean and don't put everything

02:04.880 --> 02:07.430
in a single line for control Antar.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.770
We get the same behavior as before.

02:09.770 --> 02:12.540
Of course you can also write conditional code here.

02:12.660 --> 02:20.540
Maybe we want to change the style depending on whether the current element is odd or even number for

02:20.540 --> 02:30.690
this case I can copy that or catch this constant and put it into my map method to your into year.

02:31.060 --> 02:41.290
And now I can simply check if Al divided by two with the modulus operator if data is equal to zero if

02:41.290 --> 02:42.750
it is then it's an even number.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.260
So we could set the background color to green.

02:45.440 --> 02:50.250
Otherwise I want to set a to read and of course here we have a question mark in between.

02:50.290 --> 02:56.770
It's a turn every expression if you now would control enter click on you element it's red green red

02:56.770 --> 02:57.350
green.

02:57.550 --> 03:00.310
So now that's working now with dynamic styles.

03:00.340 --> 03:08.290
Again thinking in this javascript world write your javascript code and then mix it with GSX to change

03:08.380 --> 03:09.370
what you output.
