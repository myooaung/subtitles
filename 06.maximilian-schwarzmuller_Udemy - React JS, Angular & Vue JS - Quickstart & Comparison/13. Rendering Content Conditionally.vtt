00:02.880 --> 00:06.860
Now that we learned how we can output data and how we can react to events.

00:07.050 --> 00:12.040
Let's also understand how we can actually conditionally output content.

00:12.150 --> 00:19.100
So let's add this good old paragraph which says name updated we all go ahead and your examples and as

00:19.100 --> 00:22.270
in the Alberich samples I only want to display this paragraph.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.000
If we did change the name.

00:24.030 --> 00:30.240
So if it isn't Max any more here therefore we can add a directive in react.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.130
We didn't use directives.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.980
In view we did Engler also has directives what are directives directives.

00:37.980 --> 00:44.370
Just like in view are instructions commands you place in the dorm in angler's case.

00:44.400 --> 00:50.990
This would be energy if energy is just a prefix de angler Pecka shoes for all build indirectness and

00:51.050 --> 00:59.190
if directive or NGF is built in one and important we may use it because of this browser module.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.460
As I said this module add some base functionality to start and run our app but also include some common

01:05.460 --> 01:07.240
features we use in most apps.

01:07.290 --> 01:11.470
The common directives like NGF are one of these features.

01:11.580 --> 01:13.570
So with that we can add this.

01:13.620 --> 01:18.440
Now we need to assign a value when we do this by adding an equal sign and then quotation marks.

01:18.750 --> 01:25.230
And like in the event where we executed code between the quotation marks here we execute the code which

01:25.230 --> 01:28.830
returns true or false in the end because that is what NGF needs.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.330
True or False should it add it or not.

01:31.680 --> 01:40.620
So here NGF should simply check if name is not equal to max which means we changed it because it is

01:40.620 --> 01:42.040
equal to max initially.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.480
So if it is not equal to max then is true.

01:45.510 --> 01:48.540
So then name updated will be added and shown.

01:48.530 --> 01:51.200
However it won't run like this.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.200
There's one important thing we have to add.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.240
The directive is named NGF.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.150
But behind the scenes Anglo-Dutch some transformations with it.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.440
So for this directive we need to add a start in the beginning to inform angular that this is a structural

02:04.440 --> 02:11.700
directive structural directives are directives commands which change the structure of the DOM like here

02:11.980 --> 02:15.770
it at purchase or detach element to and from the dorm.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.320
So it changes the structure.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.830
Therefore we need to add to store later.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.990
We will also see directives which don't use the star and it should become clear then when we need it

02:25.110 --> 02:26.200
and when we don't need it.

02:26.220 --> 02:30.470
Basically it's just a handful or a couple of directives which need to start.

02:30.690 --> 02:36.060
So with that let's save it and end you served still runs to recompiled us in the running app if I now

02:36.060 --> 02:38.950
click Change name we see name updated here.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.210
If we open the developer tools we can see something interesting.

02:42.360 --> 02:50.600
Let's reload this app and let's inspect Max here and now see the part on the right here you'll see your

02:50.610 --> 02:51.280
subparagraph.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.270
Here's the button.

02:52.320 --> 02:59.040
And in between we got this comment this comment basically is a hook for angular which tells it there

02:59.040 --> 03:01.460
to eventually add something.

03:01.620 --> 03:07.560
If I click Change name now you see the hook is still there but this paragraph is brand new.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.520
It was just added and that is how angler does it just like you.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.830
It really adds and removes elements to and from the dawn It doesn't make them invisible or something

03:16.830 --> 03:17.590
like that.

03:17.910 --> 03:24.020
So that's how we can use NGF to conditionally displays on content on our page.
