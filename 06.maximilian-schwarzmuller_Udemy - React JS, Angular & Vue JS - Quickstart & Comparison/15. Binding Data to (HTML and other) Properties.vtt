00:03.080 --> 00:05.350
So now did you learn how we can render lists.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.070
Let's go back to outputting data.

00:08.180 --> 00:13.790
We do output data by using strenger stipulation here with Akali braces.

00:13.970 --> 00:21.440
Dead works fine but there is another syntax we can use especially if you want to bind the value of some

00:21.510 --> 00:25.420
HVM attributes or properties to be precise.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.970
Let's say we want to change the ideal one to give each list item here.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.710
I'm just bringing this in your line to make it easier to read.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.910
I want to give each list item here.

00:34.970 --> 00:44.450
The idea attribute so we could say ID equals and then give it something like L in quotation marks to

00:44.450 --> 00:50.740
output hard coded string plus L which is d id right.

00:50.750 --> 00:55.520
So to avoid confusion let's name this element.

00:55.590 --> 01:03.050
So with that I'm trying to assign this dynamic ID and if I save this and open here my developer tools

01:03.560 --> 01:05.060
you see I don't get an error.

01:05.090 --> 01:11.330
And if we inspect this element we see the IDs indeed we're at it and that's absolutely fine to do it

01:11.330 --> 01:14.000
like this with stringin jubilation.

01:14.090 --> 01:22.100
However typically for binding attributes and properties of elements like the ID or for image to source

01:22.310 --> 01:30.140
things like dead you don't use string interpellation you have a number syntax you can use and that is

01:30.290 --> 01:38.030
wrapping this idea in square brackets square brackets is assumed X recognized by angular which means

01:38.410 --> 01:42.250
bind it sends some data into this property.

01:42.410 --> 01:47.130
So some data into this id property here and you can kind of see a pattern.

01:47.210 --> 01:52.580
We have parentheses for events which means react to something when we get something out of this event

01:52.580 --> 01:57.820
basically or out of this element and square brackets to send something into it.

01:58.130 --> 02:04.150
So here I am binding to ID and now I need to define which data I want to get into dare.

02:04.610 --> 02:07.400
And here we can again use single quotation marks.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.230
Element plus L.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.440
Now that didn't become much shorter right.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.540
We just omitted the double curly braces.

02:14.570 --> 02:18.950
We don't need them and we don't have to or can't use them here anymore.

02:19.220 --> 02:25.230
But still this is the cleaner syntax which you should use if you want to bind to some property but because

02:25.240 --> 02:31.950
trigger jubilation Mostly should only be used if you want to put some text like this in your template.

02:31.970 --> 02:35.040
However as you saw the two are interchangeable.

02:35.060 --> 02:41.240
A lot of the times if we save this and go back to our app and I reloaders and add new elements here

02:41.240 --> 02:45.410
and we inspect these elements you see they still have the element being added to them.

02:45.410 --> 02:47.050
So that works just like before.

02:47.090 --> 02:53.330
Again data by owning a property binding like this is now Rickie's syntax however and we will see it

02:53.330 --> 02:54.830
being used later to.
