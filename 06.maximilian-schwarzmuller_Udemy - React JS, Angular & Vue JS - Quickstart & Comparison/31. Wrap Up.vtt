00:02.350 --> 00:04.630
So that was the introduction to angler.

00:04.720 --> 00:10.220
Just like the frameworks of course angler has to offer way more than what we learn here.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.570
It's a powerful framework with loads of features some features we have even touched on a lot of features

00:16.570 --> 00:21.590
we could dive much deeper into and is of course his only introduction.

00:21.880 --> 00:28.180
I hope you had a chance of getting a feeling for how Anglo works how you create a project how you work

00:28.180 --> 00:33.040
with these components and how you work with typescript and you might hate it you might love it or you

00:33.040 --> 00:34.970
might say it looks interesting.

00:35.350 --> 00:42.160
If that is the case so not the hate case it's probably worth diving deeper into it even with my complete

00:42.160 --> 00:49.300
guide here and you do me or one of the many great tutorials you can find of course angler is a great

00:49.300 --> 00:50.190
framework.

00:50.260 --> 00:56.820
It probably has a great future it's backed by Google and it has some distinct nice features and what's

00:56.830 --> 01:00.970
typescript for example can look like a blocker at the beginning.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.610
You have to learn something new or get used to it.

01:03.610 --> 01:11.470
It really can also be a huge advantage since you can write much more robust and explicit code which

01:11.470 --> 01:14.940
is very clear about what it does and what it can do.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.600
Desire's angler.

01:16.780 --> 01:20.580
Definitely think about using it now in the next module.

01:20.620 --> 01:27.940
I will compare all three frameworks to kind of make it easier for you to decide which one might be the

01:27.940 --> 01:29.480
right one for you.
