WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:03.970
And The Last Lecture we had a look at.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.810
Note Jason NPM and why it is great.

00:06.830 --> 00:09.930
Now want to take a look at this web development server.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.110
To be honest I don't want to have a look at this package.

00:13.100 --> 00:17.270
It's pretty boring just contain some code to spin up a simple note.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.180
JS server.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.840
Wish we can of course do keep in mind.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.770
No chairs a server side language.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.830
But why do we need that.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.680
Why don't we just double click on the T-Mo file and open it in the browser like this.

00:29.690 --> 00:32.420
Well let's double click it to see the difference.

00:32.440 --> 00:37.660
I'm in my project folder here and if I click this file it indeed opens it here.

00:37.940 --> 00:44.310
But you see we have this you r l and then we have file to follow protocol here.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.830
And we don't see anything.

00:46.010 --> 00:52.070
If we open up the console we see that it fails to load to build TROCHILUS file.

00:52.070 --> 00:59.560
Now the built touchiest file is present however and to import pauvres slash disks slash built or Che's

00:59.640 --> 01:01.300
also is correct.

01:01.670 --> 01:07.170
It simply fails to load this because this way of opening it is incorrect.

01:07.220 --> 01:12.740
The file protocol just doesn't work the same SDH UDP protocol does.

01:12.740 --> 01:17.020
Now we could fix this by not making this an absolute path but a relative one.

01:17.060 --> 01:23.200
If we now reloaders you see it works but as soon as we try to navigate it again fails because now it

01:23.210 --> 01:26.390
try to load this route which of course doesn't work.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.430
That is why we need a development server.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.090
The file protocol can only do one thing.

01:31.130 --> 01:38.540
Load files on our local machine and it will fail as soon as we try to do something which is more web

01:38.540 --> 01:42.040
server ish like navigating between different POVs.

01:42.170 --> 01:47.810
Changing the part after the domain we don't have a domain here which has to have a path to a file so

01:47.810 --> 01:51.520
anything which is connected to domain or to the or else will would not work.

01:51.650 --> 01:58.800
If we want to dynamically fetch or load our script files that might also fail.

01:58.940 --> 02:05.810
Sort of file protocol is really limited in what it is able to do and that is why we need to use D.H.

02:05.810 --> 02:07.260
to DP protocol.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.330
Now the HDP protocol can only target a server.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.710
And this is why we need a development server.

02:12.710 --> 02:19.640
So did we have some server handling our HTP requests and that is exactly what the weapon deaths are

02:19.640 --> 02:26.900
or does it simply host wrap and is able to send it back to us to our client whenever we send the request

02:26.900 --> 02:27.820
to the def server.
