00:02.230 --> 00:09.190
In the last lecture we learn how we can dynamically said our styles with the style property here we

00:09.190 --> 00:12.210
set and then passing in our style object.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.930
Of course we can also change to class names.

00:14.950 --> 00:18.450
Let's stick to the example we saw in the future section.

00:18.520 --> 00:25.780
I'll treat a new see is us Claassen my CSA as portion here updated and I'll set the text color to white

00:26.230 --> 00:33.010
and background color to yellow to ever really unreadable background and text color.

00:33.010 --> 00:37.380
Now with that I want to add update it to my name.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.240
Paragraph your.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.130
But only if the name was changed.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.260
Well we can again do this using javascript.

00:44.260 --> 00:49.700
We actually already check if the name has been changed so I could add a new variable here.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.990
Which old name.

00:51.220 --> 00:51.980
Name.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.610
Paragraph.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.170
And of course you may choose a shorter name which is an empty string by default.

00:58.540 --> 01:01.570
And now I will inside of this if blocks.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.710
Only if the name has been changed.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.110
I will say name.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.200
Paragraph.

01:06.220 --> 01:08.420
Clause equal to updated.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.840
So to the clause I created here.

01:11.350 --> 01:12.640
Also add a semicolon here.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.520
By the way.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.850
So with that I'm setting declasse And now here on the paragraph I can add class.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.290
Now that's important not just CLOS because that would be a javascript keyword.

01:24.490 --> 01:28.230
And keep in mind that we are writing Chalis with code here instead.

01:28.280 --> 01:36.580
It's a class name with a capital end and I'll bind this to the variable i create up there which will

01:36.580 --> 01:44.070
hold my class name and dead ever is an empty string so no class or it is the class I want to add.

01:44.350 --> 01:50.890
So if I now had control enter again I click Change name you see diskettes changed to that nice unreadable

01:50.890 --> 01:53.210
style as soon as it did click.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.170
Change name.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.430
So then add a CSSA class.

01:57.430 --> 02:03.290
Again I can't emphasize this enough staying in that javascript world of thinking about it.
