00:02.770 --> 00:04.210
That's all working.

00:04.270 --> 00:06.870
Now I want to show you one Avernus thing.

00:07.390 --> 00:13.940
You'll see that in the info component here we have a paragraph and we do have one end user component.

00:14.290 --> 00:20.500
Let's go back to the thing I told you that the styling we add in the example user component or C is

00:20.500 --> 00:20.980
as follows.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.290
Or in the interval components here.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.510
This file is scoped to that component.

00:25.510 --> 00:26.640
It belongs to.

00:26.980 --> 00:28.510
I can prove this.

00:28.510 --> 00:30.450
I'll go to my user component file.

00:30.520 --> 00:38.100
I'll add a paragraph styling here and I want to start my paragraph to be italic.

00:38.140 --> 00:43.900
Now if I do this and I hit save you see my user name is Max is it Telic.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.560
Because that's the user component.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.270
Just edit the style.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.870
Engler is pretty awesome.

00:48.900 --> 00:52.240
It's not however and that's the difference to you.

00:52.270 --> 00:57.380
There are scoped styles travelled down to the child in England they don't.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.430
They really are simply scoped to the component.

01:00.450 --> 01:00.900
They sit.

01:00.910 --> 01:06.600
And so here to the user component and no advocate for that no child component no sibling component nothing

01:06.780 --> 01:12.540
justice component and that is a nice way of working with styles and making sure that the style is only

01:12.540 --> 01:14.700
applied to what you want to apply to.
