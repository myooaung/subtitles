00:02.590 --> 00:04.030
So bad was it.

00:04.030 --> 00:09.140
That was a basic introduction to react Chia's of course only scratching the surface.

00:09.160 --> 00:16.580
You probably saw that it has some similarities to chess but mostly is really different to it.

00:16.600 --> 00:22.860
We have this javascript first and only approach where we write everything in javascript and use GSX

00:22.870 --> 00:24.970
to get some HVM like feeling.

00:24.970 --> 00:29.530
But in the end it is just javascript and that is the key difference.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.780
And you may like this you may not like this.

00:31.780 --> 00:35.650
We have one more framework to come and then I will compare them all.

00:35.650 --> 00:42.010
If you enjoyed it you should keep in mind that you should learn ESX to dive into react.

00:42.010 --> 00:47.350
And of course take some dedicated courses tutorials or materials on.

00:47.400 --> 00:54.100
Yes this was just a basic introduction and was you now are aware of the core features to concept the

00:54.100 --> 00:55.310
idea behind it.

00:55.370 --> 01:01.510
There's a lot more to learn to build both powerful multi-page full stack application where you drop

01:01.510 --> 01:08.530
re-act into your single pages and the individual pages of the app or single page applications where

01:08.530 --> 01:14.770
you have one index each team file and then use the react router and the multitude of components to render

01:14.770 --> 01:18.100
different pages with components in them.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.300
I hope you enjoy that.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.590
Now let's move on in this course.
