WEBVTT

00:02.510 --> 00:06.280
We're still in the Getting Started section but we already learned a lot.

00:06.290 --> 00:12.380
We learned what the basic terms mean what all these things in the javascript world mean what libraries

00:12.410 --> 00:19.070
are and why we might want to use some frameworks are and why we might want to replace some libraries

00:19.070 --> 00:20.630
with frameworks.

00:20.630 --> 00:22.880
Now it's time to move on though.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.860
We'll take a closer look at javascript frameworks and understand how we may add them to applications

00:29.870 --> 00:35.720
because there's more than one way of doing so we will understand what makes up such frameworks and how

00:35.720 --> 00:40.270
they work and which features they offer us after we learn dead.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.970
We'll dive into the frameworks one by one.

00:42.980 --> 00:45.820
The three most popular ones will start with future.

00:45.830 --> 00:52.070
Yes we had a brief look at the Getting Started section here but there we will dive much deeper and learn

00:52.070 --> 00:53.480
the basic syntax.

00:53.510 --> 01:00.470
The concept behind it how it works and how we may create different kinds of applications with it thereafter

01:00.580 --> 01:07.130
for diving into our frameworks I'll pause for a second and take a look at a web page and the build workflow

01:07.700 --> 01:08.840
when using future.

01:08.850 --> 01:16.640
Yes by the end of that module will have a local set up which uses web page to bundle our code compile

01:16.640 --> 01:21.160
it or transform it a little bit and also optimize it.

01:21.440 --> 01:27.540
We'll have a look at this workflow in this second year and understand what it does for us and why we're

01:27.560 --> 01:28.560
using it.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.370
Thereafter we'll jump back into the frameworks.

01:31.370 --> 01:32.600
We'll have a look at react.

01:32.600 --> 01:38.510
J.S. a very popular and awesome framework and we will understand how this framework works.

01:38.510 --> 01:44.000
You'll see quite different to view chess but very interesting to jump into that so that you can get

01:44.000 --> 01:46.860
an impression of whether that's interesting to you or not.

01:46.970 --> 01:52.790
Well after react we'll have a look at Engler in its latest version angler for at this point.

01:52.790 --> 01:56.720
Now however it will also be valid for later worsens.

01:56.780 --> 02:03.890
We'll learn how angler works how we trade angle projects and how we work with angler which concept this

02:03.890 --> 02:05.980
framework uses.

02:06.180 --> 02:07.150
Does.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.220
We had a look at the three most important frameworks.

02:10.220 --> 02:16.700
We had a look at things like weap egg and then you should have a clear impression of the JavaScript

02:16.700 --> 02:25.010
world which role each of the parts place and how we may use them and especially you have an impression

02:25.010 --> 02:28.820
of how these frameworks work and which one you like the most.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.320
I'm not done though.

02:30.530 --> 02:34.640
I'll have a module where I compared these frameworks.

02:34.640 --> 02:41.180
I'll have a couple of topics are criterions where I will match the FREYBERG against each other so that

02:41.180 --> 02:49.250
you can also get an additional idea of which framework might be suited for which task.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.110
Well and after.

02:51.170 --> 02:56.050
You should really be prepared to pick your favorite framework and dive deeper into it.

02:56.120 --> 02:56.930
If you want to.
