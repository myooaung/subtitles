00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:10,620
In this demo, I'm going to walk you through the Web UI. If using minikube, "minikube dashboard --url"

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:19,260
This is the correct URL that you need to access the dashboard. If you are on AWS you can use the comments 

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,520
from the theory to launch you dashboards. In the end,

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,660
you should both see something like this.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:38,010
This is the Kubernetes Web UI. Here we can do exactly the same as with our command utility,

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,670
"Kubectl", kube control.

7
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,160
We can get information from the "Namespaces"

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,450
This divides a cluster into multiple "Namespaces" the cluster in multiple "Namespaces".

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,340
We have a "default" namespace, that's where we have been deploying our apps in.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,190
We have one note here "minikube," labels it is ready, and so it was ready for four days.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,890
The allocated resources.

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,440
So here you find some useful metrics,

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,500
we have two gigabytes of memory, approximately 4 of 110 pods running.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,730
It's a "Boot2Docker" image.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,020
So, we can say we can go to deployments, for instance, we have deployments, replica sets, replicated controllers,

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,340
most of these things we've already seen, pods as well.

17
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:31,140
And then, you're the other ones I'm going to cover in the advanced section 

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,720
and we have services, "Ingress" in various volumes.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,890
I'm also going to-- "Ingress" I'm going to cover later, 

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,920
"Persistent Volumes" I'm also going to cover later, "Secrets" we've already covered, and "Config Maps" is going to be very soon.

21
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,890
Deployments, we can just click on this create button,

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,050
and you could create a deployment right here.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,740
You can specify these app details here or we can upload a YAML or JSON file. Rather than using YAML files

24
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,810
and you can also use JSON files.

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,840
It is a syntax difference.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:09,240
So, let's say that I just start our "helloworld-deployment", then you click on deployments, 

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
you see our deployment is now running.

28
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,250
It has a label what is actually spinning up right now.

29
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,870
So, it's not running yet, but now it is running three or three out of three pods and we could just 

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,670
delete it from here again.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,390
We can have we can do the actions here.

32
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,860
We also have the details here.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,390
It's just a dashboard.

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,290
You can do exactly the same things as with "kubectl".

35
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,710
So, if you don't really like the kubecontrol tool and you have a UI, you are free to use this one rather

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,610
than kubecontrol.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,810
Will continue with kubecontrol in next lectures.
