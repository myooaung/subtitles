00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:09.910
In this demos, I will show you a set up of Kubernetes with kops. You can use kops on Linux and on Mac.

2
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.960
If you have Windows you first have install Vagrant and VirtualBox, so they will first show you is to 

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.080
so they will first show you is to start a new VM with a VirtualBox you can do that on Mac, on Linux, and on Windows as well.

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.780
So, first you download a Vagrant and VirtualBox, and then you install it.

5
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.210
It's very easy, very straightforward.

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.770
Then, you open a shell or a terminal on Mac and then you create a directory in this directory.

7
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:47.050
In this directory, you do, "vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64". I am going to use "ubuntu/xenial64", but you can use any linux distribution that you want.

8
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.870
On the website of Vagrant, you can find other boxes, if you'd rather run other operating system.

9
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:04.990
These "vagrant init" will create a vagrant file and then you just do, "vagrant up".

10
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.330
"Vagrant up" is then going to use a virtual box to set to set up this "ubuntu/xenial64" box.

11
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.990
This might take some time.

12
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.120
A couple of minutes.

13
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.180
And this is what you should see, when it is set up.

14
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.960
You also see that within the Linux box you just create,

15
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.520
you have a "/vagrant" that is pointing to the current directory that you are in, on your host system.

16
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:42.890
To log in, "vagrant ssh-config", Linux and Mac users will just be able to do, "vagrant ssh".

17
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.350
Windows users will need to take a look at this identity file here.

18
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.120
This is going to point to a path of the "private key" that they can use in "putty".

19
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.840
So, it is a tool for windows to look into as a sage,

20
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.160
and you can use "puttygen" or "putty" to first convert this private key, using "puttygen" and then log in with "putty" to this box.

21
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:14.590
You can also use a "vagrant ssh". But, then you need to install open ssh client.

22
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.470
So, whatever you think is most easy for you, you can either use "puttygen" or "putty" to log in with your private key

23
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.500
to log in using ubuntu, or you can install open ssh libraries.

24
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.090
If you would be stuck,

25
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540
There's lots of information on the Internet on how to convert a key using "puttygen" and "putty", 

26
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.860
there are lots of screenshots, so have a look there, if it still doesn't work, use the Q&A, and tell me exactly where you're stuck, and I will try to help you.

27
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.690
So, from now on, I'll assume that you have a Linux box available on whatever platform that you are.

28
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.000
So from this point on, I'll be using the Linux downloads and I will be using this box to set up the Kubernetes cluster.

29
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.330
So, the next step here is that we are going to downloads kops, so that we can install kubernetes.
