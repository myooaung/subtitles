00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.390
Congratulations on completing this course. You now have a solid basic understanding of Kubernetes to

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.090
start really working on it.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.370
Kubernetes is moving super fast, and more and more, alpha APIs are getting stable every release.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.280
If you wish that I add a feature that hasn't been discussed, here definitely sent me a message.

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.640
I've tried to get as many stable and beta features to this course, but I know there are some new ones coming

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.780
but those are still alpha and prone to change.

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.850
That's why I didn't add them initially, but I'm good at them at a later time when they become more stable

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.830
or if you all message me that he really needs is.
