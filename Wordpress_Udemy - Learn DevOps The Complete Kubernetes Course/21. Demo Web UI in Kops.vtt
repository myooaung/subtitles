00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.510
<v Edward>In this demo I will show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.510  -->  00:00:04.523
how to add the web UI in kops.
3

3

00:00:06.400  -->  00:00:10.310
In my vagrant/kubernetes-course my git repository
4

4

00:00:10.310  -->  00:00:12.023
I have directory dashboard.
5

5

00:00:13.830  -->  00:00:16.719
In this dashboard I have README that you can use
6

6

00:00:16.719  -->  00:00:19.533
to start your dashboard on kops.
7

7

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:23.660
In earlier releases of kops it was pretty easy
8

8

00:00:23.660  -->  00:00:24.750
to start a dashboard.
9

9

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:28.820
But in new releases they added RBAC by default.
10

10

00:00:28.820  -->  00:00:31.743
So you have to also add a user to be able to log in.
11

11

00:00:33.110  -->  00:00:35.191
To start our dashboard it's still the same,
12

12

00:00:35.191  -->  00:00:39.210
although the (mumbles) is a little bit outdated,
13

13

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:41.633
but it's still a kubectl apply.
14

14

00:00:42.810  -->  00:00:44.900
So I'm gonna do that first.
15

15

00:00:44.900  -->  00:00:47.000
And this is going to create the dashboard.
16

16

00:00:47.930  -->  00:00:50.053
Then I'm going to create a sample user.
17

17

00:00:53.050  -->  00:00:55.893
This is a user that I'm going to add to the account.
18

18

00:00:56.950  -->  00:01:00.650
It is a ServiceAccount and it's called admin-user
19

19

00:01:01.760  -->  00:01:06.760
and this is a ClusterRoleBinding to bind to this user,
20

20

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:10.233
this admin-user, to bind a certain role.
21

21

00:01:11.198  -->  00:01:12.810
And the role I'm going to add is cluster-admin.
22

22

00:01:12.810  -->  00:01:16.050
So we're going to add a user, this will be admin-user
23

23

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:17.800
that will be able to do everything.
24

24

00:01:20.180  -->  00:01:23.190
Going to create this new user.
25

25

00:01:23.190  -->  00:01:24.690
This new user is created.
26

26

00:01:24.690  -->  00:01:28.220
Now that this user is created I can retrieve a token.
27

27

00:01:28.220  -->  00:01:31.240
So if I do kubectl in the kube-system namespace,
28

28

00:01:31.240  -->  00:01:34.077
get secret, and I'm gonna grep,
29

29

00:01:34.077  -->  00:01:35.653
I'm gonna filter on admin-user.
30

30

00:01:36.840  -->  00:01:39.140
And I will see here an admin-user token
31

31

00:01:39.140  -->  00:01:41.173
and then this random string.
32

32

00:01:42.136  -->  00:01:44.673
And if I describe this secret,
33

33

00:01:45.516  -->  00:01:49.163
then I can see the secret.
34

34

00:01:50.090  -->  00:01:53.000
Using this token we can now log into the cluster
35

35

00:01:53.000  -->  00:01:55.180
without using our certificates.
36

36

00:01:55.180  -->  00:01:58.370
So by default, in kops we are using certificates
37

37

00:01:58.370  -->  00:01:59.310
to log in.
38

38

00:01:59.310  -->  00:02:03.090
Those certificates are configured here in kube/config.
39

39

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:05.550
So rather than using those certificates
40

40

00:02:05.550  -->  00:02:08.630
I am going to use a token.
41

41

00:02:08.630  -->  00:02:11.690
And then the last thing that we need is the password.
42

42

00:02:11.690  -->  00:02:14.060
So we do kubectl config view
43

43

00:02:14.930  -->  00:02:17.693
or we just open the editor and edit the config in.
44

44

00:02:17.693  -->  00:02:20.370
Then we see the admin log in and password that we need
45

45

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:23.233
to log into the API server.
46

46

00:02:24.160  -->  00:02:26.190
So we go in to log into the API server.
47

47

00:02:26.190  -->  00:02:27.700
Enter admin and the password
48

48

00:02:27.700  -->  00:02:29.590
and then use this token to log in.
49

49

00:02:29.590  -->  00:02:30.733
So let's try that out.
50

50

00:02:31.690  -->  00:02:33.000
So this the first log in,
51

51

00:02:33.000  -->  00:02:35.850
I'm going to enter admin and my password
52

52

00:02:35.850  -->  00:02:37.440
to log in as admin.
53

53

00:02:37.440  -->  00:02:39.753
And now I am logged into the API server.
54

54

00:02:41.960  -->  00:02:46.083
To access the UI I just type /ui.
55

55

00:02:46.083  -->  00:02:48.083
And then I will be redirected to the UI,
56

56

00:02:48.980  -->  00:02:50.520
to the Kubernetes Dashboard.
57

57

00:02:50.520  -->  00:02:54.333
Two ways to log in, using Kubeconfig or using a token.
58

58

00:02:55.200  -->  00:02:56.780
Even if you use Kubeconfig you still
59

59

00:02:56.780  -->  00:02:59.800
need to have your token configured in the config
60

60

00:02:59.800  -->  00:03:02.153
so it's easier to just copy paste this token here.
61

61

00:03:03.750  -->  00:03:06.260
From here we can copy, paste the token
62

62

00:03:06.260  -->  00:03:09.003
that we need to log into the dashboard.
63

63

00:03:10.470  -->  00:03:14.320
Going to enter this token, click sign in,
64

64

00:03:14.320  -->  00:03:16.960
and then I'm logged in to the dashboard.
65

65

00:03:16.960  -->  00:03:19.720
Here you have an overview of what I am running right now
66

66

00:03:19.720  -->  00:03:21.380
in my cluster.
67

67

00:03:21.380  -->  00:03:24.000
So you can just go a little bit around.
68

68

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:27.110
Click on the links here to see
69

69

00:03:27.110  -->  00:03:28.710
what is running on your cluster.
70

70

00:03:30.270  -->  00:03:33.230
In the next demo I will show you the same with minikube
71

71

00:03:33.230  -->  00:03:35.773
and then I will also go over some dashboard items.
