<v Edward>The Readiness Probe.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,710  -->  00:00:05,750
Besides livenessProbes you can also use
3

3

00:00:05,750  -->  00:00:08,303
the readinessProbes on a container within a Pod.
4

4

00:00:10,010  -->  00:00:14,360
livenessProbes indicate whether a container is running.
5

5

00:00:14,360  -->  00:00:16,960
If the check fails, the container will be restarted.
6

6

00:00:18,020  -->  00:00:19,800
readinessProbes, on the other hand,
7

7

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:21,720
indicate whether the container is ready
8

8

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:23,213
to serve requests.
9

9

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:25,720
If the check fails, the container
10

10

00:00:25,720  -->  00:00:28,670
will not be restarted, but the Pod's IP address
11

11

00:00:28,670  -->  00:00:30,520
will be removed from the service,
12

12

00:00:30,520  -->  00:00:34,050
so it will not serve any requests anymore.
13

13

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:35,550
The readiness test will make sure
14

14

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:37,740
that at startup the pod will only receive
15

15

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:39,583
traffic when the test succeeds.
16

16

00:00:40,910  -->  00:00:43,190
You can use these probes in conjunction,
17

17

00:00:43,190  -->  00:00:45,890
and you can configure different tests for them.
18

18

00:00:45,890  -->  00:00:48,020
If your container always exits when something
19

19

00:00:48,020  -->  00:00:50,570
goes wrong you don't really need the livenessProbe.
20

20

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:53,600
But in general, you configure both
21

21

00:00:53,600  -->  00:00:56,283
the livenessProbe and the readinessProbe.
