00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.490
In this lecture, I'll be talking about a Kubernetes set up.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.060
I will first talk about different ways of setting up Kubernetes.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.350
Then, I'll show you how to set it up locally and on the AWS. Kubernetes should really be able to run anywhere.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.050
But, there are more integrations for certain cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud.

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.560
Things like volumes and external appliances, work only with support cloud platforms.

6
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.800
So, if the integration for your cloud platform is not available, then you can still use Kubernetes,

7
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.930
but you will not be able to use volumes and external Load Balancers. For AWS and Google Cloud, this is available also for Azure.

8
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.580
This is available, so for the main providers, this is already available.

9
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.220
Other providers have different types of support.

10
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.830
You'll have to take a look in the documentation and the cloud provider plugins to see which ones are supported.

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.320
I will first use "minikube" to quickly spin up a local machine with a Kubernetes cluster.

12
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.800
You can use minikube on your laptop or your desktop to spin up a Kubernetes cluster. 

13
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.560
And will then show you how to spin up a cluster on Amazon  using Kops. Kops is a tool that can be used to spin

14
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.990
up a highly available production cluster. Doing the labs yourself is possible and highly recommend.

15
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.430
Using the AWS Free tier, wheatear which gives you 750 hours of t2.micro's per month, 

16
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.210
it's not just one t2.micro, it's 750 hours per month.

17
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.530
So, you can run multiple t2.micro's as long as you don't exceed the number of 750 hours per month.

18
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.160
The URL to sign up is "http://aws.amazon.com".

19
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.030
You can do the same labs using your local machine, you will not be able to test integrations with a cloud,

20
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.110
but you can still use Kubernetes, you can use minikube from this URL.

21
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.950
You can find these URL in the procedure documents

22
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.380
from the beginning of the course, or if you want to can use DigitalOcean, and you can use this URL 

23
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560
to get a $10 coupon.
