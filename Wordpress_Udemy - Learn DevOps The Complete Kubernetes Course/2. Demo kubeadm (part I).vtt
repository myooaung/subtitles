00:00:00.320  -->  00:00:01.910
<v Edward>In this demo I'm going to show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.910  -->  00:00:04.853
how to install kubernetes using kubeadm.
3

3

00:00:07.150  -->  00:00:09.520
When you will type in the URL that I shared with you
4

4

00:00:09.520  -->  00:00:14.520
with the referral codes, you end up on a page like this.
5

5

00:00:14.830  -->  00:00:18.900
This is the digitalocean.com website,
6

6

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:21.520
you can use this to deploy kubernetes
7

7

00:00:21.520  -->  00:00:23.660
or if you're deploying on-prem
8

8

00:00:24.550  -->  00:00:26.380
then you will have your own machines.
9

9

00:00:26.380  -->  00:00:27.990
If you deploy on another cloud provider
10

10

00:00:27.990  -->  00:00:30.790
you can create an account there or use an account there.
11

11

00:00:31.720  -->  00:00:33.983
If you decide to use DigitalOcean,
12

12

00:00:34.910  -->  00:00:37.420
use my URL from the previous lecture
13

13

00:00:37.420  -->  00:00:40.490
to get this $10 coupon, then sign up here
14

14

00:00:40.490  -->  00:00:42.860
and you will get a new DigitalOcean account
15

15

00:00:42.860  -->  00:00:45.133
with $10 credit on it.
16

16

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:49.760
Once you create an account and once you log in,
17

17

00:00:49.760  -->  00:00:51.650
you should see a screen like this.
18

18

00:00:51.650  -->  00:00:54.700
I'm on the dashboard page and here
19

19

00:00:54.700  -->  00:00:57.163
I already have two droplets running,
20

20

00:00:58.060  -->  00:00:59.380
if it's a new account you probably
21

21

00:00:59.380  -->  00:01:01.460
don't have any droplets running.
22

22

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:02.510
So what we're going to do is,
23

23

00:01:02.510  -->  00:01:05.023
we're going to create two new droplets.
24

24

00:01:06.890  -->  00:01:09.870
Here you have a create button on the right top,
25

25

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:14.483
and I'm going to choose for droplets, create cloud servers.
26

26

00:01:18.110  -->  00:01:22.330
And then here you can use one of the distributions
27

27

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:24.423
that are supported by kubeadm.
28

28

00:01:25.580  -->  00:01:30.380
Either ubuntu, the LDS version,
29

29

00:01:30.380  -->  00:01:32.220
this one has long-term support,
30

30

00:01:32.220  -->  00:01:33.860
or one of the newer ones,
31

31

00:01:33.860  -->  00:01:36.540
I'm going to use the LTS version,
32

32

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:38.840
or a Fedora which is also supported,
33

33

00:01:38.840  -->  00:01:40.563
which is a Red Hat based solution.
34

34

00:01:41.770  -->  00:01:46.770
Debian, CentOS, or even CoreOS the container Linux
35

35

00:01:48.260  -->  00:01:49.730
that you can use is a new one
36

36

00:01:49.730  -->  00:01:51.543
that's also supported by kubeadm.
37

37

00:01:53.100  -->  00:01:55.500
I'm going to keep it simple and I'm going
38

38

00:01:55.500  -->  00:01:57.913
to use ubuntu, the LTS version.
39

39

00:01:59.370  -->  00:02:02.430
2GB of ram, two times,
40

40

00:02:02.430  -->  00:02:04.610
you can use this one, or either this one,
41

41

00:02:04.610  -->  00:02:06.230
which gives you more CPU,
42

42

00:02:06.230  -->  00:02:08.620
which is handy for the master.
43

43

00:02:08.620  -->  00:02:12.463
One CPU will also do, even just for demo purposes.
44

44

00:02:13.340  -->  00:02:15.285
If you don't really want to scale something,
45

45

00:02:15.285  -->  00:02:17.120
You'll probably need something bigger,
46

46

00:02:17.120  -->  00:02:19.813
depending on the apps that you want apparent.
47

47

00:02:21.170  -->  00:02:24.240
You can choose a data center.
48

48

00:02:24.240  -->  00:02:25.760
I'm going to choose London,
49

49

00:02:25.760  -->  00:02:28.060
but you can also choose one of the other ones.
50

50

00:02:29.540  -->  00:02:32.920
You can add your SSH keys if you have SSH keys.
51

51

00:02:32.920  -->  00:02:36.250
If you don't have SSH keys, then just don't add one.
52

52

00:02:36.250  -->  00:02:38.533
And they will email the roots password.
53

53

00:02:39.580  -->  00:02:41.300
Once you create a droplet you will get an email
54

54

00:02:41.300  -->  00:02:42.480
with your root password.
55

55

00:02:42.480  -->  00:02:45.650
If you used a safe key, then you
56

56

00:02:45.650  -->  00:02:49.360
create a new safe key here, you'll upload your public key.
57

57

00:02:49.360  -->  00:02:51.010
And then you use your private key to log in.
58

58

00:02:51.010  -->  00:02:53.060
So depending whether you have a safe keys or not,
59

59

00:02:53.060  -->  00:02:54.690
you can use this or not.
60

60

00:02:54.690  -->  00:02:57.053
I'll be using it, cause it's easier.
61

61

00:02:58.230  -->  00:02:59.840
How many droplets do you want?
62

62

00:02:59.840  -->  00:03:00.673
Two.
63

63

00:03:01.510  -->  00:03:03.830
Give it a host name.
64

64

00:03:03.830  -->  00:03:07.440
I will call it kubernetes monster.
65

65

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:11.793
And kubernetes node zero one.
66

66

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:18.440
I'll add a tag, I'll call it kubernetes cluster.
67

67

00:03:19.040  -->  00:03:22.170
That's gonna be easier later on to then add a firewall.
68

68

00:03:22.170  -->  00:03:24.120
Because even though you use public IP addresses,
69

69

00:03:24.120  -->  00:03:25.870
which are all here in this case,
70

70

00:03:25.870  -->  00:03:27.320
then we also need a firewall.
71

71

00:03:28.290  -->  00:03:29.503
Going to click create.
72

72

00:03:31.170  -->  00:03:33.023
And now those two will be creating.
73

73

00:03:34.130  -->  00:03:37.580
Then while these are creating I'm gonna go to networking.
74

74

00:03:37.580  -->  00:03:41.410
Firewalls, create a firewall.
75

75

00:03:41.410  -->  00:03:43.260
I'm gonna call it kubernetes cluster.
76

76

00:03:45.110  -->  00:03:49.410
And I only want to allow my IP address
77

77

00:03:49.410  -->  00:03:52.790
to be accessible using SSH.
78

78

00:03:52.790  -->  00:03:57.040
And I will add a new rule for cluster traffic.
79

79

00:03:57.040  -->  00:03:58.593
So All TCP.
80

80

00:04:00.170  -->  00:04:05.170
Is gonna be kubernetes cluster.
81

81

00:04:05.830  -->  00:04:09.192
So everything that comes from the kubernetes cluster.
82

82

00:04:09.192  -->  00:04:11.763
All TCP and All UDP will be accepted.
83

83

00:04:13.150  -->  00:04:15.233
(typing)
84

84

00:04:18.090  -->  00:04:19.133
And SSH,
85

85

00:04:21.260  -->  00:04:22.093
lets,
86

86

00:04:23.230  -->  00:04:25.390
lets also set this to All TCP.
87

87

00:04:25.390  -->  00:04:27.940
It is gonna be my IP address.
88

88

00:04:27.940  -->  00:04:29.410
So what is my IP address?
89

89

00:04:29.410  -->  00:04:33.630
ifconfig.co will tell you what your IP address is.
90

90

00:04:33.630  -->  00:04:35.020
My IP address is this one.
91

91

00:04:35.020  -->  00:04:39.020
So we're gonna add this in as well.
92

92

00:04:39.020  -->  00:04:42.103
So give me access to the cluster.
93

93

00:04:43.900  -->  00:04:45.773
Outbound we're not gonna specify.
94

94

00:04:47.683  -->  00:04:50.400
Why I just do everything that is
95

95

00:04:50.400  -->  00:04:52.193
with that kubernetes cluster.
96

96

00:04:53.210  -->  00:04:54.253
Create a firewall.
97

97

00:04:56.400  -->  00:04:59.000
And then we have two droplets, six rules,
98

98

00:04:59.000  -->  00:05:00.350
and I just create this now.
99

99

00:05:02.560  -->  00:05:04.700
Back to the dashboard we see now.
100

100

00:05:04.700  -->  00:05:06.220
The kubernetes monster is up.
101

101

00:05:06.220  -->  00:05:08.530
Our kubernetes node is up.
102

102

00:05:08.530  -->  00:05:12.520
So we can SSH to those IP addresses.
103

103

00:05:12.520  -->  00:05:13.893
And install the cluster.
