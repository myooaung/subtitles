00:00:00,560  -->  00:00:03,250
<v Edward>I just showed you how to use minikube</v>
2

2

00:00:03,250  -->  00:00:06,270
or the docker client to get a kubernetes cluster.
3

3

00:00:06,270  -->  00:00:08,120
Now let's talk a little bit about auto tools
4

4

00:00:08,120  -->  00:00:10,173
to run a production cluster.
5

5

00:00:12,100  -->  00:00:15,890
There are multiple tools to install a kubernetes cluster.
6

6

00:00:15,890  -->  00:00:18,480
I showed you how to use minikube and docker client.
7

7

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:20,363
Those are for local installs.
8

8

00:00:21,500  -->  00:00:23,260
If you want a production cluster
9

9

00:00:23,260  -->  00:00:25,740
you will need different tooling.
10

10

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:28,570
Minikube and docker client are great for local setups
11

11

00:00:28,570  -->  00:00:30,050
but not for real clusters.
12

12

00:00:30,050  -->  00:00:32,180
They spin up only a one-node cluster
13

13

00:00:32,180  -->  00:00:33,833
for development and testing.
14

14

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:38,363
Kops and kubeadm are tools to spin up a production cluster.
15

15

00:00:39,410  -->  00:00:42,390
You don't need both tools, just one of them.
16

16

00:00:42,390  -->  00:00:44,973
On AWS, the best tools is kops.
17

17

00:00:45,830  -->  00:00:48,870
At some point AWS EKS, the host of Kubernetes,
18

18

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:50,150
will also be available.
19

19

00:00:50,150  -->  00:00:53,430
At that point this will probably be the preferred option.
20

20

00:00:53,430  -->  00:00:55,100
With the hosted solution you don't
21

21

00:00:55,100  -->  00:00:56,800
need to maintain the masters.
22

22

00:00:56,800  -->  00:00:58,910
With kops you own all the infrastructure
23

23

00:00:58,910  -->  00:01:00,973
so you also need to maintain a masters.
24

24

00:01:02,130  -->  00:01:04,490
For other installs, or if you cannot get kops to work,
25

25

00:01:04,490  -->  00:01:05,490
you can use kubeadm.
26

26

00:01:06,984  -->  00:01:09,040
Kubeadm is an alternative approach,
27

27

00:01:09,040  -->  00:01:11,670
and kops is still recommended on AWS.
28

28

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:15,360
You also have AWS integrations with kops automatically.
29

29

00:01:15,360  -->  00:01:17,650
Kubeadm is a more generic tool.
30

30

00:01:17,650  -->  00:01:20,480
So it's an alternative approach if you're not on AWS
31

31

00:01:20,480  -->  00:01:21,940
or if you cannot get it working,
32

32

00:01:21,940  -->  00:01:25,000
but I still recommend you to use lops of you are on AWS
33

33

00:01:25,000  -->  00:01:27,128
because you will get integrations
34

34

00:01:27,128  -->  00:01:30,150
with IAM and a load balancer as well.
35

35

00:01:31,460  -->  00:01:34,670
The kubeadm lectures can be found at the end of this course,
36

36

00:01:34,670  -->  00:01:37,590
and let you spin up a cluster on DigitalOcean.
37

37

00:01:37,590  -->  00:01:39,270
Because the focus on this course is really
38

38

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:42,830
on minikube and kops I just put the lectures at the end
39

39

00:01:42,830  -->  00:01:45,250
because they provide you an alternative way
40

40

00:01:45,250  -->  00:01:46,620
of setting of a cluster.
41

41

00:01:46,620  -->  00:01:49,318
If you have AWS you should always try AWS first.
42

42

00:01:49,318  -->  00:01:53,280
If you're going to do bare metal or another cloud provider
43

43

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:55,423
then kubeadm can be a good alternative.
