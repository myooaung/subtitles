In this demo, I'm going to show you how to add a health check to your deployment. In your deployments folder,

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.270
you will find "helloworld-health check.yml".

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.230
This is our deployment object, it still has the "k8s-demo" as a container.

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.140
But here we add the "livenessProbe". And this "livenessProbe" is going to check "/" on the "nodejs-port",

5
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.930
which is Port 3000 and it will wait 15 seconds before doing a first check.

6
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.840
I mean, you have a timeout of 30 seconds. You are going to use "kubectl create", 

7
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.520
and I am using "kubectl get deployments" or "get pods",

8
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.770
and we can get the status of one pod.

9
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:05.950
Describe pods. And in the details, we see there's a "Liveness: http-get" on this "nodejs-port"

10
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.870
with a delay of 15 seconds, a timeout of 30 seconds, with a delay between a checks of 10 seconds, but the pod will would consider it healthy

11
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.930
when there's one success or unhealthy when there's three failures.

12
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.490
So, then we have three pods running on our node and if one of those pods gives an error.

13
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.900
So, at that point the container is still running.

14
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.900
These containers still running, but for some reason our app crashed, it doesn't work anymore,

15
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.410
it doesn't give a HTTP 200 code anymore, which is the normal code.

16
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.110
But, for instance, code 500, which shows that there is something wrong done.  

17
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.820
With Kubernetes it will terminate the pods and launch new pods. And this is very important because if the pod is not working anymore

18
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.970
and you route traffic to it, then the end-user might get an error,

19
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
while there are still other pods that might be healthy.

20
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.690
So, what you want is that you don't route traffic at all to pods that are not healthy 

21
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.010
and that's why we have this health check.

22
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.760
So, this health check is very useful and you should always include it if you deploy applications in production.

23
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:31.320
If you want to edit any settings right now of this deployment you can use "kubectl edit"

24
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.340
And here you see the settings that they can change.

25
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.010
This is a useful trick to also see what settings are available like the "timeout", like the "period", 

26
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.310
the "successThreshold", and the failureThreshold". These you can either edit it right here 

27
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.830
or include them in the YAML file, 

28
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.250
If you would want to change them, otherwise the default values will be used.
