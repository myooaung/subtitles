00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.760
Let's talk about the Web UI. Kubernetes comes with a Web UI

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.550
you can use instead of the "kubectl" commands.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.650
You can use it to get an overview of running applications on a cluster and for creating and modifying

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.520
individual Kubernetes resources and workloads like "kubectl create" and "delete". 

5
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.570
Retrieve information on the state of resources.

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.090
Like when you use the "describe pod" command or "describe deployment" in general you can access the Kubernetes Web UI at "https://<Kubernetes-master>/ui"

7
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.630
If you cannot access it, for instance, if it's not enabled on your deploy type 

8
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.960
you can install it manually using the "kubectl create" and then using the YAML file 

9
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.310
straight from the Kubernetes repository.

10
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.790
If a password is asked, you can retrieve the password by entering "kubectl config view".

11
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.280
If you are using minikube, you can use the following command to launch dashboard, "minikube dashboard"

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.260
is going to open in your browser and it will go straight to the URL.

13
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.040
If you just want to know your URL, you can use, "minikube dashboard --url" 

14
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.590
and then you can copy and paste it yourself in the browser that you want it.  

15
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.860
In the next demo, I will briefly show you around the web UI.
