<v Tutor>This lecture is completely optional.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.762  -->  00:00:05.644
If you didn't have any issues with DNS
3

3

00:00:05.644  -->  00:00:07.862
then you can skip this lecture
4

4

00:00:07.862  -->  00:00:09.588
or you can come back to it later on
5

5

00:00:09.588  -->  00:00:12.725
if you realize that at some point your cluster doesn't work
6

6

00:00:12.725  -->  00:00:15.837
because you have an issue with DNS.
7

7

00:00:15.837  -->  00:00:18.068
In this demo, I will show you a little bit
8

8

00:00:18.068  -->  00:00:20.203
about DNS troubleshooting.
9

9

00:00:20.203  -->  00:00:23.087
CROPS need to have DNS working properly
10

10

00:00:23.087  -->  00:00:26.078
otherwise you cannot start your cluster
11

11

00:00:26.078  -->  00:00:27.722
or you can sometimes start a cluster
12

12

00:00:27.722  -->  00:00:29.348
but not connect to it.
13

13

00:00:29.348  -->  00:00:30.668
So here in this lecture,
14

14

00:00:30.668  -->  00:00:34.459
I will talk a little bit about DNS troubleshooting.
15

15

00:00:34.459  -->  00:00:37.895
On your machine that you are using CROPS Linux machine,
16

16

00:00:37.895  -->  00:00:40.478
you can't use the program host.
17

17

00:00:41.682  -->  00:00:43.955
You first need to make sure that Horse is installed
18

18

00:00:43.955  -->  00:00:47.043
so we can use pseudo app installed by Nine Host.
19

19

00:00:47.043  -->  00:00:49.448
In my case it's already installed.
20

20

00:00:49.448  -->  00:00:53.129
So now we can use the executable host.
21

21

00:00:53.129  -->  00:00:55.319
To make sure that the name servers are properly set,
22

22

00:00:55.319  -->  00:00:58.396
you can do host minus t NS.
23

23

00:00:58.396  -->  00:01:00.610
NS stands for name server.
24

24

00:01:00.610  -->  00:01:03.943
Of, in my case that is newtech academy .
25

25

00:01:06.666  -->  00:01:10.665
You can see that the name service of this name,
26

26

00:01:10.665  -->  00:01:15.087
kubernetes newtech academy, points to the route 53 zone.
27

27

00:01:15.087  -->  00:01:18.022
If this doesn't return the Amazon name service
28

28

00:01:18.022  -->  00:01:18.920
of your route 53
29

29

00:01:18.920  -->  00:01:21.420
then something is not working.
30

30

00:01:22.345  -->  00:01:24.799
In route 53, you also need to make sure
31

31

00:01:24.799  -->  00:01:25.966
that the reply
32

32

00:01:27.419  -->  00:01:30.753
of the name servers also matches exactly this.
33

33

00:01:30.753  -->  00:01:34.833
So these are specific name service for this zone.
34

34

00:01:34.833  -->  00:01:36.232
You cannot use my name service
35

35

00:01:36.232  -->  00:01:38.581
because yours will be different.
36

36

00:01:38.581  -->  00:01:42.151
The reason why this resolving works, the host minus DNS,
37

37

00:01:42.151  -->  00:01:44.150
it's because I put these records in place
38

38

00:01:44.150  -->  00:01:47.827
in the DNS control panel of namecheap.
39

39

00:01:47.827  -->  00:01:50.603
Let's say that you don't use namecheap
40

40

00:01:50.603  -->  00:01:53.623
and that you only use aws route 53.
41

41

00:01:53.623  -->  00:01:57.721
Well, then you need to create a host of its own.
42

42

00:01:57.721  -->  00:02:02.471
For example, our great hosts its own for newtech academy.
43

43

00:02:04.011  -->  00:02:05.844
And I'll click Create.
44

44

00:02:07.350  -->  00:02:12.235
And this newtech academy has different name servers.
45

45

00:02:12.235  -->  00:02:15.247
And still if I go back to my terminal
46

46

00:02:15.247  -->  00:02:17.944
even though I created this public host name
47

47

00:02:17.944  -->  00:02:21.027
if I do host t NS of newtech academy.
48

48

00:02:23.560  -->  00:02:24.688
newtech academy.
49

49

00:02:24.688  -->  00:02:28.285
It will still point to register servers.com
50

50

00:02:28.285  -->  00:02:30.050
which is namecheap
51

51

00:02:30.050  -->  00:02:31.186
because namecheap
52

52

00:02:31.186  -->  00:02:33.992
is still responsible for the name servers.
53

53

00:02:33.992  -->  00:02:35.829
So if I do whois,
54

54

00:02:35.829  -->  00:02:38.542
which is not a tool of this domain name,
55

55

00:02:38.542  -->  00:02:42.635
I can see that the name service are set on this register.
56

56

00:02:42.635  -->  00:02:47.399
So if you want to host your full domain name on Amazon,
57

57

00:02:47.399  -->  00:02:50.109
which is not necessary, but if you want,
58

58

00:02:50.109  -->  00:02:53.826
then you need to change the name servers in namecheap,
59

59

00:02:53.826  -->  00:02:54.923
not in the DNS management's
60

60

00:02:54.923  -->  00:02:57.200
but there's also an option name servers
61

61

00:02:57.200  -->  00:02:59.717
and every domain provider has that option
62

62

00:02:59.717  -->  00:03:01.369
where you can choose name servers.
63

63

00:03:01.369  -->  00:03:03.389
And then you has to point the name servers
64

64

00:03:03.389  -->  00:03:05.222
to these name servers.
65

65

00:03:06.424  -->  00:03:10.341
Then, your domain name points to this host zone
66

66

00:03:11.405  -->  00:03:13.019
but that doesn't mean that this host zone
67

67

00:03:13.019  -->  00:03:14.711
will work automatically.
68

68

00:03:14.711  -->  00:03:17.590
Then you have to still create name server records
69

69

00:03:17.590  -->  00:03:19.973
that point from your main domain name,
70

70

00:03:19.973  -->  00:03:24.064
newtech academy to kubernetes newtech academy.
71

71

00:03:24.064  -->  00:03:24.897
So then,
72

72

00:03:26.137  -->  00:03:27.720
you can copy those.
73

73

00:03:29.153  -->  00:03:30.740
Go to newtech academy
74

74

00:03:30.740  -->  00:03:32.466
and then create a record sets
75

75

00:03:32.466  -->  00:03:36.920
and then this is going to be kubernetes newtech academy
76

76

00:03:36.920  -->  00:03:40.840
and the value will be these name servers.
77

77

00:03:40.840  -->  00:03:44.173
And these are going to be an NS records.
78

78

00:03:45.103  -->  00:03:47.292
And then you gonna have kubernetes newtech academy
79

79

00:03:47.292  -->  00:03:51.955
is going to point to your order route 53 zone.
80

80

00:03:51.955  -->  00:03:53.802
So this is only necessary
81

81

00:03:53.802  -->  00:03:57.920
if you want to host your main domain as well on Amazon
82

82

00:03:57.920  -->  00:04:00.461
because then you need to make sure that
83

83

00:04:00.461  -->  00:04:02.855
you register your domain register
84

84

00:04:02.855  -->  00:04:06.298
uses these records because these are from your main domain
85

85

00:04:06.298  -->  00:04:08.583
that you add also here, just like I did
86

86

00:04:08.583  -->  00:04:10.550
in the previous lecture records
87

87

00:04:10.550  -->  00:04:15.050
and as records to point to kubernetes newtech academy.
88

88

00:04:16.178  -->  00:04:17.466
The third option is
89

89

00:04:17.466  -->  00:04:19.622
that you don't use kubernetes newtech academy,
90

90

00:04:19.622  -->  00:04:21.306
you don't use a sub domain,
91

91

00:04:21.306  -->  00:04:24.112
but you just pass this main domain name
92

92

00:04:24.112  -->  00:04:26.810
as a cluster name and as a DNS name.
93

93

00:04:26.810  -->  00:04:27.643
And then you will have
94

94

00:04:27.643  -->  00:04:30.075
and then you don't have kubernetes newtech academy
95

95

00:04:30.075  -->  00:04:32.602
so we can remove these records,
96

96

00:04:32.602  -->  00:04:36.427
then you only need this and you use your main domain name
97

97

00:04:36.427  -->  00:04:39.964
as a cluster name and as a DNS name.
98

98

00:04:39.964  -->  00:04:42.343
And then you will have API.newtech academy
99

99

00:04:42.343  -->  00:04:46.232
instead of API.kubernetes newtech academy.
100

100

00:04:46.232  -->  00:04:48.818
So that's the third option that you can use.
101

101

00:04:48.818  -->  00:04:49.917
The best option is to use
102

102

00:04:49.917  -->  00:04:51.605
like I explained in the previous lecture,
103

103

00:04:51.605  -->  00:04:54.637
you often have DNS management at your domain register
104

104

00:04:54.637  -->  00:04:57.100
and then you can just add these NS record.
105

105

00:04:57.100  -->  00:04:58.501
If that's not possible,
106

106

00:04:58.501  -->  00:05:02.019
you can create a second host zone for your main domain name
107

107

00:05:02.019  -->  00:05:04.884
and then you can also add an extra host
108

108

00:05:04.884  -->  00:05:06.876
to kubernetes newtech academy.
109

109

00:05:06.876  -->  00:05:08.597
So that all works.
110

110

00:05:08.597  -->  00:05:11.929
So then at the end, when you do all this configuration
111

111

00:05:11.929  -->  00:05:14.389
then you need to check whether
112

112

00:05:14.389  -->  00:05:17.390
host NS newtech academy resolves to the correct one
113

113

00:05:17.390  -->  00:05:20.376
and kubernetes newtech academy results
114

114

00:05:20.376  -->  00:05:22.793
to the correct route 53 zone.
115

115

00:05:24.752  -->  00:05:27.853
But in my case, the first goes to my register.
116

116

00:05:27.853  -->  00:05:30.262
At my register I have a DNS record set
117

117

00:05:30.262  -->  00:05:35.045
that points to my host zone, my route 53 host zone.
118

118

00:05:35.045  -->  00:05:37.315
So I hope this makes it a little bit more clear.
119

119

00:05:37.315  -->  00:05:39.809
DNS is not a easy topic.
120

120

00:05:39.809  -->  00:05:42.876
You might have to spend some time to set this up.
121

121

00:05:42.876  -->  00:05:44.277
Also when you set this up,
122

122

00:05:44.277  -->  00:05:46.828
it might take another 30 minutes one hour
123

123

00:05:46.828  -->  00:05:49.411
before those changes are propagated.
124

124

00:05:49.411  -->  00:05:51.647
So these records might be cached sometimes
125

125

00:05:51.647  -->  00:05:54.408
so sometimes you just have to wait half an hour one hour
126

126

00:05:54.408  -->  00:05:57.142
before you get the correct results.
