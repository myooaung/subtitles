00:00:00,380  -->  00:00:02,580
<v Edward>Hi, I'm Edward, and I will be your trainer</v>
2

2

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:04,330
for this course.
3

3

00:00:04,330  -->  00:00:07,070
Getting started with Kubernetes is no easy task,
4

4

00:00:07,070  -->  00:00:09,640
so reach out to me using the Q and A if you're stuck
5

5

00:00:09,640  -->  00:00:11,460
somewhere in this course.
6

6

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:13,810
Setting up your Kubernetes cluster for the first time
7

7

00:00:13,810  -->  00:00:17,170
can be hard, but once you're passed the initial lectures
8

8

00:00:17,170  -->  00:00:19,470
it'll get easier, and you'll deepen your knowledge
9

9

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:22,153
by learning all of the details of Kubernetes.
10

10

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:25,310
When you're finished with this course you can continue
11

11

00:00:25,310  -->  00:00:27,913
with my two other Advanced Kubernetes courses,
12

12

00:00:28,891  -->  00:00:31,614
you'll get a coupon code in the last lecture,
13

13

00:00:31,614  -->  00:00:32,470
the bonus lecture.
14

14

00:00:32,470  -->  00:00:35,220
This is the course overview of this course.
15

15

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:38,440
You see there's a lot to cover.
16

16

00:00:38,440  -->  00:00:40,300
I'll first talk about introduction,
17

17

00:00:40,300  -->  00:00:43,220
what is containers, what is Kubernetes.
18

18

00:00:43,220  -->  00:00:46,830
I will guide you through the setup on your desktop
19

19

00:00:46,830  -->  00:00:48,390
or on the cloud.
20

20

00:00:48,390  -->  00:00:50,040
And then once you have a cluster setup,
21

21

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:52,550
then we will start building containers.
22

22

00:00:52,550  -->  00:00:54,843
We'll run the first app on Kubernetes.
23

23

00:00:55,990  -->  00:00:58,600
Then I will explain to you the Kubernetes Basics,
24

24

00:00:58,600  -->  00:01:00,423
what do you need to know.
25

25

00:01:00,423  -->  00:01:03,480
The node architecture, how to scale, how to use deployments,
26

26

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:07,873
services, healthchecks, the lifecycle of the pod,
27

27

00:01:08,870  -->  00:01:13,000
and how to use secrets in your application.
28

28

00:01:13,000  -->  00:01:16,050
I'll also show you how to use a WebUI.
29

29

00:01:16,050  -->  00:01:19,030
Then we'll start with more advanced topics.
30

30

00:01:19,030  -->  00:01:21,060
I will talk about service discovery,
31

31

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:25,152
how to use config files and ingress,
32

32

00:01:25,152  -->  00:01:26,660
which is also a load balancer.
33

33

00:01:26,660  -->  00:01:30,570
External DNS, I'll talk about volumes, pod presets,
34

34

00:01:30,570  -->  00:01:33,770
StatefulSets, Daemon Sets, monitoring, autoscaling,
35

35

00:01:33,770  -->  00:01:36,600
node affinity, anti-affinity.
36

36

00:01:36,600  -->  00:01:38,750
I will also cover operators,
37

37

00:01:38,750  -->  00:01:41,343
which can give you extra functionality in Kubernetes.
38

38

00:01:42,230  -->  00:01:43,750
And then I will cover administration.
39

39

00:01:43,750  -->  00:01:45,560
I will talk about the master services,
40

40

00:01:45,560  -->  00:01:50,560
how to set quotas and limits, namespaces, user management,
41

41

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:53,133
and how to limit your users using RBAC.
42

42

00:01:54,242  -->  00:01:56,010
I'll talk about networking, node maintenance,
43

43

00:01:56,010  -->  00:01:59,053
high availability and TLS on your load balancer.
44

44

00:02:00,110  -->  00:02:02,590
Then a very interesting topic, packaging.
45

45

00:02:02,590  -->  00:02:06,910
So how do you run your applications on Kubernetes.
46

46

00:02:06,910  -->  00:02:08,890
First I will introduce you to Helm,
47

47

00:02:08,890  -->  00:02:10,980
and then how to create Helm charts
48

48

00:02:12,202  -->  00:02:13,720
to package your applications,
49

49

00:02:13,720  -->  00:02:16,510
and then we're going to set up a Helm repository,
50

50

00:02:16,510  -->  00:02:18,423
to store our Helm charts.
51

51

00:02:19,608  -->  00:02:22,450
Then we will be building and deploying applications
52

52

00:02:22,450  -->  00:02:25,220
using Helm and Jenkins.
53

53

00:02:25,220  -->  00:02:28,160
I have a few extras that you can take,
54

54

00:02:28,160  -->  00:02:31,560
kubeadm if you want to set up an on-prem cluster,
55

55

00:02:31,560  -->  00:02:33,723
and TLS certificates with cert-manager,
56

56

00:02:34,703  -->  00:02:36,400
which is part of one of my other courses.
57

57

00:02:36,400  -->  00:02:41,330
This allows you to use letsencrypt to add certificates
58

58

00:02:41,330  -->  00:02:42,543
to your applications.
59

59

00:02:43,810  -->  00:02:47,220
Course objectives, after this course you should be able
60

60

00:02:47,220  -->  00:02:50,260
to understand, deploy and use Kubernetes.
61

61

00:02:50,260  -->  00:02:52,650
You should be able to get started with Containerization
62

62

00:02:52,650  -->  00:02:55,400
and run those containers on Kubernetes.
63

63

00:02:55,400  -->  00:03:00,370
To deploy Kubernetes on your desktop, on-prem, and on AWS.
64

64

00:03:00,370  -->  00:03:03,100
To be able to run stateless and stateful applications
65

65

00:03:03,100  -->  00:03:04,660
on Kubernetes.
66

66

00:03:04,660  -->  00:03:07,120
And to be able to adminster Kubernetes.
67

67

00:03:07,120  -->  00:03:09,240
You should also be able to package and deploy
68

68

00:03:09,240  -->  00:03:12,690
applications using Helm,
69

69

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:14,890
and this last one is quite an important one.
