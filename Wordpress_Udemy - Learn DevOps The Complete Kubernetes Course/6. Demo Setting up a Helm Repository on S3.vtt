00:00:00.340  -->  00:00:01.790
<v Edward>In this demo, I will show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.790  -->  00:00:05.623
how to create a chart repository using AWS S3.
3

3

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:08.769
In the previous lecture, I didn't install
4

4

00:00:08.769  -->  00:00:12.700
using our charts but our chart was locally available,
5

5

00:00:12.700  -->  00:00:14.700
it was on Git and we had to check out
6

6

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:17.410
the Git repository to then install a chart.
7

7

00:00:17.410  -->  00:00:20.030
Now, I will put a chart in a repository
8

8

00:00:20.030  -->  00:00:21.770
so that you can just use Hub Install
9

9

00:00:21.770  -->  00:00:24.320
and then package name rather than having
10

10

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:26.170
to use the directory.
11

11

00:00:26.170  -->  00:00:28.450
To be able to do this demo, you need an
12

12

00:00:28.450  -->  00:00:31.773
AWS account and you will need to create an S3 bucket.
13

13

00:00:33.160  -->  00:00:35.986
I'm here again in my Kubernetes course in the helm
14

14

00:00:35.986  -->  00:00:40.190
directory and here I have a read me.
15

15

00:00:40.190  -->  00:00:42.650
In this read me, it also explains how to set up
16

16

00:00:42.650  -->  00:00:43.773
a helm repository.
17

17

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:46.160
Let's have a look at this file.
18

18

00:00:46.160  -->  00:00:48.903
Set up S3 helm repo.sh.
19

19

00:00:53.260  -->  00:00:55.830
This is a simple bash script that will
20

20

00:00:55.830  -->  00:00:58.920
set up the repository for us.
21

21

00:00:58.920  -->  00:01:00.750
First, we are gonna create a random string.
22

22

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:03.610
Thus, every S3 bucket needs to be unique
23

23

00:01:03.610  -->  00:01:06.470
so it's easier to just append a random part
24

24

00:01:06.470  -->  00:01:08.930
to your S3 bucket name so that you are sure
25

25

00:01:08.930  -->  00:01:10.400
it's unique.
26

26

00:01:10.400  -->  00:01:13.400
It is important to set the AWS region and if you
27

27

00:01:13.400  -->  00:01:15.880
don't set, you can change the default here.
28

28

00:01:15.880  -->  00:01:18.540
So my default region is E-U West one
29

29

00:01:18.540  -->  00:01:20.840
because I don't really have an AWS region set.
30

30

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:24.890
Then we're going to create the S3 bucket
31

31

00:01:24.890  -->  00:01:27.140
and for that, we're going to use the AWS tool,
32

32

00:01:27.140  -->  00:01:28.890
the AWS command utility.
33

33

00:01:28.890  -->  00:01:31.020
So you will have to install this tool
34

34

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:32.910
if you haven't already.
35

35

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:34.630
In one of the first lectures, where I explained
36

36

00:01:34.630  -->  00:01:37.126
about coops, I explained how to install it.
37

37

00:01:37.126  -->  00:01:39.810
In the same lecture, I also explained how
38

38

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:42.550
to set up the credentials to create an admin
39

39

00:01:42.550  -->  00:01:45.440
user in AWS and to use those credentials.
40

40

00:01:45.440  -->  00:01:47.700
Those need to be configured before you can
41

41

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:49.860
execute this command.
42

42

00:01:49.860  -->  00:01:51.610
I will not explain this again now.
43

43

00:01:51.610  -->  00:01:54.370
But if you haven't done so, please go to
44

44

00:01:54.370  -->  00:01:57.433
one of the first lectures to set up AWS first.
45

45

00:01:58.270  -->  00:02:00.720
If the bucket is in US east one,
46

46

00:02:00.720  -->  00:02:03.520
you can just do AWS S3 api.
47

47

00:02:03.520  -->  00:02:04.580
Create bucket.
48

48

00:02:04.580  -->  00:02:07.090
If it's not, then you have to parse the region
49

49

00:02:07.090  -->  00:02:08.890
and the create bucket configuration.
50

50

00:02:09.750  -->  00:02:14.750
Once we have our S3 bucket, we can install S3 helm again.
51

51

00:02:15.170  -->  00:02:17.853
Helm plugin install from this GitHub repository.
52

52

00:02:18.711  -->  00:02:21.770
You can then initialize the S3 bucket
53

53

00:02:21.770  -->  00:02:24.530
so we're going to create a directory of charts.
54

54

00:02:24.530  -->  00:02:26.806
In this directory of charts, you will have
55

55

00:02:26.806  -->  00:02:30.060
our charts uploaded.
56

56

00:02:30.060  -->  00:02:32.400
Then we can add the repository to helm.
57

57

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:36.623
So helm repo add my charts, helm random string /charts.
58

58

00:02:36.623  -->  00:02:39.350
From that point, we can upload the charts
59

59

00:02:39.350  -->  00:02:41.363
to our S3 repository.
60

60

00:02:42.890  -->  00:02:44.790
So make sure that your AWS credentials
61

61

00:02:44.790  -->  00:02:46.600
are set up correctly.
62

62

00:02:46.600  -->  00:02:51.600
To test, you can do AWS sts get caller identity
63

63

00:02:51.880  -->  00:02:56.770
for example to get your user name, your user ID
64

64

00:02:56.770  -->  00:02:58.193
and your account ID.
65

65

00:02:59.159  -->  00:03:03.320
If you get output and not an error then your AWS
66

66

00:03:03.320  -->  00:03:04.363
access is working.
67

67

00:03:05.430  -->  00:03:08.373
Then you can do setup S3 helm repo.sh.
68

68

00:03:12.580  -->  00:03:16.497
So this script set up our helm repository,
69

69

00:03:16.497  -->  00:03:18.593
our helm uses a random string.
70

70

00:03:20.360  -->  00:03:23.193
Download and installed the helm S3 plugin.
71

71

00:03:24.030  -->  00:03:27.712
The S3 plugin, it initializes an empty repository
72

72

00:03:27.712  -->  00:03:29.712
in this chart directory.
73

73

00:03:30.857  -->  00:03:32.100
In the S3 bucket add a my charts to my repository.
74

74

00:03:36.520  -->  00:03:40.330
If you do helm repo list, we now have
75

75

00:03:40.330  -->  00:03:43.173
my charts in our repository list.
76

76

00:03:44.170  -->  00:03:48.910
So now we can add our demo chart to this list.
77

77

00:03:48.910  -->  00:03:51.023
Let's have a look at our read me again.
78

78

00:03:52.590  -->  00:03:56.180
First, we need to make sure we export our AWS region.
79

79

00:03:56.180  -->  00:03:58.612
If you don't have it set in AWS.
80

80

00:03:58.612  -->  00:04:01.107
Let's do to make sure.
81

81

00:04:01.107  -->  00:04:05.000
Export AWS region EU west one and then we have
82

82

00:04:05.000  -->  00:04:07.560
up here our demo chart.
83

83

00:04:07.560  -->  00:04:11.310
Once we have our demo chart that we installed earlier,
84

84

00:04:11.310  -->  00:04:13.040
now we want package just one.
85

85

00:04:13.040  -->  00:04:16.420
So we do helm chart package, successfully packaged
86

86

00:04:16.420  -->  00:04:21.183
the chart and save it to demo chart 0.0.1.
87

87

00:04:23.627  -->  00:04:27.300
Now we can push it, helm S3 push.
88

88

00:04:27.300  -->  00:04:29.520
My chart repository.
89

89

00:04:29.520  -->  00:04:31.123
So let's do that.
90

90

00:04:33.550  -->  00:04:38.550
And now the demo chart is pushed to our repository
91

91

00:04:38.900  -->  00:04:42.903
so we could do helm search demo chart.
92

92

00:04:43.860  -->  00:04:47.410
Then we get our local version and the one
93

93

00:04:47.410  -->  00:04:50.130
that we pushed to our repository.
94

94

00:04:50.130  -->  00:04:53.930
Now anyone who has this repository can use
95

95

00:04:53.930  -->  00:04:57.080
our chart so they don't need this directory anymore.
96

96

00:04:57.080  -->  00:04:59.750
They can just use this repository and then do
97

97

00:04:59.750  -->  00:05:03.697
helm install the name of repository, my charts,
98

98

00:05:04.645  -->  00:05:09.140
and then demo chart, the name of our chart.
99

99

00:05:09.140  -->  00:05:13.320
This will then install again the demo charts
100

100

00:05:13.320  -->  00:05:15.113
but this time using the repository.
101

101

00:05:16.795  -->  00:05:18.545
I will just delete the chart again.
102

102

00:05:21.160  -->  00:05:24.863
Helm delete and then the name of the deployment.
103

103

00:05:26.550  -->  00:05:28.973
And the chart is going to be deleted again.
104

104

00:05:30.000  -->  00:05:32.880
So the next obvious step, once you've created
105

105

00:05:32.880  -->  00:05:36.083
the repository is to then use a CI or a CD
106

106

00:05:36.083  -->  00:05:38.520
like continuous integration or continuous deployment
107

107

00:05:38.520  -->  00:05:42.170
tool to build this package and then push this package
108

108

00:05:42.170  -->  00:05:44.670
to this repository so that you don't have to do this
109

109

00:05:44.670  -->  00:05:46.560
locally anymore.
110

110

00:05:46.560  -->  00:05:47.943
So that's it for this demo.
111

111

00:05:48.861  -->  00:05:51.850
The next demo, I will then show you how to integrate it
112

112

00:05:51.850  -->  00:05:54.823
within Jenkins, a continuous integration platform.
