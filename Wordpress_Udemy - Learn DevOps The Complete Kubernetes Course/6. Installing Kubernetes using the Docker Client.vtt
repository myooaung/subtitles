00:00:00.680  -->  00:00:03.530
<v Edward>Minikube is really a great tool</v>
2

2

00:00:03.530  -->  00:00:05.970
to install and use kubernetes,
3

3

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:08.350
but sometimes it doesn't spin up,
4

4

00:00:08.350  -->  00:00:10.450
sometimes it doesn't work with your configuration,
5

5

00:00:10.450  -->  00:00:13.980
with your desktop, so there is an alternative.
6

6

00:00:13.980  -->  00:00:16.830
We can download docker and the newest versions of docker
7

7

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:19.970
allow you to install kubernetes within the client.
8

8

00:00:19.970  -->  00:00:22.990
So that makes it a lot easier to use kubernetes
9

9

00:00:22.990  -->  00:00:25.170
if you're already using the docker client
10

10

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:27.260
or if minikube doesn't work for you.
11

11

00:00:27.260  -->  00:00:29.663
So in this demo I will show you how this works.
12

12

00:00:30.700  -->  00:00:35.700
So if you just type in docker client windows edge in Google
13

13

00:00:35.990  -->  00:00:37.870
then you will get on this page.
14

14

00:00:37.870  -->  00:00:40.871
Store.docker.com/editions/community,
15

15

00:00:40.871  -->  00:00:42.260
it's a community edition, docker-ce,
16

16

00:00:42.260  -->  00:00:45.370
stands for community edition, desktop-windows.
17

17

00:00:45.370  -->  00:00:49.020
And here on this page you can download the Stable version
18

18

00:00:49.020  -->  00:00:50.313
or the Edge version.
19

19

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:54.490
Because kubernetes within a docker client is pretty new
20

20

00:00:54.490  -->  00:00:56.350
you need the Edge version.
21

21

00:00:56.350  -->  00:00:58.730
At some point they will include it in the Stable version,
22

22

00:00:58.730  -->  00:01:01.130
but now you need Edge version.
23

23

00:01:01.130  -->  00:01:03.530
So you need to download Edge version for Windows
24

24

00:01:04.970  -->  00:01:07.593
or you can download the Edge version for Mac.
25

25

00:01:08.460  -->  00:01:11.640
So I downloaded the Edge version for Mac.
26

26

00:01:11.640  -->  00:01:14.210
It's an installer and it will install docker
27

27

00:01:14.210  -->  00:01:17.220
in your tray in Mac,
28

28

00:01:17.220  -->  00:01:19.963
but I suppose in Windows it's exactly the same.
29

29

00:01:20.820  -->  00:01:25.150
And once it started, it starts by default when you start it,
30

30

00:01:25.150  -->  00:01:27.410
then you can go to Preferences,
31

31

00:01:27.410  -->  00:01:29.310
and when you open your Preferences
32

32

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:30.740
a window like this will open
33

33

00:01:30.740  -->  00:01:33.860
and you should have an icon here kubernetes.
34

34

00:01:33.860  -->  00:01:35.610
If you don't have this then you're probably
35

35

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:37.060
on the Stable version and you
36

36

00:01:38.031  -->  00:01:39.370
should download the Edge version.
37

37

00:01:39.370  -->  00:01:42.240
To enable kubernetes you just click on this.
38

38

00:01:42.240  -->  00:01:45.153
You click on kubernetes and you press apply.
39

39

00:01:46.150  -->  00:01:48.100
Kubernetes is now starting.
40

40

00:01:48.100  -->  00:01:49.603
This can take a few minutes.
41

41

00:01:50.960  -->  00:01:53.103
So my kubernetes cluster is now running.
42

42

00:01:54.320  -->  00:01:58.120
This is the Mac OS terminal that I launched.
43

43

00:01:58.120  -->  00:02:00.580
If you are on Windows you can just launch
44

44

00:02:00.580  -->  00:02:04.230
the command cmd or a powershell to get a terminal
45

45

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:06.580
and then you will also be able to use the docker
46

46

00:02:06.580  -->  00:02:09.000
and kubectl commands.
47

47

00:02:09.000  -->  00:02:14.000
So I can now use a terminal and do kubectl get nodes.
48

48

00:02:14.620  -->  00:02:17.010
And I get my docker-for-desktop.
49

49

00:02:17.010  -->  00:02:19.890
If you already tried to use minikube earlier before that
50

50

00:02:19.890  -->  00:02:22.870
you might have to change your context.
51

51

00:02:22.870  -->  00:02:27.870
So kubectl config get-context.
52

52

00:02:29.884  -->  00:02:33.420
We'll show you the context that you have.
53

53

00:02:33.420  -->  00:02:35.710
And now I only have one cluster, one context,
54

54

00:02:35.710  -->  00:02:38.120
but if you're reusing minikube it's possible
55

55

00:02:38.120  -->  00:02:40.730
that there's also a minikube context here,
56

56

00:02:40.730  -->  00:02:45.730
and then you just have to use kubectl config use-context
57

57

00:02:46.250  -->  00:02:47.490
and then the name of the context.
58

58

00:02:47.490  -->  00:02:50.030
It will switch you to that cluster.
59

59

00:02:50.030  -->  00:02:52.773
We switch now but I was already on this context.
60

60

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:55.870
So this is only if you have multiple context.
61

61

00:02:55.870  -->  00:02:58.100
If you use minikube earlier
62

62

00:02:58.100  -->  00:03:00.650
or you already have the cluster installed earlier.
63

63

00:03:00.650  -->  00:03:04.620
Now I can start using it, kubectl get nodes.
64

64

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:06.360
I have one node.
65

65

00:03:06.360  -->  00:03:07.617
Let's try to run a pod.
66

66

00:03:08.860  -->  00:03:11.690
I will run kubectle run hello-kubernetes,
67

67

00:03:11.690  -->  00:03:14.863
and I'm going to use echoserver port 8080.
68

68

00:03:15.890  -->  00:03:17.690
Deployment hello-kubernetes created.
69

69

00:03:20.150  -->  00:03:22.790
Kubectl expose deployment hello-kubernetes type NodePort.
70

70

00:03:22.790  -->  00:03:25.156
I'm creating a service so they can
71

71

00:03:25.156  -->  00:03:27.135
access this hello-kubernetes,
72

72

00:03:27.135  -->  00:03:28.376
so this is just a test.
73

73

00:03:28.376  -->  00:03:30.183
I will explain you in the coming lectures
74

74

00:03:30.183  -->  00:03:31.030
what this all means,
75

75

00:03:31.030  -->  00:03:33.381
just to see whether the cluster is working.
76

76

00:03:33.381  -->  00:03:38.381
I should now be able to connect to this service,
77

77

00:03:40.600  -->  00:03:44.163
get service hello-kubernetes.
78

78

00:03:45.570  -->  00:03:48.920
And I should now be able to go to my browser
79

79

00:03:48.920  -->  00:03:52.120
on localhost and this port I should be able to connect.
80

80

00:03:52.120  -->  00:03:57.120
Localhost and this port and this just gives me a response.
81

81

00:03:57.240  -->  00:04:01.960
So this is my request, request_uri localhost 8080,
82

82

00:04:01.960  -->  00:04:04.120
that's what my pod is running on.
83

83

00:04:04.120  -->  00:04:07.110
So if you get this then your kubernetes install
84

84

00:04:07.110  -->  00:04:09.600
is properly working and you just created
85

85

00:04:09.600  -->  00:04:10.650
your first application,
86

86

00:04:10.650  -->  00:04:13.520
your first pod on kubernetes.
87

87

00:04:13.520  -->  00:04:15.790
So the next lectures I will go in a bit more detail
88

88

00:04:15.790  -->  00:04:17.520
what all these things mean.
89

89

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:20.010
This is definitely a good alternative to minikube
90

90

00:04:20.010  -->  00:04:22.170
if you don't get minikube running or you just want to use
91

91

00:04:22.170  -->  00:04:24.560
only docker client with kubernetes
92

92

00:04:24.560  -->  00:04:26.793
and then you only have to install one package.
