00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.210
<v Edward>Now that I've shown you how to use</v>
2

2

00:00:02.210  -->  00:00:03.970
ingress controller, I want to show you
3

3

00:00:03.970  -->  00:00:06.193
how to use external DNS.
4

4

00:00:07.050  -->  00:00:08.600
In the previous lecture, I explained to you
5

5

00:00:08.600  -->  00:00:10.713
how to setup an ingress controller.
6

6

00:00:11.580  -->  00:00:13.433
On the public cloud providers, you can use
7

7

00:00:13.433  -->  00:00:17.830
ingress controller to reduce the cost of your LoadBalancers.
8

8

00:00:17.830  -->  00:00:20.070
You can use one LoadBalancer that captures all
9

9

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:23.420
the external traffic and send it to the ingress controller.
10

10

00:00:23.420  -->  00:00:26.303
This as opposed to use many LoadBalancers,
11

11

00:00:26.303  -->  00:00:28.620
one for every app.
12

12

00:00:28.620  -->  00:00:30.560
The ingress controller can be configured
13

13

00:00:30.560  -->  00:00:33.030
to route the different traffic to all your apps
14

14

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:36.343
based on HTTP rules, hosts and prefixes.
15

15

00:00:37.210  -->  00:00:41.190
This only works for HTTP or HPS-based applications.
16

16

00:00:41.190  -->  00:00:45.040
So you need to be able to apply rules based on
17

17

00:00:45.040  -->  00:00:46.800
hosts and prefixes.
18

18

00:00:46.800  -->  00:00:49.630
If your app doesn't do HTTP or HPS
19

19

00:00:49.630  -->  00:00:51.330
then you cannot use this approach.
20

20

00:00:52.280  -->  00:00:55.433
Then you just create a new LoadBalancer for that app.
21

21

00:00:56.820  -->  00:01:00.896
One great tool to enable such approach is external DNS.
22

22

00:01:00.896  -->  00:01:02.580
This tool will automatically
23

23

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:04.507
create the necessary DNS records
24

24

00:01:04.507  -->  00:01:09.453
in your external DNS server, like for example, route 53.
25

25

00:01:10.289  -->  00:01:13.941
For every hostname that you use in ingress,
26

26

00:01:13.941  -->  00:01:16.330
it'll create a new record
27

27

00:01:16.330  -->  00:01:19.050
to send traffic to your load balancer.
28

28

00:01:19.050  -->  00:01:20.650
So it'll create this new record
29

29

00:01:20.650  -->  00:01:24.400
in your DNS server like route53.
30

30

00:01:24.400  -->  00:01:25.940
So that's what you're using when you host them
31

31

00:01:25.940  -->  00:01:27.510
in your ingress control.
32

32

00:01:27.510  -->  00:01:29.790
This hostname will be automatically created
33

33

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:33.213
and will be routed to the LoadBalancer to your ingress.
34

34

00:01:34.310  -->  00:01:36.980
The major cloud DNS providers are supported.
35

35

00:01:36.980  -->  00:01:41.160
Google Cloud DNS, route53, Azure DNS, Cloudflare,
36

36

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:42.974
Digital Ocean and so on.
37

37

00:01:42.974  -->  00:01:45.277
All the setups are also possible
38

38

00:01:45.277  -->  00:01:47.250
without ingress controllers.
39

39

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:49.990
For example, directly on the host's part
40

40

00:01:49.990  -->  00:01:53.150
or using the node ports.
41

41

00:01:53.150  -->  00:01:54.800
The node port is still a work in progress,
42

42

00:01:54.800  -->  00:01:56.073
but it will be out soon.
43

43

00:01:57.066  -->  00:02:00.990
Let me show you how the external DNS works with a diagram.
44

44

00:02:00.990  -->  00:02:03.690
So we have the internet, we have two bolts
45

45

00:02:03.690  -->  00:02:05.360
in our connect cluster,
46

46

00:02:05.360  -->  00:02:07.610
we have the NGINX controller in one spot
47

47

00:02:07.610  -->  00:02:09.788
and the external DNS in another spot.
48

48

00:02:09.788  -->  00:02:12.900
We have one service in front of our ingress
49

49

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:14.830
and that service looks like LoadBalancer.
50

50

00:02:14.830  -->  00:02:17.170
So that service sprung up the a list load balancer
51

51

00:02:17.170  -->  00:02:18.703
on the left here.
52

52

00:02:18.703  -->  00:02:22.359
We're going to add a few ingress rules.
53

53

00:02:22.359  -->  00:02:25.340
There are three rules and these rules
54

54

00:02:25.340  -->  00:02:28.442
will be led by NGINX ingress controller.
55

55

00:02:28.442  -->  00:02:32.980
The external DNS tool will also read through those rules
56

56

00:02:32.980  -->  00:02:35.940
and we'll see that it will create DNS records
57

57

00:02:35.940  -->  00:02:39.093
for host X, example company host Y, example.
58

58

00:02:40.226  -->  00:02:43.484
So external DNS will create those records
59

59

00:02:43.484  -->  00:02:45.410
in a rotation tree.
60

60

00:02:45.410  -->  00:02:47.807
For example can be any DNS provider.
61

61

00:02:47.807  -->  00:02:51.409
So that host x and host y are going to point
62

62

00:02:51.409  -->  00:02:53.830
to the a list LoadBalancer.
63

63

00:02:53.830  -->  00:02:55.959
Then the client comes in,
64

64

00:02:55.959  -->  00:02:58.146
is going to go to a list these three
65

65

00:02:58.146  -->  00:03:01.100
to get the IP address or the host name.
66

66

00:03:01.100  -->  00:03:03.610
For example, host x, example to come.
67

67

00:03:03.610  -->  00:03:06.260
Route53 will apply the IP address.
68

68

00:03:06.260  -->  00:03:08.837
The IP address will be off the LoadBalancer
69

69

00:03:08.837  -->  00:03:10.878
so it will connect the LoadBalancer.
70

70

00:03:10.878  -->  00:03:13.721
LoadBalancer will connect to the ingress service.
71

71

00:03:13.721  -->  00:03:16.980
Ingress service will redirect the traffic
72

72

00:03:16.980  -->  00:03:19.000
to the ingress controller.
73

73

00:03:19.000  -->  00:03:20.750
Ingress controller will read the rules
74

74

00:03:20.750  -->  00:03:24.683
and will see that it's the route this request to open one.
75

75

00:03:25.650  -->  00:03:28.890
So that's how it works in a nutshell with external DNS
76

76

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:31.400
with the NGINX ingress controller
77

77

00:03:31.400  -->  00:03:34.070
and an a list load balancer.
78

78

00:03:34.070  -->  00:03:36.723
This setup I will show you in the next demo.
