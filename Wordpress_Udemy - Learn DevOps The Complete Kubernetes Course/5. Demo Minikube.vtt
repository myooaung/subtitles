00:00:00.220  -->  00:00:01.200
<v Instructor>In this demo,</v>
2

2

00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:03.680
I'll show you how to do a local kubernetes setup
3

3

00:00:03.680  -->  00:00:04.993
using minikube.
4

4

00:00:08.490  -->  00:00:12.760
This is the kubernetes minikube GitHub URL.
5

5

00:00:12.760  -->  00:00:15.770
You'll find all the GitHub releases
6

6

00:00:15.770  -->  00:00:17.923
under releases right here.
7

7

00:00:19.340  -->  00:00:21.410
So here you can download manually
8

8

00:00:21.410  -->  00:00:23.903
the latest release of minikube.
9

9

00:00:24.960  -->  00:00:27.520
They have versions for macOS
10

10

00:00:27.520  -->  00:00:29.373
for windows and for Linux.
11

11

00:00:30.970  -->  00:00:33.980
The easiest way is to use a package manager.
12

12

00:00:33.980  -->  00:00:38.210
So if you go back to the minikube main URL,
13

13

00:00:38.210  -->  00:00:41.050
then below you have read me
14

14

00:00:41.050  -->  00:00:42.060
and in this read me,
15

15

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:44.160
you're gonna find a getting started guide.
16

16

00:00:46.920  -->  00:00:49.010
Using this getting started guide,
17

17

00:00:49.010  -->  00:00:52.393
you can install minikube for Linux, macOS or Windows.
18

18

00:00:53.730  -->  00:00:56.200
And I would recommend you to follow this guide
19

19

00:00:56.200  -->  00:00:58.810
to install minikube on your system
20

20

00:00:58.810  -->  00:01:01.770
because the guide splits out different options
21

21

00:01:01.770  -->  00:01:03.360
and depending on what OS
22

22

00:01:04.250  -->  00:01:06.350
and the version of OS you're running,
23

23

00:01:06.350  -->  00:01:08.650
you might have to go with a different option.
24

24

00:01:08.650  -->  00:01:12.840
So I'm going to show you this demo on macOS
25

25

00:01:14.140  -->  00:01:15.850
and a macOS is pretty straightforward,
26

26

00:01:15.850  -->  00:01:16.830
but if you're Windows
27

27

00:01:16.830  -->  00:01:20.023
I would just follow this guide to get it installed.
28

28

00:01:20.860  -->  00:01:24.280
So let's quickly go over the different options.
29

29

00:01:24.280  -->  00:01:26.050
Let's say that you're on Linux,
30

30

00:01:26.050  -->  00:01:27.990
you can just download and install minikube
31

31

00:01:27.990  -->  00:01:31.460
in use local, bin using this command.
32

32

00:01:31.460  -->  00:01:32.610
You will still have to install
33

33

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:35.030
the command line utility kubectl,
34

34

00:01:35.030  -->  00:01:37.460
which you can download from the kubernetes website.
35

35

00:01:37.460  -->  00:01:38.890
In my procedure document,
36

36

00:01:38.890  -->  00:01:42.170
you will find the URLs that you can use to download
37

37

00:01:42.170  -->  00:01:43.013
kubectl.
38

38

00:01:44.210  -->  00:01:48.400
So this for Linux, then for macros, you have two options.
39

39

00:01:48.400  -->  00:01:51.080
You can use brew, which is easiest way.
40

40

00:01:51.080  -->  00:01:52.790
It will automatically install
41

41

00:01:52.790  -->  00:01:55.160
the cube CTL command default for you,
42

42

00:01:55.160  -->  00:01:58.950
or it can use direct also using the curl command
43

43

00:01:58.950  -->  00:02:02.663
and extracted in user local bin minikube.
44

44

00:02:03.690  -->  00:02:05.960
And then you have the windows option.
45

45

00:02:05.960  -->  00:02:10.090
And with windows, you can download the minikube installer,
46

46

00:02:10.090  -->  00:02:11.800
which will install it for you.
47

47

00:02:11.800  -->  00:02:13.710
Or you can use a package manager,
48

48

00:02:13.710  -->  00:02:16.410
the chocolatey package manager.
49

49

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:18.090
If you don't have this yet,
50

50

00:02:18.090  -->  00:02:20.190
you can download this package manager from here
51

51

00:02:20.190  -->  00:02:21.350
and then run this command
52

52

00:02:21.350  -->  00:02:24.453
and it will install minikube for you.
53

53

00:02:25.490  -->  00:02:27.200
So the difficulty that will arise
54

54

00:02:27.200  -->  00:02:32.200
is that minikube will start a VM to run kubernetes in.
55

55

00:02:33.400  -->  00:02:35.320
So you cannot, and that is important.
56

56

00:02:35.320  -->  00:02:39.050
You cannot run minikube within a VM.
57

57

00:02:39.050  -->  00:02:40.963
It will spin up a VM itself.
58

58

00:02:42.330  -->  00:02:45.520
That means that you will have to choose a hypervisor.
59

59

00:02:45.520  -->  00:02:48.440
So on Windows and also on mic,
60

60

00:02:48.440  -->  00:02:50.350
you have different hypervisors.
61

61

00:02:50.350  -->  00:02:54.480
So on Windows, you can either use hyper-V or a virtualbox,
62

62

00:02:55.970  -->  00:02:57.750
and then using these commands here,
63

63

00:02:57.750  -->  00:03:01.950
you can see which hypervisor is installed on your system.
64

64

00:03:01.950  -->  00:03:03.990
So if you have a look here, for example,
65

65

00:03:03.990  -->  00:03:06.380
hyper-V will only work on windows 10
66

66

00:03:06.380  -->  00:03:08.940
Enterprise Pro or Education.
67

67

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:10.760
If you have the home edition,
68

68

00:03:10.760  -->  00:03:12.530
you will not be able to use hyper-V.
69

69

00:03:12.530  -->  00:03:14.520
You should use virtualBox.
70

70

00:03:14.520  -->  00:03:16.098
So then you download virtualBox
71

71

00:03:16.098  -->  00:03:19.083
and then you use minikube start VM driver, virtual box,
72

72

00:03:20.950  -->  00:03:24.800
and using this command, you can make it a default driver.
73

73

00:03:24.800  -->  00:03:29.210
So in general, home edition, virtualBox
74

74

00:03:29.210  -->  00:03:31.150
otherwise you can use hyper-V
75

75

00:03:31.150  -->  00:03:34.010
and with hyper-V you still might have to enable it
76

76

00:03:34.010  -->  00:03:35.060
as the administrator.
77

77

00:03:36.190  -->  00:03:39.270
So whether you will be able to run minikube,
78

78

00:03:39.270  -->  00:03:40.980
all depends on hypervisor.
79

79

00:03:40.980  -->  00:03:43.010
If you have troubles, launching minikube,
80

80

00:03:43.010  -->  00:03:45.700
it'll probably be a hypervisor issue.
81

81

00:03:45.700  -->  00:03:47.810
There are alternatives you can use for example,
82

82

00:03:47.810  -->  00:03:50.060
Docker for windows, Docker, for mac,
83

83

00:03:50.060  -->  00:03:52.643
if you have issues starting minikube.
84

84

00:03:53.660  -->  00:03:56.440
I also recommend to try minikube first,
85

85

00:03:56.440  -->  00:03:58.467
because it's such an easy way to get Kubernetes
86

86

00:03:58.467  -->  00:04:00.103
running on your system.
87

87

00:04:01.150  -->  00:04:05.170
So to summarize, getting started guide right here
88

88

00:04:05.170  -->  00:04:06.710
to install minikube.
89

89

00:04:06.710  -->  00:04:08.920
And then if you're not using a package manager,
90

90

00:04:08.920  -->  00:04:13.880
download Kubectl install kubectl, for Linux
91

91

00:04:13.880  -->  00:04:16.083
or mac or for windows.
92

92

00:04:17.090  -->  00:04:17.937
So for example, if you're on windows,
93

93

00:04:17.937  -->  00:04:20.487
you can download the latest version from this link.
94

94

00:04:21.530  -->  00:04:22.930
I also have in my procedure,
95

95

00:04:22.930  -->  00:04:26.163
documents links to the kubectl version.
96

96

00:04:27.010  -->  00:04:29.510
If you already have Docker for windows installed,
97

97

00:04:29.510  -->  00:04:32.040
then this will also have a kubectl version.
98

98

00:04:32.040  -->  00:04:34.500
Probably best to just type kubectl
99

99

00:04:34.500  -->  00:04:37.500
already in a PowerShell or a CMD on windows
100

100

00:04:37.500  -->  00:04:39.633
to see if you have kubectl available.
101

101

00:04:40.670  -->  00:04:42.510
Make sure that if you download the latest version
102

102

00:04:42.510  -->  00:04:47.250
of minikube, that you also have a new version of kubectl
103

103

00:04:47.250  -->  00:04:50.070
which means if you already have kubectl installed,
104

104

00:04:50.070  -->  00:04:51.780
you probably want to upgrade that one.
105

105

00:04:51.780  -->  00:04:53.160
Otherwise you can get some errors
106

106

00:04:53.160  -->  00:04:55.460
when you're trying to connect to your cluster.
107

107

00:04:56.530  -->  00:04:59.283
So let's try to set minikube up on my machine.
108

108

00:05:02.050  -->  00:05:04.190
So I'll just use brew
109

109

00:05:04.190  -->  00:05:07.317
because that's the easiest brew install, minikube.
110

110

00:05:09.140  -->  00:05:11.260
So if you are a macOS is going to be pretty easy
111

111

00:05:11.260  -->  00:05:12.970
to install minikube.
112

112

00:05:12.970  -->  00:05:16.060
It will also install the kubectl for me.
113

113

00:05:16.060  -->  00:05:18.363
So it will have minikube and the kubectl.
114

114

00:05:20.230  -->  00:05:22.890
Once this is done, and this command is exactly the same
115

115

00:05:22.890  -->  00:05:26.130
whether you are all windows, Mac, or Linux,
116

116

00:05:26.130  -->  00:05:27.593
you run minikube start.
117

117

00:05:31.000  -->  00:05:32.680
And if you are on windows,
118

118

00:05:32.680  -->  00:05:35.317
you might have to add the VM driver here.
119

119

00:05:36.479  -->  00:05:37.312
If you don't add,
120

120

00:05:37.312  -->  00:05:40.760
VM driver is going to automatically select one for you.
121

121

00:05:40.760  -->  00:05:44.370
So here it has automatically selected the hyper key driver
122

122

00:05:44.370  -->  00:05:46.840
and alternatives is virtualbox.
123

123

00:05:46.840  -->  00:05:48.610
So for me, it's going to use a hyperkit,
124

124

00:05:48.610  -->  00:05:50.310
but I could also use a virtualbox.
125

125

00:05:51.180  -->  00:05:53.723
Hyperkit is preferred over virtualbox on mac.
126

126

00:05:55.110  -->  00:05:58.460
So this is then going to set up hyperkits.
127

127

00:05:58.460  -->  00:06:01.053
So I need to give my root password of the machine.
128

128

00:06:03.970  -->  00:06:07.573
And then it's going to download the latest VM image.
129

129

00:06:09.500  -->  00:06:11.640
Now it's creating a new VM
130

130

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:16.000
and that's why we cannot run Minikube within our own VM.
131

131

00:06:16.000  -->  00:06:17.740
We need to run it on our whole system,
132

132

00:06:17.740  -->  00:06:19.240
so if your whole system is windows,
133

133

00:06:19.240  -->  00:06:22.200
then you need to run it on your windows machine,
134

134

00:06:22.200  -->  00:06:26.450
because it will create a VM virtual machine itself.
135

135

00:06:26.450  -->  00:06:31.210
So all our kubernetes processes will run in this VM
136

136

00:06:31.210  -->  00:06:33.123
that minikube is creating.
137

137

00:06:34.670  -->  00:06:38.080
So now it is preparing kubernetes one 17 zero
138

138

00:06:38.080  -->  00:06:41.010
on Docker, 19 zero three five.
139

139

00:06:41.010  -->  00:06:43.360
So because we are using kubernetes one 17,
140

140

00:06:43.360  -->  00:06:46.350
you also want to make sure that your kubectl version
141

141

00:06:46.350  -->  00:06:48.530
is also on one 17.
142

142

00:06:48.530  -->  00:06:50.663
So if I just opened another window,
143

143

00:06:53.145  -->  00:06:54.913
kubectl version,
144

144

00:06:55.960  -->  00:06:58.190
and I can also see that my kubectl
145

145

00:06:58.190  -->  00:07:01.440
is version one 17 one 17 zero.
146

146

00:07:01.440  -->  00:07:03.770
So this one will definitely be compatible
147

147

00:07:03.770  -->  00:07:07.103
with the communities that I'm running within minikube.
148

148

00:07:09.190  -->  00:07:10.800
So then once it starts,
149

149

00:07:10.800  -->  00:07:15.620
the VM is going to use kubeadm to set up my cluster.
150

150

00:07:15.620  -->  00:07:17.470
I also have at the end of this course,
151

151

00:07:17.470  -->  00:07:19.910
some kubeadm lectures,
152

152

00:07:19.910  -->  00:07:23.720
where we use kubeadm manually to serve communities
153

153

00:07:23.720  -->  00:07:26.773
on a couple of VMs within the cloud.
154

154

00:07:28.100  -->  00:07:30.360
So if you want to do it completely manual
155

155

00:07:30.360  -->  00:07:33.163
on a virtual machine, you can use kubeadm for that.
156

156

00:07:34.120  -->  00:07:37.202
Then it's pulling the images, launching communities,
157

157

00:07:37.202  -->  00:07:40.403
waiting for cluster to come online and now it is done.
158

158

00:07:41.951  -->  00:07:44.920
minikube also says that it has configured kubectl
159

159

00:07:44.920  -->  00:07:45.990
to use minikube,
160

160

00:07:45.990  -->  00:07:49.940
so that basically means that it created a conflict for us,
161

161

00:07:49.940  -->  00:07:51.270
where in this conflict
162

162

00:07:51.270  -->  00:07:55.133
It is in our home directory in dot kube config.
163

163

00:07:57.950  -->  00:08:00.850
So minikube set this up for us.
164

164

00:08:00.850  -->  00:08:03.680
It set up the certificate, the server,
165

165

00:08:03.680  -->  00:08:08.220
so now we can connect to this server using kubecdl
166

166

00:08:08.220  -->  00:08:10.713
to execute kubernetes commands.
167

167

00:08:12.170  -->  00:08:13.920
So let's have a look again at the documentation,
168

168

00:08:13.920  -->  00:08:15.430
which has some example commands
169

169

00:08:15.430  -->  00:08:18.913
that we can run to test whether our cluster is running.
170

170

00:08:21.580  -->  00:08:24.581
So here we have the link examples,
171

171

00:08:24.581  -->  00:08:26.630
minikube start that we did.
172

172

00:08:26.630  -->  00:08:29.490
If you want, you can run a minikube dashboard
173

173

00:08:29.490  -->  00:08:32.490
to see a dashboard we're gonna skip that for now.
174

174

00:08:32.490  -->  00:08:34.490
I have some lectures later on dashboard,
175

175

00:08:35.630  -->  00:08:38.300
and then you can do kubectl create deployment,
176

176

00:08:38.300  -->  00:08:42.150
hello-mini cube, which is going to create a deployment.
177

177

00:08:42.150  -->  00:08:45.600
Using the echo server image
178

178

00:08:45.600  -->  00:08:48.100
its just a test image to see whether it's working.
179

179

00:08:49.640  -->  00:08:52.710
And then we go to expose it this service as a NodePort,
180

180

00:08:52.710  -->  00:08:55.140
I will explain later on what NodePort means.
181

181

00:08:55.140  -->  00:08:56.860
Now we're just going to copy paste these commands,
182

182

00:08:56.860  -->  00:08:58.820
see whether our cluster is working.
183

183

00:08:58.820  -->  00:09:02.110
And then later on, I will explain in depth,
184

184

00:09:02.110  -->  00:09:03.283
what it all means?
185

185

00:09:06.520  -->  00:09:09.720
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube,
186

186

00:09:09.720  -->  00:09:11.003
deployment is created.
187

187

00:09:12.760  -->  00:09:16.430
So now it created a service so they can reach
188

188

00:09:17.630  -->  00:09:20.393
my hello minikube deployment,
189

189

00:09:21.450  -->  00:09:23.040
and because this is now all created
190

190

00:09:23.040  -->  00:09:25.820
in a Coobernetti's within the cluster.
191

191

00:09:25.820  -->  00:09:29.150
I now also need to enter a command to know the IP address
192

192

00:09:29.150  -->  00:09:34.150
and a port where I can connect on to reach this service.
193

193

00:09:34.290  -->  00:09:36.543
So minikube service hello-minikube,
194

194

00:09:38.410  -->  00:09:39.580
and this one's pretty quick,
195

195

00:09:39.580  -->  00:09:42.470
but it actually opened a browser window
196

196

00:09:42.470  -->  00:09:45.240
and it immediately went to the correct URL.
197

197

00:09:45.240  -->  00:09:47.390
So let's have a look at the terminal first.
198

198

00:09:49.290  -->  00:09:52.550
So we have the namespace default namespace name,
199

199

00:09:52.550  -->  00:09:54.060
hello-mini cube.
200

200

00:09:54.060  -->  00:09:55.990
And then the URL that we have.
201

201

00:09:55.990  -->  00:09:58.680
So this is the NodePort that has been opened
202

202

00:09:58.680  -->  00:10:02.870
on this IP address of my virtual machine.
203

203

00:10:02.870  -->  00:10:06.430
So you see here server 192.168.64.8.8443
204

204

00:10:09.350  -->  00:10:11.690
which is the Kubernetes API server.
205

205

00:10:11.690  -->  00:10:13.470
Now it creates another port.
206

206

00:10:13.470  -->  00:10:15.063
It opened another port,
207

207

00:10:16.510  -->  00:10:19.860
the NotePort where then my service is reachable on.
208

208

00:10:19.860  -->  00:10:20.840
So then it says
209

209

00:10:20.840  -->  00:10:24.450
opening service default/hello-minikube in a default browser.
210

210

00:10:24.450  -->  00:10:27.493
Then it opens within my browser, this URL.
211

211

00:10:29.430  -->  00:10:33.810
And this is exactly what the echo serve is returning.
212

212

00:10:33.810  -->  00:10:36.190
The echo server just returned some information
213

213

00:10:36.190  -->  00:10:37.820
about the request.
214

214

00:10:37.820  -->  00:10:39.710
So we have the client values
215

215

00:10:39.710  -->  00:10:42.410
server views and the headers received.
216

216

00:10:42.410  -->  00:10:44.010
There was nobody in the request.
217

217

00:10:46.440  -->  00:10:47.530
When you are finished with a lab
218

218

00:10:47.530  -->  00:10:48.900
and you want to stop minikube,
219

219

00:10:48.900  -->  00:10:51.260
you can just run minikube stop,
220

220

00:10:51.260  -->  00:10:54.253
and this will then stop the minikube VM.
221

221

00:10:55.580  -->  00:10:56.880
If you did something wrong
222

222

00:10:57.870  -->  00:10:59.910
and you want to completely destroy your VM,
223

223

00:10:59.910  -->  00:11:02.650
you can use minikube delete,
224

224

00:11:02.650  -->  00:11:06.533
and this will then delete the VM completely,
225

225

00:11:07.510  -->  00:11:09.110
and then when you can do minikube start,
226

226

00:11:09.110  -->  00:11:10.960
it will start a new VM.
227

227

00:11:10.960  -->  00:11:12.520
You don't have to delete it all the time.
228

228

00:11:12.520  -->  00:11:15.420
Only when something major and drunk and you cannot recover
229

229

00:11:15.420  -->  00:11:17.210
or completely finished with minikube,
230

230

00:11:17.210  -->  00:11:19.060
You wanna make sure that you don't have
231

231

00:11:19.060  -->  00:11:20.343
the VM installed anymore.
232

232

00:11:21.550  -->  00:11:25.060
Then you can use minikube delete to delete a cluster
233

233

00:11:25.060  -->  00:11:28.177
and delete the profile from your kube config.
234

234

00:11:30.130  -->  00:11:31.870
So that's it for minikube.
235

235

00:11:31.870  -->  00:11:33.870
minikube is a very powerful tool
236

236

00:11:33.870  -->  00:11:36.960
that you can use to test with kubernetes
237

237

00:11:36.960  -->  00:11:40.283
and deploy on Kubernetes using your local machine.
238

238

00:11:41.480  -->  00:11:44.300
It might be a bit tricky to set up for a first time,
239

239

00:11:44.300  -->  00:11:47.180
especially on windows, but once it is set up,
240

240

00:11:47.180  -->  00:11:48.883
it is pretty easy to use.
