00:01.840 --> 00:09.040
Now to use group transitions, I'll add a new horizontal line here and then I want to output an unordered list,

00:09.220 --> 00:14.590
I'll add the list group class which just gives this some nice bootstrap styling

00:14.590 --> 00:21.790
and then my list item with the list group item class here, again just to have a nice style being applied

00:21.790 --> 00:23.380
to it, like this.

00:23.390 --> 00:27.370
So this is my list item and now I also need some data,

00:27.460 --> 00:31.420
I will set up a simple array of numbers here because it's not really about the data, it's about the

00:31.420 --> 00:36.230
animations which shall be the number is 1, 3, 4, 5 let's say

00:36.820 --> 00:46.250
and I want to loop through them of course, so I will add v-for and loop through my number in numbers, like this

00:46.270 --> 00:50.000
and the output the number here with string interpolation.

00:50.170 --> 00:53.920
Having a look at this, we see this list down there, looks great

00:54.040 --> 01:01.000
and as we know it, now I want to add a way to add and delete items and then as a last step, we want to

01:01.010 --> 01:02.350
animate this.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.730
Now let's add a way to add and delete items first,

01:06.070 --> 01:17.360
here I will simply add a new button, button button primary which will get the add item caption and then

01:17.420 --> 01:23.810
upon clicking, I want to execute addItem, a method I have yet to add. And on the individual item, I want

01:23.810 --> 01:30.580
to add a click listener so that when I click on an item, I execute removeItem. Now for remove

01:30.610 --> 01:37.940
item, I need to know which item and to be able to know, I will adjust this code a bit, bringing it over multiple

01:37.940 --> 01:38.590
lines too

01:38.610 --> 01:43.450
so that this is easier to read and I will get more arguments than just one,

01:43.450 --> 01:47.650
we learned this, we can always retrieve the index of the current iteration like this

01:47.840 --> 01:52.640
and then I can pass this index like this to know which items shall be removed.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.750
Now I get these two methods

01:53.750 --> 01:55.610
I don't have set up right now,

01:55.760 --> 02:02.300
so let's set them up next to make this work, though before doing so, I will add some style here to make

02:02.300 --> 02:07.730
the cursor a pointer, so that when we hover over them, we can see that we actually can click them or should

02:07.730 --> 02:09.410
be able to click them.

02:09.410 --> 02:11.460
Now let's add the two methods here,

02:11.630 --> 02:17.780
the two methods are addItem which doesn't take an argument and then removeItem which has the index

02:17.780 --> 02:19.690
of the item as an argument.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.620
Now removing is very simple,

02:21.680 --> 02:24.070
I simply get my numbers array,

02:24.110 --> 02:30.200
this is the property I set up here in my data which is just an array and then with the splice method, I

02:30.200 --> 02:37.340
can edit this existing array to remove item, for example and I want to remove an item at the index and

02:37.340 --> 02:41.530
then only one item to remove just the item at this index.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.870
This is how I remove an item

02:43.900 --> 02:48.260
and we can already see this in action, if I now click on an item, it's gone.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.150
And then for adding an item, I went to randomize this,

02:53.150 --> 03:00.890
so I want to get a position which I'll determine randomly with math.floor to get a full integer and

03:00.890 --> 03:02.110
then math.random

03:02.150 --> 03:06.410
which gives me a random number between 0 and .9999

03:06.830 --> 03:13.880
and this multiplied with the current length of my array will give me together with math.floor some number

03:13.880 --> 03:21.620
between 0 and the highest indexes of the last item in this array, which is exactly what I want to have

03:21.620 --> 03:23.750
a position to add it at.

03:23.870 --> 03:29.540
And then I can simply use the splice method here too because it can not only be used for removing elements

03:29.960 --> 03:35.450
but instead I want to start splicing at the position here, don't remove any element which is why I pass

03:35.450 --> 03:36.970
0 as the second argument

03:37.130 --> 03:43.210
but then splice also has a third argument which allows me to add a new element to this array at this position

03:43.230 --> 03:47.780
then. So here I want to add this.numbers.length plus 1,

03:47.780 --> 03:52.510
this is important so that I don't add a number which are currently as part of the array.

03:52.600 --> 03:58.250
Now we can see this in action by simply starting to add here and you see these numbers like the 7 here

03:58.310 --> 04:00.390
are added in random places,

04:00.500 --> 04:00.900
nice.

04:00.900 --> 04:08.450
The last thing is I want to add a horizontal line after some breaks, after the button here so that we

04:08.450 --> 04:11.750
do have a nice separation here, some distance in between

04:11.930 --> 04:15.980
and now I want to animate both the addition and deletion of items.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.730
This is what I'll work on next.
