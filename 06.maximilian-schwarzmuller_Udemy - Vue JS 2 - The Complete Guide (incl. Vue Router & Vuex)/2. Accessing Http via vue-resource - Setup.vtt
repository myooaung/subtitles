WEBVTT

00:01.580 --> 00:08.590
Now for accessing http, the first important thing to realize is you saw it throughout the course, vuejs is

00:08.600 --> 00:15.060
normal javascript code, you can mix it or you can embed in your normal javascript code flow

00:15.410 --> 00:20.690
and that allows you to use any of your favorite ajax libraries.

00:20.690 --> 00:24.650
So if you want to use jQuery's ajax function, do it,

00:24.650 --> 00:32.720
if you get some other jQuery, excuse me, some other Ajax library which allows you to send http request in the

00:32.720 --> 00:34.500
way you want to send them, do it,

00:34.540 --> 00:39.280
use it like that and you are fine to use it in your vuejs code too.

00:39.350 --> 00:46.970
Now I will show you a special package written for vuejs which makes making http requests very easy

00:46.970 --> 00:52.490
which closely embeds into your vue instance and gives you some other nice features,

00:52.490 --> 00:57.260
it's called vue resource and we'll have a look at it in this video.

00:57.260 --> 01:02.840
The package I'll be using, vue resource can be found by googling, simply google for vue resource and

01:02.840 --> 01:10.180
you should find this official github repository, there you will also find installation, steps for different

01:10.180 --> 01:10.510
set up,

01:10.510 --> 01:15.910
so for example by simply using a CDN if you want to dump it into your index.html file or if you want

01:15.910 --> 01:21.220
to install it with npm like we will do in our webpack project where we manage all our dependencies

01:21.220 --> 01:26.110
and bundle everything with webpack and then you also see some examples and the documentation here, and

01:26.110 --> 01:31.120
I can only recommend diving into that documentation, though of course I will guide you through the most

01:31.120 --> 01:37.390
important parts here in this module but it's always nice to really understand what's going on and to

01:37.390 --> 01:38.840
dive in deeper.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.810
So as we're going to use,

01:40.840 --> 01:44.100
let's start by installing it into our project.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.690
Now I already have a brand new project set up,

01:46.690 --> 01:51.880
it starts as all my projects started here in the last modules, it's empty,

01:51.880 --> 01:57.580
the only thing I do have is some bootstrap classes in the app.vue file and hence I also do import

01:57.670 --> 02:01.060
bootstrap here in the index.html file, that is all.

02:01.090 --> 02:04.320
Now since I want to install vue resource here,

02:04.510 --> 02:10.590
I'm not going to use the CDN but instead, I want to install it via npm and let webpack bundle this

02:10.600 --> 02:11.830
then in the end,

02:11.920 --> 02:19.120
so let the webpack handle this. To do so, I can simply type npm install and then if we have a look, vue resource

02:19.390 --> 02:27.730
though I will also add save to make sure it's installed as a production dependency, vue resource like

02:27.730 --> 02:28.650
this.

02:28.660 --> 02:35.380
Now what this will do is pull it down and load it or store it into my node modules folder which is

02:35.380 --> 02:39.410
hidden by my IDE but which does exist here too in this project,

02:39.610 --> 02:42.640
and once it is installed, looks good no errors,

02:42.910 --> 02:51.160
I have to add it or I have to configure it and add it to my stack here or through my application to be able

02:51.160 --> 02:52.450
to use it.

02:52.450 --> 02:57.490
Now this is done by using a new method on the global vue object,

02:57.740 --> 03:06.790
I can use vue and then use, now use basically tells vuejs to add a plugin to the core

03:06.790 --> 03:08.140
vuejs functionality,

03:08.140 --> 03:10.610
so the core functionality is now extended

03:10.840 --> 03:17.530
and the thing I want to use is vue resource. As a side note you can find these steps here too, if

03:17.530 --> 03:24.100
you scroll down to configuration, there you will see that is how you should install it when using webpack

03:24.190 --> 03:26.670
and there you see this vue use command.

03:26.860 --> 03:28.940
You also see that we need to import it,

03:29.050 --> 03:30.360
so let's quickly do that,

03:30.370 --> 03:31.960
I'll add it here,

03:31.960 --> 03:37.560
import vue resource from vue resource just like that

03:37.750 --> 03:42.340
and then we pass this newly imported vue resource as an argument to vue use

03:42.340 --> 03:48.970
and now it's enabled and we're able to access all the methods vue resource gives us directly on our

03:48.970 --> 03:54.940
vue instance and I will show you in the next videos where we can then actually start setting up our little

03:54.940 --> 03:58.240
test application here and send http requests.
