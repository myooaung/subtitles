Registering a local directive is easy,

00:04.470 --> 00:10.110
so here in my app.vue file where I have this instance, I can register a local directive and I can

00:10.110 --> 00:14.000
do that in every component by adding the directives property.

00:14.220 --> 00:21.240
You know we already had components, like this to register local components, well it works the same for

00:21.240 --> 00:22.860
directives. Here

00:22.860 --> 00:25.330
I then have the name of the directive

00:25.560 --> 00:32.150
and this can be a string like local highlight for example or of course the camel case version of

00:32.200 --> 00:37.050
that, again you will attach this by adding v- this name.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.930
Now here this is again an object,

00:38.940 --> 00:45.490
so just like on the global directive, the second argument, this is the value we pass to this key here

00:45.750 --> 00:51.840
and there, we will again have bind, this is the major hook we use to set up what our directive should

00:51.840 --> 00:53.160
do typically.

00:53.160 --> 00:59.910
Here again, I get my data, my binding, my vnode and the element and then I want to basically set it

00:59.970 --> 01:01.750
up as my global directive

01:01.770 --> 01:04.170
but add more features to it.

01:04.170 --> 01:09.630
So first of all, I will copy the code of my global directive here with the set timeout and so on, with

01:09.630 --> 01:11.160
that modifier,

01:11.190 --> 01:12.700
all these things.

01:12.990 --> 01:20.080
So I will add another paragraph and here, I want to use v-local-highlight, that of course is the new

01:20.080 --> 01:24.240
name I chose down there and v- at the beginning is always needed.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.430
Now if I save this,

01:25.650 --> 01:28.410
we see that both should get red after three seconds,

01:28.410 --> 01:29.610
looks good.

01:29.610 --> 01:32.380
Now that is how I register a local directive,

01:32.400 --> 01:35.180
now let's work on it to add some extra features.
