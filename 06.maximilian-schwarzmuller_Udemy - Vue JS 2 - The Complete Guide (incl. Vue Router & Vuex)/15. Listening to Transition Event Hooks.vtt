00:02.140 --> 00:03.000
Thus far we used

00:03.000 --> 00:09.040
css, css transitions and animations to animate our elements in and out and to animate the

00:09.040 --> 00:11.010
transition between two elements.

00:11.050 --> 00:16.300
We can also use javascript because with javascript, we can of course also influence the style position

00:16.300 --> 00:20.270
and much more of such element or anything we want basically.

00:20.290 --> 00:24.310
Now vuejs allows us to also listen to certain events,

00:24.340 --> 00:29.740
this transition element, this transition element vuejs ships with emits.

00:29.770 --> 00:36.160
So this transition component we wrap our elements in emits some events at certain points of time and

00:36.160 --> 00:41.170
we can listen to these events to execute our own javascript code.

00:41.170 --> 00:45.650
Now the missing piece is to know which events are emitted at which point of time

00:45.790 --> 00:50.040
and here we see a similar pattern as with the css classes.

00:50.050 --> 00:57.070
We add our element and then we remove it and upon adding, we first have the beforeEnter hook,

00:57.130 --> 01:03.130
this is kind of comparable to the enter class being attached for one frame.

01:03.130 --> 01:09.400
Then right after we get the enter hook, this is where we would then typically play our animation, then

01:09.400 --> 01:10.680
we have after enter,

01:10.680 --> 01:17.740
this is new and this executed once the animation finished and important note, you can combine all that with

01:17.890 --> 01:19.420
css classes,

01:19.420 --> 01:25.660
you can also execute some other code in each of these hooks so that it's perfectly possible. And we have

01:25.660 --> 01:31.690
the after enter cancelled hook which is called whenever we kind of say change the condition which

01:31.690 --> 01:35.320
would add the element before the animation finished.

01:35.690 --> 01:40.750
Well and that here, we get the same hooks for leaving it or for moving it out, we got before leave,

01:40.960 --> 01:44.080
leave, after leave and after leave cancelled,

01:44.200 --> 01:46.250
these are the hooks we've got available.

01:46.420 --> 01:52.090
As I said, you can mix them with css, they get executed any ways. You can change the style of the element

01:52.090 --> 01:56.840
here or do something completely different or nothing at all like we did before.

01:57.010 --> 02:03.980
But now, let's have a look at how we can use these hooks to play a nice animation purely through javascript.
