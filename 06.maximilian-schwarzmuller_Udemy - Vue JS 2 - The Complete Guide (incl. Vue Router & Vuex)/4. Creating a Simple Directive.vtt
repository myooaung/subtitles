00:01.630 --> 00:06.390
So I'm back to my own directive and we just learned that we get these hooks to work with it,

00:06.460 --> 00:09.590
so let's implement the bind hook here, like a method,

00:09.640 --> 00:16.510
this is like a lifecycle method in a component but here in the directive. So bind as we learned gives

00:16.510 --> 00:20.680
us access to the element, to the binding and the virtual node.

00:21.040 --> 00:26.110
Now we won't need all the arguments here, I just wanted to list them and then let's say what I want

00:26.110 --> 00:32.440
to do here is I want to simply set the style of my element, the element here of course is the native

00:32.710 --> 00:37.870
html element so I have access to the style property, that's a normal javascript property of a built

00:37.900 --> 00:45.670
in html element and there, I want to set the background color to let's say green to start simple,

00:45.700 --> 00:49.590
we will soon update this to be more powerful.

00:49.810 --> 00:56.920
Well with that set up, I can go to my app.vue file and since it is a global directive with the highlight

00:57.040 --> 01:01.480
selector here, I can simply add v-highlight like this,

01:01.600 --> 01:06.360
no argument passed, no value passed, nothing at all, just like this.

01:06.370 --> 01:10.330
Now if I save this, you see it indeed has the green background

01:10.330 --> 01:13.600
so our directive is already working.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.540
Now of course it would be nice if we could manually control which color this should get,

01:18.550 --> 01:19.870
so we'll work on this next.
