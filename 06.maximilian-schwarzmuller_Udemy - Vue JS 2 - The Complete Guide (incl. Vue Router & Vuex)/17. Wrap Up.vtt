WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:08.330
So over this module, we added a lot of features which are typical to user authentication,

00:08.330 --> 00:16.250
all of them running in our vue application. We got this token which we fetch, which we get when signing

00:16.250 --> 00:22.760
out and signing in which we store in both vuex and the more persistent local storage, we get auto

00:22.760 --> 00:25.040
logout and login functionality,

00:25.250 --> 00:32.090
we got a UI that takes our authentication status into account by updating the header and blocking access

00:32.090 --> 00:34.280
to dashboard if we're not authenticated

00:34.520 --> 00:42.350
and with that we got a lot of useful features implemented into our application, into our demo application

00:42.350 --> 00:43.120
here.

00:43.220 --> 00:48.200
Now feel free to play around with that and enhance it adjust to your needs

00:48.290 --> 00:54.920
and of course add it to your next project because these are all powerful and very interesting features

00:55.280 --> 00:58.880
which you might need in a lot of web apps you're building.
