Over the last lectures, we learned a lot about controlled validation.

00:05.990 --> 00:13.760
Now it's always nice to show validation errors next to the controls but maybe we also want to disable

00:13.940 --> 00:21.440
the form submit button if we get any validation errors in our form.

00:21.450 --> 00:34.580
Now the hard way of doing that would be to bind disabled here to $v.email.$error and so on, to disable

00:34.580 --> 00:35.150
it

00:35.260 --> 00:36.800
if, excuse me, not AND but

00:36.830 --> 00:38.410
OR, to disable this

00:38.510 --> 00:47.720
if any of our control groups has an error. The quicker way conveniently is to just access $v.$error

00:47.900 --> 00:56.630
because that simply means if any of our validations here fails, then this error is set to true and this

00:56.630 --> 01:02.620
will be disabled and maybe we even want to set it to invalid to disable it right from the start

01:02.660 --> 01:07.890
and not only after the user started typing. If we now save this and we go back,

01:08.030 --> 01:12.590
we see that right at the start, the button is disabled and I can't click it,

01:12.840 --> 01:17.030
we can also confirm this in the console, can't click it, nothing happens.

01:17.030 --> 01:22.170
I have to enter valid data into all of these fields,

01:22.390 --> 01:23.950
so let me quickly do that,

01:24.900 --> 01:28.780
accept and add hobbies

01:31.720 --> 01:33.340
and only after I did this

01:33.460 --> 01:35.790
I can click submit. Now

01:35.800 --> 01:42.910
this simply fails because I submitted an email address which is already taken on the backend, we don't

01:42.910 --> 01:45.060
have to care about this here,

01:45.070 --> 01:50.050
the validation worked and this obviously is what this module is about. Though

01:50.050 --> 01:52.420
this email address already taken

01:52.420 --> 01:54.300
thing is interesting.

01:54.460 --> 01:59.640
Wouldn't it be great if we warned the user right during validating his email address

01:59.690 --> 02:03.830
whether this is a valid email address or not or if it is already taken?

02:04.060 --> 02:10.090
Well let's dive into that and therefore into asynchronous validators in the next lecture.
