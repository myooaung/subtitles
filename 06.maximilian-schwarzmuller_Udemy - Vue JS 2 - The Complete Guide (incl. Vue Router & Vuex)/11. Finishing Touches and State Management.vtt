00:01.770 --> 00:08.250
Well I want to pass the quote count and the number, maximum number of quotes. I do both have in my app.vue file,

00:08.340 --> 00:12.020
max quotes is hardcoded and I do have my quotes array,

00:12.270 --> 00:18.540
so I can simply pass this by pass saying quote count, this is the name

00:18.570 --> 00:31.270
I gave the prop in here and setting this equal to quotes, my array length and max quotes can simply be

00:31.270 --> 00:32.320
max quotes,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.030
this is what I named it down here too.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.620
But then I'm passing the relevant data

00:36.880 --> 00:41.160
and if I save this, we already see this works fine,

00:41.170 --> 00:47.420
the fact that it has this smooth animation comes from the css classes used there, that's all bootstrap,

00:47.500 --> 00:49.610
nothing I programmed there.

00:49.750 --> 00:57.250
The last thing is that once I hit 10, I want to give myself a warning that I shall first delete an

00:57.250 --> 00:59.700
item before adding any more.

01:00.100 --> 01:07.540
Well to get this, I will simply go to the new quote method here and here, I will simply check if this quotes

01:08.320 --> 01:13.060
length is greater or equal the maximum quote number

01:13.600 --> 01:18.350
and if that is the case, well then I will return an alert

01:18.410 --> 01:23.820
where I say please delete quotes first.

01:23.990 --> 01:34.130
And with that in place, you can now see that if I add a couple of quotes here until I add the maximum, I get

01:34.130 --> 01:35.020
this warning

01:35.060 --> 01:40.720
and I have to delete some quotes before I can continue adding new ones.

01:40.730 --> 01:49.430
This is the finished application, using components to structure this nice looking app, using slots, passing

01:49.430 --> 01:53.570
data around, using a lot of the concepts we learned in the last modules,

01:53.570 --> 01:59.840
so I hope you now feel really confident using components, using all their features,

01:59.840 --> 02:05.990
seeing how they connect to all the other things we learned throughout the course like binding to styles and

02:05.990 --> 02:06.800
so on.

02:06.980 --> 02:10.910
And with that, we're well prepared to move on to the next course modules.
