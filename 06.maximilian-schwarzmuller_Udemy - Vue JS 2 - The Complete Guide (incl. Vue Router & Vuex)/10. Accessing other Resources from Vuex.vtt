00:02.300 --> 00:04.940
In the last lecture we learned how to store the token,

00:04.970 --> 00:06.240
let's now use it.

00:06.470 --> 00:10.860
We need it on that dashboard page for the outgoing request there,

00:10.880 --> 00:14.090
if we have a look at our dashboard.vue file, it's

00:14.140 --> 00:17.450
this get request which requires the token. First of all,

00:17.450 --> 00:20.790
I want to move that request into an action too,

00:20.840 --> 00:26.660
so in my store.js file, I'll add a third action next to login and dashboard

00:26.810 --> 00:31.270
and here, I would simply name that fetch user,

00:31.430 --> 00:33.110
you can name it whatever you want.

00:33.110 --> 00:37.940
There we will get this context object where we can get the commit method out of it

00:38.420 --> 00:43.160
and inside the action, I will use axios to get my user.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.860
We have to be careful here,

00:45.110 --> 00:53.060
the axios instance I import in the store.js file actually is the axios of instance which is the wrong one

00:53.060 --> 00:55.610
for fetching user data.

00:55.700 --> 01:03.440
Now to be even more precise, another problem we will face is that here I got some user data on firebase,

01:03.500 --> 01:04.380
on that URL 

01:04.460 --> 01:10.640
I want to reach out to in fetch user due to an earlier module where we added axios, 

01:10.850 --> 01:17.810
right now when signing up however, we never store something in our firebase database, we only sign a user

01:17.810 --> 01:21.290
up and that gets stored in some other database.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.970
So there are two things I want to do before we can use our token,

01:24.980 --> 01:27.750
the first is when we sign a user up,

01:27.770 --> 01:34.190
once we did successfully sign up in the then block, I want to dispatch another action and also store

01:34.250 --> 01:40.340
user data in the firebase database and not just in the firebase authentication database to which we

01:40.340 --> 01:41.930
have no access.

01:41.930 --> 01:48.050
The second thing I want to do is then fetch the user and for both storing and fetching user data outside

01:48.050 --> 01:52.420
of the firebase authentication world, we need to set a different base

01:52.430 --> 01:53.290
URL,

01:53.570 --> 01:56.990
we import the wrong axios instance

01:57.020 --> 02:00.190
so to say. Well that's no problem,

02:00.340 --> 02:08.510
we can still import the main axios instance to, I'll name it global axios from axios,

02:08.530 --> 02:10.330
you can give it any name you want

02:10.720 --> 02:16.370
and now local axios is the axios instance I will use for storing and fetching user data.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.990
Let's start with storing,

02:18.220 --> 02:27.190
I want to do this once we did sign up and I will quickly create a new action store user, there

02:27.220 --> 02:34.960
I want to extract the commit method like this and in store user, I will use my global axios instance,

02:35.170 --> 02:38.900
send a post request, send it to

02:38.920 --> 02:46.810
now we need that URL we have in the main.js file here, that that's automatically used as a

02:46.930 --> 02:48.780
starting URL,

02:48.790 --> 02:56.350
so now I only need to reach out to /users.json, as we did earlier, as we did at the beginning

02:56.350 --> 02:58.200
of this module too.

02:58.330 --> 03:06.850
So I now post my data here, the data I do want to post is data I expect to get here passed to this

03:06.850 --> 03:12.710
store user action, so I'll name it user data here and I just want to pass it on

03:12.970 --> 03:20.740
and then here we can also add a then block where I console log the response and a catch block for potential

03:20.800 --> 03:21.730
errors,

03:21.730 --> 03:24.730
so console log the error.

03:24.730 --> 03:34.560
Now this actually should be dispatched when we actually get the user data, so once we did authenticate.

03:34.630 --> 03:42.340
The good thing is this context object where we pull out commit also has the dispatch method as a property

03:42.340 --> 03:44.060
so we can pull this out too

03:44.290 --> 03:45.640
and once we did authenticate,

03:45.670 --> 03:52.300
so in this then block, I can not only commit our mutation because I can set the token, the user is

03:52.340 --> 03:54.340
authenticated at this point of time,

03:54.520 --> 03:57.700
I can also dispatch store user

03:57.760 --> 04:01.820
so this other action here and pass on my user data,

04:01.840 --> 04:07.830
so I'll simply pass on a javascript object where I want to pass all the user data we have.

04:08.170 --> 04:19.990
And here I will simply pass on auth data, that's the data I receive from my signup.vue file

04:20.160 --> 04:25.120
and here, auth data is basically this object,

04:25.140 --> 04:31.920
now I will change this to be my form data so that I get all this information. In my actions to avoid

04:31.920 --> 04:32.860
confusion,

04:32.880 --> 04:39.100
I still only submit the email and password from that bigger object here on signup

04:39.270 --> 04:45.450
but once we did sign up, I take advantage of the same auth data object which contains my overall form

04:45.450 --> 04:47.820
data to pass the overall form data,

04:47.820 --> 04:53.490
so the whole auth data object here on to store user. And in store user,

04:53.490 --> 04:58.800
I then use the global axios instance to post this data and store it in the database.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.550
Now let's see if that works

05:02.610 --> 05:12.240
and for that, I will actually first of all go back to firebase, to database there and then to rules and

05:12.240 --> 05:19.800
I will also switch write to this alternative rule where only authenticated users may write because the

05:19.800 --> 05:22.620
user should be authenticated at this point of time.

05:22.620 --> 05:30.630
Now if we go back to our application here and I click on sign up and use yet another e-mail address I

05:30.630 --> 05:32.180
haven't used before,

05:33.900 --> 05:39.960
you can enter whatever we want for all the other fields, doesn't really matter it's not checked right now,

05:40.210 --> 05:48.030
if I hit submit, I get an error for this post request even though authentication was successful.

05:48.290 --> 05:54.710
Well the reason for this of course is that I don't pass on my token, I'll do that in a second before

05:54.710 --> 05:55.520
I do that,

05:55.520 --> 06:03.890
let me quickly also use global axios in fetch user so that when I fetch the user, we also do that with

06:03.890 --> 06:06.280
the global axios instance

06:06.680 --> 06:09.700
and there I also want to store the user data in my store,

06:09.740 --> 06:16.600
so I'll add a user field which is null initially and then, I want to store the first user here.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.680
So I want to commit let's say store user,

06:21.680 --> 06:27.890
this mutation doesn't exist yet and I want to pass on users zero,

06:27.980 --> 06:34.850
I still have my old code which I set up in the axios module where I pull out data, transform the object

06:34.880 --> 06:38.160
I get back from firebase and create an array of users

06:38.300 --> 06:43.720
and then I only store the first user in the store, here in the vuex store.

06:43.820 --> 06:49.100
And that of course is not really a great app because the first user might not be the active user but here,

06:49.190 --> 06:52.920
I just want to demonstrate how we can access the database.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.890
So I'm storing this, I'm calling store user as a mutation,

06:57.050 --> 07:02.660
well obviously I need to create that mutation so store user is created here,

07:02.750 --> 07:05.120
it receives the state and the user

07:05.240 --> 07:14.140
and then I just want to set state user equal to user. Finally with that, I'll add a getter and in this getter,

07:14.270 --> 07:22.190
I want to get the user and for that in this user method where I also receive the state as an argument as

07:22.190 --> 07:23.110
you learned it,

07:23.120 --> 07:25.940
I just want to return state user,

07:25.940 --> 07:28.650
we can now use this getter in the dashboard.

07:28.970 --> 07:34.450
Let's use this getter here with a computed property in the dashboard component

07:34.940 --> 07:44.420
and here I will add a property named email and on there, I will return this store getters user and then

07:44.420 --> 07:48.470
there will be an email property on that user we stored in the store.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.320
If this went a little bit too fast,

07:50.390 --> 07:52.370
carefully move all through all these files,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.300
I'm just using vuex to store some data.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.630
None of that code will work though,

07:58.640 --> 08:03.760
now one reason why it won't work is that I never dispatch the fetch user action,

08:03.830 --> 08:08.600
so that's the first thing I'll actually do in the dashboard component in the created hook,

08:08.660 --> 08:16.250
I still want to access my store and dispatch fetch user but the main reason why none of that will work

08:16.370 --> 08:25.190
even if I change it like this, if I go to dashboard is of course that I as you can see by the unauthorized error,

08:25.190 --> 08:30.100
that I never attach this token to my requests.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.350
Now that is what I talked a lot about though,

08:32.370 --> 08:38.640
so let's finally do it in the next lecture and we'll then also take care about this other error we see

08:38.640 --> 08:38.890
here.
