WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.260
Well we've already achieved a lot here,

00:04.260 --> 00:06.810
we learned a lot about animations and transitions.

00:06.810 --> 00:12.660
Now before I come to animating groups of elements which we can't do right now, the best we can do is

00:12.660 --> 00:17.720
switch between two or multiple elements but only one may be displayed at all times.

00:17.720 --> 00:24.420
So before I come to a different component which allows us to animate different pieces or elements

00:24.420 --> 00:26.570
in our code at the same time,

00:26.700 --> 00:33.840
let me show you a different thing or a different part of vuejs which we may animate or which we may

00:33.840 --> 00:34.890
transition.

00:35.130 --> 00:38.850
We transition between different html elements right now

00:38.980 --> 00:45.000
but there's one thing we learned about in the component section which would be for perfect to transition

00:45.000 --> 00:45.810
between.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.330
I'm not talking about components because we could use them like normal html elements here,

00:50.400 --> 00:57.780
I'm talking about dynamic components. So dynamic components would also make up for a great transition

00:57.780 --> 00:58.560
task,

00:58.560 --> 00:59.900
now let's do this.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.450
For this I will first quickly add two new components,

01:04.620 --> 01:10.480
DangerAlert component and you might be able to guess what this will hold,

01:10.590 --> 01:17.910
it will hold a template where I will simply have a bootstrap class with alert and then

01:17.970 --> 01:19.530
alert-danger,

01:19.550 --> 01:21.950
this is dangerous maybe,

01:21.990 --> 01:30.880
whoops, dangerous and I don't need any scripts here because well I don't want to have any specific logic in there,

01:30.900 --> 01:37.590
I only want to have the template to demonstrate this and I will also have my success alert,

01:37.740 --> 01:40.160
let's say SuccessAlert.vue,

01:40.620 --> 01:45.780
so here we would then have our template where we say this is successful, like this.

01:45.780 --> 01:55.470
Now I get two new components and I want to switch between them here by having a look at my dynamic components,

01:55.740 --> 01:57.710
to use dynamic components,

01:57.720 --> 02:04.300
I first need to register them as components and I'll do this locally here in my vue instance.

02:04.320 --> 02:12.540
So I'll add my components key here to register both my danger alert which I need to import then and

02:12.570 --> 02:16.690
my success alert which I'll also need to import,

02:16.690 --> 02:20.040
so let me add these imports up here real quick.

02:20.040 --> 02:26.540
So here we need to import the danger alert from the DangerAlert.vue

02:26.550 --> 02:28.590
file and down there,

02:28.590 --> 02:35.160
we also want to import the success alert and that allows me to hook them up to my properties down there

02:35.160 --> 02:37.180
in the components object,

02:37.210 --> 02:42.190
here I will have the danger alert and of course also the success alert.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.030
Now both components are available,

02:45.030 --> 02:52.530
I will add a new property to my data object which is the selected component and by default, that

02:52.530 --> 03:00.110
shall be, let me also change these names to be appDangerAlert

03:00.130 --> 03:06.040
now that I think about it, that would be more in line to also have this app prefix.

03:06.040 --> 03:11.830
So here the selected component shall be app-success-alert with dashes in between

03:11.830 --> 03:16.780
because again, this is what vuejs enables us to use when setting up our property names like this

03:16.780 --> 03:18.260
down there.

03:18.290 --> 03:25.090
So now this is the default selected component for my dynamic component added with this component keyword and

03:25.090 --> 03:31.300
then with colon is dynamically bound to selected component, like that.

03:31.300 --> 03:36.540
Now I also want to add a button which allows me to switch between both,

03:36.760 --> 03:44.350
so here I will have my button with button, button primary and here I simply want to toggle my components,

03:44.350 --> 03:48.910
of course you could also use a drop down instead but I'm going to use it like this.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.450
And here I simply want to have a click listener

03:52.240 --> 04:02.760
where I check if selected component equals app-success-alert, if that is the case then I want a set selected

04:02.790 --> 04:10.600
component and now this is getting really long and I pull js for this, app-danger-alert otherwise separated

04:10.620 --> 04:11.860
with the colon here,

04:12.070 --> 04:20.120
I want to set selected component equal to app-success-alert.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.190
So this is really just toggling between the two components

04:23.200 --> 04:25.960
I'm importing here. Now

04:25.990 --> 04:29.680
if I go to the application, we can see this done here,

04:29.890 --> 04:31.520
I can switch between both

04:31.780 --> 04:37.720
and I should maybe go to my success alert and change this to alert-success to make it green,

04:37.810 --> 04:41.670
also add another horizontal line but now it really looks great.

04:41.920 --> 04:42.790
So this works,

04:42.790 --> 04:46.160
now I want to animate this. Now to animate it,

04:46.420 --> 04:54.040
I'll go back in my application and in here of course, I wrap this in a transition element like we learned

04:54.040 --> 04:54.910
before.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.520
So here, whoops, like this,

04:57.520 --> 05:04.500
what I want to do though is I now want to transition my component, my dynamic component.

05:04.680 --> 05:11.670
Now can you do this just by using name, fade for example again to use this fade animation I already set up

05:11.770 --> 05:19.290
and now if we load this again, we already see we get this working though, we get this ugly jump again

05:19.310 --> 05:24.830
so to avoid this, I'll again set the mode to out in as before

05:25.040 --> 05:30.440
and now we're able to use this just like we used the two divs before, but now this dynamic component,

05:30.530 --> 05:35.870
and here of course we could have multiple dynamic components because it will ensure that only one is

05:35.870 --> 05:41.480
loaded at a time and that's the only thing transition cares about, not between how many elements you're

05:41.570 --> 05:45.650
switching but that in the end, you're only displaying one at a time.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.670
Well we're going to leave this one at a time,

05:48.680 --> 05:54.350
so with the next videos though where we will have a look at how we can animate lists or generally,

05:54.440 --> 05:55.530
groups of items.
