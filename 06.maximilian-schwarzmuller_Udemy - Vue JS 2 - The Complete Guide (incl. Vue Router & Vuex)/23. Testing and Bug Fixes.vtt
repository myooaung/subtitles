00:01.660 --> 00:05.260
So in the last video, we created our action to get the data,

00:05.260 --> 00:11.500
we also added this set portfolio mutation to portfolio.js in the modules folder,

00:11.500 --> 00:13.480
now let's hook it up. In the header,

00:13.490 --> 00:21.040
I got my load data method and here, I want to call this load data action. To do so, I first need to get

00:21.040 --> 00:22.190
access to it,

00:22.210 --> 00:29.500
I already do map actions here so I can simply also map my load data action, though that will give us

00:29.500 --> 00:33.610
a problem we already had, the name here matches the name down there.

00:33.910 --> 00:38.870
So to prevent this from happening, I will instead map it again,

00:39.040 --> 00:50.040
so I will map randomize stocks to randomize stocks but I'll name the other fetch data here and map it to load

00:50.040 --> 00:55.660
data in my store, this allows me to here call this fetch data, like that.

00:55.680 --> 01:02.090
However this still will not do it because the action I set up here is exported but I never do import

01:02.090 --> 01:02.740
it,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.970
so I have to go to my store and here I need to import that,

01:06.990 --> 01:11.930
so import everything as actions from my actions file here,

01:11.940 --> 01:14.320
it's only one constant but it could be more

01:14.490 --> 01:17.400
and then I want to add it to my store as actions.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.000
Again the long form would be actions mapped to actions

01:20.010 --> 01:24.060
but since it's the names, for the same name I take the shorter form.

01:24.060 --> 01:29.700
Now with that let's go back to the application, we see our portfolio is empty here but on firebase we do

01:29.700 --> 01:31.250
have a stock portfolio,

01:31.500 --> 01:37.290
so if we load well nothing happens, it should change,

01:37.290 --> 01:41.720
we can see it that our funds get updated and our stock prices too,

01:41.880 --> 01:45.080
so somehow the portfolio is not loaded correctly,

01:45.180 --> 01:47.180
let's have a look at what's going wrong here.

01:48.680 --> 01:55.810
That was a very very tiny but very powerful mistake, here in the header where I saved data,

01:55.880 --> 02:00.980
I accidentally named the field where I saved my stock portfolio stock portdfolio,

02:01.040 --> 02:07.940
it should be portfolio of course, because by naming it wrongly here, I was not able to extract that here

02:07.940 --> 02:15.860
where I tried to access stock portfolio which doesn't exist. Well it should exist now by simply buying

02:15.860 --> 02:17.280
some stocks here,

02:18.060 --> 02:22.320
ending the day and saving this again and now reloading,

02:22.320 --> 02:27.930
we see the data was overwritten here of course on firebase server, so if I now hit load,

02:27.930 --> 02:30.020
we see now it gets loaded correctly,

02:30.030 --> 02:31.280
now we see it here.

02:31.290 --> 02:39.750
Now we can still end the day of course, sell this with a nice profit and always reload and go back.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.650
Now we really get all the things in place I wanted to put in place in this application,

02:45.720 --> 02:48.080
so let me wrap it up in the next video.
