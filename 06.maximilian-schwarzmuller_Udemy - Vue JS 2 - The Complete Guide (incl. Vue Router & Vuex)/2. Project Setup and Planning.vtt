WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:11.030
This is the starting set up I'm well starting with, it's the default set up we use throughout the course,

00:11.290 --> 00:16.580
it's the webpack simple template installed with the vue cli

00:16.580 --> 00:18.250
and I haven't added that much.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.650
The app.vue file is pretty empty,

00:20.650 --> 00:26.380
only added to this container div here with the bootstrap container class which I as always also added

00:26.390 --> 00:29.740
here as I import in my index html file.

00:29.780 --> 00:35.450
The main.js file is pretty much untouched so you can simply install the webpack symbol template

00:35.450 --> 00:37.760
and should get the same result.

00:37.760 --> 00:44.720
Now one thing we can do right away is since we're going to use vuex, we want to install this stage 2

00:44.780 --> 00:47.260
preset which gives us access to the spread

00:47.280 --> 00:49.010
operator, we're going to use that later on.

00:49.010 --> 00:56.940
So let's install it right away, with npm install --save dev as it's a development only dependency,

00:57.080 --> 01:07.940
we can install babel-preset-stage-2 and this will download it and once it is downloaded, we can go to

01:07.940 --> 01:12.710
the babelrc file and simply add it here to our presets,

01:12.740 --> 01:15.860
so here I want to add it to this array of presets,

01:15.890 --> 01:17.570
the stage 2 preset,

01:17.620 --> 01:20.030
this again unlocks this spread

01:20.030 --> 01:21.040
operator.

01:21.260 --> 01:24.170
Well besides that, we get everything we need

01:24.170 --> 01:29.830
and with that let's let's first think about how should our application be laid out.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.680
If you recall the app from the last video, the app we're going to build,

01:33.770 --> 01:39.680
we had a header so that certainly makes up for a good separate component and then we had basically three

01:39.680 --> 01:40.190
routes.

01:40.220 --> 01:43.280
We had this home page where we had the

01:43.490 --> 01:46.600
please go somewhere you have so much fun

01:47.240 --> 01:47.800
text,

01:47.810 --> 01:55.190
then we had the stocks page where we could buy stocks and then we had the portfolio page where we could

01:56.030 --> 01:59.520
look at our stocks and sell them of course.

01:59.570 --> 02:05.690
So these were the three pages we had plus the header, sounds like we at least need these four components,

02:05.690 --> 02:12.290
now for the individual stocks on the stocks and on the portfolio page, we're probably also needing some extra

02:12.290 --> 02:15.070
components or at least that makes sense to create them.

02:15.170 --> 02:21.180
You want to choose your components to be granular enough but you also don't want to make every button

02:21.820 --> 02:23.090
its own component,

02:23.120 --> 02:25.230
so kind of find the right balance there.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.390
So this would be the layout

02:26.450 --> 02:27.700
I have in mind

02:27.980 --> 02:34.220
and with that I'd say why don't we get started in the next video with setting up all these main components

02:34.220 --> 02:39.560
we can think of right now and then setting up the routing so that we can at least switch between them and then

02:39.560 --> 02:40.670
we go from there.

02:40.670 --> 02:41.730
Sounds like a plan,

02:41.870 --> 02:42.900
let's start with that.
