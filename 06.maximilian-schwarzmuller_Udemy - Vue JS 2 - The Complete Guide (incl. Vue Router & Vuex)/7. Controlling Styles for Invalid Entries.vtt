In the last lecture, we added some code to change the styling of the input when the user did enter something

00:09.650 --> 00:10.270
invalid

00:10.580 --> 00:16.850
and maybe you wondered whether you could control when this is marked as invalid because right now, it

00:16.910 --> 00:18.800
isn't at the start which is good

00:19.040 --> 00:23.120
but if I type one character, it's marked as invalid.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.090
Now you could argue that this also doesn't provide such a good user experience because it means that

00:28.090 --> 00:30.150
we already show error message

00:30.230 --> 00:36.740
once the user starts typing, even before he had a chance to enter a valid email address which simply

00:36.740 --> 00:39.150
isn't done by typing one character.

00:39.380 --> 00:43.330
Now of course you can control when this is invalidated,

00:43.640 --> 00:49.760
we did use the @input event here to fire this $touch event, we don't have to use

00:49.790 --> 00:50.610
@input here,

00:50.780 --> 00:56.900
we could use @blur, this now would only fire once the input loses focus.

00:56.900 --> 01:02.460
So now if we go back and reload this application, if I type one character,

01:02.600 --> 01:06.800
it's still not red, only if I click out of there it's marked as red.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.610
So this might be the user experience you maybe want to provide,

01:10.610 --> 01:14.070
now you can keep on typing as long as you want

01:14.240 --> 01:17.920
only if you leave this form with an invalid value,

01:17.960 --> 01:22.150
you're showing this error message and your error styles.

01:22.220 --> 01:27.000
So this is an alternative which I wanted to show you and it's not just blur,

01:27.200 --> 01:30.770
it all comes down to when you call 

01:30.770 --> 01:33.920
$touch, you can call this whenever you want.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.740
You could add a button which is not connected to this input which calls $touch for this email

01:39.740 --> 01:41.540
property on $v,

01:41.600 --> 01:49.430
you can call $touch whenever you feel that now is the right time to evaluate this input and

01:49.430 --> 01:52.040
that again is totally up to you.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.910
This is one of the cool features of the vuelidate package,

01:54.950 --> 01:56.690
you got a lot of control over it,

01:56.780 --> 01:59.530
you don't have to use the approaches shown here,

01:59.540 --> 02:05.330
you can fine tune this to your needs to really validate and potentially show errors

02:05.570 --> 02:08.190
at the point of time you do want to do that.
