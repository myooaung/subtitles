00:01.860 --> 00:06.280
So we saw how we could attach and detach css classes conditionally.

00:06.540 --> 00:11.350
What if you don't want to store this object here in your html template code?

00:11.460 --> 00:20.160
It's very simple here but imagine we would also have this blue class here for the blue css class and set this 

00:20.160 --> 00:22.340
to the opposite of attachRed.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.900
If I now control this, you see you can toggle between blue and red here

00:27.120 --> 00:29.930
but now this object grows rather big.

00:30.210 --> 00:35.940
Well I could go down to my vue instance and create a new computed property for that since it will depend

00:35.940 --> 00:38.840
on my attach red property it needs to be computed,

00:39.090 --> 00:41.730
so here I could call this div classes

00:42.030 --> 00:48.150
and this of course is a function as all computed properties, which should return me a javascript object

00:48.330 --> 00:49.540
namely the object

00:49.560 --> 00:58.740
I set up here. So in here I will simply have red, attach red and then blue which is the opposite.

00:58.740 --> 01:04.770
Now that of course won't work because keep in mind here in our vuejs code, in the javascript code, we have

01:04.770 --> 01:07.940
to access the properties with this at the beginning.

01:08.310 --> 01:15.450
Now with that change in place, I can simply replace my object here with div classes and if I save this,

01:15.870 --> 01:22.300
you see the same behavior as before but now outsourced in a property, in this case a computed property

01:22.410 --> 01:27.720
if you wouldn't have this dependency of course, you wouldn't need to use a computed property and our

01:27.720 --> 01:33.160
template is much leaner again due to this being stored in our javascript code now.
