WEBVTT

00:01.970 --> 00:06.620
In this module we learned a lot about using http in our vuejs application.

00:06.640 --> 00:13.750
We started with simple http requests using vue resource which was set up here, added with vue use

00:13.840 --> 00:15.280
and then vue resource

00:15.430 --> 00:21.370
and we started simple way with using this $http post, get and so on, passing the URL as the first

00:21.370 --> 00:24.620
argument, data as the second argument and so on.

00:24.760 --> 00:30.820
We then also had a look at how we could centralize this with the global http object

00:30.820 --> 00:34.930
vue resource provides us or how we could set up interceptors, like this.

00:35.020 --> 00:40.470
Finally we had a look at vue resources which allows us to save certain types of requests we

00:40.470 --> 00:46.600
want to send over and over again and convenient methods we can use and where we could also use this way

00:46.600 --> 00:53.770
of using templates for our URLs where we can exchange parts of it dynamically based on some data

00:53.770 --> 00:57.860
we possibly enter ourselves, like in the input field here.

00:58.200 --> 01:03.430
With that, we really learned a lot and you saw me mention the official documentation from time to time

01:03.460 --> 01:04.920
during this module,

01:05.020 --> 01:10.510
I can really encourage you to have a look at it because it is really good,

01:10.510 --> 01:15.850
it's not super good documentation but it allows you to have a look at all the options for example, something

01:15.850 --> 01:20.200
which really doesn't make sense to walk through step by step in a video.

01:20.200 --> 01:25.570
This is where you can learn how to configure your request, your response which dive deeper into this

01:25.570 --> 01:32.220
package, though to be honest I am very very sure that you have a solid toolset with the things you learned

01:32.220 --> 01:38.440
here and that you're now able to send http requests to store your data, get your data and all the things

01:38.500 --> 01:40.050
you need in your application.
