It's finally time. After learning about all these core features of vuejs, after learning about how to

00:08.070 --> 00:13.980
use vuejs in your existing applications, so to build complex applications with it, there's one thing we

00:13.980 --> 00:20.010
haven't covered yet, how to create a single page application with vuejs and we couldn't cover it

00:20.010 --> 00:22.390
yet because we didn't know about the router.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.740
The router is the important thing about a single page application though because a single page application

00:28.740 --> 00:36.480
means technically we only have one page, the single page which is the index.html file we load which hosts

00:36.540 --> 00:45.530
our vuejs application and then we use this single page to simulate navigation for the users, so our

00:45.570 --> 00:52.770
URL does change but we catch all these changes and only re-render this single page so that it looks

00:52.770 --> 00:55.590
like as if we were revisiting different pages,

00:55.590 --> 01:00.320
it looks like this to the user but behind the scenes, it's always the same page.

01:00.330 --> 01:06.720
So the big difference to the last lectures is we no longer have application to where we need to reload

01:06.720 --> 01:12.510
our page, where we get different pages from the server and then only embed vuejs to handle parts of

01:12.510 --> 01:13.410
this page,

01:13.620 --> 01:17.540
now the whole application is handled through vuejs

01:17.760 --> 01:24.570
and that is a huge thing, that is really something which allows you to build very big applications based

01:24.630 --> 01:25.930
on vuejs.

01:26.070 --> 01:31.320
Therefore in this section, we're going to have a look at the main building block you'll need for

01:31.360 --> 01:35.580
this, the vuejs router and how routing works in vuejs.
