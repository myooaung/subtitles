00:02.180 --> 00:08.810
So with the addition of asynchronous validation in the last lecture, we added another extremely useful

00:08.810 --> 00:11.280
tool to our toolset.

00:11.300 --> 00:19.460
Now we can really handle form validation with ease and we can make sure that we always submit forms which

00:19.520 --> 00:28.810
are valid and which therefore pass data onto our backend or whatever we're doing with it that we need.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.930
I hope you saw the many features vuelidate offers,

00:31.940 --> 00:36.020
now one important note, vuelidate is only one option,

00:36.020 --> 00:44.210
there are other validation packages like v validate, links can be found in the last lecture of this

00:44.210 --> 00:45.450
module.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.040
Vuelidate is a very powerful and still simple to use package though,

00:49.220 --> 00:51.470
so I can only recommend using it.

00:51.620 --> 00:53.790
And with that, feel free to play around with that,

00:53.800 --> 00:59.420
add it to your next vue project, dive into the vuelidate documentation which I showed you and build

00:59.480 --> 01:02.250
awesome forms that only are valid

01:02.330 --> 01:03.280
if you want it.
