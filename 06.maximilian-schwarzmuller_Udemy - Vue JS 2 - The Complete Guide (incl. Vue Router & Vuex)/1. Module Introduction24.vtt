Until now we already learned a lot about the basics of components, how to create them, how to use them,

00:06.450 --> 00:08.040
how to set them up.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.680
Now I want to dive deeper into how components can communicate with each other, so that we not just have

00:13.680 --> 00:20.430
contained pieces of code where we can use all vuejs features but well don't really have connections

00:20.430 --> 00:26.670
between the components but such that we do have such connections and that we can communicate across components,

00:26.850 --> 00:30.670
something every real application will need for sure.

00:30.810 --> 00:36.930
Now in order to do this, I set up a basic application here and you will find it attached to this lecture

00:37.200 --> 00:42.490
and beginning with the next lecture, we will dive into that and learn how we can communicate across the

00:42.500 --> 00:43.850
different pieces there.
