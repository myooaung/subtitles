00:01.820 --> 00:04.210
Which features could I add to my directive?

00:04.490 --> 00:10.940
Well I want to show how to use multiple modifiers and how to pass more complex data than just a string

00:10.940 --> 00:11.550
here,

00:11.810 --> 00:13.890
let's start with the multiple modifiers.

00:14.180 --> 00:21.590
let's say I want to add a modifier where this not only has the possibility to get added delayed but also to

00:21.620 --> 00:22.300
blink,

00:22.370 --> 00:31.260
so to alternate between two states once I well have it, set it up, so I can add .blink here.

00:31.590 --> 00:36.200
Now in order to be able to use this, I also need to check this of course in my code,

00:36.210 --> 00:45.930
so here I will add another if check where I check if binding modifiers has this blink key here.

00:45.930 --> 00:53.040
Now if I do have this, I want to set up this timeout and then an interval inside of this timeout,

00:53.250 --> 00:59.490
otherwise in the else block, if we don't have this modifier, I just want to use the timeout as we did

00:59.490 --> 01:00.030
before,

01:00.030 --> 01:02.850
so this code will remain untouched.

01:02.850 --> 01:10.740
Now what I want to do here in the blink case? Well here I simply want to alternate between two colors,

01:10.770 --> 01:14.410
so I will create new variables and I use the var before

01:14.430 --> 01:22.210
but since we use ES6 code, I can also use let here, let is the ES6 variable which is block scoped,

01:22.230 --> 01:26.580
that is a difference and you want to check out the ES6 tutorial to learn more about it,

01:26.640 --> 01:28.450
you could still use var though.

01:28.590 --> 01:36.060
So let here just to alternate this allows me to define a new variable and I will set up the main color

01:36.060 --> 01:36.700
here,

01:37.020 --> 01:39.940
the main color shall be green

01:39.960 --> 01:46.700
let's say, then I will set up my second color and this shall be blue

01:46.730 --> 01:50.390
because again I want to blink, I want to switch between both colors.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.010
I can also say the main color should be what the user passes,

01:54.020 --> 01:56.380
so let's say binding value,

01:56.600 --> 01:58.850
I still do pass a color here, red,

01:58.880 --> 01:59.720
so let's use that,

01:59.720 --> 02:00.440
why not?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.850
So now I get two colors,

02:01.880 --> 02:06.930
the second color is hardcoded, the first color is settable by the user, the main color that is,

02:07.220 --> 02:14.110
I also want to have a current color and at the beginning this shall be my main color here, like that.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.720
Ok, so with that let's now

02:16.720 --> 02:19.290
copy that set timeout code

02:19.300 --> 02:26.500
but inside there to make it blink, I also need to set an interval, so I'll execute set interval, interval

02:26.530 --> 02:27.750
like this

02:28.060 --> 02:34.870
and there, let's set up the duration it should take or how long it should take for it to keep one state

02:34.870 --> 02:36.550
before it alternates again,

02:36.550 --> 02:40.650
let's set this to one second so that we can clearly see this, this of course is totally up to you

02:40.780 --> 02:44.530
and you could also make this settable from outside, I will soon show you how.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.510
So here, set interval

02:46.510 --> 02:50.410
then takes a callback which is executed every one second

02:50.590 --> 02:54.730
but it only starts after three seconds though because it is nested inside the set

02:54.730 --> 03:02.660
timeout and here, I want to check if the current color equals the second color,

03:02.770 --> 03:07.870
if that is the case, then the current color is the main color because it obviously is the second color

03:07.870 --> 03:08.260
right now

03:08.260 --> 03:12.950
so I want to switch it otherwise I want to do the opposite, then current color

03:12.960 --> 03:14.760
shall be the second color.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.110
So that basically will switch my colors,

03:17.110 --> 03:18.750
that's all I'm doing here

03:18.910 --> 03:21.310
and that of course shall not be an if statement,

03:21.460 --> 03:23.310
that's a normal ternary statement,

03:23.400 --> 03:24.850
so like this.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.220
This will change my colors,

03:27.820 --> 03:33.890
the next line then decides whether it shall change the background color or not,

03:33.940 --> 03:39.400
so I will take this code which is currently outside of the interval and put it inside of the interval.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.880
So this is of course needed because you still are able to set background as an argument here as we do,

03:45.070 --> 03:48.040
so that will determine what color should be alternated.

03:48.240 --> 03:54.130
Now of course I also need to change this, the background color should now be set to the current color

03:54.220 --> 03:59.480
as should be the color in case we're not passing the background argument. With this in place,

03:59.500 --> 04:01.010
let's see if that works,

04:01.180 --> 04:05.200
it should start up to three seconds and it alternates.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.320
It took an initial of one second because we set up the interval to be one second

04:09.460 --> 04:11.980
but as you can see, it now blinks,

04:12.100 --> 04:12.700
awesome.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.430
This is the behaviour you wanted,

04:14.440 --> 04:22.060
now let's see how we can control both colors and not just one, as well as the duration of this blinking

04:22.060 --> 04:22.370
interval.

04:22.370 --> 04:25.600
Well I'll show you how to do all these things in the next video.
