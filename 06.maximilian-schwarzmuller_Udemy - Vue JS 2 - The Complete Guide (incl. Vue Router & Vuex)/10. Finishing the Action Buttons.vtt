00:01.680 --> 00:04.040
We're almost done, we're able to attack and heal,

00:04.050 --> 00:09.840
now we want to implement the method to give up what should happen if we click this button. Well we want

00:09.840 --> 00:14.330
to set game is running to false because it isn't running anymore

00:14.880 --> 00:19.190
and then this is all. I'll come back to this later on

00:19.200 --> 00:22.760
but for now, this is really all. I can see it in action

00:22.860 --> 00:26.570
if I fight a little bit and then give up, it's over,

00:26.610 --> 00:28.370
we can start a new one,

00:28.440 --> 00:35.660
go back to 100 and start fighting again, like that, wonderful. With that,

00:35.700 --> 00:38.170
all our action buttons are hooked up,

00:38.190 --> 00:42.290
I now want to work on this section which doesn't display anything yet.

00:42.360 --> 00:49.290
I want to show a log showing us precisely how much damage we dealt, how much damage we healed or how

00:49.290 --> 00:51.750
much damage we got by the monster.

00:51.960 --> 00:57.560
So let's implement this logging functionality next to wrap up and finish this project.
