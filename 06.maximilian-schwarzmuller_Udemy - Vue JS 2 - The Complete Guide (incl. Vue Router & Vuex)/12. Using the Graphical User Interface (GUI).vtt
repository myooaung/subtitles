WEBVTT

00:02.230 --> 00:05.860
With all of that, we saw the core features of the new cli

00:05.860 --> 00:09.300
but one important and interesting feature is missing.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.770
Back in the terminal, let's

00:10.990 --> 00:18.550
run vue ui because the new vue cli actually has a graphical user interface which can use, this command

00:18.550 --> 00:23.700
starts it and should automatically open up a tab in the browser which hosts it,

00:23.920 --> 00:27.340
if not, you can visit this page to see it

00:27.520 --> 00:29.240
and this is what it looks like.

00:29.510 --> 00:35.500
This is a graphical manager and which basically gives you access to the same commands we ran from within

00:35.500 --> 00:36.730
the command line

00:36.910 --> 00:41.650
but now with this nice interface, here you can see existing projects you created,

00:41.650 --> 00:42.510
I have none,

00:42.580 --> 00:48.270
so this is basically vue create and there, you got your file system where you can navigate around.

00:48.310 --> 00:52.430
So in there, you could navigate into a folder where you want to create a new project,

00:52.510 --> 00:57.220
you can also by the way favorite that path so that you can always quickly access that folder in the

00:57.220 --> 00:58.900
future,

00:59.050 --> 01:02.880
you can then create a new subfolder if you want, show hidden folders and then in the end, create a new

01:02.890 --> 01:04.830
project as you can see.

01:04.840 --> 01:12.270
You can then define a name for the folder which will be created like vue cli ui, choose the package

01:12.270 --> 01:15.600
manager you want to use for managing the dependencies in a project,

01:15.600 --> 01:20.580
if you only got npm installed you will only use that but if you have yarn, you have the choice, you have

01:20.590 --> 01:26.980
the alternative there. You can choose if you want to override that folder if it already exists and you can

01:26.980 --> 01:32.900
decide if you are using git if you want to initialize this already. Now with that if we click on next, we go to

01:32.900 --> 01:39.890
the presets page and now we can choose to take our saved preset, the default one or use the manual

01:39.890 --> 01:42.530
approach where we then will go to the next page

01:42.680 --> 01:44.610
and now we can check some features

01:44.690 --> 01:49.920
and this is exactly the same set of features we were presented in the terminal.

01:50.060 --> 01:56.780
So here I could then enable router vuex and let's say css preprocessing, click next

01:56.790 --> 02:03.560
again, finally here you can add some configuration for the presets, for the features you added, for the

02:03.560 --> 02:07.720
plugins you added, this also was something you got asked when using the terminal,

02:07.730 --> 02:15.080
now it's in here. So we can choose for the css preprocessing, which preprocessor to use, for a

02:15.080 --> 02:18.410
linting which configuration to use and to lint on save

02:18.470 --> 02:20.420
and then we can create the project.

02:20.420 --> 02:26.320
We can also save this preset just as we could in the terminal or continue without saving and now this

02:26.390 --> 02:31.540
will take a while as it will create this new folder and install all the dependencies in there.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.180
It's up to you of course if you want to use that user interface or the terminal,

02:35.180 --> 02:40.970
I personally find the terminal to be a bit faster for me but this of course is a bit easier to work

02:40.970 --> 02:41.180
with

02:41.180 --> 02:45.320
I'd argue and it's always nice to have a graphical user interface.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.210
Now let's wait for this to finish and with it finished, this is

02:49.210 --> 02:53.990
now the project we're in, now you can always go back by clicking on the home icon there,

02:54.020 --> 02:57.820
now you should see a project there and there, you can go back into the project

02:57.950 --> 03:01.600
and here you see the installed plugins, you can add a new plugin if you want

03:01.700 --> 03:03.730
and there you can now also search,

03:03.740 --> 03:08.650
so for example if I search for vuetify here, it finds that plugin so that's very convenient.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.990
This is a way to find all the available plugins,

03:11.990 --> 03:18.430
this is a registry where you can search plugins or simply browse them all of course.

03:18.900 --> 03:24.450
And let's say I want to add that vuetify plugin again, then I can simply click on it here, install that

03:24.450 --> 03:25.110
plugin

03:25.170 --> 03:30.580
and now it will do that same thing it did in the terminal, download it and once it's done, it will also

03:30.660 --> 03:34.090
ask you for the configuration that plugin needs.

03:34.260 --> 03:38.670
So here this, I can now choose if I want to use a custom theme, no, premade template,

03:38.670 --> 03:39.260
yes.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.880
a la carte components, babel/polyfill, finish the installation

03:43.290 --> 03:49.560
and this will then well execute that or install that plugin and do all these changes, apply all these

03:49.560 --> 03:50.230
changes.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.340
You can actually see the changes here before they are applied,

03:53.340 --> 03:54.200
so that's really great,

03:54.210 --> 04:01.230
you see what will change and then you can commit this here to github or you skip to just apply them.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.480
And with that, this is now added,

04:05.530 --> 04:08.820
we can also configure some settings here on this screen

04:08.830 --> 04:10.540
for example the base URL,

04:10.600 --> 04:15.970
these are also things you could do from within the cli, the official docs show you a full reference

04:15.970 --> 04:20.810
of cli commands you can run into terminal to configure an existing project.

04:20.830 --> 04:22.800
Here you have them all on one page,

04:22.930 --> 04:28.960
all these settings and in the last area here, you then have these commands you can run. So you can build

04:28.960 --> 04:35.280
it, you can serve it, you can lint it, inspect is an extra command which let's you look into the webpack

04:35.430 --> 04:41.090
config you're using in the project, vue inspect would be the terminal command you could have also

04:41.110 --> 04:42.020
executed

04:42.340 --> 04:47.710
and overall, I can only encourage you to play around with that and to take advantage of this graphical

04:47.710 --> 04:51.170
interface, especially for browsing available plugins.

04:51.160 --> 04:57.820
I'd argue that this is especially useful and overall, it's a nice alternative to the terminal driven

04:57.880 --> 05:03.180
cli and it's good to have this as it can really speed up your development process.
