00:01.340 --> 00:04.340
So we want to fade this alert in and out,

00:04.370 --> 00:05.450
how does this work?

00:05.450 --> 00:06.520
Let's start with fade-enter

00:06.530 --> 00:07.100
.

00:07.100 --> 00:12.600
remember this is the css class which is only attached for one frame at the beginning,

00:12.620 --> 00:15.370
so here we should set our initial state

00:15.380 --> 00:16.640
we want to have

00:17.000 --> 00:20.850
Now since we want to fade it in, it should initially be transparent,

00:20.940 --> 00:23.930
therefore here, I will set the opacity to zero

00:23.960 --> 00:24.710
and that is all,

00:24.710 --> 00:28.930
I'm not setting up any transition here or something like this because keep in mind, this class will

00:28.950 --> 00:31.480
immediately be removed after one frame,

00:31.580 --> 00:34.760
so if I would set up a transition here, that wouldn't work.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.510
The place to set up the transition is here, the fade-enter-active class, here

00:39.530 --> 00:41.870
I want to transition my opacity,

00:41.870 --> 00:47.330
you could also transition all if you wanted but we only want to transition the opacity so this is fine

00:47.750 --> 00:50.260
and I want to transition over one second let's say,

00:50.360 --> 00:52.650
pick any time frame you want to pick.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.250
Now this will animate it,

00:55.250 --> 00:58.700
now I'm not setting opacity one here and that is important,

00:58.860 --> 01:04.970
opacity one is the default anyways because keep in mind, opacity zero here will be removed after

01:04.970 --> 01:05.580
one frame

01:05.600 --> 01:09.660
so we don't need to override it, it by default is fully opaque.

01:09.710 --> 01:13.390
So we do have, we don't have to specify one here

01:13.640 --> 01:19.490
and indeed if we were to set the opacity to one here, the thing that would happen is that we would instantly

01:19.580 --> 01:26.130
override our initial state of zero which yes was removed but it was there when we added this transition

01:26.130 --> 01:30.790
opacity thing here because that gets added right before this gets removed.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.960
So we would remove this or override this immediately to one,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.850
therefore we wouldn't see any fading because the opacity would always be one,

01:38.990 --> 01:42.970
so it's important to not set it here, only set up the transition here.

01:43.610 --> 01:49.480
Well and for leaving, here we could set opacity to one though that is the default already,

01:49.490 --> 01:50.770
so I'm going to comment it out,

01:50.770 --> 01:57.130
we don't need to set it. For fade-leave-active though, we again should set up the transition

01:57.170 --> 02:02.500
and now here it is important that we also set up the opacity of 0,

02:02.600 --> 02:05.020
remember the default already is 1

02:05.150 --> 02:11.220
so by setting up both the transition and the opacity of zero, we tell it yes, please animate whenever the

02:11.280 --> 02:12.460
opacity changes,

02:12.500 --> 02:15.430
oh and look, here it changes to 0,

02:15.580 --> 02:18.180
this is how we can control this.

02:18.350 --> 02:21.600
And now with that set up and the name being added here,

02:21.870 --> 02:28.040
hence making sure that fade-enter and so on be unattached by vuejs, vuejs is now able to sniff

02:28.040 --> 02:32.600
these css classes, finds out that the transition length is one second,

02:32.600 --> 02:38.600
we don't have animation so it uses transition, with animation of course I'm referring to the css

02:38.630 --> 02:43.870
animation property which would be an alternative to transitioning here and it does the same for the

02:43.870 --> 02:47.660
leaving, hence it knows how to, how long it should attach these

02:47.740 --> 02:50.390
css classes. Well and with that, 

02:50.420 --> 02:51.180
let's see,

02:51.290 --> 02:53.030
let's have a look at the running application,

02:53.030 --> 03:00.410
make sure your development server is running and there we need to reload this and now you see, it fades in and it

03:00.410 --> 03:01.400
fades out.

03:01.670 --> 03:06.430
And now we already set up our first animation for a single element

03:06.470 --> 03:07.850
but how cool is that?

03:07.910 --> 03:13.970
Now in a next video, let's have a look at how this would work if we wouldn't use the transition property

03:13.970 --> 03:19.580
here but instead, css animations which is the alternative to transitioning single properties.
