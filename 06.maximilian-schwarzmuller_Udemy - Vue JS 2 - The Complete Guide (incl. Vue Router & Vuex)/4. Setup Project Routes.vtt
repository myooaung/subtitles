00:02.310 --> 00:05.030
So let's have a look at the routing set up

00:05.040 --> 00:13.800
I chose to use, I will first of all create a new file which I'll name routes.js and that is

00:13.800 --> 00:14.400
optional,

00:14.400 --> 00:17.170
you don't need to outsource your routes there

00:17.190 --> 00:21.730
but before we can set up any routes, we first need to install the vue router, right?

00:21.960 --> 00:25.130
So let's run npm install --save

00:25.170 --> 00:28.270
vue router, like that

00:28.590 --> 00:35.340
and that should give us the vue router and with the router now installed, we can go to the main.js file

00:35.520 --> 00:45.210
and here, I want to add a new import, thank you where I import the vue router from the vue router package

00:45.210 --> 00:48.990
here and then you learned that we first need to run

00:49.090 --> 00:52.410
vue use vue router in order to use it,

00:52.440 --> 00:54.390
so let's do that here.

00:54.470 --> 00:56.510
This enables the vue router

00:56.730 --> 00:59.130
and next, we want to set up the router, for that

00:59.130 --> 01:00.960
we need some files,

01:01.020 --> 01:06.810
some routes I should say, so I'm going to set them up here in extra file, export const routes, give this

01:06.810 --> 01:12.670
of course any name you like and then routes are really just an array of objects as you learned.

01:12.960 --> 01:19.790
So we need three routes now, to our home page, to the portfolio and to the stocks page,

01:20.010 --> 01:26.640
so for that, I'll set up the main route first, the empty path or just this slash here which will

01:26.640 --> 01:32.370
lead to our home page and there, I want to load a component and this component I want to load is of course

01:32.640 --> 01:33.900
the home component.

01:34.110 --> 01:37.340
So here, I'll import home from

01:37.410 --> 01:41.280
and now it's from the components file from the home.vue file,

01:41.280 --> 01:46.450
so this now allows me to set the home component there for this first route.

01:46.770 --> 01:50.240
The second route shall now lead to the portfolio, let's say

01:50.250 --> 01:55.910
so slash portfolio shall load the portfolio component of course,

01:55.950 --> 02:04.800
so for that let's go up to our imports and add the import here of our portfolio from and now this lives in the

02:04.800 --> 02:09.720
components folder in the portfolio folder in the portfolio.vue file,

02:09.780 --> 02:12.320
so with that we can add the portfolio component.

02:12.450 --> 02:17.500
And lastly the last route we want to set up, now that of course has to lead to our stocks,

02:17.640 --> 02:24.020
so here let's links to our stocks and then adds the stocks component here,

02:24.020 --> 02:35.680
so let me add this last import, import stocks from components stocks, whoops, stocks and then the stock,

02:36.010 --> 02:39.280
not that file, this file, stocks.vue file

02:39.640 --> 02:41.290
and then of course add it here.

02:41.290 --> 02:47.160
So these are the three routes I want to use in this application, no nested routes or anything like that

02:47.170 --> 02:50.490
because routing whilst in this application is pretty straightforward.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.440
So with that, we get all the routes configured here,

02:54.590 --> 03:00.050
now since we export this, we can go back to the main.js file and import our routes here.

03:00.220 --> 03:08.320
So import the routes with the curly brace syntax since it's a named export from the routes.js

03:08.320 --> 03:08.710
.

03:08.710 --> 03:17.110
file and we can then use our router or create our router here in a constant let's say by running

03:17.110 --> 03:18.450
new vue router.

03:18.490 --> 03:24.430
Important is that you used vue use before and then we pass an object where we configure our

03:24.430 --> 03:25.080
router,

03:25.180 --> 03:26.890
now how do we want to configure it?

03:27.130 --> 03:33.010
Well I want to set the mode to history to get these nicer URLs and don't have the hash tag

03:33.280 --> 03:34.820
and then I'll set my routes,

03:34.840 --> 03:40.300
so since I'm importing them, I could say routes routes or again use this ES6 syntax of just setting up

03:40.300 --> 03:42.410
routes. And with that,

03:42.430 --> 03:44.350
the routes are configured

03:44.770 --> 03:51.200
and now of course we also have to add the router here to our vue instance, again with the shortcut

03:51.230 --> 03:58.070
instead of writing router router, since we named this constant, we want to use as a value router as well.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.310
With that, the router has been added to the application,

04:01.330 --> 04:02.820
we got our routes.

04:02.950 --> 04:09.910
Now let's see this in action by going to the app.vue file and adding a first router vue here so a place

04:09.910 --> 04:17.080
where we can load these, well these routes. And with that in place, let's run our server with npm run dev,

04:17.350 --> 04:23.130
the development workflow and the server and we see the home component.

04:23.250 --> 04:30.300
Now let's manually enter portfolio here, portfolio component and if we visit /stocks, the stocks component.

04:30.380 --> 04:37.170
So with that, we got our first components in place and routing to go there. With that in the next video, let's

04:37.170 --> 04:39.880
think about the next steps and start working on them.
