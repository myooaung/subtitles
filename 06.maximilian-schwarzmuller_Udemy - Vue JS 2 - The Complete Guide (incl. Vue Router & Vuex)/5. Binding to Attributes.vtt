You should feel a bit more confident with this first syntax with the double curly braces here,

00:07.620 --> 00:10.970
we used quite a lot and I think it's clear what it does.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.860
What if you wanted to do something else?

00:14.100 --> 00:16.540
Let's say we have a link property

00:16.590 --> 00:24.270
and as the name implies, it stores a link to let's say Google.com. Now here in the paragraph,

00:24.570 --> 00:31.420
we might not only want to say hello, we also might want to output this link so we could enter an anchor tag

00:31.420 --> 00:38.370
here and call it Google since this link leads to Google and then we could try the following, use

00:38.370 --> 00:40.730
our double curly braces here in

00:40.760 --> 00:43.430
the ref attribute to that output,

00:43.450 --> 00:48.790
the link. If I hit control enter, we got our link here

00:48.990 --> 00:58.160
but if I click on it, well you see it's not going to google at all. What it actually does is it encodes

00:58.350 --> 01:04.370
the curly braces and tries to go to curly brace, curly brace, whitespace link, whitespace curly brace,

01:04.410 --> 01:08.160
curly brace so it tries to parse this as a link.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.630
That is the normal thing to happen because vuejs doesn't work like that,

01:12.690 --> 01:18.060
we can't use curly braces in any html element attribute,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.530
so this does not work.

01:20.640 --> 01:28.820
We can only use these curly braces in the place where we would normally use text, not on html elements.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.580
What if we still wanted to bind this link dynamically?

01:32.580 --> 01:36.610
That is certainly a use case you will oftentimes see in your application,

01:36.870 --> 01:37.410
no worries,

01:37.440 --> 01:38.820
you can do this.

01:39.120 --> 01:47.670
We can bind it dynamically by removing the link for now and then introducing a directive vuejs ships

01:47.670 --> 01:57.270
with, this directive is called a v-bind and this directive tells vuejs hey don't use the normal attribute

01:57.270 --> 01:57.960
here,

01:58.050 --> 02:03.600
don't use it like a normal html attribute, instead bind it.

02:03.600 --> 02:10.860
We do pass an argument to the bind directive by adding a colon and the argument we do pass is then

02:10.860 --> 02:12.990
the name of the attribute we want to bind,

02:13.020 --> 02:19.350
so ref here. By setting it up like this we can now pass a link here between the quotation marks,

02:19.350 --> 02:20.840
no curly braces still,

02:20.860 --> 02:27.070
this is the link, we don't need curly braces because we now already are in vuejs template language.

02:27.450 --> 02:35.460
And with this, if I now hit control and I now try to load this, well you see I'm now taken to Google because

02:35.460 --> 02:40.680
now it binds to this data dynamically due to this v-bind directive.
