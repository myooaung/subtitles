You also get the alternative of setting up a template

00:05.550 --> 00:10.280
you want to attach or remove. So I could use template here,

00:10.280 --> 00:16.510
this is html5 code and the template tag doesn't get rendered in the dom,

00:16.650 --> 00:18.640
you won't see template there.

00:18.690 --> 00:25.530
So if I now add the inside a template paragraph here and render this, you see inside a template

00:25.530 --> 00:31.110
but if we inspect that, you don't see a wrapping template element over there,

00:31.110 --> 00:32.200
do you see that?

00:32.220 --> 00:34.630
So this is how template works,

00:34.650 --> 00:42.280
this allows us to attach v-if to this template here, to now also toggle this.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.840
And now you might ask what's the difference to the first version?

00:46.080 --> 00:52.320
Well we can wrap multiple elements in here, like a heading for example.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.680
Notice that they are not nested in each other

00:54.690 --> 00:59.930
and since we can only attach v-if to one element while we can attach it to multiple ones

01:00.150 --> 01:07.770
but we can't say v-if on this element and also have it affect the next one which is not nested inside,

01:08.160 --> 01:14.640
I can simply wrap it in a template which won't be visible in the end but to group all the elements which

01:14.640 --> 01:16.670
I want to group together with the v-if.

01:16.710 --> 01:22.110
The alternative would of course be a div but maybe you don't want a div, you don't want to have the

01:22.260 --> 01:29.990
side effects div introduces, then template v-if would be a valid option to group multiple elements

01:30.030 --> 01:34.480
you want to show or hide or attach or detach to be precise together.
