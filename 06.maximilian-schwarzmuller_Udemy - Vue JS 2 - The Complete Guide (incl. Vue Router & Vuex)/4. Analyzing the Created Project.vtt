WEBVTT

00:02.290 --> 00:06.690
I opened the project in Visual Studio Code, the IDE I'm using here, 

00:06.780 --> 00:08.090
it's a free IDE

00:08.370 --> 00:12.550
and in this project, we see this is what the cli generated for us.

00:12.570 --> 00:18.180
We got a bunch of config files since I chose that store each configuration for each of the features

00:18.180 --> 00:23.340
we're using in a separate file and we get that package.json file where we see the scripts it gave

00:23.340 --> 00:24.030
us,

00:24.030 --> 00:26.520
these are scripts we can run with npm run

00:26.550 --> 00:31.500
and then the script name and then we got a script for developent and serving that development server

00:31.770 --> 00:37.440
and for building the production app, this will automatically use production ready settings and optimize

00:37.440 --> 00:38.890
everything.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.770
We also see some dependencies here

00:40.830 --> 00:46.440
and one thing you won't see neither here in the dependencies nor here in the configs is the webpack

00:46.470 --> 00:47.490
configuration.

00:47.490 --> 00:51.020
Now the vue cli does use webpack under the hood,

00:51.240 --> 00:55.040
it basically hides it away in these vue cli

00:55.080 --> 00:59.020
plugins or to precise, in the vue cli service here.

00:59.290 --> 01:06.120
This is where it uses webpack and you can't directly access the webpack configuration, though you can

01:06.120 --> 01:07.040
extend it

01:07.070 --> 01:12.390
and details can be found about this advanced feature in the official docs of the cli to which you of

01:12.390 --> 01:15.240
course find a link in the last lecture of this module,

01:15.270 --> 01:19.980
you don't really have to tweak that though because as you will see in that link, you can add things to

01:19.980 --> 01:21.300
the config if you need to

01:21.420 --> 01:27.200
but most of the time, using these plugins gives you a lot of power and a lot of features.

01:27.210 --> 01:31.940
Now here in the package.json file, we also see that browsers list thing,

01:31.950 --> 01:36.810
this allows you to set up which browsers you want to support with your project

01:36.810 --> 01:43.950
and this is important for plugins like the or for tools like the auto prefixer which will be added

01:43.950 --> 01:44.460
automatically,

01:44.460 --> 01:50.100
it's already part of the default set up which will take your css code and automatically prefix

01:50.100 --> 01:53.760
it such that it works best in the selected browsers here.

01:53.820 --> 02:00.090
It's the same for babel, our set up here uses babel to give you next gen javascript support and this

02:00.090 --> 02:06.060
will automatically give you polyfills for features you're using depending on which browsers you support,

02:06.060 --> 02:09.200
so it's already detecting what it needs to add.

02:09.510 --> 02:12.420
Therefore this is your browser list and you can tweak this,

02:12.480 --> 02:17.220
you'll also find a link to explanations on how to work with that and what you can write there

02:17.460 --> 02:23.100
in the last lecture of this module and the other files here, well there you can dive in to configure

02:23.100 --> 02:31.690
for example the linting, to configure the compilation of your css code, to configure babel,

02:31.710 --> 02:33.250
most of the defaults should be fine

02:33.270 --> 02:37.590
but if you need to, you can tweak the configs of these packages.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.530
Now what about these two folders,

02:39.570 --> 02:45.840
public and source? The public folder is where you have that index.html file for your single

02:45.840 --> 02:51.020
page app, you will see the manifesto.json file which is related to the progressive web app,

02:51.030 --> 02:56.280
this file basically provides metadata information about your app which can be read by a browser

02:56.370 --> 03:02.070
to make it installable on the home screen and you can also store some static assets here,

03:02.190 --> 03:07.170
though I will also show you that there is another way of adding assets which is recommended since that

03:07.260 --> 03:13.290
other way will be handled by webpack which will do additional optimizations whereas any assets you add

03:13.290 --> 03:18.800
in the public folder will simply be copied to your production ready app and will not be optimized anymore.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.630
The source folder then is where you write your code, here is that assets folder,

03:23.640 --> 03:29.490
that's the other way I was talking about, this file here for example will be analyzed by webpack and will be

03:29.490 --> 03:30.630
optimized

03:30.630 --> 03:37.020
and then besides that, you write your vuejs code. You got your main.js file where your vue app starts, where

03:37.020 --> 03:42.390
you have the route vue instance, you have the router where you set up your routes configuration,

03:42.390 --> 03:47.600
since we added vuex, you got a default store with which you can start working, register service worker,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.800
you don't need to tweak it right now,

03:49.800 --> 03:54.930
you can of course if you know once you're doing, this will basically register a service worker to give

03:54.930 --> 03:59.890
you that progressive web app support, app.vue is our root component.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.690
Then in the views folder, we find the pages to which we can navigate,

04:03.690 --> 04:08.850
we could of course also store them in components or wherever you want and components in this set up

04:09.000 --> 04:11.510
is simply non-routing components,

04:11.580 --> 04:18.170
so components which you don't load through the router but which you embed through their tag in other components.

04:18.270 --> 04:19.740
This is a setup we have here,

04:19.760 --> 04:25.650
this is what the cli gave us and now we can work with that setup, just as you worked with it through the

04:25.650 --> 04:26.400
entire course,

04:26.400 --> 04:32.120
so just as you work with the other set up, you can now start adding components, import them as you learned it

04:32.210 --> 04:33.170
in this course,

04:33.210 --> 04:35.350
use them as you learned it in this course.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.340
There's really nothing special about this,

04:37.350 --> 04:42.030
the syntax is the same, it's the same framework but it gives you more features.

04:42.210 --> 04:46.840
And let's have a look at some of these more features and what exactly we can do.
