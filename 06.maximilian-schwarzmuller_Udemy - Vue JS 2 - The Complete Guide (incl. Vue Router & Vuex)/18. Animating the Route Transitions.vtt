00:01.760 --> 00:03.510
Let's start with animations

00:03.620 --> 00:09.380
and this of course again is a challenge for you, make sure that these switches between the different

00:09.380 --> 00:11.110
routes are animated, of course

00:11.110 --> 00:18.110
choose any animation of your choice or whatever you like. Animating the transition between routes is

00:18.110 --> 00:20.310
easy as we learned in the last module,

00:20.570 --> 00:23.060
all we have to do is go in the app.vue file where

00:23.060 --> 00:30.260
we have our router vue and add a transition here. Now in this transition, we'll place the router vue and

00:30.260 --> 00:31.850
then we can choose any name,

00:31.850 --> 00:34.250
let's say we name our animation slide,

00:34.280 --> 00:40.280
this will influence which css classes we're using. I'll set the mode to out in to first animate the old route

00:40.340 --> 00:42.650
out before adding the new one.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.030
Well with this, I go to my styles here

00:46.130 --> 00:48.810
and then I want to add the slide enter

00:48.830 --> 00:58.820
since I named it slide here, slide-enter-active class and I'll add the slide-leave-active class,

00:58.820 --> 01:03.740
these are the only two classes I need because I'm going to use animations,

01:03.740 --> 01:10.760
so I'll set up some keyframes here for slide-in for example where I want to animate from somewhere

01:10.760 --> 01:18.550
to somewhere and this somewhere is in the from case that I want to have this nice sliding animation

01:18.560 --> 01:26.300
so I will translateY -30 pixels and set the opacity to zero

01:26.690 --> 01:33.490
and the goal is to then reach transform, translateY of zeros, so the

01:33.620 --> 01:37.670
end position of this item and set the opacity to one of course,

01:37.670 --> 01:39.700
now all handled in this keyframe.

01:40.130 --> 01:46.460
And I also need keyframes for sliding it out of course because there I want to animate this in the opposite

01:46.460 --> 01:47.610
direction,

01:47.720 --> 01:58.400
so therefore here I will set up a from position of translateY, 0 because I want to start at the real

01:58.400 --> 02:00.200
position of this element

02:00.380 --> 02:11.030
and the opacity of course is one and the goal is to then go to transform, translateY -30 pixels

02:11.510 --> 02:13.790
and set the the opacity to zero.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.140
So this will fade and slide it

02:16.280 --> 02:23.840
and now I can use these keyframes here in my classes with the animation keyword or property, play slide

02:23.840 --> 02:31.490
in when entering around, over let's say 200 milliseconds, ease out and then forwards to keep the end position

02:32.150 --> 02:39.290
and upon leaving, I also want to play animation, slide out it is, also 200 milliseconds ease out and

02:39.340 --> 02:46.010
forwards and that's just all that should take. These few keyframes and classes together with the transition

02:46.010 --> 02:51.710
component wrapping a router vue with the names slides it up, slide of course here refers to the

02:51.710 --> 02:58.950
names these classes then have to have this. And with this in place, we already see a nice animation here,

02:59.060 --> 03:02.460
so let's fill our portfolio to also see the change there,

03:02.570 --> 03:03.530
looks good.

03:03.710 --> 03:05.590
So now we get the animation in place,

03:05.720 --> 03:12.000
let's now wrap this app up by making the save and load buttons work or the dropdown to begin with.
