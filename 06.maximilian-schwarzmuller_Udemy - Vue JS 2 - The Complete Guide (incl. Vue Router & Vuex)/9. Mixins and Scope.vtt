Now to conclude this part on mixins,

00:04.300 --> 00:06.790
let's answer one important question.

00:06.970 --> 00:13.540
Is the data here, this object, the fruit mixin, is this object actually shared between the components

00:13.540 --> 00:15.940
which add it or not?

00:15.940 --> 00:19.120
Because right now of course, we share the methods and so on

00:19.210 --> 00:24.310
but if we change the data, something we don't do right now, we only have the computed property, we don't

00:24.310 --> 00:25.730
change the original data,

00:25.900 --> 00:27.180
if we change this,

00:27.190 --> 00:33.610
is this reflected in all components or is a new instance of this object created for each component where

00:33.610 --> 00:35.120
we pass this mixin?

00:35.170 --> 00:39.580
Now let's find out by adding something in our app.vue file,

00:39.730 --> 00:47.620
let's simply add a new button here above our list where I say add new item.

00:47.630 --> 00:57.270
Now all I want to do here is on click is I want to access my fruits, not with this though,

00:57.310 --> 01:03.850
I know I can do that because I get it added with the mixin, this array here fruits and I want to push

01:03.910 --> 01:06.910
a new item on it and the new item

01:06.910 --> 01:09.540
simply is berries.

01:09.830 --> 01:20.420
Now if I save this, let's see if both lists get adjusted or only the first one, you see berries are only

01:20.420 --> 01:22.160
added to the first list.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.090
So this object, this fruit mixin is not shared,

01:26.090 --> 01:30.500
it's not the same place in memory which we then use as a mixin in seperate components,

01:30.650 --> 01:32.760
instead it is really replicated.

01:32.760 --> 01:39.800
So each component which gets this as a mixin gets a fresh copy of this object and we're not sharing

01:39.800 --> 01:40.400
one,

01:40.400 --> 01:46.280
this means it's safe for you to access the data and manipulate it without affecting other places in your

01:46.280 --> 01:47.340
application.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.240
If you want to affect other places in your application, consider simply using something like the event bus

01:53.240 --> 01:58.730
I showed you earlier in the last module about components where you would use a vue instance which you

01:58.730 --> 02:05.360
then basically can access throughout your application to call methods there or also change the data stored there.

02:05.360 --> 02:10.880
This would be an option or you could of course also use a normal javascript object which you just import,

02:11.170 --> 02:18.470
not add as a mixin but just use in your code like this, fruit mixin and then access the fields there.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.440
This is how you can use the same component,

02:20.450 --> 02:27.230
excuse me, the same object. If you use the mixins array, vuejs will create a copy for you so that you

02:27.230 --> 02:30.980
can safely edit it and don't influence other components.
