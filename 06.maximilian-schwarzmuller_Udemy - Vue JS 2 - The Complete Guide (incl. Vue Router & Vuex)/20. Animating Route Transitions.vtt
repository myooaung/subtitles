In this routing module,

00:03.200 --> 00:08.690
so far we learned a lot about how the router works, how we can set up routes, we can configure them to our

00:08.690 --> 00:14.300
needs, how we can pass data, how we can load different routes, how we can navigate there by clicking links

00:14.540 --> 00:17.510
or directly from code and so on.

00:17.710 --> 00:25.160
Now I want to dive in some advanced topics or in some additional things we can use to really get our routing

00:25.160 --> 00:30.350
to do what we want and to really fulfill any needs our application could have.

00:30.590 --> 00:33.500
Let's start by having a look at transitions,

00:33.590 --> 00:38.900
so how we may animate the switching from one route to another route.

00:39.070 --> 00:43.190
Now we already learned about transitions in this course or about animations

00:43.310 --> 00:49.850
and the cool thing is if we have a look at our router here, we can simply wrap a router view with this

00:49.850 --> 00:56.870
transition component here because it's only one element so no transition group here, only one element

00:56.930 --> 01:02.870
because we want to transition between the components which get loaded in this router view. If we want

01:02.870 --> 01:03.920
to do that for the

01:03.920 --> 01:08.840
other two router views too, we would wrap them in transition blocks as well.

01:08.870 --> 01:15.140
So this will now transition or animate the switching of this route and I can show this by setting up

01:15.140 --> 01:20.890
a simple animation here using various simple slide animation

01:20.890 --> 01:26.630
let's say. Now we already saw how to set this up in the animation section,

01:26.720 --> 01:30.460
so I will quickly copy in some code and then be back once I'm done.

01:32.140 --> 01:38.140
So I copied in some css style tip and I have a nice slide animation which also has some fading included

01:38.380 --> 01:47.050
and then I want to set the mode to out in so that the old component is first removed before the new

01:47.060 --> 01:48.030
one is added.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.420
Well let's have a look

01:49.420 --> 01:56.800
by going to our main page and now if I click on user, you see now we have this transition

01:56.800 --> 02:00.780
and of course if you want a different transition, you can configure it differently

02:00.850 --> 02:08.920
but what this shows here is how easy it is to actually enable navigation or enable transition combined

02:08.920 --> 02:10.300
with navigation.

02:10.300 --> 02:15.820
Important thing is wrap the router view for which you want to animate with transition and then set

02:15.820 --> 02:21.160
up the transition as you learned it with name, with your classes, possible with javascript hooks,

02:21.520 --> 02:27.740
with the mode and so on, all the things you learned about animations will work just fine with routing.

02:27.790 --> 02:32.560
So simply wrap your router view with the transition component and you're good to go.
