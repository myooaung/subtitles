Welcome to a new module. After learning about directives, forms, components and the vuejs template

00:10.040 --> 00:17.600
syntax in general, I now want to dive into two other nice features vuejs offers us which in some

00:17.600 --> 00:21.660
cases can be really helpful, filters and mixins.

00:21.830 --> 00:28.190
Now both topics don't make up for its own course module because it will see we can walk through it pretty

00:28.190 --> 00:28.840
fast,

00:28.850 --> 00:30.950
that doesn't mean that they're worthless,

00:31.040 --> 00:31.930
not at all.

00:32.030 --> 00:38.570
You will see that filters used rightly as well as mixins can really help you structure your app and

00:38.600 --> 00:40.980
output content in the way you want output.

00:41.150 --> 00:42.920
I want to start with filters.
