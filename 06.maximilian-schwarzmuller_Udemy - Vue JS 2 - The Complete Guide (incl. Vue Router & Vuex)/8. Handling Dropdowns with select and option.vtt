00:01.700 --> 00:08.100
Well we almost just finished our form, let's work on the last type of input here, a select input, a dropdown.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.590
The html code can be found here and here, I want to do two things,

00:13.830 --> 00:17.200
I of course want to use vuejs to get the value

00:17.370 --> 00:23.010
but I also want vuejs to populate this select, this dropdown with options. You see right now,

00:23.040 --> 00:27.690
it's a normal select input here set up with some bootstrap styling

00:27.690 --> 00:32.940
and then we would add a couple of options like this, of course options should also contain a bit more

00:32.940 --> 00:35.740
information than just an opening and closing tag.

00:35.970 --> 00:42.030
The reason why I only have an empty option here is that I want to add them dynamically, so let me go

00:42.030 --> 00:48.080
down into my data property and here, I first want to add an array of options

00:48.090 --> 00:55.800
I want to populate my form with. I'll name it priorities so I'll add a number of different priorities

00:55.830 --> 01:00.670
and here we get high, medium and of course low,

01:00.750 --> 01:03.570
so these are the three options I want to use.

01:03.570 --> 01:10.330
Now do you use that, I'll scroll up to my select here and the first thing I'll do is of course on my option

01:10.330 --> 01:18.540
here, I want to set up a v-for loop to loop through my priority in priorities, like that, priorities here

01:18.540 --> 01:22.350
of course refers to the priorities array I set up down there.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.900
This will create all these options,

01:24.900 --> 01:33.250
now I can also add it here, priority by simply outputting it like this with string interpolation between

01:33.250 --> 01:34.980
the opening and closing tag.

01:35.010 --> 01:42.270
Now this will add a couple of options as we can already see here, high, medium and low.

01:42.270 --> 01:49.170
Now of course you could select another option by default by binding to the selected property, the selected

01:49.170 --> 01:56.460
attribute with colon selected and then as a value for determining if this should be selected, we could

01:56.460 --> 01:58.290
simply check if priority,

01:58.290 --> 02:02.760
so the value of the current loop iteration equals medium,

02:02.760 --> 02:05.520
this is a string with single quotes.

02:05.520 --> 02:11.970
Now this will, once this reloads select medium by default and I of course can still switch to high or

02:11.970 --> 02:12.460
low

02:12.570 --> 02:18.660
but now we change default by simply adding this property bind, this attribute bind here with the colon

02:18.660 --> 02:24.170
and the name of the attribute and then the logic which determines if that should be bound or not

02:24.180 --> 02:29.750
because selected, keep this in mind is an attribute which in the end wants a true or false data field,

02:29.760 --> 02:33.010
so it wants to know whether this should be a selected or not,

02:33.090 --> 02:38.260
so the value we pass to it has to be a condition giving us back true or false

02:38.310 --> 02:41.710
and I do this by checking if priority is medium.

02:41.730 --> 02:44.910
So I'll structure this over multiple lines so it's easier to read,

02:45.120 --> 02:47.100
with that we set up our option,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.110
now of course I want to bind this input,

02:49.110 --> 02:52.300
we're not doing that right now, we're only populating it with values.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.780
So how do I bind my select field here,

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
my select input control?

02:56.940 --> 02:59.840
Of course we do that by using v-model again.

02:59.850 --> 03:05.390
Now important, v-model is now not used on the individual option but on the overall control which is

03:05.390 --> 03:06.490
select here,

03:06.510 --> 03:11.040
so here again, we use v-model and I want to bind

03:11.160 --> 03:17.600
to well a new property I'll create for that, the property I will create is simply named let's

03:17.730 --> 03:25.750
say selected priority and I will set this to high by default.

03:28.390 --> 03:37.000
And now if I go back there and add selected priority as the model which I'm binding and I'll let this reload,

03:37.530 --> 03:40.120
you now see high is selected by default.

03:40.270 --> 03:46.530
Yes I do have my check to override this but it is in the end overwritten by the model we're binding to,

03:46.540 --> 03:48.740
so that's another way to set the default.

03:48.760 --> 03:55.060
We do have our v-model which has a default value, selected priority and this will always override

03:55.180 --> 03:57.360
whatever I set here with selected,

03:57.430 --> 04:03.310
so selected will only work if we're not using v-model here or if we're not pre-populating v-model with

04:03.310 --> 04:04.680
a default value.

04:04.970 --> 04:08.110
So that's the reason why I will remove this code,

04:08.110 --> 04:11.200
keep in mind you could use it though if you don't have a default value.

04:11.470 --> 04:17.270
And with that, I set this up as I wanted with a default value of high selected,

04:17.440 --> 04:22.300
now this also of course means that it works the other way around so that if we change the selection, we'll

04:22.350 --> 04:23.720
update our property,

04:23.920 --> 04:31.940
therefore we can output it here, selected priority in this paragraph. And with that finally, you can see high

04:31.970 --> 04:32.630
down there,

04:32.650 --> 04:37.360
if I change this to low, it changes there too as it does for a change to medium.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.610
And that is the last type of input field I wanted to show you,

04:40.620 --> 04:46.780
that last type of form control we have, the dropdown, the select control here. With that you learned about the

04:46.780 --> 04:54.100
basic html controls we do have and how to use vuejs to get the values, to set the values, to work

04:54.100 --> 04:58.270
with them all the time using v-model.

04:58.270 --> 05:03.730
Now in the next video, we'll have a look at how we can build our own input field, our own form control

05:03.940 --> 05:05.470
by using components.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.590
So let's dive into that in the next video.
