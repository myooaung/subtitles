00:02.160 --> 00:08.860
Let's start solving this exercise. The first task was to put your name and your age,

00:09.030 --> 00:16.390
well we already got the name field so populate this with Max and then it's also important or required

00:16.540 --> 00:19.060
to also add an age field,

00:19.230 --> 00:24.360
so let me quickly do this and I'll set it to 27 since this is my age. Up here,

00:24.360 --> 00:31.510
you can then replace your name with double curly braces for the string interpolation syntax and output

00:31.620 --> 00:35.430
name here, referring to this name property in the data property.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.830
Remember, we don't need this or anything at the beginning,

00:38.880 --> 00:47.090
no this, no data, nothing like that, we can directly access name here. In the parentheses, I then want to output

00:47.300 --> 00:50.680
the age, using the same syntax and referring to age.

00:50.730 --> 00:55.890
If I save this by hitting control enter, we see Max 27 over there,

00:55.890 --> 00:58.570
so this is the first task solved.

00:58.860 --> 01:02.990
The second task was to output my age multiplied by three,

01:03.180 --> 01:05.040
well that's really easy to do,

01:05.040 --> 01:10.710
I'll again use double curly braces to enter this interpolation syntax and then here, I refer to my

01:10.740 --> 01:17.810
age property which I already store due to the first exercise we finished and I simply multiply it by three,

01:17.850 --> 01:23.940
this is how easy we can output a js expression or the result of this expression, as you will see when I

01:23.940 --> 01:24.600
hit enter,

01:24.600 --> 01:26.100
we see 81.

01:26.130 --> 01:30.170
Well I still got some time to get to that point, here

01:30.180 --> 01:37.320
this is how easy we use a javascript expression between the curly braces. The third exercise does something

01:37.320 --> 01:39.190
or requires something similar

01:39.270 --> 01:48.490
but here I don't want to output a simple calculation in here, instead I want to call a function,

01:48.530 --> 01:55.100
so let's first add a method to the methods array down here or the methods object, excuse me and choose

01:55.100 --> 01:56.510
any name you like,

01:56.540 --> 02:08.460
I'm going to name it random and this will be a function where I simply return math.random, this then

02:08.470 --> 02:11.520
allows me up here to call this function

02:11.590 --> 02:13.930
and upon hitting control enter,

02:13.990 --> 02:18.710
we see a random number, changing each time as I repeatedly

02:18.820 --> 02:20.890
well reload this application or reload

02:20.890 --> 02:23.160
this page. This is how easy it is,

02:23.170 --> 02:28.340
the key thing to take away here is that random, that the function call here

02:28.510 --> 02:34.490
just is another javascript expression like in the second exercise. There we executed the code right between

02:34.490 --> 02:35.620
the curly braces,

02:35.620 --> 02:37.080
now we're calling a function

02:37.120 --> 02:44.130
but in both exercise or both tasks, we actually rend some javascript code between the curly braces,

02:44.230 --> 02:49.470
doesn't matter if it is a function call or the code or the calculation itself.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.980
Now it's getting interesting,

02:50.980 --> 02:55.720
we're leaving the world of this curly brace interpolation syntax and instead

02:55.780 --> 02:59.840
here, I now want to search an image on Google and output it here in

02:59.840 --> 03:01.080
my image tag.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.990
Well what could be output?

03:03.250 --> 03:05.120
Well I will be there uncreative

03:05.170 --> 03:12.680
and simply search for vuejs on the images and let's pick, woah this looks really awesome so

03:12.680 --> 03:19.750
let's pick this one. I now want to output this image and of course, I could simply add my link here, hit control

03:19.750 --> 03:24.200
enter and well yeah we almost see it,

03:24.200 --> 03:25.680
it's a bit too big.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.060
So yes, that would be the image,

03:28.230 --> 03:34.580
maybe we should add some style here to make this more visible,

03:34.590 --> 03:37.880
so let's add a width and a height here,

03:41.540 --> 03:41.950
Yeah

03:42.080 --> 03:42.920
that looks better,

03:42.920 --> 03:46.130
of course the dimensions are now messed up but at least we see it.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.540
But anyways this is not how I want to add this image,

03:49.550 --> 03:51.470
I don't want to paste the link in here,

03:51.470 --> 03:57.320
instead I want to store it here in a property in my data field, image, which is a string holding this

03:57.640 --> 03:59.950
URL and then up here,

03:59.960 --> 04:03.010
I simply want to bind this source attribute.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.490
Now we learned that it won't work if I use double curly braces here,

04:06.500 --> 04:08.170
this is not how it works,

04:08.210 --> 04:10.320
this will resolve to an error.

04:10.340 --> 04:11.200
We can try it out,

04:11.210 --> 04:16.740
if I add image here, well we don't see the image clearly because again this is not how it works,

04:16.760 --> 04:21.650
we can't use the curly brace syntax here in a html attribute.

04:21.710 --> 04:26.260
We therefore have to bind it using v-bind, like this.

04:26.570 --> 04:34.320
This now tells vuejs that this source attribute here is no longer directly controlled by html

04:34.340 --> 04:40.760
so to say but instead that now vuejs controls it and sets the value dynamically.

04:40.760 --> 04:46.730
This then allows me to pass the source of this dynamic value which here is the image property between the

04:46.730 --> 04:49.880
quotation marks, important no curly braces here

04:49.940 --> 04:56.320
since we already are in vuejs world due to this v-bind directive here. With that set up, if

04:56.320 --> 05:02.240
I now hit control enter, we now see the image again but setting it dynamically through this link down

05:02.240 --> 05:04.880
there. For the last exercise,

05:04.880 --> 05:10.100
we're kind of doing the same but now with the value of this input

05:10.100 --> 05:17.270
and again the first ID I might be to use the curly braces here and output name and that of course won't

05:17.270 --> 05:22.450
work, we see curly braces name down there now because again, this is not how it works,

05:22.460 --> 05:24.770
we can't use curly braces here.

05:24.770 --> 05:32.650
Instead we will again use v-bind to bind this value attribute using the v-bind directive in vuejs to therefore

05:32.690 --> 05:38.660
now make this dynamic and allowing us to now simply pass the property name between the quotation

05:38.660 --> 05:39.210
marks

05:39.320 --> 05:44.390
thus upon hitting control enter, we now see my real name down there.

05:44.390 --> 05:51.410
This word, the first exercise in outputting data should have been too complicated but yet it's very

05:51.410 --> 05:57.020
important to get this right, to understand these core mechanics because we're going to use them throughout

05:57.030 --> 05:57.720
this course

05:57.830 --> 06:03.340
and if you get some issues here, now is the time to get 100% clear about what you're doing

06:03.470 --> 06:09.230
because we will need this and everything else kind of builds up on that. With that, let's continue with the

06:09.230 --> 06:10.270
next lectures.
