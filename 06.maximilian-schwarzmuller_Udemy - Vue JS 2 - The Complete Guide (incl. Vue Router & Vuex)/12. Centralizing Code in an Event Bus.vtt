One more word to this eventBus here, of course it would also be possible in the main.js file where we

00:07.760 --> 00:15.700
create this new vue instance to add a method here, so let's say name it changeAge

00:16.100 --> 00:26.330
and in this method, to basically set this emit, let's say we have to pass the age to the changeAge method,

00:26.830 --> 00:32.610
emit event which is called age was edited as well and pass age here,

00:32.660 --> 00:38.270
so now we have the emit logic in the eventBus. And then in the user edit component, I'm going to comment this

00:38.270 --> 00:39.450
out too,

00:39.530 --> 00:48.560
I can now simply use the eventBus and call changeAge there and pass this user age

00:48.560 --> 00:53.810
we updated here in the user edit component, like this.

00:53.810 --> 00:59.580
With this set up, if I reload the app, it still works as before

00:59.690 --> 01:05.660
and why did I show this to you? Because I want to show you that you can use such a vue instance like the

01:05.690 --> 01:10.150
eventBus here generally to store some centralized code

01:10.160 --> 01:15.180
you want to access from different places in your app like here where we emit this event.

01:15.410 --> 01:21.650
This makes especially sense if you have some code which you don't want to duplicate in different places

01:21.890 --> 01:24.680
but instead which you want to store centrally,

01:24.710 --> 01:26.960
you don't need to emit events all the time,

01:26.960 --> 01:32.350
this could be any code here accessible from anywhere in your application

01:32.390 --> 01:39.110
as long as you import it and then well access the methods you provide on this bus and the same would

01:39.110 --> 01:41.150
be true for data you provide there.

01:41.240 --> 01:47.510
If you set up some data properties here, as a side note here not as a function but directly as

01:47.510 --> 01:53.930
an object, as this is a new instance, if you set up some data properties here, you can also access that from

01:53.960 --> 01:55.910
all over your application.

01:56.300 --> 02:04.730
So it's perfectly fine to use such a new vue instance to centralize certain tasks, submit data, transport

02:04.730 --> 02:11.960
data across your application and therefore outsource certain pieces of your code into such a central

02:11.960 --> 02:12.760
place.
