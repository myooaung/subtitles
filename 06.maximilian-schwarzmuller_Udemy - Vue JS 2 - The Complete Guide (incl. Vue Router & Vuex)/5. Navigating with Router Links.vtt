00:01.570 --> 00:09.250
Well in order to be able to navigate, I want to include some links obviously and for that to be included,

00:09.250 --> 00:15.340
I'll quickly create a new component which I'll simply name header.vue and in there, I simply want

00:15.340 --> 00:21.970
to have a template and now I will grab some nice links from getbootstrap.com/components

00:22.480 --> 00:23.930
and there from navs,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.250
I like this pills look here,

00:26.260 --> 00:32.500
so I will quickly copy this snippet over to my template and there, I want to have two links

00:32.500 --> 00:34.570
for now, I want to have my home link,

00:34.570 --> 00:35.270
that's correct

00:35.290 --> 00:36.520
and then the user link.

00:36.790 --> 00:41.530
I didn't want to have the active class on it though because I don't know if it will always be active,

00:41.530 --> 00:46.190
we'll come back to marking a link as active in one of the next videos too.

00:46.210 --> 00:50.160
So now I got both links with my anchor tags, though

00:50.260 --> 00:52.090
I don't want to use them like this,

00:52.090 --> 00:56.600
I don't want to use the ref attribute because that would always send a request to the server

00:56.620 --> 01:01.960
and even though that would be handled correctly, I don't want to do it like this because first of all

01:01.960 --> 01:09.280
that would limit the way how I can set up the links I visit and I will come back to this and it will

01:09.280 --> 01:11.670
also mean I always send the request

01:11.680 --> 01:17.140
but if I'm already on the page and I click on this, it would be better if the request doesn't get sent

01:17.140 --> 01:20.700
in the first place because I know I don't want to leave the application.

01:20.890 --> 01:27.700
Well for this, vuejs gives us a nice little alternative to using an anchor tag at all, so we're

01:27.700 --> 01:35.830
going to remove it and instead use a component the vue router ships with. It's called router link and it

01:35.830 --> 01:37.980
will render an anchor tag in the end

01:38.020 --> 01:44.770
so you wrap your content with this router link here but it allows you to set it up differently than

01:44.770 --> 01:46.150
the normal anchor tag.

01:46.510 --> 01:49.990
What you do set up here for example is you pass the to attribute,

01:49.990 --> 01:54.160
you can also dynamically bind this by adding a colon in front of it of course, we will see this in one of

01:54.160 --> 01:58.550
the next videos too and then to is simply the path you want to navigate to.

01:58.560 --> 02:05.950
This can either be a relative path like user, now it'll always be appended to the current URL or

02:05.950 --> 02:12.220
/user or /home or just slash in this case to append it to the end of your domain instead of the

02:12.220 --> 02:13.310
end of your current

02:13.420 --> 02:18.550
URL and here, we would have /user for example.

02:18.550 --> 02:26.080
Now by setting it up like this, if we go back to our application and well maybe also include it here, that

02:26.080 --> 02:34.930
would also help so also quickly import the header from components header.vue file and then register it

02:35.020 --> 02:37.070
as a local component here,

02:37.270 --> 02:40.300
so app header shall be our header

02:40.600 --> 02:45.440
and now I want to add it above my loaded component let's say, like this.

02:45.460 --> 02:50.410
With that in place, we now see our links here and you see, it works,

02:50.500 --> 02:54.790
if we inspect such a link here, we see it is an anchor tag,

02:54.790 --> 02:55.900
this is what I told you,

02:55.900 --> 02:57.990
it gets replaced by an anchor tag

02:58.010 --> 03:05.250
even though we used router link in our code. You also see that it has this class attached to it,

03:05.260 --> 03:08.820
this route link active class but only if it is active,

03:08.950 --> 03:14.770
we're going to take advantage of this class soon. For now the great thing is we got our working routing

03:15.010 --> 03:19.870
and the interesting thing is if you click this link, it's actually not reloading the page,

03:19.870 --> 03:24.340
you can tell by it not playing this reload animation up there.

03:24.340 --> 03:30.320
It doesn't do that because since we used router link, there's an implicit click listener attached to it,

03:30.340 --> 03:34.920
so if you click on it, it doesn't do the default behavior of sending a request,

03:34.960 --> 03:38.410
instead it simply listens to the click and loads the correct route

03:38.440 --> 03:42.940
which is one of the big advantages of using router link instead of the normal anchor tag.
