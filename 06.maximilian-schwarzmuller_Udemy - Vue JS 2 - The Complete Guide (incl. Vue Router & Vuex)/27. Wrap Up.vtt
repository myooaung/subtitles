WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:06.120
Well, in this module we really learned a lot about routing,

00:06.130 --> 00:10.350
we really took a deep dive into the vuejs router.

00:10.570 --> 00:17.080
We learned so much about setting up routes, navigating, passing parameters, reacting to parameter changes,

00:17.080 --> 00:24.070
passing query parameters, scrolling, loading components, lazy loading, protecting guards with guards, protecting

00:24.070 --> 00:26.440
routes with guards and so much more.

00:26.650 --> 00:33.550
I think you're well-prepared to now use this router in your application and build a real big single

00:33.550 --> 00:35.140
page application with it.

00:35.380 --> 00:42.460
Actually, we will soon build a bigger single page application in this course right after the next module

00:42.810 --> 00:47.390
and I can only encourage you as always to play around with that and practice it,

00:47.410 --> 00:54.070
set your own challenges, create your own little test applications and navigate around like crazy to really

00:54.070 --> 00:59.150
understand how this all works and which features it has and how you may use them.

00:59.150 --> 01:00.440
See you in the next module.
