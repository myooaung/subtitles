Let's dive into authenticating users, as I mentioned I'll use firebase since it's a ready to use backend

00:09.500 --> 00:15.980
because I don't want to focus on the backend logic, that is something for a node, PHP, Ruby or whatever

00:15.980 --> 00:23.090
backend language you'll use in course. On firebase, we can simply get working authentication by going to the

00:23.090 --> 00:30.350
authentication area and then selecting a sign in method and I want to use the traditional method of

00:30.470 --> 00:33.940
storing email and password on our own server,

00:34.040 --> 00:37.750
here on the firebase servers. For that, I'll

00:37.790 --> 00:44.460
click on email password and I'll simply enable it by setting the switch to enabled and hitting save,

00:44.480 --> 00:49.280
now users can sign in with their email and password.

00:49.280 --> 00:54.130
Now let's also go to the database and there on the rules tab,

00:54.320 --> 01:02.210
I want to ensure that we only grant read access to users if we are authenticated.

01:02.570 --> 01:10.700
So on read, I will revert this to auth unequal to null, auth is some object firebase knows which simply

01:10.700 --> 01:15.570
means is the user authenticated, it stores information about the authenticated user

01:15.740 --> 01:19.430
and if this is null, then it means the user is not authenticated,

01:19.550 --> 01:21.010
so by checking if it's not

01:21.020 --> 01:28.100
null, we check if the user is authenticated. So let's simply publish it and with that, we already should

01:28.100 --> 01:29.090
see one effect,

01:29.150 --> 01:35.180
if we go back to the application and reload this page on the dashboard, we actually get an unauthorized

01:35.240 --> 01:37.100
error here and that's good,

01:37.100 --> 01:38.810
now we'll fix this later.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.260
So important, we enabled authentication,

01:42.260 --> 01:45.760
now we could authenticate through the firebase SDK

01:45.920 --> 01:53.000
but actually I want to show you an approach which is reusable with any backend which is a restful API.

01:53.300 --> 02:01.280
And thankfully, firebase also gives us some rest API endpoints we can use to create new users or sign

02:01.280 --> 02:02.700
existing users in,

02:02.900 --> 02:07.960
you can find these endpoints by simply searching for firebase auth rest API,

02:08.270 --> 02:14.970
then it should be the first result, the referenced documentation for this rest API

02:15.170 --> 02:21.500
and there on the right, you see a couple of well typical tasks like sign up with email and password.

02:22.100 --> 02:27.500
Then you see the rest API endpoint to which you have to send that request and the data which you should

02:27.500 --> 02:28.510
pass along.

02:28.580 --> 02:33.170
Now we'll of course do this together, we'll do this in the next lecture.
