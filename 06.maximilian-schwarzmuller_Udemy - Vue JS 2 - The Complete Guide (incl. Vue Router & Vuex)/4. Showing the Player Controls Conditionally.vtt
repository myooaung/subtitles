00:02.030 --> 00:03.610
We get the health bars in place,

00:03.620 --> 00:10.060
now we want to be able to start a new game and switch from non-game mode to game mode.

00:10.280 --> 00:17.030
Remember we're tracking the current mode here with the game is running property and well, since we do track

00:17.030 --> 00:24.440
it here, it would be a great start to go to the section holding our start new game button and add the v-if

00:24.440 --> 00:29.620
directive here to conditionally show the section or not show it.

00:30.310 --> 00:37.060
We only want to show it if a new game is not running, so if game running is false. In this case I will

00:37.060 --> 00:42.930
show the start new game button, so here I will check if game is running is false,

00:42.940 --> 00:45.990
that's why I have this exclamation mark at the beginning.

00:46.060 --> 00:51.850
On the other hand on the section below, where I have my special buttons, the attack button and so on,

00:52.030 --> 01:00.010
I could now said v-if equals game is running simply to check if this is true or simply check v-else

01:00.010 --> 01:00.590
here,

01:00.730 --> 01:06.220
since the first v-if is placed on a section and the element directly following that is the one we

01:06.220 --> 01:09.970
want to conditionally show if the first condition is not met,

01:09.970 --> 01:16.390
so if this block here is not shown, we can use v-else here to alternate between this section and this

01:16.390 --> 01:17.270
section.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.130
Important,

01:18.130 --> 01:23.650
these have to follow each other and have to be of the same type, so both have to be an element of type

01:23.650 --> 01:24.300
section,

01:24.340 --> 01:30.100
we couldn't use v-else if that were a div, in this case you would have to set up v-if here instead

01:30.100 --> 01:31.710
of using v-else.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.220
So this now

01:33.370 --> 01:39.040
should show the right thing and we can check this if we save it and reload,

01:39.100 --> 01:41.110
now the action buttons are gone,

01:41.110 --> 01:43.130
we only see start new game.

01:43.180 --> 01:48.400
Now of course the button doesn't do anything because we haven't hooked it up but at least we are now

01:48.400 --> 01:50.240
showing the right thing.

01:50.410 --> 01:55.700
Next of course we want to hook up this button so that we can change from

01:55.900 --> 01:58.940
well game is not running to game is running.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.060
Let's do this next.
