00:01.900 --> 00:08.590
Thus far, we always used default inputs, default controls html gives us, there is nothing wrong with

00:08.590 --> 00:09.010
that.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.710
Chances are high that this will cover all you need

00:11.950 --> 00:13.980
but let's say you want to build your own,

00:13.990 --> 00:16.260
you want to build your own input, here

00:16.300 --> 00:20.390
I want to build a little switch which I can toggle between on and off

00:20.740 --> 00:25.210
and to do this, I will build my own component which has this logic in it,

00:25.210 --> 00:31.000
let's start with that. To build our own component which works as an input,

00:31.030 --> 00:34.260
we have to understand what v-model does behind the scenes.

00:34.270 --> 00:35.820
I'll explain it here at

00:35.920 --> 00:37.910
the user data field.

00:38.740 --> 00:41.860
V-model does two things behind the scenes,

00:41.860 --> 00:44.860
it binds to the value with colon value

00:44.890 --> 00:49.010
or of course the longer form would be v-bind value.

00:49.300 --> 00:56.380
So it binds the value of that and it binds it of course to user data e-mail,

00:56.440 --> 01:05.430
it also simply gives us the @input listener or of course @change

01:05.530 --> 01:12.090
if we use the modifier, the lazy modifier but here, I'll use @input which is the default.

01:12.280 --> 01:18.650
And here it then listens to changes where it then simply sets user data

01:18.890 --> 01:22.620
email equal to event,

01:22.810 --> 01:29.110
that's the normal event the dom kind of creates for us, the normal javascript event, there we want to get

01:29.110 --> 01:35.950
access to this element which was the root for this event, the target, this input field and then value.

01:36.010 --> 01:41.350
Now with this setup, what you will see is that if I go back and I enter an email address here, it still

01:41.370 --> 01:42.510
appears down there,

01:42.610 --> 01:44.650
so we get the same behavior as before,

01:44.830 --> 01:47.810
if I remove the M, it also updates there.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.460
So I get the same behavior,

01:49.480 --> 01:51.810
now that's my manual v-model,

01:51.820 --> 01:54.640
it's the same thing v-model does behind the scenes

01:54.640 --> 02:00.970
but just now in the longer form, I'll leave it like this so that we can always see that. Now that we know

02:00.970 --> 02:07.360
how v-model works behind the scenes, we know how our own component has to work to be able to be usable

02:07.360 --> 02:08.770
with v-model,

02:08.770 --> 02:15.220
it has to have a prop named value so that v-model is able to pass a value into our component and

02:15.220 --> 02:20.450
it has to emit an event called input to allow v-model to react to that.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.170
Well with these two information pieces, we can create our own component,

02:26.170 --> 02:28.310
I'll name it switch,

02:28.520 --> 02:35.530
so a switch.vue file will house it, here I'll have a template and I'll need a script and I'll also

02:35.530 --> 02:41.180
need some styling, whoops, style like that. With that let's work on our own component,

02:41.230 --> 02:46.450
set up a nice little template, html template and styling and then add the javascript logic to make it

02:46.450 --> 02:47.390
work correctly.
