00:02.160 --> 00:06.780
We already saw quite a lot of the very nice features the new cli offers us.

00:06.840 --> 00:15.420
Now one common thing you need in bigger apps is environment variables, environment variables are configuration

00:15.420 --> 00:20.410
variables you could say or global values which you want to inject into your app,

00:20.520 --> 00:27.720
for example URLs which then might differ in the production and in the development environment.

00:27.720 --> 00:34.440
A good example would be API keys or URLs, for your testing environment you might reach out

00:34.440 --> 00:43.050
to some testing API or to an API with a test API key which has a lot of access rights for example attached

00:43.050 --> 00:47.680
to it. For production you don't want to use that same key or that same URL,

00:47.700 --> 00:53.310
instead you want to use a production ready URL and you want to swap that API URL or that API

00:53.310 --> 00:54.210
key.

00:54.270 --> 00:59.130
Now obviously you can manually add it your code right before you build your app for production but it would

00:59.130 --> 01:05.090
be nicer if you could simply store your values and then automatically inject them into your code

01:05.130 --> 01:09.690
and just reference these global values and have them replaced automatically

01:09.690 --> 01:11.210
and the cli supports that,

01:11.220 --> 01:12.680
let me show you how this works.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.810
Not at the example of http request I send

01:15.900 --> 01:19.350
but still of a URL I want to output, let's say.

01:19.380 --> 01:25.050
So in my home.vue file which is basically that page which is loaded here, let's output something

01:25.050 --> 01:32.180
there and there, I will add h1 tag or let's say a paragraph to make it less big, a paragraph where

01:32.280 --> 01:34.870
I say hello just to see that this works,

01:34.900 --> 01:35.970
yes there it is

01:36.100 --> 01:42.020
and now let's say we want to output a URL here, the URL to which we would normally send a http request,

01:42.030 --> 01:43.410
now obviously we can send it there.

01:43.410 --> 01:51.970
So here I have my dev.api.com URL and this is as the name suggests, my development API, let's

01:51.980 --> 01:59.540
say. So for development it's fine that this gets printed but if I now build this for production, I don't

01:59.540 --> 02:01.430
want to use that,

02:01.460 --> 02:05.210
so for that, I don't want to hardcode it in there,

02:05.210 --> 02:11.990
instead I want to store it in some environment variable file which is then handled by the vue cli. For that

02:11.990 --> 02:20.800
I can create a new file here in my project folder which I name .env. Now .env is a file which will

02:20.830 --> 02:28.090
automatically be picked up by the cli where I can store values which I can use in my project, environment

02:28.090 --> 02:35.800
variables are simply key value pairs and there, you can add a VUE_APP_URL name and

02:35.800 --> 02:42.250
then an equal sign and then the value which could be my https://dev.api.com value.

02:42.250 --> 02:50.300
Now with that added, if you save that, you can reference this name in your components or in your code,

02:50.310 --> 02:51.560
not just in the components,

02:51.630 --> 02:57.390
you could of course also use it in your vue instances, so there you could use it in computed properties,

02:57.390 --> 03:00.840
in watchers, anywhere, you can use it in your entire project

03:00.840 --> 03:02.780
essentially, it's injected everywhere,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.360
you can use it in the vuex store,

03:04.380 --> 03:09.930
you can use it everywhere. And actually I will use it in such a way here in home.vue, there

03:09.990 --> 03:17.520
I can direct the output in my template because it's injected into my code but it's not set up as a

03:17.520 --> 03:18.190
vue

03:18.290 --> 03:21.500
instance data property which I could output here,

03:21.780 --> 03:25.060
so instead it will be available in all my javascript code,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.840
so let's add my script tag there.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.360
This creates the vue instance for this component or allows us to configure it

03:30.360 --> 03:36.270
I should say and there, I can add that data field which has to be a function here as you learned when

03:36.300 --> 03:46.460
I return my URL let's say and here, I then reference process.env.VUE_APP_URL,

03:46.530 --> 03:47.410
that's important.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.710
You don't use just the name like this,

03:49.740 --> 03:57.890
instead you add process.env. and this is simply a hardcoded or a provided object

03:57.890 --> 04:03.030
you could say, provided to you by the vue cli which gives you access to your global variables.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.240
And now we can then use that URL property here

04:06.420 --> 04:12.000
in our paragraph with string interpolation like this, before we see that though, I need to restart my

04:12.000 --> 04:20.150
dev server for it to pick up that env file and really take it into account in its configuration. Once this

04:20.200 --> 04:21.830
is done after reloading,

04:21.840 --> 04:28.770
you see that URL here. Now of course, I mentioned that we could use that to swap that value and right

04:28.790 --> 04:35.040
now, we have a global place where we can manage it which already is nice and suffices in some cases

04:35.060 --> 04:40.460
because now at least you can manage your URL here and if you use it in different components, you

04:40.460 --> 04:43.030
only have to change it in one place to change it everywhere so

04:43.130 --> 04:48.040
that's already great but to also get that different value thing going,

04:48.140 --> 04:52.860
you can simply add another file here and that is the .env.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.840
and now you've got different modes.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.230
You've got three modes out of the box,

04:57.290 --> 05:02.030
you got a development mode, you got a test mode and you got a production mode and these modes

05:02.480 --> 05:08.130
are simply global configurations automatically managed and handled and set by the vue cli.

05:08.420 --> 05:16.220
So if you name that file .env.development, then this file will be used during development, 

05:16.220 --> 05:22.070
so now if I take my vue app URL here and added into this file and here I use dev and for

05:22.070 --> 05:27.500
the other file, I use just api.com, without dev like this,

05:27.580 --> 05:33.700
then you will see that this .env.development will be used after restarting the server

05:33.710 --> 05:35.340
here with npm run serve.

05:35.410 --> 05:40.750
So after restarting this, we should now see dev here in our page still,

05:40.780 --> 05:47.850
so if we reload this, we still see dev API and not this URL which I set up in the .env file, which

05:47.850 --> 05:48.810
we previously used.

05:48.900 --> 05:54.810
So it now uses this file because of the development because this is one of the default modes the cli

05:54.830 --> 05:55.870
supports

05:55.920 --> 05:58.780
and as I said, alternatives are production

05:58.860 --> 06:04.770
so if you had a .env.production file, then this one would get used for production builds which you

06:04.800 --> 06:12.570
by the way create by running npm run build, this will automatically set mode production and you have

06:12.570 --> 06:18.390
a test mode too, for that you can add a .env.test file. And you don't need to add all these files,

06:18.660 --> 06:22.470
only need them in places where you really want to overwrite some setting,

06:22.500 --> 06:25.190
so I will get rid of test and production here

06:25.320 --> 06:30.630
but if you need that, if you need to get rid of a setting and overwrite it, then these files help you

06:30.630 --> 06:37.900
with that because they will then overwrite any keys you might set in other env files.

06:37.950 --> 06:44.240
And one important note about the key names, I named mine VUE_APP_URL,

06:44.280 --> 06:45.790
now you need to name it

06:45.840 --> 06:51.660
VUE_APP and then your name for it to be available in your client side,

06:51.660 --> 06:53.570
so in your vue code.

06:53.850 --> 06:58.660
So as we are using it here in the home.vue by accessing process env

06:58.800 --> 06:59.680
and then the name,

06:59.790 --> 07:03.290
this only works because it starts with vue app.

07:03.330 --> 07:10.220
If I had name it just my cool name, then it would not be available there,

07:10.230 --> 07:17.250
so for your environment variables to be available in your vue code, they need to start with VUE_APP_

07:17.250 --> 07:19.850
and then your name.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.280
This is really important otherwise,

07:22.310 --> 07:25.900
well you can try it but otherwise it just won't work.
