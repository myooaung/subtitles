This is especially important to keep in mind because in our vue instance, if we here wanted to output the

00:09.540 --> 00:15.450
title in this function so we don't want to return hello but we want to return a title, then this

00:15.450 --> 00:21.570
will not work because unlike in the template where we do have direct access to all these properties

00:21.570 --> 00:28.580
and methods, vuejs proxies them for us, here in the javascript code, that does not work.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.550
But we still have an easy access,

00:31.560 --> 00:36.950
you notice that the title property sits on an object which is called data

00:37.170 --> 00:44.730
and normally we wouldn't be able to access it by calling this title because this would not refer to

00:44.730 --> 00:46.660
this data object here.

00:47.230 --> 00:51.070
Thankfully vuejs also provides us some magic here,

00:51.080 --> 00:56.070
it proxies these properties and the same is by the way true for the method

00:56.070 --> 00:59.260
so it would also work that we call a method like this.

00:59.400 --> 01:08.040
It proxies them in a way that by simply calling this anywhere in our vue instance object here will give us

01:08.070 --> 01:13.020
access to these proxy properties, methods, whatever it is,

01:13.020 --> 01:19.200
so we can call this title to access the title in the data field because behind the scenes and I will

01:19.200 --> 01:20.590
come back to this in the vuejs

01:20.600 --> 01:20.840
.

01:20.850 --> 01:28.020
instance module in this course, behind the scenes, vuejs kind of creates an easy access for us to

01:28.040 --> 01:29.600
these properties.

01:29.700 --> 01:35.190
That is the important thing to keep in mind here and especially keep in mind, there is a difference in

01:35.190 --> 01:35.880
a template,

01:35.880 --> 01:37.000
we don't need this,

01:37.050 --> 01:42.990
here we do. Well and with this change in place, if I update it again we see hello world again but this

01:42.990 --> 01:47.340
time by calling a function which now accesses our title property.
