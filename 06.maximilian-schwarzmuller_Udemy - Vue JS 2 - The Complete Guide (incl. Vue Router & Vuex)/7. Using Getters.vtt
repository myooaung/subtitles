00:01.750 --> 00:05.330
So we want to outsource this calculation here into a getter,

00:05.530 --> 00:11.500
let's go back to our store.js file and here we can add a new property, besides the state,

00:11.560 --> 00:17.310
we now also get some getters and that of course also is a reserved word kind of, it's a property vuex

00:17.350 --> 00:18.160
will look for,

00:18.160 --> 00:22.370
so you must name this getters, it cannot be named differently.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.870
So getters is then again an object where we can set up as many getters as we want

00:27.870 --> 00:30.930
and now you are free to choose which ever name you want to use,

00:31.090 --> 00:39.130
for example here doubleCounter could be the name for the getter and doubleCounter actually is a function

00:39.510 --> 00:42.380
where we do get the state as an argument,

00:42.400 --> 00:48.730
this is passed automatically by vuex when this function is executed which is also done by vuex

00:49.600 --> 00:55.660
and in the body of this function here, we can do whatever we want to do with the state.

00:56.080 --> 01:03.130
So if our goal is to basically double the counter, then we would need to return of course because we

01:03.130 --> 01:10.870
want to access this value in the end, state counter times two, that's all.

01:10.870 --> 01:16.860
Now with this getter in place, we now need to access the getter in our components,

01:17.230 --> 01:23.770
well we can do so by going to the component and here, we still keep the counter computed property

01:24.010 --> 01:33.700
but now here I simply return this.$store.getters.doubleCounter, I don't execute it though, that is something

01:33.790 --> 01:36.110
vuex will do for me.

01:36.190 --> 01:42.460
Now with this set up, I can simply copy this, go over to my other result and insert it here

01:42.580 --> 01:46.650
and yes I know, character-wise this didn't get shorter,

01:46.660 --> 01:51.190
keep in mind, this doubled calculation is only an example,

01:51.220 --> 01:55.200
we're talking about an application where you have more complex code

01:55.450 --> 02:02.370
but having such application here as an example would then again pull the focus from vuex,

02:02.380 --> 02:04.560
so that is why I decided to use this.

02:04.810 --> 02:11.560
So now we're using getters in both result components to get our counter and it's in this getter where

02:11.560 --> 02:13.080
we now run the calculation

02:13.090 --> 02:18.520
and again, this could be a more complicated calculation. If we save this and have a look at our running

02:18.520 --> 02:19.620
application,

02:19.720 --> 02:26.890
you see it still works as before but now with getters in place and whilst we didn't save that many characters

02:26.890 --> 02:27.330
here,

02:27.340 --> 02:29.490
actually I think we're using more now,

02:29.800 --> 02:35.260
I think you are able to see that if we would have multiple components and more complex calculations,

02:35.620 --> 02:37.980
this would really save us some time.
