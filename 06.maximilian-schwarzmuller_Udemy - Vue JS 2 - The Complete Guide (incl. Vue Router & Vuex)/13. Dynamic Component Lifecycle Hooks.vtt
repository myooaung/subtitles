We're able to keep our components alive with keep-alive here, now as it is kept alive, we lose the

00:09.300 --> 00:10.850
destroyed lifecycle hook.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.240
What if we wanted to react to the navigating away so that another component gets loaded? We do have

00:17.240 --> 00:22.740
two lifecycle hooks to control if a dynamic component is currently visited,

00:22.760 --> 00:29.180
so if it was activated or if we navigate it away, so if it was deactivated and that were the two names

00:29.180 --> 00:30.880
of these lifecycle hooks.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.460
So in the new component, I can implement them here,

00:34.490 --> 00:37.080
the first one is deactivated,

00:37.130 --> 00:43.350
this will be executed whenever we are on the component and load another one, another dynamic component,

00:43.550 --> 00:52.820
so here I will simply log deactivated and the other hook is the activated method, well and that

00:52.850 --> 00:55.440
obviously is called whenever we do load

00:55.560 --> 00:59.770
this dynamic component here, so activated like this.

01:00.050 --> 01:08.590
And now if we let this reload, let's go to new and you see activated gets executed

01:08.780 --> 01:09.410
and when I click

01:09.500 --> 01:11.590
author, we see deactivated.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.570
So these are these two new lifecycle hooks we can use now.
