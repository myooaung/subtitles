00:01.750 --> 00:03.810
So let's try to solve this together,

00:03.850 --> 00:10.090
make sure to download the setup for this project attached to the last lecture and the special thing

00:10.090 --> 00:12.310
is that there, we also get this font,

00:12.370 --> 00:16.510
already imported this handwritten font I'm using.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.820
So let's think appout this application,

00:18.820 --> 00:25.520
how do we want to structure, which parts should this application have? Well it should have a header,

00:25.610 --> 00:27.480
this progress bar,

00:27.620 --> 00:30.170
we also want a place where we create new quotes,

00:30.200 --> 00:36.860
this text area in the button and then a place where we display all the quotes, where each single quote

00:36.920 --> 00:38.710
is a component on its own.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.570
So we get four components thus far, header,

00:41.620 --> 00:45.240
new quote, all quotes and then a single quote,

00:45.500 --> 00:52.390
well and this info message at the bottom, we can simply put it in our main root object, the app.vue

00:52.400 --> 00:53.550
file.

00:53.570 --> 01:00.950
This would be how we could structure that and how we could logically break that into single pieces with

01:00.950 --> 01:02.770
their own business logic.

01:03.110 --> 01:10.610
Well I'd say let's get started working on this grid and then adding the possibility to add new quotes

01:10.790 --> 01:14.260
before we finish that all with tracking the state,

01:14.270 --> 01:19.520
so tracking the number of quotes and adding the progress bar to display the current state.
