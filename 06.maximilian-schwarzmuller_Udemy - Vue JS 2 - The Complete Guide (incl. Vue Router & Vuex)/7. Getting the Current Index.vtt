What if you not only wanted to display the string but also the position, so the index of the item.

00:07.640 --> 00:12.260
So let's say you wanted to say ingredient and then in parentheses, that is no syntax

00:12.260 --> 00:17.050
by the way, that's just normal text here, then here you wanted to display the index,

00:17.090 --> 00:21.030
so with double curly braces. I want to get access to

00:21.050 --> 00:23.410
well the index, let's name it i.

00:23.570 --> 00:30.710
Well i is not defined, it neither is a property in my vue instance down here nor is it available through

00:30.730 --> 00:32.060
this loop here.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.890
We can make it available,

00:33.890 --> 00:40.430
we were able to specify ingredient here as a name for the very well, the current value of our loop iteration

00:40.430 --> 00:41.210
has,

00:41.330 --> 00:43.760
we can also alter the syntax.

00:43.790 --> 00:50.840
I can set up parentheses here and now not only extract the ingredient, so the current item but also the

00:50.900 --> 00:54.840
index of the current item by simply adding it here with a comma.

00:54.980 --> 00:55.540
Let's name it

00:55.580 --> 00:58.020
i because I use i over there,

00:58.250 --> 01:01.180
let me make this a bit broader so that we can easier read it.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.080
So i here refers to this i, an ingredient to this.

01:05.090 --> 01:09.150
So with that, we're setting our own names, this is totally up to you,

01:09.170 --> 01:14.840
these two names here. We're setting these names and we're extracting first and the order is important,

01:14.930 --> 01:18.970
first the current element and second, the index of that element.

01:19.130 --> 01:27.060
If we now hit control enter, you see our ingredients followed by the index of this ingredient, again

01:27.200 --> 01:30.730
just going to emphasize this, the order is important here,

01:30.740 --> 01:36.290
the first element in this parentheses is always the element, the value of the element in this array and

01:36.290 --> 01:37.850
the second element, i

01:37.960 --> 01:42.660
in this case is always the index of this element in this array.

01:42.680 --> 01:48.320
This is how easy a looping or dynamically outputting content with a loop is in vuejs.
