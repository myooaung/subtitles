Let's stick to this example and let's say I want to have a data or this data object here as well as

00:08.460 --> 00:14.730
this computed property, filtered fruits in both my list and my app.vue file. For this,

00:14.730 --> 00:21.840
I will create such a mixin, so we want to outsource all that code into such a mixin and here, I'll

00:21.840 --> 00:26.930
create a new file in the source folder which I'll name fruitmixin.js,

00:26.970 --> 00:33.500
name is totally up to you and there I will export a constant, fruitmixin is the name I'll choose

00:33.660 --> 00:36.670
and this will be a javascript object which holds all the data

00:36.700 --> 00:39.940
I just copied or cut from my component.

00:40.230 --> 00:46.080
Now with that, I can go back to my list here and I want to import this newly created mixin which I export

00:46.080 --> 00:46.630
there,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.170
so I import that from my fruit mixin file

00:51.380 --> 00:54.480
and the thing I want to import of course is my fruit mixin

00:54.740 --> 01:01.850
and now I can simply replace the data here with the mixins property on that vue instance which is an array

01:02.120 --> 01:07.160
where I specify all the mixin, so all the code snippets I want to add to this instance.

01:07.160 --> 01:13.670
Now if I save this and navigate back to the app, you see this still works as before

01:13.790 --> 01:20.090
but now we're sharing this code which also means I can now go to my app.vue file and here, I

01:20.090 --> 01:25.760
get also my text in the data field so I'm not completely removing it, I'm only removing fruits and this

01:25.850 --> 01:36.470
and remove the computed property here and now here, I will also import this fruit mixin I just created

01:36.890 --> 01:45.740
from the fruit mixin file I just created, this one here and I will add mixins here too, the

01:45.740 --> 01:47.000
fruit mixin.

01:47.390 --> 01:51.540
If I save this and reload, let's also reload the app here,

01:51.560 --> 01:55.030
you see it still works in my app.vue file again.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.910
And interesting enough, here we still have the data property

01:58.910 --> 02:04.970
so even though we mixin a new one, we can clearly see as we see the string up here still exists that

02:05.080 --> 02:10.620
vuejs cleverly merges our mixin and the already existing data

02:10.670 --> 02:14.760
in our app.vue file or in any instance where we add a mixin.

02:15.020 --> 02:17.870
So this is how we generally create and use mixins,

02:17.960 --> 02:23.080
let me dive into that merging process and some other really interesting things about mixins.
