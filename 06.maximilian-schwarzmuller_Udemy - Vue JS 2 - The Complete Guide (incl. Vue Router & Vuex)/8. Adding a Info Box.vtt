Let's implement the functionality to delete quotes. For that,

00:06.780 --> 00:14.190
I first of all in the app.vue file want to add the little info box telling me that I should click on a quote

00:14.190 --> 00:17.940
to delete it. For that I'll use a bootstrap row

00:18.210 --> 00:25.230
and in that row, simply a column which spans over the whole width and in there,

00:25.450 --> 00:32.520
I also want to center my text, text center is a helper class provided by bootstrap which does just that.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.560
And then I will have an alert,

00:34.610 --> 00:41.560
this is the box with the rounded corner but to not make it red, I'll add the alert info class

00:41.770 --> 00:47.600
and then I can simply say info click on a quote to delete it, like this,

00:47.740 --> 00:50.330
delete with lowercase d.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.870
Now we see the box here,

00:52.030 --> 00:57.970
now to make quotes deletable, I need to make them clickable and then when I click them, I kind

00:57.970 --> 01:02.450
of need to access my array here and delete the quote from it.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.770
Let's do that next.
