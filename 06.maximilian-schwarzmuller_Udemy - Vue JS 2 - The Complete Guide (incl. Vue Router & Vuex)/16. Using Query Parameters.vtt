So far, we learned how to navigate, how to use named routes and how to pass parameters, how to have nested

00:07.590 --> 00:14.160
routes. Well sometimes you also have some query parameters, query parameters are the parameters you have

00:14.230 --> 00:19.670
the end of your URL, always at the end separated with a question mark and then something like a equals

00:19.680 --> 00:23.830
100, b equals hello, something like this.

00:23.910 --> 00:30.120
This would be a query parameter and this is mostly optional data you pass with a route, for example a

00:30.130 --> 00:32.300
stored redirection route,

00:32.310 --> 00:37.650
if you redirected the user to log in first and then want to redirect him to his original route

00:37.980 --> 00:42.330
or something like this. To pass such query parameters,

00:42.330 --> 00:48.030
you can either go to your route to where you set up the path directly and add question mark,

00:48.040 --> 00:50.750
a equals 100 for example

00:51.000 --> 00:59.460
or if you use the object syntax like we do here in user detail, you can add another property to this

00:59.460 --> 01:01.490
object which is called query.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.200
This again takes an object as a value

01:04.230 --> 01:09.600
and here you set up key value pairs where you set up your query parameters with because a query parameter

01:09.600 --> 01:12.470
always is a key like a

01:12.540 --> 01:14.310
and then the value like 100

01:14.310 --> 01:17.070
and this is exactly what you set up in this object.

01:17.070 --> 01:29.640
So let's do this, let's say locale should be a string en and then let's also set q equal to 100, to

01:29.640 --> 01:30.290
a number.

01:30.390 --> 01:37.350
So this shall pass these two things as query parameters to the user detail route or to the user edit route,

01:37.350 --> 01:38.240
excuse me,

01:38.370 --> 01:44.650
and if I now choose a user and click edit user, you now see we have a locale equal en and q equals

01:44.670 --> 01:45.470
100,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.890
so these are the query parameters I set up here,

01:48.930 --> 01:52.690
so this extra data. Now to extract this extra data,

01:52.710 --> 01:55.420
let's do it on the edit user template here,

01:55.560 --> 02:00.840
here again I will not set it up in the reactive way with a watcher because I know this will always

02:00.840 --> 02:03.280
be recreated but we could of course do this

02:03.450 --> 02:09.180
but here, we want to output the locale which I can again access on my loaded route

02:09.180 --> 02:12.280
and then here it's not params but instead it's query

02:12.420 --> 02:21.570
and then I know I stored it in a key named locale and for the analytics parameter, let's name

02:21.570 --> 02:22.690
it which was q,

02:22.740 --> 02:24.740
I simply access q here.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.390
Well and with that in place, you already see it reloaded here

02:28.650 --> 02:34.480
and if I change my query parameter here to 105, we see that reflected here too because the page

02:34.550 --> 02:35.170
reloaded.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.650
If you do have links which allow you to reload the page without destroying this component first, you

02:40.650 --> 02:45.420
want to set up a watcher to dynamically update this, as you learned with normal parameters.

02:45.520 --> 02:51.850
And with this, you're also able to send query parameters and to use them and not just normal parameters.
