00:01.800 --> 00:04.850
So we now want to use animation instead of transition,

00:04.890 --> 00:06.670
let's say we want to slide this in,

00:06.720 --> 00:12.180
we could also achieve a slide-in effect with the transition property but for demo purposes, let's use

00:12.180 --> 00:13.360
animation.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.260
I need to set up the slide-enter class therefore, I haven't attached it up there yet but I will do

00:19.260 --> 00:20.650
so in a second,

00:20.880 --> 00:27.670
slide-enter, here we will have slide-enter-active and then we will also need slide-leave

00:27.690 --> 00:30.170
and of course slide-leave-active.

00:30.200 --> 00:37.610
So these are the css classes which you could now use by setting up a name of slide here,

00:37.720 --> 00:40.810
I'll leave it at fade for now though.

00:40.890 --> 00:45.990
Now these classes don't do that much right now, for animations to be playable,

00:45.990 --> 00:51.720
I also need to set up some keyframes with @keyframes and I will have a slide-in animation and then

00:51.720 --> 00:53.420
a slide-out animation.

00:53.430 --> 00:56.660
Now here you could specify the individual percentages,

00:56.700 --> 01:04.850
I'm going to say from and then to to keep it real simple and I want to start for sliding it in with transform,

01:04.860 --> 01:12.420
so when I move it in its position here with translateY on the y axis and then I want to move it by

01:12.420 --> 01:20.930
20 pixels and 2 is where I want to end and I want to end at the real position of the element, hence translateY

01:20.930 --> 01:26.140
shall be set to 0 which is the position the element really has in the document flow.

01:26.490 --> 01:33.290
Well and for, I can now basically copy that for the slide-out animation, so slide-out like this

01:35.490 --> 01:49.130
and then all I need to do here is move this like that and then rename this from and to, whoops, from and to to also slide

01:49.130 --> 01:54.620
it out on the y axis again, so that we have a nice sliding animation, of course set up any animation you

01:54.620 --> 01:55.580
want.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.470
Now with these keyframes here configured,

01:58.760 --> 02:02.180
I can now set up the slide class up here.

02:02.180 --> 02:09.380
Now on slide-enter, I could set up transform and then translateY and then 20 pixels because that is

02:09.380 --> 02:13.490
our beginning state here, though as I do set it up as a keyframe here,

02:13.490 --> 02:15.340
I don't really need to set it up here again,

02:15.380 --> 02:17.480
it wouldn't hurt but it also isn't needed,

02:17.570 --> 02:23.700
so no special starting state again because we do set up the starting state here in the keyframes since

02:23.750 --> 02:27.770
we'll use the css animation. In slide-enter-active,

02:27.770 --> 02:33.620
I now want to play this animation so the animation shall be slide-in referring to this keyframe here of

02:33.620 --> 02:34.380
course,

02:34.580 --> 02:41.470
over one second let's say we have that ease-out, ease-in function to end a bit slower than we start

02:41.600 --> 02:47.090
and importantly, we need to set up forwards so that the element stays in the finishing position of this

02:47.090 --> 02:53.380
animation and doesn't snap back to the start. Well and we're leaving here, there

02:53.390 --> 02:59.870
I want to use no initial state because I no need to, the starting position of the element is the default

02:59.870 --> 03:06.320
position of the element but I want to add animation for the time where this active class is attached

03:06.350 --> 03:15.760
and here, I want to slide it in, excuse me, I want to use slide-out or one second with ease-out again and

03:15.770 --> 03:17.800
forwards to keep it down there.

03:17.950 --> 03:21.830
And with that if we save this, we can now go up here,

03:21.880 --> 03:23.620
copy that,

03:23.620 --> 03:29.800
the div in this transition now, add a second one with the slide class and let's reload this and

03:29.800 --> 03:34.070
showed us, this slides up and it slides down.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.920
Now this already looks great,

03:35.920 --> 03:44.050
we see now we're using a css animation to use it or to animate this, though it's a bit too bad

03:44.070 --> 03:49.510
or I don't like that it instantly slides down and appears like that, it would be nicer if it would also

03:49.510 --> 03:52.190
become transparent over the time period.

03:52.390 --> 03:56.500
So in the next video, let's see how we can mix transition and animation.
