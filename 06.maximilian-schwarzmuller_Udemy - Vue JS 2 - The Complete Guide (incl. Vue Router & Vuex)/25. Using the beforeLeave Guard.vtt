00:01.740 --> 00:06.540
In the last video, we had a look at how to check if a user is allowed to enter somewhere,

00:06.540 --> 00:12.510
now we want to check if the user is allowed to leave a route. I alreaady set up the user edit route to have this

00:12.570 --> 00:13.820
confirm button,

00:14.010 --> 00:21.210
so I'll now quickly add a script here to export my default object belonging to this vue component and there,

00:21.260 --> 00:23.190
I want to have some methods

00:23.310 --> 00:31.050
and I also want to have some, some data, my data object. And in there, I will simply return an object

00:31.050 --> 00:35.020
where I set edited to false or not edited,

00:35.040 --> 00:35.870
let's name it

00:36.000 --> 00:37.040
confirmed,

00:37.040 --> 00:38.530
confirmed to false,

00:38.530 --> 00:46.090
don't need the method to be honest, I can simply click listener here and set confirmed equal to true inside

00:46.110 --> 00:46.760
there.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.530
So this now controls whether

00:49.530 --> 00:51.550
I did click this button or not

00:51.960 --> 00:58.150
and now on this component and this is now the only place where I can specify this, as before in user

00:58.170 --> 01:00.720
detail with beforeRouteEnter,

01:00.930 --> 01:07.260
I can now set up beforeRouteLeave, again this is the only place where I can do this because while it is in

01:07.260 --> 01:12.880
the component where I want to check this right, this is right before I actually do navigate away

01:12.990 --> 01:16.350
so checking this on a global level would be too late,

01:16.350 --> 01:18.840
the navigation would already be on its way.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.920
So instead it's here in the component which decides

01:21.930 --> 01:24.450
are you even allowed to go somewhere else

01:24.720 --> 01:28.610
and here I checked to, from and then also next

01:28.830 --> 01:33.210
and I have to call next to let the request continue,

01:33.210 --> 01:37.540
I can also abort and redirect here just like with beforeRouteEnter.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.220
And here I could check if this.confirmed is true,

01:41.370 --> 01:48.210
here of course I do have access to this.confirmed because I am in the component and I'm talking about

01:48.210 --> 01:49.630
are you allowed to leave,

01:49.650 --> 01:54.450
of course the component has been created at this point of time, we were using it all the time.

01:54.450 --> 02:00.210
So here I may access it with this and I can check if this is confirmed in which case

02:00.210 --> 02:01.650
I want to navigate,

02:01.890 --> 02:03.730
if it is not confirmed,

02:04.200 --> 02:08.750
well then I want to throw or show the confirm dialog,

02:08.760 --> 02:13.310
are you sure to let the user decide if he wants to continue,

02:13.360 --> 02:19.200
confirm this dialog will return true or false depending on whether the user clicked yes or no.

02:19.560 --> 02:24.010
And if this was yes, then I also want to navigate away otherwise

02:24.040 --> 02:28.800
I want to abort the navigation. So we have this double check, if the button was clicked,

02:28.810 --> 02:35.040
you're always free to leave, if the button was not clicked, well then I'm asking you with the confirm dialog,

02:35.100 --> 02:40.230
if you say yes there, okay, you're allowed to leave, if you say no, you'll stay on this page.

02:40.290 --> 02:45.150
This would be a typical set up where you want to ensure that a user doesn't navigate away by accidentally

02:45.150 --> 02:47.260
hitting the back button or something like this.

02:48.430 --> 02:52.610
So with this, let's load this again, go to edit user there, we are there

02:52.930 --> 02:55.820
and now let's try to go to home.

02:55.840 --> 03:01.000
I didn't click the confirm button so now I'm asked if I want to leave and if I click on cancel, I'm staying

03:01.000 --> 03:01.910
on this page,

03:02.020 --> 03:08.300
if I click on ok, well then I'm allowed to leave. And therefore if I now go there again

03:08.770 --> 03:12.450
and now I click confirm first and click now on go to home,

03:12.490 --> 03:17.260
I'm instantly allowed to leave because confirmed was set to true and this is the first check

03:17.260 --> 03:23.380
I do have here. And these are the two navigation guards you have, before entering and before leaving so

03:23.380 --> 03:28.730
that you can really control when the user is allowed to beware in your application.
