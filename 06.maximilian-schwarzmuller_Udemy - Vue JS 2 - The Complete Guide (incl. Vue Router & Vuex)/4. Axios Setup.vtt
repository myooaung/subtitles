So in the last lecture we set up our project and the firebase backend, let's now install axios.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.510
As I said it's a third party package,

00:10.510 --> 00:16.950
it's not integrated into vue. So I'll quit my npm run dev process for a second

00:17.170 --> 00:24.020
and in the terminal, I'll now run npm install --save to also store an entry in the package.json

00:24.030 --> 00:27.860
file, axios, that's the name of the package.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.070
As a side note if you want to learn more about this package and dive deeply into it, don't miss the chance

00:33.070 --> 00:38.560
to visit its webpage on github.com or its github repository I should say,

00:38.560 --> 00:42.430
you can simply search for axios in github and you should instantly find this.

00:42.550 --> 00:46.180
There, you will find detailed instructions about installation, about the usage,

00:46.200 --> 00:48.120
the whole API and so on

00:48.220 --> 00:51.750
but of course, I'm going to show you the most important things here.

00:51.760 --> 00:59.230
So with that I installed axios, I can now rerun npm run dev to go back into my development server mode

00:59.500 --> 01:06.460
and in the watch mode which watches my code. With axios installed, the first important thing to note is

01:06.790 --> 01:12.300
that we don't add it or don't have to use it on our vue app,

01:12.340 --> 01:20.260
so unlike the router which we use with vue use or the store which we use with vue use, vuex, axios

01:20.260 --> 01:24.500
is a third party package and by default not integrated into vue like this.

01:24.550 --> 01:30.560
Now there actually are packages which bind axios to vue and then give you axios to it on the

01:30.570 --> 01:35.430
this instance, so in any component with the this keyword

01:35.620 --> 01:38.570
but I want to show you the raw way of using axios,

01:38.680 --> 01:44.620
you can always look into other third party packages if you are interested in more deeply integrating

01:44.710 --> 01:45.830
axios into vue

01:45.850 --> 01:49.290
but for now, let's just stick to the raw library itself.

01:49.690 --> 01:55.930
So the goal is to submit data on the sign up page and then later, I want to be able to get this data

01:55.930 --> 01:58.120
on the dashboard page.

01:58.120 --> 02:05.770
So the simplest way of using axios in the sign up page is to just make an http request through

02:05.820 --> 02:09.730
the package from there. Let's do this in the next lecture.
