00:02.230 --> 00:05.790
Thus far we're creating components with vue component here,

00:05.920 --> 00:12.280
this means in our app we're using it with the selector and we're adding them. Now if I create a second

00:12.310 --> 00:17.790
app and therefore I create a second vue instance down there, app2.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.060
Now if I hit enter,

00:20.320 --> 00:26.350
well we see it four times because our second app here also now uses the same component.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.240
What if we wanted to register different components globally and locally?

00:31.240 --> 00:38.050
So we want to use the same selector maybe but use it or use different components in the end,

00:38.050 --> 00:40.060
we can do this. To do this,

00:40.090 --> 00:41.980
I'll do a little change here,

00:41.980 --> 00:46.840
I don't call vue component which registers it globally, instead

00:46.840 --> 00:51.540
now I want to store this as a variable. So to do so,

00:51.610 --> 00:55.830
I will say var component equals

00:55.900 --> 01:01.420
and now this equal is just the object configuring the component, so the selector is gone.

01:01.720 --> 01:10.960
Now in my vue instance, I can now execute or I can add a new property components which basically tells

01:10.960 --> 01:18.520
this instance which local components do you have? So components only usable in this instance here.

01:18.760 --> 01:26.380
Well and here, I want to set up my selector, this is  now completely freely choosable by myself, my component

01:26.380 --> 01:27.480
for example

01:27.640 --> 01:31.480
and I will refer to my component data variable up there.

01:31.480 --> 01:39.430
Now I set up a local component and if I hit control enter therefore, the app breaks which happens because

01:39.460 --> 01:44.860
I need to remove this unnecessary parentheses here coming from the component function but if I now

01:44.870 --> 01:46.070
hit enter again,

01:46.120 --> 01:51.850
we only see the server status in the first app because in the second where I also use my component,

01:51.970 --> 01:53.300
it's not registered.

01:53.470 --> 01:58.570
We only registered it here on the first vue instance with the component property, on the second we don't

01:58.570 --> 01:59.260
have that,

01:59.260 --> 02:01.920
so my component is not recognized there.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.550
And this is how we can register it locally,

02:04.600 --> 02:09.760
we could now also register it on the second one, also use a different selector there by simply setting

02:09.760 --> 02:11.710
up a different selector

02:11.710 --> 02:16.910
but if you want to do that, this is how to do it, if you want to use a global component instead,

02:17.020 --> 02:23.950
well then you need vue component, this method where you have your selector first, my component and then

02:23.950 --> 02:26.770
your component object.

02:26.830 --> 02:33.160
These are the two different ways of registering it globally with vue component or locally with the components

02:33.160 --> 02:34.870
property in a vue instance.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.570
And with that, now it's really time to leave

02:37.630 --> 02:45.640
JSFiddle and work on these single file templates I explained before to see how we can use them in conjunction

02:45.640 --> 02:47.470
with components. See you there.
