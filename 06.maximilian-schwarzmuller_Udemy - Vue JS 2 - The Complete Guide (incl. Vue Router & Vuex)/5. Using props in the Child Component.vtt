WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:04.520
So the passing of the property works fine,

00:04.520 --> 00:11.380
we can use props like this. Important to note is we not only output in the template of course, we could

00:11.380 --> 00:20.710
also have a method here so this methods array where we have switch name and this is a function where I simply

00:20.710 --> 00:27.910
want to return this my name, so I can access it with this like I can access any property in the data

00:27.910 --> 00:36.280
property, it set up in the same way, this my name split because it is an array in the end, a string is

00:36.280 --> 00:43.660
just an array of character, split with well an empty string so to split on each character then reverse

00:43.660 --> 00:47.190
it and then join it on each character,

00:47.940 --> 00:52.260
this simply will reverse the name. I can then of course here execute

00:52.260 --> 01:00.630
switch name and that will as you see work fine too, say on Max of course.

01:00.630 --> 01:08.340
The reason why it works fine is that I can of course use this props here like a normal property in my

01:08.340 --> 01:11.310
whole vue object I have down there,

01:11.370 --> 01:18.240
I can access it with this, I can access it like normal, like a normal property set up in the data

01:18.390 --> 01:19.350
object.

01:19.350 --> 01:25.920
This is so important to understand, this is why that is a perfectly valid way to use my props.
