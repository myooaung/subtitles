00:01.640 --> 00:07.590
So throughout this module, we learned how we couldn't flexibly distribute content with slots and named

00:07.590 --> 00:14.690
slots which gives us the power to create reusable components, maybe used in widgets like a slideshow

00:14.730 --> 00:21.680
widget which has the same frame all the time but the content then has to be distributed in this frame

00:21.680 --> 00:22.690
somehow

00:22.970 --> 00:30.290
and how to use dynamic components to change which component is loaded in a specific part of the page

00:30.460 --> 00:30.990
depending

00:31.010 --> 00:38.660
for example on the state of a property, like we do it here when we save the currently selected component

00:38.660 --> 00:46.040
in that property. With that we get two amazing features which really allow us to create reusable and

00:46.040 --> 00:53.970
flexible components. And with all that, we learned so much about components in the last few modules,

00:54.020 --> 01:02.480
now I'd say it's time to move on and learn about more fantastic features vuejs offers us but components

01:02.540 --> 01:06.740
already are one of the best features and one of the most powerful ones.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.610
But with that, let's continue.
