Now before moving on and seeing the transition from one element to another, let me conclude this first

00:08.090 --> 00:13.910
basic introduction here by showing you that name here doesn't have to be static,

00:13.910 --> 00:16.520
you don't have to hardcode it here.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.320
Indeed

00:17.480 --> 00:22.880
let me add a line break here and add a select up here, the select control

00:22.880 --> 00:29.480
and I want to head, have an option to switch between the fade and the slide animation so that we

00:29.480 --> 00:31.180
can choose this.

00:31.190 --> 00:37.130
Now we already learned how to get this value with v-model and I want to bind it to a property here

00:37.310 --> 00:40.960
which I will name alert animation, now alert

00:41.090 --> 00:43.730
animation by default here

00:43.800 --> 00:46.100
shall be let's say fade.

00:46.100 --> 00:53.600
Now with that, I can now bind here to alert animation with v-model and this will set this depending

00:53.600 --> 00:59.170
on what I choose here in my dropdown, for this to work though I will need to set up my values here,

00:59.180 --> 01:01.640
so to fade and to slide,

01:01.670 --> 01:05.140
these will be the values this property then takes in the end.

01:05.540 --> 01:12.540
And now I can bind name here dynamically by exchanging name like an attribute with as we learned it,

01:12.560 --> 01:15.790
attribute binding with a colon in front of it.

01:15.800 --> 01:23.420
Now this will make this property here being bound dynamically and of course here, you then enter the

01:23.420 --> 01:26.500
property name which has the value you want to bind dynamically,

01:26.510 --> 01:29.600
that's the idea behind dynamic binding, right we learned that.

01:29.660 --> 01:35.900
Now with that, let me just add another line break and add the form control bootstrap class here to make

01:35.900 --> 01:41.600
it pretty and if I reload this, you see now fade is selected, hence the first alert fades in

01:41.600 --> 01:42.170
and out

01:42.230 --> 01:44.120
but I can switch this to slide

01:44.240 --> 01:46.400
and now it slides in and out.

01:46.460 --> 01:54.390
Though we see the issue here we fix before by specifying what should toggle the way this transition

01:54.390 --> 01:54.980
works,

01:55.130 --> 02:00.590
so the type here is set to animation down there for the one slide animation while we don't set it here

02:00.620 --> 02:07.010
where we dynamically set this to slide. So we could also set type dynamically therefore with type,

02:07.010 --> 02:12.260
you can bind all attributes like this in the end but for now, I will leave it like this

02:12.260 --> 02:17.780
because the key thing is that you understand that you can bind these properties, these attributes

02:17.790 --> 02:18.520
set up here,

02:18.530 --> 02:20.690
the same is true of course for these classes here,

02:20.810 --> 02:24.320
you can bind them dynamically by adding a colon in the beginning.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.720
You use them like normal html attributes,

02:27.740 --> 02:30.650
this is the important thing I want you to take away here.
