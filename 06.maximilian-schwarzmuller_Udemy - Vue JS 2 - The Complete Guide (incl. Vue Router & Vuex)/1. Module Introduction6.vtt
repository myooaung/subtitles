00:02.120 --> 00:03.880
Welcome to another module.

00:03.920 --> 00:10.520
So we learned about components, about forms, about the general template syntax, the core features of vuejs

00:10.570 --> 00:11.530
.

00:11.690 --> 00:16.660
We also learned about directives, filters and mixins, so we learned about a lot of things,

00:16.730 --> 00:23.270
a lot of things which are really important to vuejs and really are core features. Now it would also

00:23.270 --> 00:26.600
be nice to make our application a little bit prettier

00:26.810 --> 00:33.230
and for making it prettier and telling the user what he just did or where he is at in your application,

00:33.350 --> 00:37.960
animations are key. Animations are more than just an extra benefit,

00:38.000 --> 00:45.770
animations really allow your user to know, to understand how to use your application and where, in which

00:45.770 --> 00:48.570
point of the application the user currently is.

00:48.590 --> 00:55.220
Therefore in this module, we'll have a look at animations and transitions, how we can animate single objects,

00:55.310 --> 01:02.900
animate the transition of two objects and animate whole list of items like sliding new items in and sliding

01:02.900 --> 01:04.970
old items out or stuff like that.

01:04.970 --> 01:06.070
So let's dive in.
