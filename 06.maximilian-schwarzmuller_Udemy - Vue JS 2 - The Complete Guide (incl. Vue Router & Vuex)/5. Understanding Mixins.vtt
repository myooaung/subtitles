Now you might recognize one problem, let's say I would have another component and I'll quickly create

00:08.090 --> 00:15.920
one, I'll name it list.vue because all I want to have in there is basically a copy of my app.vue file,

00:16.100 --> 00:19.510
I want to have my fruits in there too,

00:19.610 --> 00:25.460
I will remove the uppercase thing here, I don't need that and I will remove my filter here therefore

00:25.800 --> 00:32.840
but I still will have my data, don't need the text but I need the fruits, the filtered text and then my

00:32.840 --> 00:41.680
filtered fruits down there. And then in the app.vue file, I want to import that so I can import list from

00:42.490 --> 00:47.970
my list.vue file and register it as a local component here as we learned it before,

00:47.980 --> 00:49.550
thus far nothing new.

00:49.660 --> 00:51.460
So let me quickly do this,

00:51.460 --> 00:57.700
my app list component, list is the imported file or module here

00:58.020 --> 01:00.630
and then I can simply attach it below my other list,

01:00.640 --> 01:04.640
I have now my app list with the selector I just specified.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.080
If I do this, we see the second list, 

01:07.150 --> 01:08.300
ok that's a bit ugly

01:08.320 --> 01:09.800
because of the styling,

01:10.080 --> 01:14.000
so let me quickly get rid of all these things,

01:14.020 --> 01:18.550
all these things here, should keep one surrounding div here though.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.520
So let's quickly do that,

01:20.560 --> 01:21.400
reorder this,

01:21.400 --> 01:22.330
nice.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.660
Now it looks much better,

01:23.710 --> 01:28.580
now we get this duplication here and as you can see of course this works too,

01:28.630 --> 01:31.300
it's not connected to the first filter and it shouldn't be

01:31.480 --> 01:33.630
but now I get two filtered lists.

01:33.640 --> 01:37.020
The problem we have here of course is code duplication,

01:37.120 --> 01:43.930
we have our computed property here and the data fields here and also in the app.vue file.

01:44.050 --> 01:50.830
Now a filter, normal filter registered globally let's say, would have allowed us to solve this issue because

01:50.830 --> 01:55.720
we registered it globally and then we can use it everywhere and hence we don't duplicate the code but

01:55.720 --> 02:01.660
we just learned that filters aren't that good to be used and are also limited in their capability.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.500
How can we avoid such a code duplication?

02:04.630 --> 02:09.970
And of course we not only faced this when using filters, duplicate code is something we'll often see,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.670
sometimes we just want to have some code or some data which you want to share amongst multiple vue instances

02:15.670 --> 02:17.660
or components. For that,

02:17.680 --> 02:21.360
we got mixins and I will have a look at this now.
