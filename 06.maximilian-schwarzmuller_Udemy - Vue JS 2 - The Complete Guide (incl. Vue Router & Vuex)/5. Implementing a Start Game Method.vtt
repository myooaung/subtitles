We want to make this start new game button work and then display these action buttons. To do so we need

00:08.760 --> 00:11.310
to hook it up to an event listener,

00:11.400 --> 00:14.580
so here on the button with start new game on it,

00:14.580 --> 00:16.530
we want to listen to the click event

00:16.600 --> 00:25.280
and I can do this with v-on click or the shortcut, just @click to listen to a click event.

00:25.290 --> 00:31.530
Now here, I want to execute the code or I want to run the code which should get executed when we ever,

00:31.590 --> 00:33.260
whenever we click this button.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.710
Now I could simply set

00:34.740 --> 00:37.690
game is running to true here

00:38.010 --> 00:40.660
but actually that's not all I want to do here,

00:40.720 --> 00:43.500
hence since I can only write one expression here

00:43.510 --> 00:47.010
and anyways I shouldn't put too much code in my template,

00:47.310 --> 00:53.700
I will simply execute the start game method, putting the reference here like this.

00:54.060 --> 01:03.090
And in my app.js, I therefore add my methods object to the vue instance and here I add the start game function,

01:03.210 --> 01:04.640
like this.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.500
So this is the start

01:06.500 --> 01:15.010
game function here and in this function, I want to set this game is running to true.

01:15.330 --> 01:21.870
I also want to set the player health to 100 in case we already had a game running before and it wasn't

01:21.870 --> 01:23.120
100 anymore

01:23.460 --> 01:30.280
and the same is of course true for the monster health which should now also be 100 again.

01:30.450 --> 01:33.410
So this is the start game function

01:33.450 --> 01:39.900
and if we save this now and reload the application and we click start new game, it correctly switches

01:39.900 --> 01:42.340
to displaying the other buttons instead,

01:42.390 --> 01:43.400
great.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.790
So the game is running, the players are initialized,

01:46.800 --> 01:51.230
time to make these action buttons work and actually start hitting each other.
