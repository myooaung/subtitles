So in the last lecture, we learned how to create a local filter with the filters property on our vue

00:07.240 --> 00:11.600
instance or vue component and how to use it with the pipe symbol there.

00:11.740 --> 00:17.230
You also learned that we need to pass a value and return the transform value, important again, that only

00:17.230 --> 00:20.290
transforms the value that we see here in the template,

00:20.290 --> 00:24.240
so it doesn't transform the data property, so it doesn't transform text,

00:24.250 --> 00:25.620
it only transforms the output,

00:25.670 --> 00:27.280
that's important to understand.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.720
Now with that let's create a global filter here,

00:29.740 --> 00:35.470
I already have a name, to-lowercase and there we want to pass the function as the second argument which

00:35.470 --> 00:39.150
should get executed. Here of course we also get the value

00:39.190 --> 00:45.350
and here I want to return the value to, whoops, to lowercase, like this,

00:45.430 --> 00:49.330
so it does the opposite of the uppercase filter. With this filter set up.

00:49.330 --> 00:50.100
I want to use it

00:50.110 --> 00:55.080
and now I can also show you how to chain filters, I can simply add another pipe.

00:55.090 --> 01:00.660
Now this filter here will then use all the content in front of it as an input,

01:00.840 --> 01:08.480
so the text transform to uppercase is now the new value passed to to lowercase here.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.310
Now let's save this

01:10.600 --> 01:14.470
and we see now it's all lowercase because now the following happens,

01:14.590 --> 01:20.380
I pass text to to uppercase, there it gets transformed to be all uppercase letters

01:20.590 --> 01:24.040
and then I take this result and pass it to to lowercase,

01:24.100 --> 01:28.730
there it gets transformed to be all lowercase letters which is what we see here.

01:29.020 --> 01:35.830
And that really is it, that are filters, this is how we create our own filters both globally here

01:36.220 --> 01:42.490
and locally here with the filters property, how we pass value, how we return it and how we can chain them.
