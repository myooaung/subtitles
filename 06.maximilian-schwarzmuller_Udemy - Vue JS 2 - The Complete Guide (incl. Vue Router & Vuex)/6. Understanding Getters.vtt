For that problem I just described the last video where we do have more complex calculations when fetching

00:08.180 --> 00:13.700
our state and possibly do have this in multiple parts of our application, for this problem,

00:13.700 --> 00:19.400
we do have a solution. Instead of directly accessing our state in the component where we want to access

00:19.400 --> 00:20.040
it,

00:20.060 --> 00:27.870
we can create a getter, such a getter would then get the state from the store and perform any calculations

00:27.870 --> 00:29.220
it should perform

00:29.420 --> 00:33.260
but then we access this getter from our different components.

00:33.290 --> 00:40.220
Hence our calculation, our code is stored in one place and then we only reach out to that getter from

00:40.220 --> 00:44.750
the pieces in our application where we wanted to reach out. Let's have a look at how we could implement

00:44.750 --> 00:46.400
this in the next video.
