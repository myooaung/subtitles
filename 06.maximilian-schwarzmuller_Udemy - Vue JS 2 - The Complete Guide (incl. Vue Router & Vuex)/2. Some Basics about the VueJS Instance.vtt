I'm back in JSFiddle and here's a very simple fiddle where I get my app div where I output a title

00:07.790 --> 00:13.790
which we can find in the data property down there, where I get a button hooked up to a wind with v-on

00:13.790 --> 00:15.020
syntax here

00:15.230 --> 00:21.350
with to the or hooked up to this show method in the methods property on our vue instance and we get

00:21.350 --> 00:24.160
this v-if to conditionally show something.

00:24.290 --> 00:32.300
I also get a computed property which calculates lower case title and then here, I got this watch property

00:32.540 --> 00:37.850
where I simply throw an alert whenever I click this show paragraph button.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.970
So if I do this, yeah we see this alert, we see this is updated,

00:41.990 --> 00:47.540
we saw that alert as a side up because we were watching the title and the title changed when clicking

00:47.540 --> 00:48.010
this.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.320
So this code doesn't do anything

00:50.330 --> 00:51.430
we haven't seen yet,

00:51.440 --> 00:55.610
it's just a little collection of things we saw. In this section,

00:55.610 --> 00:58.440
I want to focus on this vue instance though.

00:58.850 --> 01:03.040
We got all these properties, el, data, methods, computed

01:03.200 --> 01:09.800
and that really is what makes up a vuejs application and what makes up a vue instance. The vue instance

01:09.800 --> 01:16.590
kind of is the middleman between our dom, our html code up there and our business logic,

01:16.640 --> 01:24.500
we pack all our business logic into this vue instance, either in the data property if it's simply some data

01:24.500 --> 01:29.310
we want to work with, be that set it initially or change throughout the application,

01:29.510 --> 01:31.550
be that a method which you want to call,

01:31.550 --> 01:36.410
for example when clicking a button where we then want to interact with our data and change it, like

01:36.410 --> 01:43.730
here in the methods property where we set up such methods or be that dependencies or more complex operations

01:43.730 --> 01:49.050
where we depend on the value of another property, like here in the computed property.

01:49.340 --> 01:55.640
These are the options on the vue instance you already learned about throughout the last modules

01:55.640 --> 02:01.490
and that again is what composes your vue instance and composes your application which allows you to

02:01.490 --> 02:06.430
pick the right tool for the right task using vuejs and setting it all up

02:06.440 --> 02:13.220
in this vue instance. Well, there are two things I haven't touched on at all for a good reason but now is

02:13.220 --> 02:14.720
the time to do so,

02:14.750 --> 02:19.470
the first thing is did you ever wonder if we could have more than just one vue instance?

02:19.610 --> 02:26.360
In the end we do hook up our vue instance with this el selector here to this div ID with the, well to

02:26.420 --> 02:32.240
this div with the ID app, what if we would have another div with another ID,

02:32.240 --> 02:34.940
could we create a new instance?

02:34.940 --> 02:36.790
The answer is yes, I'll come back to this,

02:36.790 --> 02:42.880
let me first ask the second question, can we access our vue instance from outside?

02:42.890 --> 02:48.920
We do have all our logic inside this object we passed to the constructor here but could we access our

02:48.920 --> 02:50.730
instance from outside?

02:51.020 --> 02:53.090
The answer on this question is yes too

02:53.180 --> 02:56.370
so let's look at these two questions in more detail now.
