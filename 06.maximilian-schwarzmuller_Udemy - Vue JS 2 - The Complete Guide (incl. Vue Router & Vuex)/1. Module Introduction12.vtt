Welcome to this course module where we really start diving into vuejs. We already had a look at our first

00:09.110 --> 00:15.500
vuejs application in the last course module, we learned about this basic connection, how to interact with

00:15.500 --> 00:16.990
our html code,

00:17.000 --> 00:23.720
now it's time to really understand what's going on there and which other tools vuejs offers us. For

00:23.720 --> 00:24.050
this,

00:24.050 --> 00:29.000
I will continue working with JSFiddle, though as I explained that the last module you are free to

00:29.000 --> 00:32.320
use your local set up and attached to this video,

00:32.420 --> 00:36.230
you will find the code with which I'll start in the next video.

00:36.380 --> 00:43.350
Well with that, enough of the talking, let's finally dive really deep into vuejs and start learning it.
