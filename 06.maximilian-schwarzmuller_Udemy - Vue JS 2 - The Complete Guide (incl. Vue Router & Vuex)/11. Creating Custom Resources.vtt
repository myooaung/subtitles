We saw how to use a resource in the last video with a default action and whilst this is a bit shorter than

00:07.670 --> 00:12.980
this http post and then in setting up like this, we didn't save that much space.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.810
Now it becomes more powerful if you create your own actions,

00:16.850 --> 00:22.640
so I will create a new constant custom actions here in the created hook and be aware, you could of

00:22.640 --> 00:29.330
course also set up these resources here in a more central place and access them on a central object

00:29.330 --> 00:34.410
or whatever you like, so that you can share it across multiple vue components

00:34.460 --> 00:36.300
but here, I'll keep it in this one.

00:36.500 --> 00:42.530
So here, custom actions, I want to create an action which I'll name saveAlt for save alternative

00:42.530 --> 00:46.990
or something like this and this will now be an object where I configure this action.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.860
I set up the method, well

00:49.030 --> 00:52.440
this shall be post though it will be overridden to put anyways

00:52.640 --> 01:03.250
but then I will also set up the URL and I want to have a URL of alternatives.json, instead

01:03.250 --> 01:04.040
of data.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.010
json.

01:05.260 --> 01:14.830
Now with that set up, I can go up to my submit method here and now, I can simply use this though in order

01:14.830 --> 01:16.950
to be able to use my own custom method,

01:17.110 --> 01:21.690
I have to pass new arguments to my resource set up here.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.980
The second argument will be empty,

01:23.990 --> 01:26.900
this would allow me to pass a variable data into the URL,

01:26.950 --> 01:28.880
I'll come back to this soon

01:28.990 --> 01:31.960
and a third argument are my custom actions,

01:31.960 --> 01:36.550
so this object I set up here which only has one action right now but that's enough.

01:36.550 --> 01:42.300
Now with this custom action place, I can access my resource again and call saveAlt, 

01:42.380 --> 01:50.150
the thing I just set up and of course I also pass this user like before but now we should see that

01:50.160 --> 01:53.850
a new node gets created on the backend on firebase.

01:53.980 --> 02:01.270
Well let's try this out by reloading the application, entering some data here and hit submit and on the back

02:01.270 --> 02:07.840
end, we did see a new node, alternative was created and our data is stored here because now we're using

02:07.840 --> 02:10.300
the saveAlt resource here.

02:10.360 --> 02:16.990
And you can hopefully see how it would easily be possible to create multiple quick resources here with

02:16.990 --> 02:22.570
different URLs and then use them just like this in different places having a highest degree of

02:22.570 --> 02:28.450
flexibility without having to hardcode everything over and over again if you reused the same resource

02:28.450 --> 02:30.740
twice and another resource three times,

02:30.790 --> 02:35.440
well this is how you can easily store it in a central place down there and then simply use it here

02:35.470 --> 02:36.770
on this resource.
