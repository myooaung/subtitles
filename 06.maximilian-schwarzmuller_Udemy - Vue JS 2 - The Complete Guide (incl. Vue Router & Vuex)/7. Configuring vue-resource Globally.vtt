WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:05.840
So we learned how to send posts and get requests,

00:05.850 --> 00:10.650
one thing we do right now though is we repeat ourselves here,

00:10.710 --> 00:16.620
we do have the URL copied and pasted into each of our functions, into the post, in the get function, if we

00:16.620 --> 00:21.090
were to add more requests or more places where we do these requests,

00:21.090 --> 00:23.990
we would repeat this URL all the time.

00:24.040 --> 00:30.840
Now the URL doesn't change that much though, so it would be great to have kind of a global place to set

00:30.840 --> 00:32.780
this up for each http request

00:32.820 --> 00:36.470
in this application, this might of course be different in your application.

00:36.810 --> 00:41.940
So we actually do have such a central place where we can set up our application

00:41.940 --> 00:44.430
URL or the URL we want to use.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.040
So I'm going to copy the URL and the place I am talking about is in the main.js file where

00:50.040 --> 00:59.090
we set up our vue resource or we add the vue resource to our vue instance here after adding it with vue use,

00:59.090 --> 01:01.860
I can call vue http

01:02.010 --> 01:07.500
and now important, without dollar sign, dollar sign is only needed when accessing it from inside

01:07.500 --> 01:13.590
your vue instance, if you access it on the global vue object, then this is without a dollar sign

01:13.800 --> 01:19.710
and here we can set up some global options. Again to learn more about these global options, dive into

01:19.710 --> 01:22.940
the official vue resource documentation

01:23.010 --> 01:30.540
and there, you will find the API docs where you can learn more about which options you can set where

01:30.810 --> 01:33.210
and how to configure that all.

01:33.210 --> 01:39.930
Now what I can show you here is you got access to the root key on your global options and the root key

01:40.140 --> 01:44.580
basically just is your main URL you're going to use,

01:44.580 --> 01:52.140
so by setting up this, all requests will be sent to this URL and then in your methods, you can simply

01:52.140 --> 01:53.840
append things to that URL,

01:53.880 --> 01:57.260
for example nothing because the URL already includes everything I need

01:57.360 --> 02:04.020
but if you had some other service and then you have some sub-routes like send data or something like

02:04.020 --> 02:09.120
that, then you could append it like this or again if URL covers everything you need, just send

02:09.120 --> 02:10.610
an empty string.

02:10.620 --> 02:17.300
Now with this set up, you will see if I now reload this and hit get data again, it still works

02:17.340 --> 02:24.210
but now we have a central place where this URL is stored and you can set up other things too on this global vue

02:24.210 --> 02:24.910
object,

02:25.020 --> 02:31.560
for example you could also set up some default headers here if you needed that, if you wanted to set

02:31.560 --> 02:34.390
the content type for each request or something like that,

02:34.470 --> 02:41.010
that can all be done on this global vue http object here or on the options object I should say and that

02:41.010 --> 02:46.130
is a convenient way of centralizing certain things which are always equal.
