WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:05.590
We get our base routing set up and the main components in place,

00:05.590 --> 00:07.730
now let's continue working on this app.

00:07.750 --> 00:14.020
I think the logical next step in my opinion at least is to now implement a header, so that we also got

00:14.020 --> 00:18.680
some links to route instead of having to manually type it in the URL.

00:18.850 --> 00:24.220
So let's add a header and for that since I use bootstrap anyways, I'll head over to bootstrap and pick

00:24.220 --> 00:25.750
the header on their page,

00:25.780 --> 00:28.300
so here under components nav bar,

00:28.300 --> 00:30.700
we find the default bootstrap nav bar.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.620
Now I'm grabbing this whole nav bar,

00:32.690 --> 00:36.240
that's much more than I need but we'll strip out all the things we don't need

00:36.700 --> 00:43.160
and with that, I'll go into my header.vue file and insert this here into this template.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.030
With that, this is the whole bootstrap navigation bar,

00:46.030 --> 00:48.300
now let's remove all the things we don't need,

00:48.340 --> 00:53.800
for example I won't set it up to work on mobile phones too just to keep this simple and focused on the

00:53.800 --> 00:59.090
core vue things here, of course you could change this and therefore I don't need that

00:59.110 --> 01:02.410
button here, I don't need that button in my nav bar header,

01:02.430 --> 01:07.290
also I don't need the command. What I do want indeed is my brand here,

01:07.300 --> 01:12.600
stock trader, though that of course shouldn't be an anchor tag,

01:12.790 --> 01:20.260
that should be a router link instead since we want to well manage this through vuejs, this link

01:20.260 --> 01:28.700
I mean. So I'll create my router link here and I want to link to my route page just like this,

01:30.030 --> 01:32.440
I also want to attach a class,

01:32.460 --> 01:35.870
I can still do this of course, of nav bar brand,

01:35.880 --> 01:42.120
this is a normal bootstrap class which gives us this brand-like look. Let's continue, what we have

01:42.120 --> 01:42.810
here?

01:42.810 --> 01:49.200
Here we get our navigation on the left, I want to use that, I want to have my stocks and portfolio links there,

01:49.410 --> 01:49.710
don't

01:49.790 --> 01:56.460
need that ID here though, I will strip some things here though. I don't need a drop down here on the

01:56.460 --> 02:00.980
left for example so I can remove that and I don't want to use the active link here,

02:01.350 --> 02:09.160
instead I want to basically set up my own links with router link, one for the portfolio and one for the

02:09.250 --> 02:10.470
stocks.

02:10.480 --> 02:17.730
However, we also want to have this anchor tag here and we learned how to do this, add an anchor tag between

02:17.730 --> 02:22.710
the router links here because router link shall then be the least item in the end which also gets

02:22.710 --> 02:24.710
the router link active class,

02:24.780 --> 02:26.210
so like this

02:26.430 --> 02:33.420
and then on this first router link, we want to go to /portfolio and on the second one, we want to

02:33.420 --> 02:40.500
go to /stocks and whilst we're at it, we can already add the active class, so let's add the active

02:40.500 --> 02:47.130
class attribute here and set this to active because this is what bootstrap expects

02:47.160 --> 02:50.000
on the li item, on the list item

02:50.000 --> 02:56.650
to mark this route as active. Well finally since I already set it, this should be a list item so let's

02:56.700 --> 02:59.490
adds tag equals li on our router link

02:59.580 --> 03:05.580
so that is not rendered as an anchor tag but instead as a list item. With that, we should have a set up

03:05.580 --> 03:11.520
which works with both the bootstrap styling and our vuejs app. So I can remove the other 

03:11.530 --> 03:13.420
bootstrap links here,

03:13.500 --> 03:15.730
that should be an equal sign of course

03:16.020 --> 03:18.550
and with that I'd say we have our router link set up,

03:18.570 --> 03:20.740
I don't need the form here.

03:20.790 --> 03:27.810
Now I want to have some navigation on the right though and here, I want to indeed have a link which allows

03:27.810 --> 03:29.660
me to end my day,

03:29.860 --> 03:38.430
so maybe a link where I keep the standard anchor tag but then change this later on, we'll work on that,

03:38.490 --> 03:43.620
I'll name it end day for now. And then this drop down, I want to have the dropdown,

03:43.620 --> 03:49.920
I didn't import the bootstrap javascript code though, so it will not work by default because we want to write

03:49.920 --> 03:53.590
the logic to open this dropdown and to handle it on our own

03:53.580 --> 03:59.930
in vuejs. You could of course use the bootstrap javascript package to let bootstrap handle this but

03:59.940 --> 04:06.690
on the other hand if you're using vuejs, you really want to do all or as good as all the javascript

04:06.750 --> 04:07.260
work

04:07.290 --> 04:09.280
through vuejs.

04:09.370 --> 04:12.200
So I'm going to leave the drop down here anyway,

04:12.220 --> 04:15.730
that is the sense of what I want to say here,

04:15.820 --> 04:21.870
I'll reorder this anchor tag which opens it though, so here I will bring it simply bring that down over

04:21.870 --> 04:30.150
multiple lines so that we can easier see what's going on here and I'll rename it to save and load

04:30.250 --> 04:33.030
because that is what you'll be able to do in the dropdown in the end

04:33.050 --> 04:38.460
once we implemented it and then regarding the dropdown links, I only need two,

04:38.800 --> 04:44.100
I want to be able to save data and I want to be able to load data later on.

04:44.110 --> 04:48.670
Now we're going to take care about the saving and loading in a later video but it's good to have it

04:48.670 --> 04:50.380
set up right now,

04:50.510 --> 04:53.650
also notice the dropdown, again right now will not work,

04:53.680 --> 04:55.870
we'll also work on that.

04:55.900 --> 05:00.100
So with this, I'd say we have a nice header in place, at least

05:00.100 --> 05:01.480
template wise,

05:01.840 --> 05:06.890
so if we now go back to our app.vue file, we can add this header.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.270
Now in order to add it, we first need to add an import here of course,

05:11.410 --> 05:12.900
so let's quickly do that,

05:12.910 --> 05:24.010
let's import our header from this header, excuse me, components header file and then I'll register it as

05:24.010 --> 05:25.410
a local component here

05:25.410 --> 05:32.800
since I only use it in this component here, so here I'll register my app header with this header file

05:33.150 --> 05:35.220
and I can therefore now add it,

05:35.260 --> 05:38.040
so let's add app header here.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.610
Now the question is do I want to add it here,

05:41.620 --> 05:42.800
the answer is yes,

05:42.820 --> 05:50.820
looks good but I also want to add a div with a class row here and then a div with a class col-md-12

05:50.840 --> 05:58.310
here for some nicer styling and then copy my router vue in there,

05:58.680 --> 06:01.210
that should be called xs here.

06:01.240 --> 06:09.270
So with this in place, let's have a look at our application, we see our header here, looks already better,

06:09.270 --> 06:15.690
one thing I want to do though is in my app.vue file, I want to add a style for my body, for this root component

06:15.690 --> 06:24.660
body to have some extra padding of 30 pixels so that not everything sits directly on the edge. With that,

06:24.660 --> 06:26.130
I'm liking that,

06:26.130 --> 06:27.560
let's see if it works too,

06:27.690 --> 06:28.320
great,

06:28.320 --> 06:31.550
you'll also notice how the active link gets marked here.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.980
So we get this working as it should,

06:33.990 --> 06:40.410
with that I'd say let's move on and work on the next things in our application, specifically let's first

06:40.410 --> 06:41.750
think what that might be.
