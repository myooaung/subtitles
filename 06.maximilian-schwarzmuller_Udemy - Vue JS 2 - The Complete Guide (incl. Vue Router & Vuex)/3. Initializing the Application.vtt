00:01.830 --> 00:08.740
So back in the project, I will run the development server here again and of course we don't see anything

00:08.740 --> 00:16.300
here because it's empty and in the app.vue file, I first want to create my data function to return

00:16.300 --> 00:24.460
this data object I'm going to use and in this data object, I now want to track the maximum number of

00:24.460 --> 00:28.350
quotes and I'll set this to 10 as you saw it in the demo

00:28.780 --> 00:33.790
and I also want to set up the array of quotes,

00:33.790 --> 00:40.000
so a simple property named quotes which is an empty array at the beginning or maybe let's start with

00:40.000 --> 00:42.360
one quote to have something to view,

00:42.370 --> 00:48.790
So this is this, just a quote to see something string because each quote shall simply be a string

00:48.790 --> 00:50.220
let's say, to keep this simple.

00:50.230 --> 00:53.200
It could be an object if it had other properties

00:53.290 --> 00:55.360
but here I really only want to have the content,

00:55.390 --> 00:57.580
so why not use a string,

00:57.580 --> 00:59.120
this is my quote

00:59.140 --> 01:03.560
therefore. With that I got the array, I get the maximum number,

01:03.580 --> 01:08.970
well I'd say let's start working on this grid of quotes we saw before.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.220
And for this, I'll create new components,

01:12.280 --> 01:16.430
so in the components folder, let's create the

01:16.450 --> 01:23.200
QuoteGrid.vue file which will hold this quote grid and the quote.vue file which holds a single quote.

01:23.310 --> 01:26.240
I'll work on these two components next.
