WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:07.070
So we want to make sure that we're not able to sell more than we have or buy for more than we can afford,

00:07.940 --> 00:15.400
in order to do so, we need some checks, let's start with a check for buying stocks. Here in the stock.vue

00:15.410 --> 00:16.250
file,

00:16.290 --> 00:20.560
right now we never check if we actually can afford our plans,

00:20.840 --> 00:26.310
so in order to do check this, I'll add a new computed property to this,

00:26.330 --> 00:35.410
so computed is added and in there, the name of the property I want to add is insufficient funds,

00:35.410 --> 00:37.720
this is a method like all computed properties

00:37.820 --> 00:43.370
and here I simply want to return this quantity, referring to the quantity I entered into the input field

00:43.730 --> 00:52.300
times this stock, stocks of course passed to this component, price greater this funds.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.880
So I do check if my quantity I plan to buy

00:56.060 --> 00:59.130
multiply with the price of the stock, if this is greater than funds,

00:59.140 --> 01:00.990
so if this is true or false.

01:01.060 --> 01:07.030
And now with this computed property which is true or false, I can go to my button and simply disable it

01:07.390 --> 01:11.240
in if insufficient funds is true

01:11.380 --> 01:14.850
and then add an OR sign to also perform the other checks.

01:14.980 --> 01:19.470
So if this is true, then this bottom will be disabled,

01:19.480 --> 01:23.830
now of course funds isn't available yet, for it to become available,

01:23.850 --> 01:32.500
I again need to add my computed property for that where I return this store getters funds, as we did

01:32.500 --> 01:34.050
it many times before.

01:34.060 --> 01:40.360
Now with this in place, we can check this if we reload the app and enter a too high number, the button

01:40.360 --> 01:41.980
indeed gets disabled.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.680
Now I also want to update the text we see on the button depending on this,

01:45.700 --> 01:48.820
so I'll use interpolation for this

01:48.980 --> 01:53.800
and here, I simply want to check insufficient funds,

01:53.800 --> 01:56.650
great word when you are talking whilst writing

01:57.310 --> 02:04.060
and if this is true, I know I don't have enough so I want to print insufficient funds in this case otherwise

02:04.080 --> 02:05.470
I print buy.

02:05.830 --> 02:07.540
So let's see if that also works,

02:07.540 --> 02:08.320
it should,

02:08.480 --> 02:10.150
yes looks good

02:10.160 --> 02:11.470
how it works, great.

02:11.500 --> 02:16.540
So with that, we're making sure we're getting an error message if we're trying to buy something we can't

02:16.540 --> 02:17.410
afford,

02:17.410 --> 02:21.310
we also may put a red border around the input in such a case,

02:21.460 --> 02:27.190
so let's bind a dynamic class here and let's say this class which I yet have to add is called

02:27.220 --> 02:32.410
danger depends on insufficient funds too

02:32.950 --> 02:42.330
and I will create the class here, style and scope it to this component here, this style is called danger,

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
this class is called Danger,

02:43.360 --> 02:50.400
it simply will create a red border of one pixel which is solid and yeah red,

02:50.520 --> 02:56.640
so again if I enter too high number here, we do get this red border around the input, looks great.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.340
So with that, we're making sure we cannot buy more than we can afford,

03:01.510 --> 03:05.920
now I also want to make sure that we can sell more than we have,

03:06.000 --> 03:14.640
so over in the stock.vue file in my portfolio module or folder here, I want to perform a kind

03:14.640 --> 03:15.820
of similar check.

03:15.960 --> 03:24.300
I will add the computed field here to add a new computed property which is called insufficient quantity

03:24.420 --> 03:30.060
because now it's not the funds which is the part restricting our action possibility

03:30.060 --> 03:33.020
but instead the quantity we have in our portfolio.

03:33.210 --> 03:40.950
So here I want to return this quantity, so what we entered into the input field and check if it's greater

03:41.250 --> 03:43.320
than the quantity in our stock,

03:43.320 --> 03:48.330
only if this is the case will I want to return that it's not possible because then we're trying to

03:48.330 --> 03:50.140
sell more than we do have,

03:50.370 --> 03:53.700
so if we want to sell more than is in our

03:53.700 --> 04:00.930
portfolio, we'll get, well not an error but we'll disable the button. So I'll disable the button

04:00.930 --> 04:07.680
if insufficient quantity is true or one of the other conditions of course

04:10.420 --> 04:13.110
and in such a case, I also want to output

04:13.390 --> 04:16.500
so check if insufficient quantity is true

04:16.690 --> 04:24.410
and then I want to output not enough stocks, otherwise I will output sell, like this.

04:25.180 --> 04:35.660
And why don't we also copy that scoped style over there to also mark the input as well

04:35.660 --> 04:36.300
wrong

04:36.360 --> 04:45.300
if this is actually the case, so have the same check here, danger is insufficient quantity and danger of

04:45.300 --> 04:47.240
course refers to this class.

04:47.250 --> 04:51.980
So now if I do buy one and I want to sell two,

04:52.050 --> 04:53.690
I get not enough stocks,

04:53.700 --> 04:59.940
it kind of jumps uglyly here I have to admit, simply due to the styling,

04:59.940 --> 05:02.700
so let me maybe just change this to

05:02.700 --> 05:08.840
not enough to have a quick fix at hand, looks better and I can sell one stock of course,

05:08.850 --> 05:12.800
zero is not allowed because it's too less but one does work.

05:13.020 --> 05:18.600
So now we get these checks in place, we're able to sell our stocks and buy if the funds get updated,

05:18.600 --> 05:22.260
everything seems to work great.

05:22.260 --> 05:28.290
The next thing is a minor thing but the funds, if we look at them, it works but it's not looking great,

05:28.370 --> 05:31.830
it would be nice to have a dollar sign and form it is more like a currency.

05:31.830 --> 05:35.640
So next challenge for you, maybe a filter is helpful here,

05:35.790 --> 05:38.400
let's try building it together in the next video.
