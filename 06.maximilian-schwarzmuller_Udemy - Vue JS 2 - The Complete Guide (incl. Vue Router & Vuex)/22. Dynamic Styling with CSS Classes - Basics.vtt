Still with me? You are now really the kings of outputting data and listening to events.

00:07.370 --> 00:10.190
With that, we got a lot of things covered,

00:10.260 --> 00:16.830
you will use a lot in your day to day applications, listening to user input and outputting transform

00:16.830 --> 00:22.920
data or whatever data really is a core task you'll well have in all your applications and which really

00:22.920 --> 00:28.140
makes up most of your applications, at least when it comes to this frontend connection, so to rendering

00:28.140 --> 00:29.350
it in the browser.

00:29.790 --> 00:38.790
But there is one other piece you will also use a lot and that is changing the styling, attaching css classes.

00:38.820 --> 00:41.040
Look at this example on the right here,

00:41.220 --> 00:48.120
I got three divs here which are gray blocks by default because I set up this demo css class,

00:48.250 --> 00:50.900
no vuejs code involved here at all,

00:51.030 --> 00:54.650
yes I have setup this element connection but I'm not doing anything there

00:54.810 --> 01:03.190
as you can clearly tell. Now it would be interesting to see how we can attach classes to these divs.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.670
So let's quickly create three new css classes,

01:06.830 --> 01:15.260
a red class which will set the background color to you guessed it, red and then copying this class, a

01:15.270 --> 01:18.340
green class which does the same with

01:18.510 --> 01:20.380
well surprisingly green

01:20.580 --> 01:23.990
and then the blue class which does the same with blue,

01:24.030 --> 01:29.160
so now we get three new css classes here which we can use in our application.

01:29.190 --> 01:34.560
Now of course I could attach it like that but that would be pretty boring right,

01:34.740 --> 01:38.400
let's instead see what vuejs can do for us,

01:38.430 --> 01:41.980
let's start simple and say I want to attach this red block

01:42.000 --> 01:44.990
only if I click on this element and detach it

01:45.000 --> 01:52.890
if I click again. To be able to well show this, I'll add my data property to the view instance which is

01:52.890 --> 01:56.390
hooked up to this code which has this as a template

01:56.700 --> 01:59.290
and here, I will set up a new property,

01:59.360 --> 02:06.300
I'll name it attach red and initially I'll set it to false, to say no I don't want to attach it initially.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.420
Upon clicking on it,

02:09.480 --> 02:12.130
I want to set attach red to

02:12.270 --> 02:17.370
well what it currently is not, so to the opposite, with this exclamation mark,

02:17.370 --> 02:20.570
I'm basically switching it from true to false

02:20.580 --> 02:22.980
and the other way around.

02:23.130 --> 02:24.450
Now this is nice,

02:24.450 --> 02:29.430
I'll just split this up over multiple lines so that it's easier to read but that alone won't do anything

02:29.430 --> 02:35.990
as of now. In order to conditionally attach a css class,

02:36.180 --> 02:42.380
I need to bind to the class property here and I can do this with colon class,

02:42.420 --> 02:48.120
notice that it doesn't matter that I alredy attach class here with the demo, with colon class.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.670
I'm using vuejs syntax and I'm not reusing the class attribute here.

02:52.710 --> 02:53.990
Yes I'm binding to it

02:54.090 --> 02:59.580
but behind the scenes, vuejs will merge this all into one class object.

02:59.610 --> 03:03.170
So here, I need to pass a javascript object as an argument,

03:03.180 --> 03:05.840
this is just what vuejs expects here

03:06.150 --> 03:12.090
and this object should be which css class has a key,

03:12.240 --> 03:15.990
should I attach and has a value, should I attach it or not,

03:15.990 --> 03:18.060
so true or false.

03:18.150 --> 03:22.580
Now here I clearly want to attach the red css class,

03:22.620 --> 03:23.850
so red like this,

03:23.850 --> 03:30.180
you could also enclose it in single quotation marks and you would need to do this if your class contains

03:30.180 --> 03:34.370
a special character like a dash but since it doesn't here, I don't have to

03:34.740 --> 03:41.700
and then the condition will be attach red which is false initially but could be true. If I now hit control

03:41.700 --> 03:42.560
enter,

03:42.780 --> 03:50.370
you see I can now turn on and off this red class here due to this single code, this single line of

03:50.370 --> 03:58.050
code here where I set up my red class as a key here referring to this css property and connect it

03:58.140 --> 03:59.240
to attach red

03:59.280 --> 04:03.570
which is true or false and switch constantly by clicking on this div.

04:03.660 --> 04:10.530
Of course I could now copy that and also add it to another div and if I now save this,

04:10.530 --> 04:16.080
now both are of course switched on and off because they share the same property, attach red which

04:16.080 --> 04:20.370
is the one well deciding on whether it should be attached or not.
