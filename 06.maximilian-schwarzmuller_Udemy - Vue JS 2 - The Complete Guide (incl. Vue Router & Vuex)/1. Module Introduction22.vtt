00:02.010 --> 00:04.110
Until now we have worked in JSFiddle,

00:04.110 --> 00:09.220
well maybe you followed along on your local setup as I showed it in the first section of this

00:09.240 --> 00:10.070
course

00:10.380 --> 00:17.310
but no matter if you did that or if we use that, that is really just a setup which works for very simple

00:17.340 --> 00:20.850
and small applications like the app we built before.

00:20.850 --> 00:26.460
It's not a setup you want to use for medium sized or certainly not for big projects,

00:26.520 --> 00:30.370
so in this course module we'll do the transition,

00:30.490 --> 00:37.080
we'll take the basics we learned thus far, all the basics about vuejs and now, we'll put them into

00:37.110 --> 00:41.990
work in bigger projects or in medium sized projects to begin with. To do that,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.400
we need a different setup,

00:43.410 --> 00:45.730
we'll move away from JSFiddle.

00:45.780 --> 00:50.780
It's great for showcasing basic things but we're leaving this world now,

00:50.850 --> 00:54.420
now we want to dive into components, into building bigger applications,

00:54.420 --> 01:01.730
building our application up from different parts and pieces and for that, we will need a more elaborate build

01:01.970 --> 01:06.200
process which sounds bigger than it is but we need some additional tools,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.050
we need some additional features and JSFiddle just doesn't offer them,

01:10.140 --> 01:15.990
especially it will get more and more different to kind of understand what's going on if you only have

01:16.230 --> 01:18.290
this small of an editor.

01:18.300 --> 01:25.230
So with that in this module, we'll have a look at which workflows we could use when using or when working

01:25.230 --> 01:28.190
with vuejs, how vuejs supports us with that

01:28.260 --> 01:30.710
and what's so special about these workflows.

01:30.780 --> 01:31.500
Let's dive in.
