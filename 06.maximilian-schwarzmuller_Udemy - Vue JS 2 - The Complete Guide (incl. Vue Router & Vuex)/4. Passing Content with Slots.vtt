00:01.820 --> 00:03.280
How do we use slots?

00:03.290 --> 00:04.310
Very simple,

00:04.580 --> 00:09.110
all I do is in the child component where I want to receive the data,

00:09.160 --> 00:14.590
I add this slot, not sloat, slot component kind of.

00:14.780 --> 00:21.440
Now this is a reserved word vuejs will detect and if I now save this, we now see the quote. Now

00:21.470 --> 00:28.550
the slot here is taking over and now renders the content we're passing from outside, so it renders this

00:28.700 --> 00:29.170
part

00:29.170 --> 00:36.530
between the opening and closing selector here. This is now what this slot does which allows us to pass

00:36.530 --> 00:40.760
in data from outside and render it in the child component.
