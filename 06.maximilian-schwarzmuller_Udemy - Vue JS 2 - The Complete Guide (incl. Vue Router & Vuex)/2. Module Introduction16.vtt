Welcome to this module. Authentication is something which plays an important role in almost any web application,

00:11.160 --> 00:12.620
authentication

00:12.660 --> 00:20.040
also to a great deal happens on the backend, on the server and therefore is not really relevant to vuejs.

00:20.140 --> 00:28.530
But there actually is something special about authentication in single page applications

00:28.650 --> 00:31.620
and that again is where vue comes in.

00:31.620 --> 00:40.230
We won't focus on validating user passwords on the server, sending confirmation emails or storing data

00:40.230 --> 00:43.480
in the database because that all happens on the server

00:43.530 --> 00:47.210
and that of course greatly depends on the kind of server side language you're using,

00:47.250 --> 00:52.260
are you using PHP and MySQL, are you using node and MongoDB, node and

00:52.280 --> 00:58.810
MySQL, whatever it is, this is something a dedicated node PHP and so on course should teach you

00:59.280 --> 01:07.830
but I will show you how to add authentication to the frontend, how to get a so-called token, more about

01:07.830 --> 01:13.440
this in the next lecture from the backend, how to store and manage that token, how to integrate it with

01:13.620 --> 01:19.230
vuex, how to protect routes against unwanted access and much more.

01:19.230 --> 01:26.100
So this is the goal of this module, show you how to integrate authentication, as a demo backend, I will

01:26.100 --> 01:32.400
use firebase for the reasons I mentioned a few seconds ago about how you need to adjust the backend depending

01:32.400 --> 01:38.850
on the server side language. With firebase, authentication is easy but it actually gives us exactly the

01:38.850 --> 01:42.940
API we would have with any custom backend too.

01:43.080 --> 01:50.430
So what I show you here does not only work with firebase but with any backend, now how however does

01:50.460 --> 01:52.350
authentication then work?

01:52.470 --> 01:56.850
That is super important and something I will explain in the next lecture.
