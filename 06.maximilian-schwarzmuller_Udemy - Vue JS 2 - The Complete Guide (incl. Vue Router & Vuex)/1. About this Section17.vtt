00:02.810 --> 00:04.410
Welcome to this module,

00:04.430 --> 00:06.880
great to have you here. In this module,

00:06.950 --> 00:11.250
we'll have a look at validation, input validation.

00:11.330 --> 00:17.930
This module takes the same project and uses the same project as we used in the axios and authentication

00:17.930 --> 00:18.850
module,

00:18.890 --> 00:22.130
you don't necessarily need to complete these modules,

00:22.130 --> 00:25.370
just be aware that it basically builds up on them,

00:25.370 --> 00:31.340
it uses the same project and therefore, if there are some features in that module which you don't understand,

00:31.430 --> 00:36.960
features in the project code you find attached to this module, then you might get back to these other bonus 

00:36.980 --> 00:42.770
modules about axios and authentication to learn how this was built up from the ground.

00:43.010 --> 00:48.470
You can still dive into this module without watching them if you only want to see the validation part,

00:48.470 --> 00:54.070
just make sure that you dig through the source code to understand what the project does. With that,

00:54.080 --> 00:54.770
let's start.
