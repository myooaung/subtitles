00:01.830 --> 00:07.110
Time for another exercise. We learned about events and how we could work with them, time to put this into

00:07.110 --> 00:12.670
practice and get deeper into events to really work with them without any issues.

00:12.690 --> 00:16.240
Here are the exercises I prepared, in the first task,

00:16.290 --> 00:20.310
I want you to simply show an alert whenever we click this button.

00:20.340 --> 00:25.280
This should be pretty straightforward to handle with an event handler and probably a function, just a

00:25.270 --> 00:26.300
little bit.

00:26.460 --> 00:33.670
The second exercise here then is a bit of a more advanced technique but we also learned this, here

00:33.750 --> 00:41.470
I want you to listen to a keydown event on this input here and store the value in a data property.

00:41.490 --> 00:47.580
So we kind of need access to the value of this input field here, of this input element

00:47.580 --> 00:48.670
and here's a hint,

00:48.690 --> 00:55.980
event.target.value might give us value, the keydown event might be the one you want to listen to to successfully

00:55.980 --> 01:01.890
store the value in a data property and we output this value property below this input so that we can

01:01.890 --> 01:03.810
see what we entered.

01:03.810 --> 01:08.330
The third exercise here then takes the last one, the second one

01:08.400 --> 01:14.660
but here we want to make sure that yes we still listen to keydown but only if the enter key is pressed

01:14.670 --> 01:17.760
do we want to refresh this value property,

01:17.760 --> 01:22.620
we also learned a way to well constrain the keys we're listening to.

01:22.620 --> 01:28.530
These are the three exercises, using how you call functions, how you execute code, how you pass arguments,

01:28.530 --> 01:30.870
how you work with the default event argument

01:31.050 --> 01:33.690
and with that, let's get started.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.450
And in the next video, we can solve this together in case you got stuck somewhere or simply want to compare

01:39.450 --> 01:40.350
your solution.
