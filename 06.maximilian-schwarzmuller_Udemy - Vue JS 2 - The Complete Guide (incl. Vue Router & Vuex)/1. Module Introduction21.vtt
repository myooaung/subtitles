WEBVTT

00:02.020 --> 00:09.760
Welcome to this course module. After two modules of diving super deep into vuejs and learning how

00:09.760 --> 00:15.160
to interact with the dom, how to change that, how to react to events, how to conditionally show content and how

00:15.160 --> 00:16.700
to render lists,

00:16.780 --> 00:18.830
I now want to focus on the vue

00:18.850 --> 00:25.730
instance, this thing we created all the time with new vue and then passing this object.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.330
Let's take a closer look,

00:27.370 --> 00:28.560
how does it work,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.810
which properties do we have,

00:31.030 --> 00:36.660
how is it created, which will lifecycle does it run through, how may we use it in ways we haven't used

00:36.660 --> 00:38.790
it before and much more.

00:38.980 --> 00:45.250
This module will be a bit more theoretical and if you're not interested and all, feel free to skip it,

00:45.520 --> 00:52.510
though for really understanding how vuejs works, I strongly recommend having a look at it or at least

00:52.510 --> 00:56.950
having a look at the specific videos which sound interesting to you.

00:57.160 --> 01:02.090
Well with that, let's dive in and work our way through the vuejs instance.
