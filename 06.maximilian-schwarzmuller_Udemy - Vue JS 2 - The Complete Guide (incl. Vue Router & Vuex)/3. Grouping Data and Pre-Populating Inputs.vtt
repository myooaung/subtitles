In the last lecture, we started simple.

00:04.000 --> 00:12.160
We hooked up this mail input field with our mail property here in our vue instance, that is great

00:12.160 --> 00:12.640
start,

00:12.640 --> 00:18.520
it shows us that we use v-model to connect our html input with our property, two-way binding that

00:18.520 --> 00:23.240
is. I also explained that vuejs will magically update it correctly.

00:23.260 --> 00:29.170
Now let's dive a bit deeper and let's say I don't only want to have this email property, instead I want

00:29.170 --> 00:35.860
to have a user data object here which then has an email field and what else have we got here,

00:35.860 --> 00:38.020
we also get a password and an age.

00:38.050 --> 00:42.890
So when I group these three inputs here together, so that we have them in one object down there,

00:42.940 --> 00:49.630
so that would be the email here, that will be the password and then that would be the age, that should

00:49.630 --> 00:51.190
be grouped together

00:51.190 --> 00:55.540
and therefore I can delete this and age shall actually not be a string but a number

00:55.540 --> 01:01.690
and let's pre-populate this with a default number, 27 here that is my real age and I want to prepopulate

01:01.690 --> 01:03.260
the form with that.

01:03.370 --> 01:09.790
Now with that object set up, I can simply bind to that by accessing my object here, user data.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.720
email now,

01:10.720 --> 01:14.760
now I'm binding to a property in an object and that's perfectly valid.

01:15.040 --> 01:21.900
I can now take this approach and also hook up my password with v-model here to also store it in the

01:21.910 --> 01:24.600
user data and then here in the password field

01:24.730 --> 01:28.830
and well for the age, we want to do the same. For the age,

01:28.870 --> 01:32.590
we also want to hook this up to user data and then age

01:32.590 --> 01:33.560
in this case.

01:33.670 --> 01:41.980
Now if I save this and we head over, we see that age is indeed pre-populated with that 27 I set

01:41.980 --> 01:44.890
up down there as a default value.

01:44.890 --> 01:48.130
Now I can also fill out all the other fields of course,

01:48.130 --> 01:53.260
enter my secret password and well now, we're not seeing it down there.

01:53.260 --> 01:59.350
The reason for that of course simply is that I still use e-mail here but that changed to user data.

01:59.380 --> 01:59.800
email,

01:59.800 --> 02:03.620
it's an object now and I'm not outputting it for password and age.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.770
So let's do that, user data

02:05.800 --> 02:14.150
email and also output user data age here, like that.

02:14.220 --> 02:16.950
Now I save this and head back,

02:16.950 --> 02:21.450
we now see the values populated in this data box down there.

02:21.600 --> 02:29.160
This is how we can use a more complex object to nest our properties and how to pre populate a field by

02:29.160 --> 02:31.560
simply setting the property initially.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.330
Now as you will see, I can of course overwrite this,

02:34.350 --> 02:36.950
if I set this to 30, it's 30 down there too.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.730
So this is how we can use this set up.
