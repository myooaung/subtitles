Well in the last video, we had a look at why you might want to use a development workflow and what that actually

00:07.050 --> 00:10.470
is, we could setup such a workflow on our own,

00:10.500 --> 00:13.470
you could use webpack if you were familiar with that

00:13.560 --> 00:19.140
and there, we have the vue loader to say that right away which is a package allowing us to for example

00:19.140 --> 00:24.450
transform such single file templates. But we don't have to set it up on our own

00:24.450 --> 00:27.570
and actually in this course, we won't do that.

00:27.630 --> 00:35.170
We will use the vue-cli and cli sounds like a big powerful many feature tool but actually the vue-cli

00:35.170 --> 00:37.490
has one major task,

00:37.500 --> 00:46.290
it allows us to fetch vuejs project templates which means to fetch certain projects setups which

00:46.290 --> 00:53.400
are empty but which have a build process setup and you can dive into such a build process of course to kind of

00:53.400 --> 00:57.540
tweak it and to adjust to your needs or to find out how to setup your own.

00:57.780 --> 01:03.490
We can install the vue cli with that command, it's very easy and that installs it globally on our machine,

01:03.510 --> 01:08.100
on Mac you will have to throw a sudo in front of that, on Linux too

01:08.460 --> 01:12.220
and then we have access to a multitude of available templates.

01:12.330 --> 01:16.570
For example here, the simple template, that is basically the same we used

01:16.680 --> 01:17.160
in JSFiddle,

01:17.250 --> 01:21.060
it's an index.html file and then the script import from a CDN.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.950
But we also have a simple webpack workflow, that is the one we'll use in this course.

01:25.950 --> 01:32.910
It has a nice webpack workflow which will compile our single file templates which allows us to use

01:32.930 --> 01:40.460
ES6, all these nice things has really the things we need and gives us a nice production ready application.

01:40.470 --> 01:46.620
Now if you want a big package with testing and all these other next level features, you could also

01:46.620 --> 01:53.130
use the webpack workflow which well includes that and which is more powerful but a bit overkill for

01:53.130 --> 01:58.100
this course where I don't want to dive into css processing or testing,

01:58.110 --> 02:02.540
I want to focus on vuejs that we understand and learn vuejs.

02:02.660 --> 02:08.040
You also could use browserify templates if you prefer that over webpack but we will use webpack

02:08.040 --> 02:15.570
as this is kind of the cool kid in the world of frontend web development right now. Regarding the template compilation

02:15.570 --> 02:17.090
I was talking about earlier,

02:17.130 --> 02:23.280
all templates except the simple one support this so that we have these single file templates compiled

02:23.550 --> 02:29.820
to our code, our javascript template so that we can have this improved runtime configuration with the

02:29.820 --> 02:32.980
smaller vuejs package and the better performance.
