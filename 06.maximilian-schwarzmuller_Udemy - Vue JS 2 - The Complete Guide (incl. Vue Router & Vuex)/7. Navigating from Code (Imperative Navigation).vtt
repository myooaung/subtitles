It's nice that we're able to navigate with router link

00:04.690 --> 00:10.060
but sometimes you want to trigger the navigation in your javascript code because some operation finished

00:10.060 --> 00:15.520
and you want to navigate away let's say. I'm going to simulate this in the user component here,

00:15.520 --> 00:22.630
here I will first add my script path and export my javascript object and in here I simply want

00:22.630 --> 00:29.910
to set up a method to which I can bind a button thereafter, I'll name it navigate to home and all

00:29.910 --> 00:33.230
I want to do here is well navigate to my home page.

00:33.360 --> 00:40.540
So in the user page itself, I'll set up a div because again we may only have one root element in here,

00:40.650 --> 00:42.230
so let's set up this

00:42.480 --> 00:44.310
and then there, I want to have a button.

00:44.310 --> 00:49.090
Now of course I could just use a router link but you get my point I think, what I want to show here,

00:49.200 --> 00:56.240
so go to a home and then I want to add a click listener and execute navigate to home,

00:56.240 --> 00:58.020
so this method I just set up.

00:58.050 --> 01:01.540
Now how do we navigate from within our code?

01:01.830 --> 01:07.970
Well in our method, we can access our vue instance and there, we will have the router available with

01:07.970 --> 01:08.930
$router,

01:09.060 --> 01:16.140
so this is the general theme of objects from vue itself or from your router in this case, having the

01:16.140 --> 01:21.120
dollar sign at the beginning to mark that this is not our own object but instead is provided by

01:21.220 --> 01:29.550
another package to us. On this router, we can now trigger navigation by calling push and push is the word we

01:29.550 --> 01:35.250
use because we want to push it on the stack of existing routes so that our back and forward buttons

01:35.250 --> 01:40.200
will work fine because we will have the old route saved as well,

01:40.200 --> 01:47.550
so this pushes it on the stack of routes we're at therefore. Now push in its simplest case simply

01:47.540 --> 01:54.100
takes the path where we want to go, like this but we could also pass an object here where we say path

01:54.120 --> 02:00.630
should be this and that is of course not really an improvement to just specifying the path but I will come

02:00.630 --> 02:07.650
back to passing an object as a routing target for route to link as well as a side note in one of the

02:07.650 --> 02:08.830
next lectures,

02:08.850 --> 02:13.150
for now let's keep it simple and simply go to slash.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.140
Now to see this in action,

02:16.140 --> 02:20.500
I'll just add some nice styling to this button,

02:20.540 --> 02:23.660
let's head over to the user page and click go to home

02:23.780 --> 02:25.580
and we're back on the home page.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.700
This is how easy it is to navigate in our code

02:28.880 --> 02:36.420
and of course you hopefully see the similarity to our router link where we also have this to attribute

02:36.420 --> 02:38.080
here where we specify a path

02:38.190 --> 02:40.140
while I do the same here with push.
