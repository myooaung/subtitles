00:01.930 --> 00:03.730
So selling a stock doesn't work,

00:03.730 --> 00:07.080
we get this maximum called stack size exceeded,

00:07.100 --> 00:11.620
I do want to change the color of the box. So I'll give it to my stock.vue

00:11.630 --> 00:18.450
file in the portfolio folder, the box color is easily changed by changing panel success to panel info

00:18.550 --> 00:21.430
but now the question is why does selling not work?

00:21.580 --> 00:26.820
I do have my sell stock method here and I create an order but

00:26.860 --> 00:33.780
I don't pass the order here as it looks like, so that looks like a good reason why it doesn't work,

00:33.790 --> 00:39.150
also after selling, I want to reset my quantity to zero,

00:39.370 --> 00:41.660
so let's see if it now works.

00:41.680 --> 00:46.210
If I now open the console again, clear it and sell,

00:46.210 --> 00:49.340
we still get this error so that was not related to it.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.860
So let's dig deeper, what's going wrong here?

00:52.060 --> 00:55.680
Well it's an error which is good

00:55.680 --> 00:58.260
that it occurred because it's something to watch out for,

00:58.630 --> 01:01.220
I did name this method sell stock,

01:01.300 --> 01:07.120
it's the one I execute if I click this button and I also map my sell stock action to be named sell

01:07.120 --> 01:07.580
stock.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.680
So both methods have the same name,

01:09.760 --> 01:15.310
so whenever I click sell stock, it executes this method where I call this sell stock again and again

01:15.310 --> 01:17.700
and it always calls itself again.

01:17.890 --> 01:25.250
So to fix this, we have to rename either of the two functions and I will rename my action, map it to a

01:25.250 --> 01:27.510
different name here in an object,

01:27.710 --> 01:40.290
I will name it place sell order and bind it to sell stock in my store and then here, I call place sell

01:40.350 --> 01:41.670
order.

01:41.670 --> 01:44.340
Now with this in place with a capital O

01:44.340 --> 01:49.650
though, with this in place, we should now see that if I try it again, now it works,

01:49.650 --> 01:51.880
the stock is gone. Now to

01:51.880 --> 01:54.380
also see if that changes our funds and so on,

01:54.390 --> 01:57.770
we of course need to display our funds, so let's do that next.
