Welcome to this module,

00:04.370 --> 00:12.790
this module is about axios, a popular package for making http requests from javascript applications.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.510
So it's not specific to vue,

00:14.540 --> 00:20.300
you can use it in any javascript application but of course vuejs uses javascript and therefore,

00:20.300 --> 00:23.810
you may use axios in vue applications.

00:23.810 --> 00:29.680
It's essentially an alternative to vue resource which you learned about earlier in this course

00:29.870 --> 00:32.810
and here's one thing I definitely want to point out,

00:32.810 --> 00:35.930
there is nothing wrong with using vue resource.

00:36.130 --> 00:42.950
I covered it in this course because it is also a popular pick for vue applications but if you don't like

00:42.950 --> 00:48.080
it or if you want to use axios because you know it from other applications or because it looks interesting

00:48.080 --> 00:49.730
to you, feel free to do so,

00:49.730 --> 00:50.910
both are fine,

00:50.930 --> 00:55.560
none of them is insecure or not recommended or anything like that,

00:55.610 --> 00:57.370
you may choose whichever you want.

00:57.380 --> 01:03.800
So with that let's cover axios and let's learn how it works and how we may integrate it into a vue application

01:04.160 --> 01:05.290
in this module.
