WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:07.280
So I opened up the project we just created in WebStorm which is the IDE I'm using, as mentioned

00:07.280 --> 00:11.420
earlier in the course, feel free to use any IDE or editor you want to use

00:11.810 --> 00:16.670
and then we have these very basic simple well folder structure here.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.480
The most important folder for us will be the source folder,

00:19.490 --> 00:23.180
this is where we write our source code, our vuejs code

00:23.180 --> 00:25.710
and you can see, we already got a couple of files here,

00:25.720 --> 00:28.130
I will come back to these files in a second.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.970
First I want to quickly guide you through the other files,

00:31.130 --> 00:37.250
well babel here, this babel config file basically sets up babel which is a transpiler allowing

00:37.250 --> 00:38.950
us to write ES6 code,

00:38.990 --> 00:42.030
so this next version of javascript today

00:42.050 --> 00:47.840
and then this transpiler will transpile it to ES5 code so that we're able to run it in any browser

00:48.020 --> 00:51.960
and not just in the latest browsers which already support ES6 features.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.110
That's very handy because we want to use ES6 syntax,

00:55.190 --> 00:57.010
it gives us some shortcuts

00:57.010 --> 00:57.850
and some nice features

00:57.860 --> 01:03.730
we definitely want to enjoy and use. Well gitignore is just for the git version control system,

01:03.860 --> 01:08.390
the index.html file is the file which actually gets served

01:08.390 --> 01:10.650
so this is what we're viewing here

01:10.670 --> 01:17.950
in the end but of course since this is a vuejs application, this file is edited by vuejs.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.250
It's basically the html section

01:20.270 --> 01:23.090
we were editing in JSFiddle in the other videos

01:23.300 --> 01:29.450
and therefore it looks very well related to these videos, just that we have a full html file here

01:29.450 --> 01:30.520
with a head too

01:30.650 --> 01:36.470
but then in the body, we got our div with the ID app and then we get this script import here which clearly

01:36.470 --> 01:39.860
imports our build vuejs application.

01:39.860 --> 01:46.340
Now I'm saying build because unlike in JSFiddle, we're not writing our vuejs code and it gets

01:46.340 --> 01:47.830
executed instantly,

01:47.900 --> 01:51.400
instead here we're using webpack to build our files.

01:51.410 --> 01:57.010
Now what needs to be built? Now for example if we use ES6 syntax, that needs to be transpiled to

01:57.020 --> 01:57.720
ES5,

01:57.980 --> 01:59.520
so webpack will do that,

01:59.540 --> 02:01.070
it will also do a couple of other things,

02:01.070 --> 02:07.040
I'll come back to this and will give us an output which lives in the dist folder and then in a bundled

02:07.100 --> 02:14.420
build.js file. Bundled also means that we're able to split up our vuejs over multiple files, our vuejs

02:14.420 --> 02:17.840
code over multiple files and it will be bundled into one file

02:17.870 --> 02:24.180
in the end, this makes for a greater development experience while serving one file in the end too.

02:24.320 --> 02:30.620
Now you won't see the dist folder here because in development mode, all of this is created in memory,

02:30.680 --> 02:32.660
in the memory of your machine,

02:32.690 --> 02:39.170
so to see this dist folder, we will have to build it for production and I will come back to this.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.100
So this is our index.html file,

02:41.120 --> 02:46.960
the package.json file here manage this all, the dependencies, as you can see that's vuejs

02:47.000 --> 02:49.310
for production and then for development,

02:49.310 --> 02:57.290
it's the webpack server then some babel related packages to be able to write ES6 code and some

02:57.290 --> 03:04.160
other transpilers and loaders, especially the vue loader here is important since this allows us to

03:04.460 --> 03:09.660
write, to use these single file templates to which I'll come back in a second.

03:10.880 --> 03:15.100
Well now we got our webpack config file which is responsible for building everything

03:15.330 --> 03:21.810
and well transpiling our code, setting up our build process and knows how to handle different files

03:21.810 --> 03:28.530
for example, then that .vue file which we'll talk about in a second should be loaded with the vue

03:28.680 --> 03:29.630
loader.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.790
So that's the general setup,

03:31.830 --> 03:37.220
let's now dive into our source folder and understand what this .vue file

03:37.230 --> 03:37.860
here is.
