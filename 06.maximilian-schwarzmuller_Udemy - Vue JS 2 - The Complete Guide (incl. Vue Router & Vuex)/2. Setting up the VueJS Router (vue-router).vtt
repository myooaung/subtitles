The cool thing about this routing section is all the things you learned before will work just like

00:06.730 --> 00:12.470
you learned it but now you are able to simply switch out different components in your application through

00:12.530 --> 00:16.900
the router and therefore load different pieces dynamically.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.810
So where do we start?

00:18.820 --> 00:26.290
I do have a nice little application here, as you already know it mostly with bootstrap imported in the index.html

00:26.290 --> 00:32.560
file and then in this app.vue file, just a relatively empty template but you see I already also created

00:32.560 --> 00:37.360
some components which we'll use, you'll find the starting project attached to this lecture.

00:37.390 --> 00:44.260
I did create a couple of components which are pretty much empty and only display what they contain basically

00:44.530 --> 00:47.130
so that we are able to select the user and so on,

00:47.260 --> 00:52.780
I created these components because for routing, it's all about dynamically switching these components.

00:52.870 --> 00:57.150
These components can kind of represent our pages if you want to look at it like this

00:57.250 --> 01:02.390
and therefore, it's key to have multiple of them so that we can demonstrate this.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.740
Well let's start simple

01:04.870 --> 01:12.180
and let's actually begin with setting up our application here and add some routes to it.

01:12.340 --> 01:19.180
For that we need the vue router like in the last lecture or the last module excuse me where we use

01:19.180 --> 01:21.730
the vue resource package,

01:21.730 --> 01:27.460
now I'm going to install a third party package, the vue router because it's not included in vuejs by default

01:27.490 --> 01:34.330
because vuejs in its core maybe use like we used it before, to only dump in certain widgets or pieces

01:34.330 --> 01:37.930
into existing applications into multi-page applications,

01:38.110 --> 01:41.830
but with this package we can now enable single page features.

01:42.130 --> 01:51.220
So here, npm and then install --save to save it as a production dependency vue router, now

01:51.250 --> 01:52.530
by hitting enter,

01:52.570 --> 02:00.430
this will pull down the router and install it and is finished and it automatically installs the 2.0 version

02:00.430 --> 02:05.710
of the router which is the one for vuejs 2.0 which we are of course using in this course.

02:05.860 --> 02:08.920
So the router was installed here

02:09.770 --> 02:14.320
and with that router installed, it's time to set up some routes in the next video.
