After learning about slots which allow us to distribute content, I now want to add some other dynamic

00:08.260 --> 00:14.740
thing we can add to our components, specifically how we can use something called dynamic components.

00:14.740 --> 00:17.150
Now what are dynamic components?

00:17.500 --> 00:23.700
Well imagine you not only have your quote here which you registered as a component but you do have two

00:23.790 --> 00:25.090
other components,

00:25.300 --> 00:32.320
let's say you also have the appAuthor component and the appNew component.

00:32.440 --> 00:39.640
Now I will quickly create these files here so I have my Author.vue file and then I have my

00:39.880 --> 00:48.740
New.vue file, a lower case v here. And then I'll quickly copy my quote in there,

00:48.850 --> 00:50.580
remove the styling,

00:50.590 --> 00:51.930
don't need that

00:51.930 --> 00:58.280
and all I want to display here inside this div is a h3 tag where I say The Author,

00:58.300 --> 01:00.440
so just some dummy content

01:00.640 --> 01:07.480
and in my new quote or excuse me in my new component, I also only want to display new quote. So we're not

01:07.480 --> 01:10.300
able to do anything here because I want to show something else

01:10.360 --> 01:13.110
but we do have three distinct components now.

01:13.410 --> 01:17.280
With that, I can quickly import them here, so the author

01:17.440 --> 01:19.100
and of course also

01:19.270 --> 01:21.980
the new file and then assign it here.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.880
So three components in place,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.720
we know that setup,

01:31.720 --> 01:36.690
now I want to dynamically decide which one to display here,

01:36.760 --> 01:38.620
I don't want to display all three,

01:38.650 --> 01:41.120
I'm not going to add app author and so on,

01:41.140 --> 01:43.440
I'm not going to add all the selectors.

01:43.600 --> 01:50.050
Instead I only have one place here where I want to display any of the three components depending on which

01:50.050 --> 01:51.640
button was pressed,

01:51.640 --> 01:54.270
so I will add three buttons here

01:54.370 --> 01:56.870
above this component part.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.640
The first one will select the quote component,

02:00.640 --> 02:08.710
the second one will select the author component and the last one will select the new component.

02:09.310 --> 02:18.510
To make this happen, I'll add a new field in my data property and there, I want to store the new property

02:19.550 --> 02:24.560
selected component let's say and by default, this shall be my

02:27.180 --> 02:30.560
app quote component or app quote written like this,

02:30.570 --> 02:33.330
so the name of the selector here basically.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.860
So this will be my default component

02:36.150 --> 02:39.570
and here when I click this, I will set @click,

02:40.230 --> 02:44.770
well in this case here I want to say selected component

02:44.880 --> 02:47.580
equals app quote,

02:47.700 --> 02:55.670
so the default but in the other two cases, I of course want to select appAuthor and here, I want to select

02:55.680 --> 02:57.090
appNew.

02:57.090 --> 02:59.010
Now that's not doing anything though,

02:59.170 --> 03:03.950
I set this up so I can change this property but it doesn't have any effect.

03:03.990 --> 03:12.540
We can see it if I print it out here, let's simply output selected component to see if it generally

03:12.540 --> 03:13.710
works.

03:13.710 --> 03:18.510
So if we save this and I click author and new, we see it change

03:18.540 --> 03:21.080
but now I want to also change the

03:21.120 --> 03:28.820
atually loaded component down there. To do this, I'll introduce a so-called dynamic component,

03:29.100 --> 03:31.550
how do we do that? For this,

03:31.590 --> 03:39.780
I will comment out the old selector here so that we still can see it but now I use the component, component

03:39.780 --> 03:40.260
here.

03:40.260 --> 03:47.340
This selector is a reserved word just like slot, component is also recognized by vuejs and component allows

03:47.340 --> 03:55.950
us to dynamically add components. I can bind component to a property which holds the component which

03:55.950 --> 03:58.120
should get loaded.

03:58.290 --> 04:06.540
So here to bind it, I have to use the is attribute and use a colon to bind it to a data property, so

04:06.780 --> 04:08.540
to a dynamic property

04:08.790 --> 04:13.710
and then I want to bind this to selected component, like that.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.980
What this does is and is a keyword of course,

04:16.980 --> 04:23.700
what this does is that this component now gets bound to the selected component property down there which

04:23.700 --> 04:30.390
is appQuote by default and it will then have a look at the value of selected component which has to be a

04:30.390 --> 04:37.410
string and that string is then interpreted as the selector of the component which now should get loaded

04:37.410 --> 04:38.370
dynamically,

04:38.370 --> 04:40.260
so appQuote by default.

04:40.350 --> 04:46.920
Therefore if I save this and I reload this, well we still see it work but we don't pass any content

04:46.920 --> 04:56.880
of course because I don't have a content in between. If I now say default content here in between, well

04:57.000 --> 05:01.720
we see that gets occupied down there in our default slot.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.540
Now watch what happens if I load the author,

05:04.750 --> 05:11.530
now we the author component and with new, we see the new quote component and with quote, we go back to the default

05:11.530 --> 05:12.790
content.

05:12.790 --> 05:20.770
This is how we can use dynamic components to dynamically replace a part in our template with different

05:20.770 --> 05:27.890
components triggered by for example button clicks and stored in a property which is bound with the is

05:27.890 --> 05:28.670
keyword here.
