00:01.640 --> 00:08.750
So let's use our newly gained directive knowledge and put it into practice by building yet another custom

00:08.750 --> 00:09.280
directive

00:09.290 --> 00:10.650
but now it's your turn.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.310
What do I want you to build?

00:12.340 --> 00:16.600
I want to build a custom directive which works like v-on,

00:16.790 --> 00:19.460
basically without all its modifiers and so on

00:19.580 --> 00:26.870
but I want you to build a directive which you can attach like v-myon, whatever you want to choose as a

00:26.870 --> 00:29.360
name and then no modifiers and anything like that

00:29.360 --> 00:35.480
but now just the argument being the event like click and then between the quotation marks, some code you

00:35.480 --> 00:38.330
want to execute. Now to make it a little bit easier,

00:38.360 --> 00:39.820
between the quotation marks here,

00:39.830 --> 00:43.260
we only want accept functions we then execute.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.900
Now that might sound super complicated but I promise you it isn't,

00:46.940 --> 00:48.510
it's a nice challenge though.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.910
So good luck with that,

00:49.910 --> 00:52.280
I'll see you in the next video where we solve this together.
