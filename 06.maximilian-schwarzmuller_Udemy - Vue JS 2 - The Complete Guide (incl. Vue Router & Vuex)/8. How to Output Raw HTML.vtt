00:02.010 --> 00:03.890
Let's enhance it even more,

00:04.140 --> 00:08.700
let's say we also have a finished link property here

00:08.880 --> 00:15.060
and unlike the link, this is not just the URL but it is the complete anchor tag.

00:15.210 --> 00:18.920
We can write html code here too, just like that

00:19.110 --> 00:22.270
and this should also lead to google.com

00:22.290 --> 00:29.470
but of course the important thing here is that it is the complete link and not URL as I just mentioned.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.030
So we could enter a horizontal line here and below that horizontal line, have another paragraph where

00:36.030 --> 00:41.290
I simply want to output this finished link to get this link to Google.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.400
What do you think we'll see if I now hit control enter?

00:44.730 --> 00:46.790
Well let's find out.

00:46.950 --> 00:53.160
We see the link as text, we don't see a finished or a rendered html element,

00:53.220 --> 01:00.560
instead we see the html element in text form. This is the default behavior of vuejs

01:00.600 --> 01:06.360
and this is great that it is the default behavior because this behavior ensures that we don't run into

01:06.360 --> 01:13.950
any problems with cross-site scripting attacks. By default vuejs escapes vuejs

01:13.980 --> 01:20.620
which means it doesn't render html elements, it only renders text, most of the time that is what you want.

01:21.150 --> 01:26.940
But if you got some html content where you know the source where it is coming from is safe or you

01:26.940 --> 01:33.840
did sanitize it on your own before outputting it, well in such a case, you might want to output the html

01:33.840 --> 01:35.880
code and not just the text.

01:35.880 --> 01:43.830
Think of a blog post which might have some editing inside of it, for such a use case, you can get

01:43.830 --> 01:49.380
rid of the interpolation syntax with the curly braces and instead use another directive.

01:49.710 --> 01:54.380
The directive would then be placed on the element where you want to output the html code

01:54.690 --> 01:57.100
and it is called the v-html.

01:57.540 --> 02:05.190
This allows you to then pass the name of the property here which holds the html code.

02:05.190 --> 02:13.370
If I now hit control enter, you now see the link, v-html tells vuejs to actually render html

02:13.380 --> 02:17.790
code and not escape it. Again use this carefully,

02:17.850 --> 02:21.170
it does expose you to cross-site scripting attacks,

02:21.240 --> 02:28.320
if this is possibly some content which for example gets created by your users and thus you can't control

02:28.530 --> 02:35.370
what is placed inside of it. If you know the source is clean or you sanitized it on your own, you should

02:35.370 --> 02:36.370
be good to go

02:36.390 --> 02:41.140
and this is how you can output normal html through vuejs.
