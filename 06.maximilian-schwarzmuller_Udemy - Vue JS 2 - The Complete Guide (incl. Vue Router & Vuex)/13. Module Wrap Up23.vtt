00:01.880 --> 00:05.450
With that we learned all about the basics of components.

00:05.460 --> 00:10.590
We learned how to create them, how to contain them in single files, how to make sure that the styling

00:10.590 --> 00:12.510
gets only applied to that component,

00:12.630 --> 00:18.420
how to register them locally and globally, what the advantages of single file templates are, how to

00:18.420 --> 00:22.260
structure our project and how to choose the selector names,

00:22.260 --> 00:28.050
a lot of very useful things. You can now work with these components and use all the other features you learned

00:28.050 --> 00:34.210
in the earlier modules in this course like outputting data there and so on just like you did before

00:34.230 --> 00:41.100
now in components. Now in the next module, I want to dive deeper into components and learn how we can communicate

00:41.100 --> 00:44.580
across components to send data from a parent to the child

00:44.670 --> 00:48.360
and the other way around. Let's dive into this in the next module.
