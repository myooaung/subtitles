Now as before, you can also combined is by here on the last div creating an array where I for one set

00:10.050 --> 00:11.080
my style.

00:11.100 --> 00:21.210
But now let's say I also pass as a second element a new object where I set the height equal to the width

00:22.280 --> 00:24.160
plus pixels,

00:24.410 --> 00:29.450
so even though it's called width, I can of course also use this value to set the height to create a square

00:29.450 --> 00:30.470
again.

00:30.470 --> 00:36.150
So now if I save this and I change this to 50, you see that the third block

00:36.170 --> 00:43.940
now also changed in both width and height because I'm setting up both my style which sets color

00:44.000 --> 00:48.690
and the width and this extra object which sets the height.

00:48.800 --> 00:56.600
This is how you can use styles and classes and bind directly to both classes and styles using the different

00:56.600 --> 01:00.470
syntaxes to pass the styles and classes you want to pass.

01:00.470 --> 01:07.760
One important note, if you use styles binding like this, vuejs will automatically prefix your styles

01:07.940 --> 01:11.940
to work in all browsers supporting vuejs in the first place.
