Now resources and that's just important to highlight are only an alternative to using http post and get

00:07.770 --> 00:13.410
which is perfectly fine and which might be the better solution in a lot of cases where you don't want

00:13.410 --> 00:20.310
to create reusable resources but only need to send this from time to time requests here and there and

00:20.310 --> 00:22.070
you don't want to set up a resource for that.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.150
That's perfectly fine,

00:23.220 --> 00:25.440
just wanted to show this as an alternative.
