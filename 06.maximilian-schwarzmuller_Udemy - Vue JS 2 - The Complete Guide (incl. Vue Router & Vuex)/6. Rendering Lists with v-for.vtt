Back I am in a brand new fiddle,

00:03.800 --> 00:11.630
once again, this time very lean but I already populated my data with some ingredients which is an array

00:11.630 --> 00:17.180
with some strings and some persons, also an array but with objects.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.080
Why do I do this?

00:19.130 --> 00:25.460
Well since I have arrays here, it looks like we're now getting into lists, outputting lists.

00:25.490 --> 00:28.580
Imagine you want to output this list of ingredients.

00:28.580 --> 00:34.610
So we want to create an unordered list with a list item with meat and then one with fruit

00:34.790 --> 00:38.450
and I certainly don't want to hardcode them there because a, that would be a lot of work

00:38.450 --> 00:42.760
and more importantly b, our content is probably not static,

00:42.800 --> 00:47.520
so it's probably changing or can be influenced by the user.

00:47.540 --> 00:55.190
So we want to output this list through vuejs and turns out it's really easy to do so. For outputting a

00:55.190 --> 00:59.510
list like this, vuejs has the v-for directive,

00:59.570 --> 01:06.110
one of the last directives we haven't covered yet. V-for allows us like with normal for loop to

01:06.110 --> 01:13.620
loop through an array and replicate the element on which v-for sits as often as needed

01:13.790 --> 01:19.990
and additionally also pull out the content in the array for the current iteration and use it in the template.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.120
Let's see it in action. Here

01:22.130 --> 01:28.940
I want to loop through my ingredients so I can simply write ingredient, this name is totally up to you, in

01:29.780 --> 01:30.760
ingredients,

01:30.800 --> 01:35.100
this of course refers to my ingredients array here in the data property,

01:35.120 --> 01:42.560
so to any property which happens to be a list or iteratable. So ingredient is the name I chose and I can then

01:42.560 --> 01:50.360
use this variable which you vuejs creates for me during the loop with interpolation here for example

01:50.360 --> 01:51.310
to output it.

01:51.470 --> 01:54.690
Side note, you can use it like you use any other property,

01:54.710 --> 02:00.380
so I could also bind to the reference of a link, I can pass it to a function call when listening to

02:00.410 --> 02:01.090
event,

02:01.370 --> 02:07.980
I can use it like any other property I've stored in my vue instance, just that I haven't stored it but vuejs

02:08.060 --> 02:10.910
creates it dynamically for me instead.

02:11.140 --> 02:16.360
So let's hit control enter and see our beautiful list, with these few lines of code,

02:16.490 --> 02:22.670
we're iterating through our ingredients here and outputting it in an unordered list with the v-for

02:22.740 --> 02:23.460
directive.
