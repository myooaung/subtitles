00:02.020 --> 00:03.880
I'm in the AWS console,

00:03.940 --> 00:10.960
if AWS Amazon Web Services is all new to you, simply google for it and make sure to get into it.

00:10.960 --> 00:16.480
Basically you'll need to create an account on Amazon Web services, you can use your normal Amazon account

00:16.480 --> 00:17.410
if you want

00:17.410 --> 00:21.620
and after logging it in, you should see this console here.

00:21.620 --> 00:27.620
Now here's a very important disclaimer, what I'm showing here will be free of charge

00:27.640 --> 00:34.360
if this is a new Amazon Web Services account within the 12 month you get everything or you get a lot

00:34.360 --> 00:36.840
for free trial period.

00:37.030 --> 00:42.700
Now you definitely have to check if these conditions still apply at the point of time you're watching

00:42.700 --> 00:43.510
this video,

00:43.510 --> 00:50.740
so if using Amazon Web Services as free as we will do is still free and you will also need to make sure

00:51.010 --> 00:58.180
that you're not using other services which might lead to more services being used, higher volumes being

00:58.180 --> 01:03.230
used than are free so that you get possible charges you don't want to get.

01:03.250 --> 01:08.050
Now with that disclaimer out of the way, which basically is have a look at what you're doing here,

01:08.290 --> 01:10.700
I will show you how to deploy it here.

01:10.900 --> 01:17.520
Now the steps I show you here will generally be the same on any hosting provider you choose,

01:17.530 --> 01:19.030
it's very simple.

01:19.030 --> 01:26.200
So I will use S3 which is its cloud storage service but this also allows you to host single page

01:26.260 --> 01:31.180
applications, static applications where you don't need to run any server side code

01:31.240 --> 01:32.820
and we don't need to do that here.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.230
So click on S3 there

01:37.790 --> 01:41.060
And once you're there, you want to create a new bucket.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.340
Now you see, I already have some buckets but that's no problem,

01:44.360 --> 01:45.470
I'll create a new one here,

01:45.470 --> 01:55.220
choose any region and I'll name it vuejs-deploy here, so hit create here and this will give you this new bucket.

01:55.220 --> 02:00.410
Now there are a couple of things we need to set up here to enable it for web site hosting,

02:00.410 --> 02:06.080
most important here, static website hosting, we want to enable this of course

02:06.080 --> 02:13.210
and our index document will be the index.html file as will be the error document. Important,

02:13.250 --> 02:19.570
we need to set our error document to index.html to make sure that in case of 404 errors,

02:19.580 --> 02:21.580
we're getting back our index.html.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.330
I discussed this in the routing section,

02:24.350 --> 02:26.420
this is important otherwise

02:26.480 --> 02:31.000
the routes we have in our frontend application will not be recognized,

02:31.040 --> 02:38.010
so make sure to set it up like this. Now here, let's hit save to save these changes,

02:38.030 --> 02:44.000
now with that we enabled this static website deployment but we also need to edit the permissions

02:44.000 --> 02:47.450
to make sure that people are able to view this webpage. There,

02:47.450 --> 02:54.290
we want to add a bucket policy and now for the policy to use, we can simply google for Amazon static

02:54.410 --> 02:55.690
webpage,

02:55.850 --> 03:01.430
AWS static webpage where you find an example article walking you through the required steps

03:01.430 --> 03:07.940
and if you scroll down there, you will see the configure your buckets step which gives you this permission

03:07.970 --> 03:10.800
you should copy into your bucket policy here.

03:10.820 --> 03:17.870
So copy it in here and now there you need to replace example.com with your bucket,

03:17.870 --> 03:21.450
so this is vuejs-deploy in my case here

03:21.650 --> 03:27.280
and then you may hit save here. And now you could also enable logging as you see here but

03:27.320 --> 03:31.490
I don't want to do this here, instead we'll jump to deploying the webpage now.

03:31.490 --> 03:38.510
Now deploying the webpage will need us to create the index.html file, we already do have this

03:38.540 --> 03:42.410
and now we may upload the files we want to upload here.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.740
Well that is very simple,

03:44.750 --> 03:49.840
we now go to our bucket here and there, we simply click on it

03:51.240 --> 03:52.710
and click upload.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.450
Now here we want to add the files to upload,

03:55.500 --> 04:03.730
make sure to navigate to your vuejs folder here and upload the index.html file and thereafter, also

04:03.970 --> 04:06.600
the build.js file in the dist folder.

04:06.700 --> 04:11.600
And now this is the step which is the same for no matter where you host your files,

04:11.650 --> 04:19.890
you need to ship these two files to your page, to the hosting service where you're hosting your application.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.870
So you may hit start upload thereafter

04:23.880 --> 04:26.280
and this is already done since it isn't that big.

04:26.460 --> 04:33.390
Now with the two files uploaded, you need to create a folder, name it dist and move your build.js file to that

04:33.390 --> 04:34.120
folder,

04:34.230 --> 04:40.920
so here, you basically want to cut it here, click into that folder and paste it in here.

04:42.080 --> 04:48.220
So with that, you now set up the same folder structure you had locally and with that, you can build back to all buckets,

04:48.410 --> 04:54.290
view the properties of your vuejs deploy bucket and hit the end point of your page to now see your

04:54.290 --> 04:57.380
page running on the Internet.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.140
This is how you deploy it on Amazon S3

05:00.260 --> 05:09.230
and again, it's the same on any service, upload the index.html file and the build.js bundle in your folder, in

05:09.230 --> 05:12.360
the dist folder and it should run like this. Again,

05:12.360 --> 05:19.560
also make sure to redirect all 404 errors to your index.html file so that vuejs can handle this.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.630
And this is our deployed app,

05:21.770 --> 05:26.890
now you can follow through the other steps in this deployment guide on AWS here,

05:26.960 --> 05:33.930
if you also want to set up cloud front to optimize the distribution and also set up dynamic zipping

05:33.950 --> 05:39.110
to compress the files when when they are transferred or if you're deploying it somewhere else,

05:39.110 --> 05:41.650
definitely have a look at the specific configurations

05:41.660 --> 05:44.920
your host might need but this is how easy it is.

05:44.920 --> 05:52.160
Again key part, prepare it for deployment by stripping out the warnings and minifying it and then upload

05:52.250 --> 05:55.580
index.html and the dist folder with the bundle.
