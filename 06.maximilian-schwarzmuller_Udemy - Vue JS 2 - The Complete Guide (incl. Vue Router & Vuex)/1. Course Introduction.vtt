Welcome to this course. I'm really happy to have you here because Vue.js is an amazing, powerful

00:07.590 --> 00:10.720
and really fun-to-work-with front-end framework.

00:10.830 --> 00:17.430
Let's get started right away and dive into the first important question. What is Vue.js, or why would

00:17.430 --> 00:18.210
you want to use it?

00:18.210 --> 00:19.710
How does it help you?

00:20.010 --> 00:26.670
Well, Vue.js allows you to create everything from small widgets driven by JavaScript which you

00:26.670 --> 00:31.410
drop into existing applications; like this one which we'll create in this course where we simply replace

00:31.410 --> 00:37.140
some content dynamically and play a nice animation with it. Over medium-sized applications where you

00:37.140 --> 00:38.460
control the whole page

00:38.470 --> 00:44.120
JavaScript and therefore re-render various parts making it very reactive, like this one;

00:44.160 --> 00:51.540
another project all the way up to building big enterprise-level applications, single page applications,

00:51.780 --> 00:58.800
where your whole web page, multiple pages (at least it views like this to the user) are driven by Vue.js which

00:58.950 --> 01:04.600
renders significant parts of the DOM to make it look like there were different pages being loaded

01:04.650 --> 01:11.180
but in the end, JavaScript handling all of that. Why JavaScript? Because JavaScript runs in the browser.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.150
You don't need to reach out to any server.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.310
You don't need to wait for any responses if you only want to re-render parts of the application.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.960
This makes the application very reactive, it makes it feel nice and it provides awesome user experiences.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.250
Now that is what you can do with Vue.js.

01:27.260 --> 01:32.600
Now why would you want to choose Vue.js and not, let's say, Angular or ReactJS which you might

01:32.600 --> 01:34.740
know which do a similar thing.

01:34.940 --> 01:41.810
Well first of all, Vue.js is extremely lean and small regarding the file size. We're talking about 16kB

01:41.810 --> 01:43.690
minified and gzipped

01:43.910 --> 01:45.640
for the core framework.

01:45.800 --> 01:51.080
Now I will say that is without the router, for example, which you would have to add extra. But even with

01:51.080 --> 01:54.240
that it still stays very lean and small.

01:54.260 --> 01:59.170
It's a very focused and to-the-point framework. But it's not only small, hence

01:59.360 --> 02:01.630
providing a fast loading time,

02:01.700 --> 02:08.540
it also is fast at runtime and telling with some benchmarks it even beats Angular and ReactJS.

02:08.540 --> 02:14.210
Now of course that will always depend on your specific application but what we can say is it is extremely

02:14.210 --> 02:20.360
fast at runtime; hence really again adding to this very great reactive user experience.

02:20.360 --> 02:26.330
Now you would probably assume that a small and fast framework doesn't have that many features but you

02:26.330 --> 02:27.080
would be wrong.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.390
It's very feature-rich and throughout the course we will go through all the features and you will learn

02:32.420 --> 02:35.240
how they work, how you use them, when you use them and

02:35.360 --> 02:40.310
what the idea behind them is. You will learn that Vue.js is very extensible, for example with the

02:40.310 --> 02:41.150
Vue.js router.

02:41.210 --> 02:46.220
But then this extension then also fits nicely into the core framework.

02:46.310 --> 02:51.160
And again we will walk through all these great features throughout this course.

02:51.180 --> 02:57.690
Now with that first impression, I'd say let's dive right into it and get started with

02:57.700 --> 03:03.970
Vue.js and build our first application as well as see how we actually get set up (spoiler...

03:04.010 --> 03:05.210
it's very easy to do ;)

03:05.240 --> 03:06.660
Let's do it in the next lecture.
