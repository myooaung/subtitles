00:02.320 --> 00:09.330
Welcome to this module. As announced in the previous video, this module builds up on the authentication

00:09.330 --> 00:13.310
and axios module in a way that we use the same project,

00:13.320 --> 00:17.140
you can still dive into this module without going through these first

00:17.280 --> 00:23.290
but then of course some things like usage of axios might be new to you. In this module however, I'll

00:23.340 --> 00:26.180
focus on validating user input.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.980
In this vue course, we already have a whole section where we talk about forms, how we can create custom

00:31.980 --> 00:34.510
controls, all these things.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.090
That's all nice

00:36.090 --> 00:42.900
but one thing we haven't really touched on is how you can validate what the user enters, if it is correct,

00:42.990 --> 00:46.870
if it fulfills your requirements. In this module,

00:46.920 --> 00:53.850
I'll show you a third party package which offers such a validation functionality because vue itself

00:54.120 --> 00:55.910
doesn't have it built into it.

00:56.160 --> 01:01.490
So with that, let's start and let's see how we can find out if our users entered the data

01:01.530 --> 01:02.700
we expect to get.
