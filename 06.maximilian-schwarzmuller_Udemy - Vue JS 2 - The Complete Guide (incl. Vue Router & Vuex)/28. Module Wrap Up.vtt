00:02.740 --> 00:05.860
Woah, in this module we already achieved a lot.

00:05.870 --> 00:13.280
We had a detailed look at how this template syntax works, how we can interact with our template and how

00:13.280 --> 00:21.710
vuejs really works and allows you to create reactive web applications and change the template, react to

00:21.710 --> 00:24.290
user events and much more.

00:24.300 --> 00:31.730
This is a huge first step which really already gives you a lot of tools to create powerful vue applications

00:31.730 --> 00:32.570
with.

00:32.690 --> 00:39.290
Now in the next module, we're going to take this to the next level and see how we can conditionally render

00:39.290 --> 00:42.370
some things in the dom and output lists of data.
