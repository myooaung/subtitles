00:02.230 --> 00:09.520
Time to practice the things we learned. Here I'm back in the exercise we did before where we outsourced

00:09.580 --> 00:11.850
all the different pieces into components.

00:11.890 --> 00:15.660
Until now we're not able to have them talk to each other,

00:15.670 --> 00:17.220
time to change this.

00:17.590 --> 00:25.900
What I want to achieve now or what I want you to achieve is that in my servers component here,

00:26.020 --> 00:32.560
we get a separate component for each list item and we loop through all these separate components

00:32.560 --> 00:38.140
we then created with a v-for loop and pass the current index so the current server number to stay

00:38.140 --> 00:39.090
in this world

00:39.200 --> 00:40.550
to this server.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.160
Well let's make it a bit more complicated,

00:43.270 --> 00:50.020
actually let's create an array of server objects here in the servers vue instance we have to create

00:50.020 --> 00:56.740
in the script tags therefore, remember that data should be a function when having a single file template

00:56.910 --> 01:06.560
like this and then pass the the ID of each server which you set in this object to each component here

01:06.560 --> 01:13.430
which holds a list item and then when you click such a server here, I want to load it in the server

01:13.430 --> 01:20.440
details component where we have a button to switch the server status which should also be managed in

01:20.450 --> 01:25.220
the data property of the servers.vue file.

01:25.220 --> 01:31.450
Now I will start by setting up this object holding all the servers and thereafter,

01:31.450 --> 01:34.190
I would recommend going on on your own,

01:34.220 --> 01:41.270
I'm just doing this as some starting help so that you don't accidentally run into problems just because

01:41.300 --> 01:45.110
I maybe did not clearly say what the idea is.

01:45.110 --> 01:52.280
So here we would have in the servers.vue file a default object with some data,

01:52.490 --> 01:58.930
remember data shall be a function returning an object which then actually holds our data

01:59.180 --> 02:08.420
and then, I want to have a servers property in this vue instance available therefore and servers should

02:08.420 --> 02:19.070
be an array of multiple javascript objects where each object has let's say ID, server ID, that

02:19.070 --> 02:26.870
could be a number, one for example and then a status, let's say normal for the first one and then I'll

02:26.870 --> 02:28.750
repeat this three times,

02:28.790 --> 02:32.760
so I have the IDs one to four and I have critical,

02:32.900 --> 02:37.450
I have unknown and I have normal again, just an example.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.770
And then, this is where you take over,

02:40.790 --> 02:47.630
I want you to loop through all these servers, create a new component for the list item, pass the ID and

02:47.630 --> 02:54.410
the status to that, be able to click this component and then load the server in server details where

02:54.410 --> 02:57.460
we have a button to change the status back to normal.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.080
That's the exercise,

02:59.090 --> 03:01.150
let's see how you solve it.

03:01.370 --> 03:04.190
I will show you my solution in the next video.
