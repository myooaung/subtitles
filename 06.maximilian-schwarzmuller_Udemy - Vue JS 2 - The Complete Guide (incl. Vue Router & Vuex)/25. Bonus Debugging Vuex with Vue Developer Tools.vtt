There also is one little extra I wanted to show you. If you have to find some errors and you're debugging

00:10.120 --> 00:12.930
your app, you learned how to debug that earlier

00:13.090 --> 00:16.620
but there is a nice tool especially when using vuex,

00:16.660 --> 00:18.970
it's called the vue developer tools,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.010
simply google for it and you should find it in the chrome store kind of. You can then add it to your browser,

00:25.030 --> 00:26.720
I already did this

00:26.860 --> 00:31.370
and once you added it, you can open it in your developer tools here under vue.

00:31.710 --> 00:38.260
Now the nice thing is these vue developer tools show you all your components and you can inspect your components

00:38.260 --> 00:41.740
for example, you load it with the data they currently have,

00:41.740 --> 00:46.110
see if it's computed or not, you can really dive into that.

00:46.230 --> 00:53.010
But what you can also do is you can go to the vuex tab here and the nice thing is if I now buy it, a new

00:53.010 --> 00:54.890
entry gets added, buy stock,

00:54.900 --> 01:02.860
we see the time. I can now also if I decrease this, go back to the portfolio and sell this,

01:02.970 --> 01:04.320
now we sell stock,

01:08.960 --> 01:13.250
like this and I can always revert, like that,

01:13.340 --> 01:21.680
so you can always switch back to older states to basically see or to time travel through your different

01:21.680 --> 01:22.900
states you had.

01:23.060 --> 01:24.650
So that's really nice,

01:24.650 --> 01:32.360
you can always use this tool to do something but then still have a look at how it looked before you

01:32.360 --> 01:35.050
did this or even reverted.

01:35.090 --> 01:42.560
So that's a nice tool to analyze your vuex flow, your payload, the data you sent, how your application

01:42.560 --> 01:44.570
looked at a certain point of time

01:44.660 --> 01:49.710
and together with the other thing of analyzing your components there which you already had a look at.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.610
This really is a powerful tool

01:51.680 --> 01:57.080
you want to make sure to use when developing vuejs applications.
