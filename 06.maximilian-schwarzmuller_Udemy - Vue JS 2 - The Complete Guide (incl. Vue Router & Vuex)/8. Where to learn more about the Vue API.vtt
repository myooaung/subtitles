If you want to dive super hardcore into all the available properties and so on on vuejs and keep in mind,

00:08.930 --> 00:10.910
I will cover a lot of them throughout the course,

00:10.910 --> 00:12.190
it's not like we're at the end here,

00:12.200 --> 00:19.700
not at all. But if you want to dive into that, vuejs.org/api is for you, here you can find

00:19.760 --> 00:25.400
all the properties on the vue instance accessible from outside, what you can set on the constructor

00:25.670 --> 00:26.750
and much more

00:26.750 --> 00:32.290
and again, I wouldn't go into there and think what, I have never seen most of the stuff,

00:32.410 --> 00:32.650
yeah

00:32.660 --> 00:38.780
as I said, I will cover much more through this course and it doesn't make sense to give you the full API reference

00:38.780 --> 00:39.800
at the beginning,

00:39.800 --> 00:42.570
go through it step by step and you don't understand at all

00:42.610 --> 00:44.230
how all of that is connected. Well

00:44.260 --> 00:47.780
if you are interested in that though, this reference is for you and anyway,

00:47.810 --> 00:52.970
it's a good resource if you want to look something up or are not 100% certain about a certain

00:52.970 --> 00:53.510
topic

00:53.630 --> 00:56.260
and want to read more about it on the official docs.
