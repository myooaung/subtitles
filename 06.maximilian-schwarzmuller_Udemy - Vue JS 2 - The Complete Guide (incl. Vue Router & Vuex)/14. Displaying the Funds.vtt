00:01.650 --> 00:06.060
Right now we're able to buy and sell stocks, at least it looks like it works

00:06.120 --> 00:11.760
but now, let's also add our funds, let's display how much funds we have and let's see if they get updated

00:11.760 --> 00:14.310
correctly. Once we implemented the funds,

00:14.310 --> 00:18.520
we also want to make sure that we're not able to buy more than we can afford and so on,

00:18.690 --> 00:21.220
so this is what I'll work on next.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.560
Let's start by displaying funds,

00:23.670 --> 00:25.300
where do we display funds?

00:25.530 --> 00:31.050
Well for one, on the home page which generally is not really in the state I want it to have,

00:31.260 --> 00:37.830
so let's quickly work on this, let's wrap it in a div, add a h1 tag where we say trade or view

00:37.830 --> 00:43.280
your portfolio to kind of describe what you're able to do then h6,

00:43.410 --> 00:51.740
you may save and load your data and also h6,

00:51.850 --> 00:58.300
click on end day which doesn't work yet but we'll soon add it to begin a new

01:00.260 --> 01:01.790
day, like that.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.450
All nice but now we also want to display the funds,

01:04.460 --> 01:10.520
so here we have a paragraph which says whoops, which says your funds

01:10.790 --> 01:13.860
and then we want to output our funds like this,

01:13.880 --> 01:15.980
now we clearly don't have access to them yet

01:16.010 --> 01:25.320
so let me add a new script part here where I now export a default object and in there, I will simply

01:25.320 --> 01:29.410
set up a computed property or this computed property and I'll name it funds,

01:29.430 --> 01:35.640
I could use map getters again but since I'm only interested in one getter, I'll access my store like this,

01:36.390 --> 01:40.290
my getters there and then the funds to get my funds.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.280
Now we should be able to see this if we visit the home page,

01:43.350 --> 01:45.460
we see funds 10000,

01:45.510 --> 01:50.640
now let's see if this updates, if I buy ten times BMW it's less

01:50.730 --> 01:54.090
and if I now sell it 10 times, we're back to 10000, 

01:54.090 --> 01:55.870
so this indeed seems to work.

01:56.010 --> 02:02.280
Now with that in place, let's also display it in the header and let's make sure that I check my funds

02:02.280 --> 02:05.940
when buying stocks as well as my quantity when selling them.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.530
So let's start by adding funds to the header

02:10.440 --> 02:13.330
and here I simply want to display them, let's say here

02:13.360 --> 02:16.200
after my two links before the dropdown.

02:16.330 --> 02:25.930
So here I'll add this strong element where I say funds equals funds with string interpolation and I'll add some

02:25.930 --> 02:34.040
classes here to position this rightly, this shall be nav bar text, nav bar right.

02:34.860 --> 02:40.200
With that in place, it will not work of course because what I need to do is I need to add my script down

02:40.200 --> 02:44.330
there, export my object and now load the funds there too.

02:45.120 --> 02:51.640
Now I could use map getters for this but since I'm interested in the funds only, I can also say computed

02:51.640 --> 03:02.420
as we learned it before, funds and then simply here return this store getters funds, like this.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.940
Now let's see if this worked,

03:04.770 --> 03:05.210
looks good,

03:05.220 --> 03:07.400
we get the funds on the very right, on the very right

03:07.440 --> 03:13.410
just because of the styles we added to this strong element, that is why it's positioned over there and

03:13.410 --> 03:19.230
we can of course see that these funds also update as soon as we try to do some things.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.020
Now I sold more than I had as you saw,

03:22.140 --> 03:24.500
so that's something we'll work on in the next video

03:24.500 --> 03:29.760
and again, challenge for you, try solving this issue, try to make sure that we're not able to buy more

03:29.760 --> 03:34.250
than we can afford like so or sell more than we have, like so.

03:34.260 --> 03:38.490
So that is what we should work on next, try to fix it on your own first though.
