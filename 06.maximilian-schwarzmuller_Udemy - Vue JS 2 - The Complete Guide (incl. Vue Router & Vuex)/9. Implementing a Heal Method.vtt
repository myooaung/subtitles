00:01.680 --> 00:04.780
So after dealing damage, we now want to be able to heal.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.630
We could also calculate the healing amount randomly

00:07.770 --> 00:09.220
but I want to hard code it,

00:09.240 --> 00:11.770
let's say we always heal by 10.

00:11.820 --> 00:19.600
So here, I then want to set this player health plus equal 10 to increase it by 10,

00:19.600 --> 00:22.470
also keep in mind, the monster shall attack

00:22.470 --> 00:26.740
so here we also have to execute monster attacks thereafter.

00:27.090 --> 00:36.620
Now after saving this, let me reload, start a new game, special attack, heal up, special attack and we won.

00:37.630 --> 00:41.790
Now here's an issue, I can also heal if I'm at full health,

00:41.890 --> 00:44.710
well this really grows my health bar, right?

00:44.710 --> 00:51.340
So we don't want to be able to heal any higher than our maximum health of 100, let's say,

00:51.570 --> 00:59.740
therefore here, we should also implement if check, if our player health is smaller or equal to 90

01:00.190 --> 01:03.540
then we can heal for the full 10

01:03.550 --> 01:12.670
so then we want to add 10 to our health but otherwise, we only want to set our player health back to

01:12.670 --> 01:20.590
100 again, so that we simply heal back to full if we're at a value higher than 90 anyways.

01:20.590 --> 01:26.800
So with this in place, if I reload, healing does nothing when at full health, it actually reduces our health

01:26.800 --> 01:32.850
because the monster still attacks us but if we go lower well then we can still heal.

01:32.860 --> 01:38.540
So this is how we can heal up, how we can implement this mechanic and as a side note,

01:38.650 --> 01:45.380
I hope you recognize that since a couple of videos, we're mostly writing normal Javascript code,

01:45.400 --> 01:48.530
this shows you how powerful vuejs is.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.270
We set up our style binding here,

01:51.280 --> 01:58.630
we hooked up our buttons and we showed our player health here and now using the vue instance and normal

01:58.630 --> 01:59.830
javascript code,

01:59.840 --> 02:06.880
we're creating quite a nice game here without having to write any complicated code or manually updating

02:06.880 --> 02:12.680
parts in the dom, manually checking if we need to update a certain value somewhere.

02:12.700 --> 02:19.120
Really this is how you use vuejs and why it is so powerful and why it helps you so much.
