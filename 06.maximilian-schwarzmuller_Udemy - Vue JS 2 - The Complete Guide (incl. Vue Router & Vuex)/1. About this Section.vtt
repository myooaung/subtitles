Welcome to this module,

00:03.970 --> 00:06.560
now here's an important note about this module.

00:06.610 --> 00:13.990
This module is a bonus module because it was added after the course was released, this module simply

00:14.080 --> 00:19.850
adds some content to the course, vue has experienced any breaking changes or something like this,

00:19.870 --> 00:25.600
this is just some extra content to make the course better because I care about keeping my courses up

00:25.600 --> 00:26.520
to date.

00:26.530 --> 00:33.670
In this module, we'll dive into axios and I'm going to spend more words on what that is over the next lectures.

00:33.670 --> 00:34.750
So let's dive in.
