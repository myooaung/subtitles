WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:07.750
Well that was a lot of talking, let's install this cli and inside a Mac, we will have to write sudo, on

00:07.750 --> 00:10.380
Windows you don't need this and then npm

00:10.540 --> 00:14.120
and what is npm? NPM is the node package manager,

00:14.140 --> 00:18.330
so for this to work you will need to install nodejs.

00:18.610 --> 00:22.300
You don't need nodejs because you are going to write any nodejs code,

00:22.300 --> 00:24.600
we're not going to write any node code,

00:24.640 --> 00:27.320
we're not going to write our own server side code.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.250
We will need it

00:28.300 --> 00:35.860
solely for now for this node package manager which is the defacto tool to use for frontend development

00:35.860 --> 00:39.810
to manage your dependencies, so we will definitely need this

00:39.940 --> 00:46.270
and also because this development server which will be included in the template we're using, so we don't

00:46.270 --> 00:50.200
have to write it on our own but it will still use nodejs to run

00:50.200 --> 00:51.560
so we need it for this too.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.300
So make sure to download the current version, the 6.8.1 version

00:56.350 --> 00:59.290
in this case, well at the time I record this video

00:59.380 --> 01:05.440
but the latest one you see here. And then download it, run through the installer and after it finishes, you will

01:05.440 --> 01:10.810
have nodejs installed and you're ready to use npm and nodejs for the server.

01:11.110 --> 01:12.620
And then you can continue here,

01:12.700 --> 01:19.380
so sudo npm and then install -g to install it globally on your machine, the

01:19.460 --> 01:20.070
vue-cli.

01:20.140 --> 01:28.600
Now after hitting enter, I'll have to enter my password here and that will pull down and install

01:28.600 --> 01:32.050
the cli on my machine and I'll be back once it is finished.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.470
Now that the installation did finish, I can navigate into the folder where I want to store my project folder,

01:39.470 --> 01:45.440
where I want to create my vue-cli project or my vuejs project and I can then do this by simply

01:45.440 --> 01:46.420
running vue,

01:46.460 --> 01:49.630
this is available since we just installed the vue-cli

01:49.850 --> 01:56.540
and then which template I want to use so which template of my project I want to use.

01:56.690 --> 02:02.690
If we have a look at the official vue-cli github page, you can find it by googling for vue-cli,

02:02.970 --> 02:09.180
you will also find the explanations here but you will also find the available templates I was mentioning

02:09.180 --> 02:10.370
on these slides earlier.

02:10.440 --> 02:15.360
So I'll choose the webpack-simple setup which has everything we need for this course,

02:15.390 --> 02:20.880
so here it's all about writing vue init to initialize a new project, then the template you want to

02:20.880 --> 02:22.980
use which is webpack-simple

02:22.980 --> 02:25.180
and then the project folder you want to create,

02:25.200 --> 02:28.730
I'm going to name my vue-cli, this name is totally up to you.

02:28.830 --> 02:34.230
Now after hitting enter, this will setup this project as you will see it will use the 2.x version

02:34.230 --> 02:38.730
by default which is what you want, if you wanted to use vue 1.x

02:38.730 --> 02:42.420
you have to attach this hashtag after the template.

02:42.620 --> 02:49.960
So yeah I will confirm the default project name, default description as well as my name here

02:50.190 --> 02:51.270
and then we're done.

02:51.270 --> 02:57.540
So now let's follow these commands and enter the vue-cli folder we just created with that

02:57.720 --> 03:03.840
and then we have to run npm install to pull down all the dependencies this needs because this just created

03:03.900 --> 03:07.740
the template with the package.json and in this package.json

03:07.800 --> 03:08.830
file,

03:08.830 --> 03:14.820
that's our dependency management file so to say, all the dependencies of this project are listed and

03:14.820 --> 03:17.300
we're installing all these dependencies here.

03:17.310 --> 03:21.310
That being said, that is almost only development only dependencies,

03:21.360 --> 03:27.000
the only production dependency should be vuejs, the rest will be webpack and so on, quite a bit

03:27.000 --> 03:27.690
as you can see

03:27.710 --> 03:28.460
but no worries,

03:28.500 --> 03:32.130
we don't need to deploy all of them, as I just said

03:32.130 --> 03:34.580
most of them are only needed for development.

03:34.830 --> 03:40.990
So going back up, we see that thereafter we should run npm run dev inside this project folder,

03:41.070 --> 03:44.420
so let's do this and this will start the development server

03:44.420 --> 03:50.460
we can use and it will keep running, so keep this process running and will automatically recompile everything

03:50.490 --> 03:54.990
and reload our server automatically whenever we change a file.

03:55.020 --> 04:00.960
So let's visit this URL here in case it didn't open up automatically which it did here and

04:00.960 --> 04:03.450
you should see this starting page.

04:03.450 --> 04:08.310
Now that's just a little starting page which shipped with the template, of course we're going to edit

04:08.310 --> 04:10.500
this and this is what we'll do next,

04:10.500 --> 04:15.940
have a look at the folder structure which was created and how we can work with that project.
