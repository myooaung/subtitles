00:02.280 --> 00:05.180
So let's add http functionalities

00:05.220 --> 00:12.870
by first installing vue resource. I will install it npm so npm install --save vue resource

00:12.870 --> 00:13.610
here

00:14.160 --> 00:18.840
and this will again add it to our dependencies in this project her

00:18.960 --> 00:22.600
and then in the main.js file, I want to import it up here.

00:22.620 --> 00:30.430
So import vue resource here from vue resource, like that

00:30.720 --> 00:33.740
and now of course as the router, we have to use it

00:33.740 --> 00:41.870
so we have to add it here, vue resource like this. With that, we're now able to send requests,

00:41.880 --> 00:48.780
now I want to use or set up my backend. I will use firebase again because that really works well and

00:48.780 --> 00:49.430
it's free,

00:49.440 --> 00:53.140
so it's a great backend for little testing applications like these

00:53.450 --> 00:59.810
and there, I want to go to my console and now the goal is to create a new project, I'll name it vuejs

00:59.890 --> 01:05.490
stock trader, you could choose any name of your, well of your liking basically,

01:05.670 --> 01:13.220
so here I will choose my country then and create this project and I'll see you once I'm in the console.

01:13.220 --> 01:18.900
So I'm inside the project now and the first thing is I'll use the database, so here in the rules of the database,

01:19.190 --> 01:23.380
I'll again grant read and write access to everyone,

01:23.390 --> 01:25.150
so everyone is able to do that,

01:25.310 --> 01:29.540
not the production settings you want to use but great for testing. Thereafter

01:29.610 --> 01:31.280
this is the URL we'll use so

01:31.280 --> 01:40.290
I'm going to copy this because now in my set up here, I want to set up this main URL

01:40.370 --> 01:42.010
we're always reaching out to.

01:42.110 --> 01:46.970
So here I will simply say vue http which I can access after adding vue resource,

01:46.970 --> 01:53.880
so after using vue resource here and on the options, I want to set my route URL to this link

01:53.900 --> 02:00.070
I just copied. So with that, I make sure that all requests will be sent to this link here

02:00.140 --> 02:04.220
and then I add the different things which need to be added, the different,

02:04.310 --> 02:08.510
the path after this main domain here basically.

02:08.810 --> 02:11.560
So that's the set up, with that, looks good,

02:11.600 --> 02:13.990
let's now work on storing our data.
