So were you successful? Let's build it together.

00:05.410 --> 00:12.970
These are the assets you got, the css files for the foundation grid I'm using and my own css file for the

00:13.050 --> 00:16.130
styles I'll use throughout this project here.

00:16.180 --> 00:21.040
Then I got the index.html file with obviously the html code and now it's time to add a

00:21.040 --> 00:27.050
script, we could it inline here at the end of this or simply add a new script file.

00:27.070 --> 00:33.780
So I'll add a new app.js file which of course I need to import in my index.html file

00:33.810 --> 00:34.630
down here,

00:34.870 --> 00:41.540
so here I'll import script source equals app.js. With this,

00:41.570 --> 00:45.270
I can now write my app here in the app.js file

00:45.620 --> 00:50.610
and for writing this, of course we have to consider which features do we have.

00:50.960 --> 00:57.020
Well if we have a look at the application, we get our health bars so we certainly need to control the

00:57.020 --> 00:58.400
health of each player,

00:58.490 --> 01:04.620
so it probably makes sense to kind of yeah have two properties for that,

01:04.810 --> 01:10.070
we conditionally then want to change the style depending on that health and we want to output it as

01:10.070 --> 01:12.480
a number, as text here.

01:12.500 --> 01:19.760
We also got these buttons here for which we need some methods to execute when we click on them, to start

01:19.760 --> 01:27.020
a new game and to have our special things we can do here like attack, special attack, heal and give up.

01:27.680 --> 01:34.820
And then we might need some additional functions, for example to render or to simulate the monster attack

01:34.820 --> 01:39.780
turn, to generate a random number, to add a turn to this

01:39.830 --> 01:45.090
log we're outputting down there which we as a side note also need to store in some kind of array

01:45.410 --> 01:49.710
and yuah, this looks like the things we will need for this.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.710
Now I want to start simple by setting up the player health and outputting it there and adding a conditional

01:57.710 --> 01:59.710
style depending on the player health,

01:59.750 --> 02:06.530
so that later on when we add functions to change this, we can directly see this being reflected in our

02:06.530 --> 02:10.330
application. To execute this application,

02:10.340 --> 02:17.580
you can simply double click on the index.html file and execute it in the browser like this.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.350
Now this is not how it will look in the end, this is just without any javascript code added to it, later

02:23.350 --> 02:28.850
in of course, we will have more complex setups where we use a little development server to host our application

02:28.850 --> 02:29.740
on the local machine

02:29.750 --> 02:33.730
but right now, we don't need that and can work with this perfectly fine.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.290
So let's dive into that.
