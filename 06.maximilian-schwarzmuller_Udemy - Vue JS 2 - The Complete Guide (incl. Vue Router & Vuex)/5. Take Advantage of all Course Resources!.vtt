00:02.090 --> 00:08.440
Throughout this course, you get a lot of videos where I will explain all the concepts in detail. But sometimes

00:08.440 --> 00:09.820
you need a bit more than that.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.570
You don't only want to watch me code.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.030
You want to code yourself.

00:13.180 --> 00:19.000
Well it's for that reason that we will build four projects throughout the course; practicing the different

00:19.000 --> 00:20.200
concepts we learn,

00:20.200 --> 00:25.870
so they are scattered out throughout this course and we will finally conclude this course with building our

00:25.870 --> 00:30.100
final project which is a complete single page application, in the end.

00:30.430 --> 00:37.090
But besides these projects I've also got a lot of quicker exercises mixed in; so little exercises where

00:37.090 --> 00:42.320
you practice single key concepts of that module the exercise is placed in.

00:42.490 --> 00:48.220
So together with the projects and the exercises you should have a lot of coding challenges throughout the course

00:48.550 --> 00:54.840
which allow you to practice the things you will see in the videos, on your own.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.620
But besides that of course, you can also find all the source code attached to the last lecture in each

00:59.620 --> 01:00.240
module.

01:00.250 --> 01:05.070
So if you want to have a look at the code we worked through in the video together, that is where we

01:05.120 --> 01:07.500
you would go to see it in action.

01:07.930 --> 01:14.050
Well and finally there's always the Q&amp;A section where you can and should ask questions if you're in

01:14.050 --> 01:15.420
doubt about something.

01:15.430 --> 01:21.730
Now there are a lot of students and myself helping you there and replying to your questions, but always

01:21.730 --> 01:28.090
keep in mind asking questions is great but also consider answering the questions of our students.

01:28.090 --> 01:33.400
This really is how you'll learn the most because you really have to challenge the things you've learned

01:33.440 --> 01:36.150
and reiterate them in such a case.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.790
So I strongly recommend answering questions too.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.660
This will give you the most.

01:41.890 --> 01:46.330
Well and with that I'd say let's have a look at how we could set up this project locally if you don't

01:46.330 --> 01:50.370
want to use JSFiddle in the first course modules here. And thereafter,

01:50.380 --> 01:53.600
time to get started and dive super-deep into Vue.js.
