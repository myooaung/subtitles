00:01.650 --> 00:08.290
With the individual stocks set up in the portfolio.vue file, I'll add a script because now I want to get all

00:08.290 --> 00:16.020
my stocks here. So I will export a default object here and this object now has computed properties

00:16.210 --> 00:17.960
and here I'll set up my getters.

00:17.980 --> 00:23.770
Now I'm only interested in one getter so I could access it directly but as before with the actions, I want

00:23.770 --> 00:31.630
to show how to use map getters so I'll import it from vuex and then in computed, I'll use this three dots syntax,

00:31.660 --> 00:32.390
the spread

00:32.390 --> 00:33.300
operator

00:33.460 --> 00:40.120
and then I call map getters and I could simply pass an array to map stock portfolio which is the name

00:40.120 --> 00:41.650
of the getter here,

00:41.870 --> 00:45.150
to a named stock portfolio in this local file

00:45.280 --> 00:51.700
but if I want to use a different name in this file, for example stocks, then I set it up as an object

00:51.700 --> 00:57.970
where I map stocks to the name in the store which is stock portfolio. With that, all that's left to

00:57.970 --> 01:06.360
do for me is I need to add my components, this local portfolio stock component which I'll therefore also

01:06.480 --> 01:15.170
import from the stock.vue file and I'll name it app stock stock,

01:15.190 --> 01:21.580
I don't have any naming conflicts with using app stock here and also in this file because both are

01:22.180 --> 01:30.420
local components and the thing left for me to do is here, I want to loop through all my stocks,

01:30.460 --> 01:37.940
so with v-for. I want to loop through stock in stocks, stocks now referring to my getter here so this

01:38.200 --> 01:41.260
in the end will be a property but directly from the state

01:41.770 --> 01:48.110
and of course I do pass stock as a prop to app stock because there, I do expect it.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.980
Well let's see if that all works as intended,

01:51.190 --> 02:01.700
if we buy a new share of BMW and go to the portfolio, we now see BMW quantity one here and if

02:01.700 --> 02:08.310
we now sell one, well then we get an error. So selling doesn't work yet,

02:08.310 --> 02:10.710
however buying it works,

02:10.720 --> 02:12.500
now let's fix selling

02:12.510 --> 02:15.990
and let's also change this from a green box to let's say a blue box.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.710
Just some stylistic change,

02:17.730 --> 02:19.330
I'll do both in the next video.
