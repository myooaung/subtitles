This is a project we're going to build in this module,

00:04.930 --> 00:07.830
It's not super complicated but it does use animations,

00:07.840 --> 00:09.660
it does use components.

00:09.760 --> 00:15.550
We get this super quiz where we have to answer some questions or some mathematical questions, some addition

00:15.550 --> 00:17.830
questions, not that difficult to be honest.

00:17.980 --> 00:24.700
But then here for example, we say yeah this should be 100 and we have this nice animation showing once we answer,

00:24.910 --> 00:30.640
so here we are using what we learned before, some things of what we learned before with that animation

00:30.640 --> 00:31.280
at least

00:31.570 --> 00:37.090
and that should allow you to build upon this and dive deeper into that and challenge you even more regarding

00:37.120 --> 00:38.280
animations.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.650
So this would be a good starting point,

00:40.660 --> 00:49.630
try building this application with maybe dynamic components for this part here where we are able to

00:51.470 --> 00:59.930
answer this and switch our question and some animations in there. In the next video, I'll start building

00:59.960 --> 01:07.160
this myself and walk you through my solution which you may use as a comparation or of course as always,

01:07.280 --> 01:12.810
challenge it, try to improve it try to find different ways to achieve the same. See you in the video.
