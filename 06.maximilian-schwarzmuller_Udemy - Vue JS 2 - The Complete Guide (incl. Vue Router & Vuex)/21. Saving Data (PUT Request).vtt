00:01.980 --> 00:05.090
We do have this button in the header,

00:05.110 --> 00:12.170
so here we get the save data button and we can of course add a click listener here to call save data in

00:12.180 --> 00:16.030
this place and then add the appropriate method down there,

00:16.080 --> 00:18.610
save data, like this.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.480
Now how do we save data?

00:20.880 --> 00:26.130
Well generally, we can now execute all the logic here,

00:26.130 --> 00:31.930
we could also create an action and a mutation in vuex but we're not really mutating the state so

00:31.950 --> 00:33.360
that doesn't sound right,

00:33.360 --> 00:36.610
why call it a mutation if it doesn't change anything,

00:36.690 --> 00:39.310
that's not how we want to use vuex.

00:39.370 --> 00:47.190
Instead I can basically store my data in a constant here and create an object which has all the data

00:47.220 --> 00:54.930
I need which would be my funds, my stock portfolio and my overall stocks,

00:54.930 --> 00:57.760
so these are the three data pieces I have

00:57.780 --> 01:00.000
including the current prices of course,

01:00.120 --> 01:06.180
so after hitting end day several times, we of course want to store the recent state and then I can simply

01:06.180 --> 01:15.960
get all this data from this store getters funds and of course I could use map getters instead, here

01:16.020 --> 01:23.700
it's from getters stock portfolio and down there, it's from stocks.

01:23.740 --> 01:26.650
So I'm getting all the data from my store,

01:26.820 --> 01:30.760
now I'm storing it in this data constant I create

01:31.020 --> 01:37.350
and I can now pass this constant so I will use http with dollar sign, $http accessing vue resource

01:37.350 --> 01:43.800
here and I will send a put request because remember on firebase, using put requests will override the old

01:43.800 --> 01:44.160
data

01:44.190 --> 01:45.450
and that's exactly what I want,

01:45.450 --> 01:47.810
I only want to keep one record.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.300
I want to put to data.json,

01:50.370 --> 01:55.340
that's the name of the node I wanted to create, of course you can choose any name you want but

01:55.390 --> 01:57.020
.json is important

01:57.030 --> 01:58.660
otherwise it will not work

01:59.130 --> 02:02.780
and then I will send data as an argument like this.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.520
Well let's try this out,

02:05.690 --> 02:13.490
if I go back to my application and hit save data, we see a data node was created in firebase with funds

02:13.520 --> 02:16.860
and stocks, no portfolio because we don't have a portfolio,

02:17.030 --> 02:24.330
so let's quickly add some items to the portfolio, hit end day and now save it.

02:24.450 --> 02:30.090
Now you see it was over written, the funds were updated, the stock portfolio looks good with ID

02:30.090 --> 02:31.290
BMW,

02:31.290 --> 02:35.190
the prices on the stocks also look all right.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.930
So this works as intended,

02:38.010 --> 02:45.080
we're now correctly storing the data on our firebase service and I think it was pretty easy to be honest,

02:45.180 --> 02:46.860
not that many steps.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.050
Now let's hook up that load button too.
