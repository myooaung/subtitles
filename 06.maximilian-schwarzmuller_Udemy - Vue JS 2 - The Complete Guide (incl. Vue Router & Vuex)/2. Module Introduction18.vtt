00:02.530 --> 00:05.520
Welcome to this module where I want to walk you through

00:05.530 --> 00:06.560
the vue cli

00:06.570 --> 00:12.840
version 3. In this course, we use the vue cli version 2 and there's nothing wrong with it,

00:12.840 --> 00:13.860
you can still use it,

00:13.860 --> 00:19.770
let me say that first but the new cli of course offers some great new features which are very interesting

00:19.770 --> 00:20.490
to use.

00:20.540 --> 00:24.990
So in this module, you will learn all about it and then you can decide with which cli you want to

00:24.990 --> 00:25.620
continue.

00:29.620 --> 00:35.870
Obviously we'll start using it in the command line and I'll show you a small demo of the cli

00:35.890 --> 00:41.650
but let's first get the big picture, how does the new vue cli work? After you installed it for which I

00:41.650 --> 00:43.730
will show you the command in a second,

00:43.810 --> 00:49.740
you can run vue create to create a new vue project, previously with the old cli, you used vue init

00:49.810 --> 00:50.290
.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.560
and this command can still be enabled but more on that later

00:53.590 --> 00:59.440
but now you use to vue create to create a new project and then you're presented with a choice, do you

00:59.440 --> 01:06.640
want to use a preset and you can save your own presets or use some pre-build one or do you want to create

01:06.640 --> 01:09.900
a new project where you configure everything on your own?

01:09.910 --> 01:11.620
Now if you use a preset, then you're done,

01:11.620 --> 01:16.450
you get the options of the preset and you get a project with which you can work, if you choose custom

01:16.450 --> 01:17.110
config,

01:17.230 --> 01:23.800
you can choose from a set of different plugins you can add to your cli project because the new

01:23.800 --> 01:27.400
vue cli is heavily plugin driven.

01:27.430 --> 01:32.200
You can add your own plugins, even you can write your own plugins and distribute them and you can add

01:32.200 --> 01:37.960
functionalities to a vue cli project by adding plugins and some choices are presented to you when

01:37.960 --> 01:40.640
installing or when creating a new project.

01:40.870 --> 01:47.660
You can add plugins like linting, progressive web app support and way more, we'll see it in action soon.

01:47.710 --> 01:49.500
You can then once you're done

01:49.510 --> 01:55.180
also save that as a new preset if you want, so that you can use it for future creations and you don't

01:55.180 --> 01:59.270
have to go through that manual config process for every new project,

01:59.410 --> 02:06.610
so you can save your own favorite template. And once that is done and you got a new project, either with

02:06.610 --> 02:12.940
a preset or with your custom configuration, you could of course develop in there, get features like a development

02:12.940 --> 02:19.500
server, hot reloading, all that fun stuff which you would expect and you can of course build your project,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.440
so then it's close to the old cli

02:21.460 --> 02:28.120
but of course with the config and the power of the new cli. You can then also add plugins to the project

02:28.210 --> 02:29.500
after you created it

02:29.560 --> 02:32.430
and that's a huge advantage compared to the old cli,

02:32.530 --> 02:35.740
there you got this template, you couldn't configure that much

02:35.830 --> 02:40.420
and once you created the project, it was pretty hard to change that configuration.

02:40.450 --> 02:46.420
You basically had to dive into the webpack configuration file to add features and whilst you can of course

02:46.420 --> 02:47.050
do that,

02:47.050 --> 02:49.880
it's not that much fun. With the new cli,

02:49.900 --> 02:56.500
you can easily pull in official plugins and I will show you how such plugins are distributed and how

02:56.500 --> 02:57.290
to find them,

02:57.340 --> 03:03.370
you can easily pull in such plugins into your existing project and add the functionality you want without

03:03.370 --> 03:04.760
creating a new project,

03:04.780 --> 03:06.980
that's a huge plus.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.900
So this is how the cli works in the big picture,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.420
now let's take a closer look at that

03:12.430 --> 03:16.200
and let's actually start using it and let's of course start with installing it.
