WEBVTT

00:01.850 --> 00:08.150
So we built our first application and hopefully you saw how easy it is to get started with Vue.js.

00:08.240 --> 00:13.650
This is where we are at now in the course. We're getting started but we'll leave this soon and thereafter

00:13.730 --> 00:19.070
we start diving super-deep into it; starting with how we can interact with the DOM, how we can output

00:19.070 --> 00:24.410
data, which different ways we have, how we can bind to HTML attributes, how we can listen to events and

00:24.410 --> 00:26.720
much much more.

00:26.720 --> 00:32.780
These are actually multiple modules in this course and you will get a very first great impression

00:32.870 --> 00:36.100
or understanding of how Vue.js works.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.310
Well thereafter, it's time to deeply dive into the Vue

00:39.320 --> 00:41.720
instance; this core object

00:41.720 --> 00:47.350
each view application in the end, or widget or whatever you're creating, uses.

00:47.390 --> 00:50.110
How does it work? Which lifecycle does it follow?

00:50.120 --> 00:52.420
How can you use it to your advantage?

00:52.730 --> 00:54.050
Well then it's time to leave

00:54.070 --> 01:00.320
JSFiddle which will use for the first sections and really learn about how you could set up more professional

01:00.320 --> 01:03.050
workflows. We'll use the Vue CLI for that,

01:03.140 --> 01:05.780
but that really isn't the CLI doing all the work,

01:05.780 --> 01:12.350
it's just a CLI which provides some ease-to-use and quickly-to-get-started-with templates for example;

01:12.350 --> 01:13.910
then using Webpack in the end.

01:13.910 --> 01:19.980
We will talk in greater detail about this in this section of course. With the more professional workflow

01:19.980 --> 01:22.300
set up, we can dive into components;

01:22.340 --> 01:24.270
a key concept in Vue.js.

01:24.410 --> 01:31.640
You build up your application from components. You can create reusable parts containing a template and

01:31.640 --> 01:36.350
business logic which you then can use in different places in your app; really powerful.

01:36.350 --> 01:42.230
And I will actually have multiple modules here about basics, about how you can communicate between components

01:42.530 --> 01:44.540
and some advanced concepts.

01:44.930 --> 01:51.530
Well, with all these core features being set, we will then have a look at forms, how can we handle user

01:51.590 --> 01:57.830
input, how can we use different form elements and how can we create our own form control. Thereafter we'll

01:57.830 --> 02:00.300
have a look at directives, filters and mixins.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.780
What are all these things?

02:01.880 --> 02:03.080
How can they help you?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.580
How would you use them in your application?

02:05.930 --> 02:08.120
Well we're getting really advanced here.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.200
And then we're going to have a look at animations and transitions.

02:11.240 --> 02:16.370
You want to make your application beautiful and here we will learn how Vue.js makes that's very easy,

02:16.550 --> 02:23.090
how it supports us animating dynamic content or the switching from one component to another.

02:23.570 --> 02:27.350
Well with that we're really diving super-deep into it,

02:27.560 --> 02:31.940
but until now, we always stayed in our Vue.js application.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.870
What if we need to reach out to a server to store something in a database?

02:36.050 --> 02:41.030
Well we can do that and we will learn how we can access the HTTP from within a Vue.js application

02:41.300 --> 02:43.160
in this part of the course.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.470
Thereafter, time to have a look at what you would need to create bigger applications, namely single

02:48.470 --> 02:49.970
page applications.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.160
For that, we will need routing

02:52.250 --> 02:56.840
and of course I have a whole module dedicated to that where you will learn how the router works, how

02:56.840 --> 03:03.230
to set it up, how to use child routes, how to pass parameters and much more. That belongs in a world of

03:03.230 --> 03:09.590
single page applications and kind of like so does the state management we'll have a look at then. Managing

03:09.590 --> 03:14.620
the state in more complex applications can quickly become a problem as you will see there

03:14.780 --> 03:20.390
and I will also provide a solution. Vuex, a great additional package which makes this easy.

03:20.450 --> 03:25.070
That concludes the single page application part and we'll then have a look at deployment.

03:25.070 --> 03:28.640
How can we actually ship our application to a server?

03:28.850 --> 03:30.670
Does this sound great? To me,

03:30.680 --> 03:34.660
it does and I can't wait to dive deeper into that. I'll do so soon.

03:34.670 --> 03:39.350
Let's next have a look at which resources this course gives you to make your progress,

03:39.350 --> 03:42.580
besides watching these videos, as easy as possible.
