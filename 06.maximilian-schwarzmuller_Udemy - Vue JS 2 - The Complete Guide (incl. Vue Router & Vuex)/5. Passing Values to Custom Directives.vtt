00:01.520 --> 00:07.740
Until now we got this basic directive which simply changes the background color to green, now it would be

00:07.740 --> 00:10.630
nice to let the user determine the background color.

00:10.680 --> 00:15.520
Therefore as a new step, I'm going to comment out the old code here,

00:15.750 --> 00:18.430
I will still set the style of this element,

00:18.450 --> 00:24.050
I will still set the background color but I want to set it to binding.value.

00:24.050 --> 00:28.450
Now binding is the information about our directive binding,

00:28.500 --> 00:30.290
so about this code here

00:30.540 --> 00:36.140
and value is whatever we enter between the quotation marks when passing it with the equal sign.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.850
So here this shall be a string since

00:38.850 --> 00:40.920
well we need to set it up as a string

00:40.920 --> 00:46.560
and here we could set this to red. And once I do this and I save this, we already see that it now has

00:46.560 --> 00:47.640
a red background

00:47.640 --> 00:53.520
because again, whatever we enter here between the quotation marks is the value of the binding and we

00:53.520 --> 00:56.040
do use the value binding here

00:56.100 --> 01:02.580
when I set the background color. So that quickly improved our directive, by now making it much more flexible

01:02.640 --> 01:06.140
because now we are able to set the value from outside.
