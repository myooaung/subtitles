00:01.440 --> 00:07.910
So I want to be able to click a list item here and load the appropriate user detail component and pass

00:07.910 --> 00:09.340
the parameter to it,

00:09.610 --> 00:15.730
well nothing easier than that. In UserStart.vue file which is where I have these list items, I will

00:15.730 --> 00:20.240
simply replace list item with router link again to

00:20.440 --> 00:25.060
well use this router link component the vue router ships with,

00:25.060 --> 00:29.260
so let me quickly replace all of that with this.

00:29.770 --> 00:33.600
And of course I still want to use the list item,

00:33.670 --> 00:38.350
so therefore I will quickly add tag equals list item there.

00:39.240 --> 00:46.200
So with this, my router links are now set up, of course I also need to add to tag or to attribute

00:46.200 --> 00:47.270
to be precise

00:47.370 --> 00:51.710
so I'll quickly restructure this so that this becomes easy to read

00:51.930 --> 00:55.870
and the first route here shall navigate to what now.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.580
Well it should navigate to /user,

00:59.640 --> 01:02.460
this is my main route here

01:02.580 --> 01:09.270
and then for user 1, it shall add /1 to it.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.820
So in UserStart, this will go to /user 1

01:13.080 --> 01:17.120
and of course in a real application, you might dynamically fill that from an array

01:17.340 --> 01:21.320
and keep in mind you can bind this dynamically by using colon too,

01:21.340 --> 01:24.790
now you could bind it to a property which contains this path.

01:25.620 --> 01:31.700
So this is the first user here, here I'll use the static setup without binding it to a property

01:31.950 --> 01:34.880
and now I do have three different routes.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.870
Now let's see this in action if I load this and

01:36.870 --> 01:38.300
now click on this,

01:38.310 --> 01:44.320
we load user 1, user 2, user 3, as we can see in the URL.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.240
That's great,

01:45.240 --> 01:50.920
now let's also extract the data in the user detail component. To do this,

01:50.940 --> 01:56.020
I go to the user detail component of course, here I'll also wrap this in a div

01:56.310 --> 02:06.610
and now I want to extract the user data, so in a paragraph, user loaded has ID and then output the ID here.

02:06.630 --> 02:14.460
Now I could again store this in a property but since this actually is a route which will not be updated

02:14.460 --> 02:22.560
without me navigating back to another route, I can simply say $route.params.id.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.030
Let's see this in action,

02:24.750 --> 02:28.870
path one, path two, path three,

02:28.880 --> 02:34.970
again I don't need to watch these changes because if I am on this user detail component, there is no

02:34.970 --> 02:38.600
way for me to click anywhere to load the user with id 2

02:38.690 --> 02:44.980
and if I manually enter it here, it will get reloaded anyways. So therefore I don't need to have my set

02:45.020 --> 02:51.050
up here where I watch for changes in the route params because that could not happen.

02:51.110 --> 02:56.270
The component will get recreated anyways because I have to navigate away and then reload it because I'm clicking

02:56.270 --> 02:57.150
a new link.

02:57.410 --> 03:04.670
So this is how this works and how now, I use a nested component with parameters to extract parameters

03:04.880 --> 03:07.510
and am nested in another component.
