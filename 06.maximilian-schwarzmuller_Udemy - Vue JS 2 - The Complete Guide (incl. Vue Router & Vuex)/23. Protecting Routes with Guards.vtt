Now speaking of navigation controls, we're already deeply in the routing topic and there's one thing

00:11.120 --> 00:13.570
which you will need from time to time,

00:13.580 --> 00:19.970
you want to control if a user is allowed to enter a certain route or if he's allowed to leave it.

00:20.360 --> 00:28.010
Let's say if we load the user detail page here and then we click on edit, we want to control whether

00:28.010 --> 00:30.440
the user is allowed to visit the edit page,

00:30.620 --> 00:33.890
let's say an arbitrary users logged in check

00:34.340 --> 00:39.960
and then if the user was in user edit page, we want to control if he's allowed to leave by let's say

00:39.950 --> 00:47.810
throwing in a button in here where I simply want to say confirm, so let's say if some edits were

00:47.810 --> 00:54.560
made and only after this button was clicked do we want to let the user navigate away, otherwise if changes

00:54.560 --> 00:55.310
weren't confirmed

00:55.310 --> 01:00.120
for example, we want to at least ask the user if he wants to navigate away.

01:00.290 --> 01:06.310
So we get these two checks, before a user enters a route and after he, well once he wants to leave

01:06.420 --> 01:06.860
a route,

01:07.010 --> 01:08.540
let me put it like this.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.940
Let's have a look at these two cases in the next videos.
