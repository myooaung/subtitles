00:02.090 --> 00:03.730
It's exercise time again.

00:03.770 --> 00:08.100
We learned about conditionals and loops or lists with v-for,

00:08.120 --> 00:10.480
now it's time to practice that to

00:10.670 --> 00:11.100
yeah,

00:11.180 --> 00:12.710
really get into using that

00:12.800 --> 00:15.830
and feel 100% safe about doing so.

00:15.830 --> 00:18.270
The first exercise is set up here,

00:18.380 --> 00:25.250
wants you to hook up this button you see here to toggle the display of the two paragraphs and do this both

00:25.250 --> 00:28.930
by using v-if and v-show to understand the difference.

00:28.970 --> 00:35.770
Side note, if you plan on using v-else, v-else is not available on v-show,

00:35.810 --> 00:37.090
you can't use it on that,

00:37.130 --> 00:39.180
it only works with v-if.

00:39.530 --> 00:41.560
Well that is the first exercise,

00:41.630 --> 00:47.630
the second one is about creating a list, output an unordered list of array elements of your choice,

00:47.630 --> 00:52.750
so basically create a new array and loop through it and create the list of that array

00:52.760 --> 00:59.870
here in the html code, also print the index of each element. In the third exercise,

00:59.930 --> 01:06.650
I want you to loop through this object here, you see here and I want you to print all the key value pairs

01:06.710 --> 01:11.650
as well as the index of each key value pair. In the fourth exercise,

01:11.690 --> 01:17.780
I also want you to print an object, this one here but I only want you to print the values. Important, create

01:17.780 --> 01:20.490
a nested loop for this data array

01:20.690 --> 01:28.580
and as we not only have nested arrays, you also might need to figure out a way to determine whether the current

01:28.580 --> 01:33.710
value of the outer loop is an array for which you can create a nested loop or not.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.340
So these are the four exercises,

01:35.360 --> 01:36.260
have fun with them.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.970
I see you in the solution video.
