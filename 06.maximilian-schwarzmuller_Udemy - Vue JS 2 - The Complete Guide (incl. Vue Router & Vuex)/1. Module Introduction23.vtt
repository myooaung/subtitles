00:02.040 --> 00:07.320
Welcome to a new module. We traveled through a lot of the features vuejs offers us.

00:07.470 --> 00:13.110
We learned about how we can interact with the dom, how we can use events and how the vue instance

00:13.110 --> 00:13.830
works,

00:13.830 --> 00:16.800
all of that is extremely important and still valid

00:16.800 --> 00:24.610
now that we learn about components. Though components are a major piece of vuejs and all the other

00:24.630 --> 00:31.230
things were basics we needed to understand how components work and we use the same basics with components

00:31.530 --> 00:38.640
but now components introduce a whole new feature to our vuejs application, namely the feature to

00:38.640 --> 00:45.300
create re-usable pieces in our application which we then can dump in in different places in our app

00:45.570 --> 00:50.300
to re-render the same kind of code or business logic in different places.

00:50.550 --> 00:55.500
Now we'll see this here in action and we will learn how we can use components which different ways of

00:55.500 --> 01:01.560
using we have, how we can register them, how we can let them interact with each other and much more.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.700
So let's dive in.
