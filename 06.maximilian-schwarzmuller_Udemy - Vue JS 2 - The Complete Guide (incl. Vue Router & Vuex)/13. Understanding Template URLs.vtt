00:02.240 --> 00:08.070
Now that we learned about resources and so on, it's also time to learn about how we can make our URL

00:08.160 --> 00:17.190
more flexible let's say. For example here, right now we always have data.json hardcoded in here,

00:17.190 --> 00:22.740
now what if we wanted to replace this dynamically? Then we could simply wrap it in curly braces and

00:22.830 --> 00:24.780
name it node for example

00:24.780 --> 00:26.040
and now this is a variable

00:26.040 --> 00:30.260
we can replace. I'll leave everything as it is here,

00:30.390 --> 00:34.480
the URL I set up here will override it for the saving action

00:34.740 --> 00:39.880
but now for getting, well maybe I want to get it from the alternative or the data node,

00:39.930 --> 00:42.330
so it would be nice if I could exchange this.

00:42.540 --> 00:52.140
Therefore I will add a new input field above my Get Data button, input type form, class form control, type

00:52.380 --> 00:57.280
text of course and then some line breaks to separate it from the button

00:57.540 --> 01:04.950
and then here, I want to bind with v-model to a node property which I'll of course add here and which should

01:04.950 --> 01:06.870
be data by default.

01:06.870 --> 01:10.990
Now I want the user to be able to enter any node here

01:11.040 --> 01:12.750
and of course only if it exists

01:12.870 --> 01:18.600
will the http request then be sent to this endpoint and fetch the data from there.

01:18.660 --> 01:25.410
So to achieve this, we somehow need to change the way we fetch our data and make this more flexible,

01:25.560 --> 01:27.800
now I will use a resource for this again.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.260
So here all I will do is I will say get data

01:31.290 --> 01:41.280
for example, this shall have a method of get and now vue resource generally supports the set up of your

01:41.300 --> 01:43.230
URLs as templates,

01:43.260 --> 01:47.240
so with flexible parts like this here. If you want to learn more,

01:47.250 --> 01:50.960
again a great start is on the vue resource

01:50.970 --> 01:57.960
github page and then there under, on the root page actually, you will find this URI templates link

01:58.410 --> 02:05.580
which will take you to this page here which basically describes this URI template standard which explains

02:05.580 --> 02:12.120
you how you can set up flexible pieces in your URLs which may be exchanged and all of the features

02:12.120 --> 02:15.420
described here will work with vue resource.

02:15.420 --> 02:20.350
Now we're using these symbols use case here where we simply have a variable thing in the URL

02:20.400 --> 02:23.780
which we can exchange for some real data,

02:23.970 --> 02:27.050
so this case here on the documentation here

02:27.180 --> 02:30.820
but more interesting, this case here in our code,

02:31.050 --> 02:34.820
so we need to replace this node variable dynamically.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.830
Now we can do this.

02:35.940 --> 02:41.240
I'm going to replace my http request here in fetch data

02:41.520 --> 02:48.870
and instead I now also want to use this resource and now it's get data, in this new resource I just set

02:48.950 --> 02:49.680
up.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.840
Now get data doesn't have its own URL so it uses the default URL and you could have used

02:54.840 --> 02:55.910
this with

02:56.050 --> 02:58.160
this http get request as well,

02:58.170 --> 03:04.710
just as a side node but here in this resource URL we set up for all resources, we do have

03:04.710 --> 03:07.500
a flexible piece in our URL, node.

03:07.740 --> 03:14.910
Now we can override this by simply passing an object as the first argument where we then specify each

03:15.000 --> 03:16.540
variable we do have in our

03:16.540 --> 03:22.920
URL, so node for example as a key and then as a value, the value which should really be entered

03:22.920 --> 03:23.860
in the URL

03:23.870 --> 03:30.550
once it is sent. This is here, this node referring to our node property where we store the user input.

03:30.570 --> 03:36.600
So what this will do is it will take our URL down there and replace the node key with this value

03:36.600 --> 03:37.680
we set up here

03:37.830 --> 03:43.350
and if we would have multiple pieces here like with a slash and then another piece, then we could

03:43.350 --> 03:47.570
simply add another here and replace this too and so on

03:47.670 --> 03:52.600
and you can again consult the page I showed you before to learn more about how you can structure this

03:52.800 --> 03:56.780
and which operators and so on you have in your toolset.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.650
So this will now replace this node part

03:59.660 --> 04:06.950
here with this value we pass here and then we could also pass other arguments but we don't need to, it's

04:06.960 --> 04:10.760
a get request so that looks fine.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.760
Now of course we here again want to use then

04:13.950 --> 04:16.500
and basically I want to use the same code as before

04:16.500 --> 04:23.400
so I'm just going to copy that because that code will work fine and all I need to do is uncomment this of

04:23.400 --> 04:28.200
course. And with this in place, this should now work well,

04:28.530 --> 04:33.810
it's the same functionality as before but now with our own resource which has the great advantage of

04:33.810 --> 04:35.380
being flexible.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.940
So let me reload the page and get the data

04:38.250 --> 04:41.490
and we see it worked when we fetched it from data.

04:41.490 --> 04:49.270
Now let's fetch it from the alternative node by entering alternative in here, looks good.

04:49.460 --> 04:54.630
And this is where I want to conclude this section because now, we really learned a lot

04:54.680 --> 05:01.790
and this is the final piece with you having the ability to exchange pieces in the URL

05:01.810 --> 05:03.440
you are sending your request to.
