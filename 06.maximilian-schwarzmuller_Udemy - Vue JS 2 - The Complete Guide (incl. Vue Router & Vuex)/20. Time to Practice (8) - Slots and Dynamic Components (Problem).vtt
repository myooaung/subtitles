Time for our exercise, this is a little application,

00:05.200 --> 00:10.540
we get three buttons for three different templates and then it looks like we got three divs here with

00:10.540 --> 00:11.820
different colors.

00:12.130 --> 00:17.830
Well these divs are actually three components which have absolutely nothing inside their template except

00:17.830 --> 00:24.340
that the div which had a style with a scoped style so that it stays inside this component. And in the

00:24.340 --> 00:30.100
app file, I simply have the buttons and these three components which I'll load in my object down there, so

00:30.100 --> 00:31.960
far, so straightforward.

00:32.140 --> 00:39.010
Now maybe you already guessed what the exercise is but as a first step, I want you to pass in some content

00:39.010 --> 00:47.410
of your choice, can be some text, can be html code to each of these templates here, the same text

00:47.410 --> 00:53.850
or the same content it should be because in this next lesson, I want to dynamically switch that.

00:53.870 --> 00:56.720
Now back to the first part, passing in some content,

00:56.770 --> 01:02.910
of course we want to pass it in between the opening and closing selector, so not as a prop.

01:02.920 --> 01:09.610
Now regarding the second part, dynamically switching these components, I want you to hook up these buttons and

01:09.610 --> 01:16.060
add some code so that only one of the three templates is displayed and the other two are not

01:16.120 --> 01:20.170
and we can switch between them. Well with slots and dynamic components,

01:20.170 --> 01:22.390
you should be well prepared to do that.

01:22.570 --> 01:25.190
Let's meet for the solution in the next video.
