An import note regarding the naming of your props, here I'm using name. Now I could also use of course

00:09.290 --> 00:10.490
myName,

00:10.490 --> 00:15.760
case sensitive here because I have a capital N inside of that, I therefore also

00:15.890 --> 00:18.280
adjust the output here in my template

00:18.380 --> 00:24.570
and then in the user component, I can use my name with capital N here too. Now if I save this,

00:24.680 --> 00:27.250
it still works as you will see if I reload,

00:27.620 --> 00:29.110
so that still worked.

00:29.210 --> 00:33.570
However, it only works because I'm using a single file template here,

00:33.590 --> 00:38.060
if you try to use this in another template and we're not doing this in this course because this is the

00:38.060 --> 00:44.510
best solution to be honest, then you can't use it because the dom implications, because the dom restrictions

00:44.780 --> 00:50.180
of having case insensitive attributes and elements applies,

00:50.360 --> 00:57.320
so a case sensitive attributeslike this will only work if you make sure that you're using a template

00:57.380 --> 01:03.140
which supports this, like the single file template we're using here which again gets compiled to javascript

01:03.140 --> 01:04.790
during the build process

01:04.810 --> 01:07.890
anyways. That's just something I wanted to highlight.
