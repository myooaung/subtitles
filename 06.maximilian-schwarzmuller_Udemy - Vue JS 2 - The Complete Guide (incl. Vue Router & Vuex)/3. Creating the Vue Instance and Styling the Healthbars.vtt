As I said, I want to start by setting up the player health

00:05.570 --> 00:11.850
but the very first thing of course is that I create a new vue instance, I can do this because in my index.html

00:11.850 --> 00:13.360
file up here,

00:13.430 --> 00:17.220
I'm importing vue from a CDN.

00:17.260 --> 00:25.680
So here with this vue instance, I now want to control the element with the ID of app, this is this

00:25.730 --> 00:31.260
div wrapping my whole app so that we can use this as a template

00:31.660 --> 00:35.030
and then I need to store some data in this vue instance,

00:35.170 --> 00:42.580
for example the player health. I'll go in and name it player health and this should be 100 initially and

00:42.580 --> 00:47.590
the same is true for the monster health, let's say should also be 100.

00:48.070 --> 00:52.450
So this is the basic data I'm managing for now,

00:52.480 --> 01:00.070
one thing we will probably also need since we can click start a new game is to track if a new game or

01:00.070 --> 01:02.200
if a game is running or not

01:02.230 --> 01:03.160
so I will add

01:03.160 --> 01:11.170
game is running here true and set it to false initially, so that initially we don't have a running game,

01:11.370 --> 01:18.460
so that by checking this property here, we can see if we should display the start a new game button

01:18.550 --> 01:21.580
or our action buttons like attack and heal.

01:21.700 --> 01:29.110
Well with this data in place, we can actually work on our template a little more and start displaying

01:29.170 --> 01:36.450
the health, let's say. The easiest thing is that inside of our health bars here, we simply output the

01:36.470 --> 01:48.050
player health here and in the monster area, we also output the monster health. If I save this and reload this

01:48.130 --> 01:52.060
application, we should now see the numbers inside our health bars.

01:52.060 --> 01:59.140
That is great but I also want to adjust the width of that health bar, of the inner health bar, of this green

01:59.140 --> 02:00.600
area here.

02:00.820 --> 02:06.550
Now to adjust this, you see that the health bar generally has this green background here,

02:06.700 --> 02:10.560
it is nested in this outer health bar class here

02:10.570 --> 02:16.150
and if we have a look at the css style, we see that initially it has a width of 80%, that we

02:16.150 --> 02:20.160
have set up a transition though that fully moves when we change the width.

02:20.380 --> 02:27.900
And now we want to change that width, we want to change that with to our actual health which is 100 at

02:27.910 --> 02:31.430
the beginning as we just set it up. For that,

02:31.450 --> 02:36.990
we clearly can use the style helper vuejs offers us.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.120
So I'm going to restructure this a bit so that it's easier to read and here, I what to bind to the style

02:43.120 --> 02:46.020
property, as explained in the last lectures,

02:46.060 --> 02:52.420
it's no issue that we have style here and now bind to it, behind the scenes vuejs will merge this

02:52.420 --> 02:59.190
together. So here I'm binding to style and I pass a javascript object here to describe the style I want

02:59.190 --> 03:03.760
to attach, I want to change the width like this

03:03.880 --> 03:08.670
and we don't have to enclose it in single quotation marks to be precise

03:08.950 --> 03:17.590
and I want to set the value depending on the player health here and now, how should we use that? If I

03:17.590 --> 03:19.220
set it to 100 like this,

03:19.220 --> 03:26.900
this would be treated as pixels but I want to set it to percentages, so I will add percentage here,

03:27.130 --> 03:34.980
this will make sure, should be in single quotes though, that the width of this div here will be 100%

03:34.990 --> 03:39.170
and 100% of what? Of its view container,

03:39.190 --> 03:45.370
so of the outer div and the outer div will be this health bar here.

03:45.370 --> 03:54.390
So if we save this and reload now, we see now it's the full width of that because we set it to 100%

03:54.390 --> 04:01.470
initially instead of 80% which we had otherwise. Side note, correctly you might say but the outer div

04:01.500 --> 04:07.770
also has the css class health bar and it does, the health bar is set to 80% width.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.000
So why is it now 100%

04:10.020 --> 04:17.460
just when we change the inner one? You have to keep in mind the outer div, the grey health bar we

04:17.460 --> 04:24.720
saw before was 80% of the size of the div holding that health bar which is this column here

04:24.720 --> 04:28.570
but now the inner health bar makes up 100% of the outer one,

04:28.590 --> 04:34.680
therefore even though the outer one doesn't completely fill the width of its holding element, this div,

04:34.950 --> 04:39.750
the inner one now makes up the full width of the health bar and that is what we need,

04:39.750 --> 04:42.340
so this is how we set this up.

04:42.450 --> 04:50.340
Now with that, I can simply copy that to my monster health bar down here where I also have the styles

04:50.610 --> 04:54.140
just wrapped together by my IDE here

04:54.270 --> 04:59.940
and here of course, I want to use the monster health and not the player health. With that, we're outputting

04:59.940 --> 05:05.640
the health and we're adjusting the health bars. The next step is to be able to actually start a new

05:05.640 --> 05:12.780
game and well, start setting up these actions so that we can do more than just view our health and this

05:12.780 --> 05:14.460
non-working application.
