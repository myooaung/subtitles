WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:09.820
So in this model, we had a detailed look at the vue cli, how we can use it to create better workflows

00:09.860 --> 00:13.870
based on some templates which are available. For the rest of the course,

00:13.870 --> 00:20.590
I will use the webpack simple template, an especially important feature are these .vue files,

00:20.590 --> 00:28.300
these single template files which house a template, a script and styles all in one file. That's a special

00:28.300 --> 00:35.770
concept vuejs offers you which makes writing your vue instances or components a lot more convenient

00:36.190 --> 00:39.400
and gives you some additional power.

00:39.400 --> 00:45.550
Therefore throughout the rest of the course, I will use this template, this webpack simple template we set

00:45.550 --> 00:53.350
up in this module, I will use these single template files, these .vue files to continue working with

00:53.350 --> 00:54.210
that.

00:54.310 --> 00:58.570
Definitely consider using such a workflow for your projects,

00:58.600 --> 01:02.970
possibly the webpack instead of the webpack simple workflow we're using here.

01:03.130 --> 01:08.980
And with that, you should have a powerful tool to really create bigger applications.
