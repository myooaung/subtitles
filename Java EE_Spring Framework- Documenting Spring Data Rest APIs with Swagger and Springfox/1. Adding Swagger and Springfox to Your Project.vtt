Hi, this is Craig Golightly, and welcome to Using Swagger in Your Project.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.740
It's time to dive into the details of how to add

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.970
Springfox to your Spring Data REST project.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.840
Let's go through the dependencies and setup,

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.650
then switch to our IDE for a code demo.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.250
Next,

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.740
we'll look at some options to customize APIâ€‘level attributes that show up

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.410
in the Swagger UI and go back to our project to make those changes in code

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.790
and see how it looks in a running application.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.010
To start out with, you'll need to add a few dependencies to your POM.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.870
These libraries will generate the Swagger doc, work with Spring Data REST to

12
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.790
pick up all of the autogenerated endpoints, and provide the Swagger UI where you

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.790
can actually see the documentation and interact with your API. Note that you'll

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.070
also need to add a repository to pick up the snapshot version of Springfox. At

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.160
the time of recording, the latest release version has some bugs that don't work

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.740
with Spring Data REST, so that's why we're using the snapshot version.

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.390
Next,

18
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.820
you'll need to add a class with the Configuration and

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.260
EnableSwagger2WebMvc annotations, as well as an import of

20
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.290
the SpringDataRestConfiguration.class.

21
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.640
The class itself can be called whatever you want, as well as the method,

22
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.400
but it needs to have the @Bean annotation. In the method,

23
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.590
you'll create and return a Docket object.

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.780
The Docket is where you can make several

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.000
modifications to what shows up in Swagger. For now, we'll just use the defaults.
