Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.230
My name is Craig Golightly, and welcome to my course, Spring Framework:

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.910
Documenting Spring Data REST APIs with Swagger and Springfox. I am a senior

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.820
software consultant. Documenting your API can sometimes feel like a losing

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.580
battle, keeping it up to date with changes, figuring out what format to

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.330
use, and where to host it.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.630
The good news is that there is an easier way. In this course, you'll

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.730
explore how Swagger and Springfox can automatically generate

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
documentation for your Spring Data REST API and make it available on a

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.170
web page that is also a REST client.

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.970
Not only will you be able to read the documentation,

12
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.430
you can actually try out the endpoints.

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.090
Some of the major topics that we will cover include the Swagger framework,

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.430
adding Swagger to your project,

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.130
customizing your documentation, and documenting different

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.640
versions of your API. By the end of this course,

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.400
you will be able to quickly and easily generate documentation for your

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.190
Spring Data REST API using Swagger and Springfox. Before beginning the

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.160
course, you should be familiar with Spring Data and REST APIs. I hope you'll

20
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.750
join me on this journey to learn about documenting REST APIs with the Spring

21
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.000
Framework: Documenting Spring Data REST APIs with Swagger and Springfox course, at Pluralsight.
