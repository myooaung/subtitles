1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,700
If you'd like to automatically translate information from

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,950
JSR‑303 annotations like @NotNull, @Min,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,050
@Max, and @Size into your Swagger models,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,980
you'll need to add an additional dependency and

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,740
import on your configuration class.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,140
The springfox‑bean‑validators library adds this capability.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,900
Add that to your POM and import the

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,480
BeanValidatorPluginsConfiguration class on your Swagger configuration

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,740
class.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,160
You'll then see information in the Swagger UI that is derived from these

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,410
four annotations, without needing to add anything extra.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,870
Note that if you're using the ApiModelProperty annotation along with one of

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,540
these four annotations, ApiModelProperty takes precedence.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,220
For example, if department is @NotNull and you just add a description,

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,570
then nothing will show up in the Swagger UI to

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,260
indicate that this is a required value.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,140
In this case,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,840
you would need to add the required = true value to the ApiModelProperty

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,600
in order for the required indicator to show up in the Swagger UI. If

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,990
you've added other services and methods,

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,940
you can use Swagger annotations to provide additional

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,420
documentation in the Swagger UI. For example,

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,030
the @ApiOperation annotation allows you to add a value that

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,000
appears by the endpoint in the Swagger UI, as well as some notes that appear below the method.
