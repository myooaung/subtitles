00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,040
Now that you've added Springfox to your project with the

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,050
Swagger UI and default configurations,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,270
let's customize some API‑level attributes. We'll do this using the ApiInfo

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,870
object when we create a Docket to add things like description,

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,140
version, and contact info.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,840
Here's the Springfox website that has links to documentation

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
and the source code for your reference.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,150
The ApiInfo object is easier to see in the project itself,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,540
so we'll jump right into the demo. We'll customize the API‑level

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,240
information here in our Configuration class when we create the Docket.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,210
We can add a call to ApiInfo, then define a method to create our

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,560
ApiInfo object. We'll utilize the ApiInfoBuilder to add some things

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:02,140
like title, version, description, contact info, and email.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,560
If your API has a specific license, you can add

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,980
that as well. And we'll build it.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,640
Let's go ahead and restart our application and see how the

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,410
API‑level information changes at the top of our Swagger UI. Our

18
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,280
application has restarted, and we'll refresh our Swagger UI. Here

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,230
we have our new title, Employee API,

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,090
and the version that we set, 1.0. Notice our description,

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,410
API for managing employees, and the contact

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,750
information that we added, Craig Golightly.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,100
If we check out the website, we'll see globomantics.com, and

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,740
the email is going to craig@globomantics.com.

25
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,070
We can also see the license that we put in, the Apache License

26
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,350
Version 2.0. Modifying the properties in your ApiInfo object is a

27
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,330
really easy way to customize your Swagger UI and make it match the

28
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,140
information for your API.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,750
You can now add Springfox to your project with a few easy

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,130
configurations and have the Swagger UI display documentation

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,090
generated from your Spring Data REST project.

32
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,520
You can also customize some API‑level attributes that display in

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,450
the Swagger UI. Join me in the next module where we will look at

34
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,000
additional customizations you can make, including how to document multiple versions of your API.
