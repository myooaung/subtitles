00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.770
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course in our programming in this affair are we going to proceed

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.150
with correcting our data set.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.400
And today we're talking about correcting and daughter through factual analysis.

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.400
So this is the case where you are able to restore Datto 100 percent certainty and go back to our Excel

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.390
document and see where this is going to be the case.

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.550
So here in this in these states or in these cases where we're missing the state we can restore to 100

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.290
percent certainty because we know the city.

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.770
Right so if we know the city then we can restore the state like here San Francisco would be California

9
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.040
.

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.030
And then also we can calculate expenses a hundred percent certainty assuming that there's no fraud and

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940
there's no errors because it is revenue minus profit basically revenue minus profit.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.180
And then once we populate two of these calls we can calculate the third one as well.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340
But we're not going to worry about these for now.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.020
We're going to focus on the state column and we're going to see how we can restore the values in the

15
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.760
state.

16
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.600
So let's go ahead and do that.

17
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.270
So back to our data set.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.770
If I run this line I will get all of the columns that have missing values and bear in mind that we have

19
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.340
already removed to or removed to from the industry.

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.850
So we removed two rows from the data set that had an A's in the district column.

21
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.860
And now we're going to focus on the state column.

22
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.910
All right so what are we going to do.

23
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.380
First we're going to single out all the rows in the state column that have a name so we can see that

24
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.200
there's four of them.

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.290
Let's see if we can single Those four out.

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.690
We're going to use fin and then we're going to use our new type of filter is an ape and we're going

27
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.170
to say in the state.

28
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.480
So we're checking for NA's or missing values in this call and then we're running this whole subset and

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.680
then we go we've got our subset of rows with an ace in the state column.

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.340
Beautiful.

31
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.520
So what do we do next.

32
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.440
And now we want to obviously correct them we want to fix these if in New York and why and these were

33
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.040
California CA because New York is in New York San Francisco is in California.

34
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.110
Now we could definitely do them one by one.

35
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.970
Right we could do them just based on their ID or road name and bear in mind that the wrong name here

36
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.520
is now different to the idea because we did remove two rows and then we updated the roll names for the

37
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.960
whole door frame.

38
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.030
Now that's one of the ways of doing it the other way of doing it is to do them one by one to actually

39
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.710
add an additional field and say anything that has New York out of this subset.

40
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.620
Then apply the value and we're going to take that approach because in this case we have only four and

41
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.680
we could definitely do that one by one but in a big data set or does it with many more missing values

42
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.960
you might have lots and lots of rows that are each correct and working with them one by one can be too

43
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.820
tedious.

44
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.160
So let's go ahead and see how we can hit them.

45
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.830
Both of these rows in one go this one and this one right here.

46
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.400
All right.

47
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.200
So what we're going to do is we're going to correct this filter a little bit.

48
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.310
We going just say yes we want this subset but then we want to add another condition on say and fin dollar

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.750
sign.

50
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.200
City equals to New York.

51
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.990
Right so we're adding an additional condition to that.

52
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.290
So if we run that now we've got all of the ones that have missing values in the state coal and their

53
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.120
city is New York and now it's very simple.

54
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.950
From here we just say we want to address the state column.

55
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.040
So in quotation marks because we're addressing it by name.

56
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.880
So the name of the call here stay and we want to say apply the New York code into that column for on

57
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.550
that.

58
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.880
And now if I look at.

59
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.840
So how do I bring these roles are because if they're on this line they won't come up any more right

60
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.350
so far.

61
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.730
Just run this line.

62
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.050
They won't come up because we don't have any arose because they don't have a name here anymore.

63
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.610
So just to check.

64
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.530
So we'll just say check.

65
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.720
We're going to bring up them by their old names so we're going to say fin.

66
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.070
And here I want to pass on the numbers 11 and 3 7 7 because that's the row names.

67
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.010
And then I want comma nothing meaning or columns has happened but that.

68
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.210
So as you can see the state has indeed been updated to New York.

69
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.780
So that is a success.

70
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.180
Great.

71
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.410
Congratulations on that.

72
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.050
What do we want to do now.

73
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.440
Well now we want to also quickly check this again and see that.

74
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.470
Now we don't have them.

75
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.900
So you can see that this subset is getting smaller and smaller every time we fix up our data set and

76
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.700
now we just need to fix up the San Francisco ones.

77
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.480
So I'm going to let you pause the video now if you want to practice.

78
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.010
Post the video and see if you can update the rows on your own and you need to put in the two letters

79
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.340
see a into these rows into the column state and then just basically perform the same procedures and

80
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.530
then unpause the video and then see how we do it here.

81
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.070
So there we go.

82
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.690
Now I'm going to continue with this.

83
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.890
In the video.

84
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.440
All right.

85
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.320
So now we want to look for fin.

86
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.770
Basically Wolf is in a state we know that there's going to be just two.

87
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.700
So there they are.

88
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.380
Once again we could just do it right away now because are the same series of the same state but just

89
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.510
for completeness sake we're going to copy this line.

90
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.810
We're going to change this to San Francisco.

91
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.050
Run that OK.

92
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.600
That's good.

93
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.960
And actually we're just going to copy this line and we're going to say state of get the quotation marks

94
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.150
and here we're going to say see hey run that and now we're going to check.

95
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.440
So Finn What were the numbers there.

96
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.370
82 and 2 6 5.

97
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.650
OK so let's have a look at that.

98
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:09.000
Eighty two and two six five common nothing run that they can see that the state is has been updated

99
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.820
to see a.

100
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.490
OK.

101
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.830
And finally let's just look at this again just to make sure that it's getting smaller.

102
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.490
Voila.

103
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.470
So we only have six rows left and we only need to deal with five of them because we agreed that this

104
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.400
one will keep.

105
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.300
So beautiful.

106
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.320
This one is getting smaller and smaller.

107
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.710
This subset is getting smaller as more and that's very exciting.

108
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.810
Slowly preparing our data for analysis.

109
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.890
And that's exactly what we are after in the section.

110
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.970
And I hope you enjoy this tutorial.

111
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.580
I look forward to seeing the next one.

112
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.880
Until then happy coding.
