00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.470
Hello welcome back to that one of course in our program.

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.480
How did you go of that exercise.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.740
I've got the answers up here and now we're going to work through them to see what the correct code is

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.240
.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.540
All right so this is us creating the median variable or vector.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.270
So let's go ahead and run that line and if I look at the value here then we can see that we've got.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.250
That is the median revenue for the construction industry as we remember we're dealing with this these

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.880
two values and they're both in the construction industry it's the revenue.

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.320
So that's why we calculate the revenue for the construction industry.

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.610
Next what we want to do is we want to find these two rows so that we can assign this value so this line

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.040
accesses the door frame it checks where the revenue is missing and make sure that we are dealing with

12
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.420
records in the construction industry so far unless we'll get those two records that we are interested

13
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.800
in.

14
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.390
And now if we assign the revenue column this calculate median value then we will get what we want.

15
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.680
So now we can see that even though when we bring this these empty or incomplete cases up they still

16
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.390
do come up but that's because they have other NA's.

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.980
So that's just kind of helps us check things quicker so we can see that the values have been assigned

18
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.760
correctly.

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.570
So that's that's a good start.

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.230
That's our revenue part now with expenses here I've got to note that we need to be careful here only

21
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.300
for certain ones we don't want to replace that one that's by itself because then that troll won't add

22
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.040
up.

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.260
So what does that mean.

24
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.830
Well here you can see that for expenses we only want to replace this value and this value we don't want

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.250
to touch this one because as we discussed this value of expenses will be derived from the revenue and

26
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.350
profit that we already know because there's a relationship between these two values and we cannot use

27
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.520
the median imputation method.

28
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.990
So when you come across situations like this you have to be careful to make sure your filters are targeting

29
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.780
exactly the right values are exactly the right cells that you're after.

30
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.510
In our case you will see that because this company is in a different industry and I.T. services industry

31
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.230
we're not going to just by the way we've structured this code is not going to pick up this row so we're

32
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.660
only going to work with the construction anyway.

33
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.670
But this is something to bear in mind.

34
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.320
And there I'll show you just now how you can add an additional layer of protection from overriding this

35
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.820
rope.

36
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.560
So let's start by analyzing this code that we have here.

37
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.860
So once again recreating and variable median expenses for the construction industry and then we're saying

38
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.940
it's the median of this doorframe which we are filtering just to the construction industry and we're

39
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.700
looking at the expenses column.

40
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.720
Right so this all makes sense for moving and they say if I just run this line I've got my median X Pence's

41
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.790
for construction so for on that there they are four million five hundred six thousand nine hundred seventy

42
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.840
six dollars.

43
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.690
And now I'm going to pick up the call the rose that I'm interested in so I'm looking for those that

44
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.180
have an empty value in expenses which would ultimately pick up this row as well.

45
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.460
But then I'm filtering it to just the construction industry.

46
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.130
So in a way we're just lucky that this company is not in the construction industry and this role won't

47
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.940
pick it up.

48
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.060
So if I run that you'll see that it's just the two construction industries and that's that.

49
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.140
Now I could just run this line and override the expenses here.

50
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.800
But what I wanted to show you is that there's another way that you can make sure that you don't pick

51
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.260
up the slide for instance that's hypothesize and say that this company was in the construction industry

52
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.000
then what would happen then this road get picked up it would get overridden by the median and then this

53
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.370
this and this would not add up.

54
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.020
We don't want that.

55
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.670
So how do we make sure that we pick up only these rules.

56
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.330
Well it's very simple we just add another filter saying that profit has to also be missing.

57
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.530
So as you can see this column doesn't have a missing profit and that is kind of the main point of concern

58
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.760
.

59
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.230
So we just want to say that here we'll just add another filter would say and is Daut and a.

60
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.270
And then fin dollar sign for off it.

61
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.200
So we're adding another layer of protection.

62
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.560
We're checking that the profit is indeed equal or is indeed missing.

63
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.670
If we add that here.

64
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.400
So if I run this line now you will see that still once again it's just picking up these two rows.

65
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.000
And even if I remove this construction filter for a second and I run this line you would see that it's

66
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.970
still picking up the same two rows because they are the only ones where profit is missing.

67
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.160
So this is the proper way.

68
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.590
Right.

69
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.930
This is what we've been doing so far we're adding this just because we have that additional concern

70
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.590
that we might override a role that we're not supposed to add override.

71
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.590
So there we go those are those two roles that we want to work with.

72
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.390
And now we're going to override the expenses for these two rows.

73
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.180
So let's go ahead and run that.

74
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600
Now if I look at Rosabeth missing balances you can see there's still four but we're slowly filling them

75
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.710
up with just filled up these two values for our construction companies.

76
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.720
And now we have just that one more step left to do.

77
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.640
And that is to derive the values for these rows and we're going to do that in the next tutorial.

78
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.360
I hope that all of this made sense maybe take a quick break take a pause just to revise this and especially

79
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.480
this part where we added an additional filter you can add as many folks as you want.

80
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.970
It really depends on your data set and what's going on in there what what you see what you want to replace

81
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.220
what you don't want to replace.

82
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.030
So just make sure that you've got your head completely around this and you're comfortable with the concepts

83
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.520
that we discussed maybe try practicing a little bit maybe rerun some of these lines just to get some

84
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.170
additional practice and then proceed to the next tutorial where we'll finalize this daughter preparation

85
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.380
we'll just calculate these missing values.

86
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.260
And I look forward to see you next time.

87
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.330
Until then hepi coating
