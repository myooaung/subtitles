Hello and welcome back to that advance course and in programming now in this section we're talking about

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.870
the plight family of functions.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.400
Now the life only functions is something that is quite unique to our programming language.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.350
And oftentimes when an analyst or data scientist comes into our and they're quite new to this language

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.470
and they're just starting out who are they are to say the least very cautious with the Apply functions

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
and that is because even if you're coming with a programming background like for instance I came into

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.960
our with a C C++ Java aged him well and even javascript program background at the same time it is hard

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.710
to get your head around the family functions because they are very different to what you're used to

9
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.860
.

10
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.140
And in essence that platform functions is a shortcut.

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.410
You can think of it as a shortcut to running loops in arm.

12
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.680
And as the name suggests the uplift functions or any one of the plie functions allows you to apply a

13
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.340
certain other function to an object and or an object can be a matrix can be a list can be a vector can

14
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
be lots of different objects that you can apply a function to.

15
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.640
And there's quite a few functions in this family as you'll see and they all have different applications

16
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.980
.

17
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.950
And why were they created in the first place.

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.560
Well that is because our is a language that it was originally developed as rather that a programming

19
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.070
language it was developed as a language for statisticians to be able to get insights into their daughter

20
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.460
very quickly and then it became a data science programming language.

21
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.480
So that is where it originated from.

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.020
And so therefore that shortcut was necessary so that people wouldn't have to sit and write out all these

23
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.180
loops and all this code and take a long time to write the actual code apply.

24
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
Family functions allows you to do very sophisticated analytics very quickly.

25
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.170
Personally it took me a long time to get my head around it.

26
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.460
It took me a long time to understand and start using apply functions more and more in my code and that

27
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.880
is why this section is here.

28
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.750
We want to get up to speed with Apply functions very quickly and that's why I'm going to show you some

29
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.860
real life examples of some very interesting analytics that you can perform some very powerful analytics

30
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.960
that you can perform with family functions so that you can go away and after the section or really start

31
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.570
exploring how you can apply these apply functions in your own work in your own career and that way you

32
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.640
will really take your skills to the next level call away to see on the first tutorial.

33
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.430
And let's dive straight in.
