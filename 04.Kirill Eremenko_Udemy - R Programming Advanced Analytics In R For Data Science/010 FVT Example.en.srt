00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello and welcome back to the boss of course in our programming.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,600
In today's tutorial we're going to continue exploring the fact variable trap and we're going to look

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,850
at a more relevant example something that will resonate with us more.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,850
In fact something that comes directly from our dark side.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,970
So once again let's look at our dollar sign which is fin Right here we've got some variables so we are

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,450
going to be specifically looking at revenue expenses and profit.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,020
And let's look at a summary or let's look at last year our first of thin sure we'll see that in these

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,950
three out of them to recognize those factors.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,400
And so ultimately what we all need to do in this daughter progression phase we're going to need to convert

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,600
these into non-factors into actual just numbers.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,910
However dealing with these is a bit more complex.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,860
We're going to need to know how to remove the commas the dollar signs so we're going to need some extra

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,390
functions that we haven't learned yet so we'll cover all of those in the coming sterols what we're going

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,510
to do for now is we're going to deal of profit.

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,030
And here you can see that it's not a factor right.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,590
So we're going to pretend that it was a factor initially and then we'll learn how to deal with it.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,250
They're just going to make this example.

18
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,240
It won't overcomplicate this example make it simpler for us and the Senate will allow us focus on the

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,020
facts or side of things rather than introducing new functions right away.

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,250
So let's do exactly that.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,880
We're going to take F-in and then we're going to take the profit verbal here and we're going to replace

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,560
it with factorisation of thin profit.

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,050
So basically we're creating this artificial example for ourselves as do that.

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,170
And now let's have a look at Esther Arfin.

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,270
So here you can see that same thing as previously like if I look at this first look at the top six rows

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,310
.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,110
If I look at the top six rows you'll see that you can't even really tell the difference.

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,470
It's actually the same.

29
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,570
It's got the values here just as we had before.

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,430
So if I look scroll up here those are the values same values here.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,590
And if I look at the structure of this data set.

32
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,770
Now you can see that it is being recognized as a factor.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,170
So that is the difference.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,480
It's not being recognized as numbers anymore.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,490
It's been recognized as a factor and so is been assigned these different levels.

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,470
There's a total of 498 levels in this factor and they're being assigned these numbers so this is these

37
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,710
are the numbers that are uses to deal with the factor in his back and these are the numbers that we

38
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,550
are seeing.

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,240
So let's say Now we want to go ahead and convert this factor into a numeric so that because now if I

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,300
look at summary for fin I'll see that profit is being recognized as a factor I don't want that.

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,640
I want to see you know I mean like here median and stuff like that I want to be able to perform arithmetic

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,410
operations of profit and so on.

43
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,650
So how do I convert profit her or convert this variable over here profit into a non-factor variable

44
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:55,740
.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,490
Well the first inclination as we discussed in the press the first inclination of a novice our programmer

46
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,490
or somebody hasn't dealt with this issue before would be to say okay I'm going to take thin don't assign

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,730
profit and I'm going to convert to an America as an American.

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,360
And then because I already know that this is what this function returns I'm just going to write a way

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,840
put it into $50 profit so I'm going to override my existing values and print profit which are for some

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,470
reason recognized as a factor which looks like a character.

51
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,660
So we're going to convert it into Gnumeric and we're going to then just put it in there so far on this

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,060
line everything seems should be OK.

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,250
So if I look at this chart then what I get I get that it's a number.

54
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,840
It's no longer a factor.

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,900
And so now let's look at the top pros of this dataset now.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,470
Now what we can see is a top ROSETT are completely different.

57
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,580
The top row the profit is $342 foran 76 the 1:48 completely different to what we had here.

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:58,940
Right.

59
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,340
So if I scroll up it has to be 8 million 550 three thousand eight hundred twenty seven dollars.

60
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
This was 13 million eight million.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,660
So this was in the millions of dollars.

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,210
Now profit is in just the hundreds of dollars.

63
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,360
What happened here and moreover can we reverted back.

64
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,190
Well the answer to the last question is no.

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,990
The Dudus out of frame has been rude.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,330
What have we done here.

67
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:28,560
So what we did is because we use the as numeric function instead of dealing with these values that are

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,330
the actual values that we want our is looking at the representation of the Numeration of the category

69
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,820
so these identifiers that are has come up with for the categories.

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,060
That's what art is applying as numeric function to and then that is now what we see in our profit and

71
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,250
that is what is being displayed here.

72
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,560
So and the worst part is that there's no way I'm going back so we'll probably that's not the worst part

73
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,800
the second worst part.

74
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,870
There's no way of going back to the actual profit figures because they're gone.

75
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,350
We just.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,260
All right.

77
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,000
By doing this slide we've overridden our doorframe that whole column in our doorframe.

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,130
And while the worst part is that if you don't pick this up while you're dealing with it then you're

79
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,190
going to report on the analysts is going to report numbers to the executives or to his manager which

80
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,140
are instead of being in millions are in the hundreds of dollars completely different picture completely

81
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,150
incorrect result.

82
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,070
So as you can see this puts it into perspective.

83
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,470
This is a major issue that needs to be recognized and needs to be avoided.

84
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,780
So you need to avoid this pitfall and just make sure that you perform your conversions correctly and

85
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,460
we will practice that in the coming to Tauriel.

86
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,580
So for now what I'm going to do before we end this tutorial I'm just going to comment this part out

87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,630
so the FBT example or in fact I'm going to comment the part out that is actually dangerous that's overriding

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:06:00,030
things so that it doesn't bother us when we really run this whole script and I'm just going to say dangerous

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,930
and same thing here and now I'm just going to run on this whole script so we do have the correct data

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,820
set with the millions of dollars here.

91
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,450
So when we proceed to an exit Tauriel we have the right data that we're dealing with.

92
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:13,940
Okay.

93
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,950
So I really hope that that puts it into perspective and you can see that's why it's important to understand

94
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,290
the fact variable trap and avoid it.

95
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,480
And in the next trial we will proceed with our data progression and I look forward to seeing you then

96
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,680
.

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Until next time happy.
