00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.360
Hello welcome back to that bass course in our program.

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.800
In today's Tauriel we're talking about handling and date times and are now of course our focus for this

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.880
section lists.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.540
However before we can proceed we do need to do some more to our preparation because our data is not

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
in exactly the ideal format for us to work with.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.060
And what I'm talking about here is this time stamp call.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.800
So let's have a look at it carefully for a few seconds.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.640
What can you see from this column.

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.710
What kind of data are we talking about here.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.140
Is this first of September 2016 or is this 9th of January 2016.

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.930
So basically I'm asking is this European format or is this American format in European format.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.620
This is first of September in American format.

13
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.050
This is 9th of January.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.930
So which one is it.

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.140
Well to answer that question we can quickly look at the bottom rows of the start set and you'll see

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.260
that here indeed the first column doesn't present the day because it goes all the way up to 30.

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.170
So basically this is the European format and we're talking about the month of September.

18
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.890
But let's imagine a scenario where we didn't have this information where we only had the first 12 days

19
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.000
of the month.

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.800
In that case we would be very confused we wouldn't know if we're dealing with European or American American

21
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.480
format what month we're dealing with.

22
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.400
And unless we had some prior knowledge or knowledge actual knowledge about raw data said we wouldn't

23
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.270
be able to tell.

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.970
And that is the ambiguity that is conveyed or inherent in arbitrary formats of data are presenting data

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.150
like we see here.

26
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.760
So that is why there is a universal type of format.

27
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.940
And in our it is called POSIX c t.

28
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.900
So I know it's a quite a convoluted name but where does it come from and what does it mean.

29
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.690
Well first let's look at the Help for Pasic CTE and what it is.

30
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.320
So here we've got day time classes when you run the slide you get data from Klaas's.

31
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.650
Let's zoom in over here.

32
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.020
And what it says here is that description of the Klaas's products LTE.

33
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.460
So we've got POSIX local time and Pasok CTE which is calendar time and it's got some description here

34
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.250
but you can really go into a lot of detail trying to read through all of this.

35
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.160
I'll just give you a quick overview of what SETI stands for and basically how it originated.

36
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.140
So let's go to a browser and it's going to be quite interesting.

37
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.600
This is from Wikipedia.

38
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.010
Politics is the portable operating system interface.

39
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.820
It is a family of standards specified by the I.e. e computer society for maintaining compatibility between

40
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.560
operating systems.

41
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.530
So now we will read through all of this.

42
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.920
Basically what POSIX means is like it's a standard for many things so not just for dates but so that

43
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.420
when you move from one machine to another machine you're different machines will still understand the

44
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.130
code because that is important right.

45
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.080
We often have programs that work across different interfaces or different machines.

46
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.320
So that's why the IEEE and you can read more about them here came up with this POSIX family of standards

47
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.350
.

48
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.790
And one of them is a standard for time.

49
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.180
And basically what POSIX CTA does is it's a number.

50
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:38.610
Or is it measures time it stores time as the number of seconds that passed from the start of the year

51
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.900
1970.

52
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440
So basically it's just an integer.

53
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.140
This was this data type is just an integer which is exactly the number of seconds that passed from the

54
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.340
start of the year of 1970 up until today according to the UTC timezone and that's pretty much it.

55
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.490
It is presented differently so it's shown on the screen differently you'll see just now it's not shown

56
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.270
as just a huge number of seconds it's shown in a nice friendly format but that's how it's stored.

57
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.510
And that's basically the essence of pausa city.

58
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.870
So what we're going to do now is we're going to convert our data into pause ex-city from this arbitrary

59
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.850
time format.

60
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.710
So let's go ahead and do that.

61
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.620
How is this done.

62
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.780
Well first thing I want to do is we want to type in as POSIX CTO.

63
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.320
So just like we do have as character or as numeric and so on.

64
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.110
So now we want to.

65
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.800
This is our function for converting something.

66
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.860
What do we want to commit while we want to convert the still dollar sign.

67
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.790
Timestep right.

68
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.000
So this is our time Datto we want to convert it into park city and now we need to pass on the format

69
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.120
so we can't just randomly convert it right away because even the computer can tell right of by itself

70
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.060
what type of dates we're dealing with here where is the month day year.

71
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.740
Our because for I could be completely arbitrary there could be two spaces here that could be sort of

72
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.770
a call and there could be a dot here that could be seconds and so on.

73
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.190
So we have to help the computer a little bit to understand what we're dealing with.

74
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
So again say format equals and let's have a look at our data here.

75
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.920
So we have day.

76
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.190
Right.

77
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.470
So for that we're going to say percentage d like we'll do this one for this type of date format and

78
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.690
then any other date format you come across in your domiciles career you'll be able to figure it out

79
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.120
it's pretty straightforward from what you'll see just now.

80
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.490
So then we want to put the slash because that's how separate or we can see a SlideShare right there

81
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.130
we want to put in the month right.

82
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.960
So percentage M and make sure it's lowercase M then we want to put another slash and then we've got

83
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.320
a year but the year is not just two digits it's four digits.

84
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.180
That's going to the same percentage and we're going to say capital Y because it's four digits.

85
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.550
And then we put a space which represents this base and then we're going to say percentage.

86
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.350
We've got our here so we're going to say age and then we're going to say coal on percentage am I know

87
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.680
it can be a bit confusing whether to put capitals or lower case and so on.

88
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.720
So if you ever run into a bit of difficulties you can always just look it up and try to understand from

89
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.580
a few examples that you'll be able to find here and there on the Internet what exactly to specify like

90
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.450
they've got some examples here as well.

91
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.460
So it's it's never that complicated to figure out.

92
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.220
OK so we're going to run this line and that will give us a vector right.

93
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.900
So if you made a mistake like if I say if I put a lowercase y here you would get an ace.

94
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.490
So it wouldn't make a mistake if you had if you did the check.

95
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.910
So hard to make a mistake basically.

96
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.360
So if you're on that you'll see that the time has been converted AEST stands for Australian Eastern

97
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.150
Standard Time.

98
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.570
That's the time zone I'm in.

99
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.620
I'm sitting here in Brisbane while recording this video.

100
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.340
And so now we're just going to put this into a new column in our data set.

101
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.760
POSIX time we will call it.

102
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.040
All right.

103
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.970
So that's our converted date and or date time to be completely precise.

104
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.940
And now we're going to put it into our data set into a doorframe.

105
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.370
There we go.

106
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.110
And so now if I look at you till let's say look at the top couple of Varos.

107
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.150
Not until you tell.

108
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.030
There we go.

109
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.080
So what we can see here is that we've got our old time stamp and we've got our new POSIX time stamp

110
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.600
.

111
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:43.010
And let's just take a random one here you can see 20:16 0 9 0 1 0 8 0 0 or so and this one thing is

112
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.320
that it is stored as Unix time.

113
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.110
So basically all POSIX time the number of seconds that passed from 1970 up until this point in time

114
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.250
.

115
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:58.660
But also you can see that it is represented in a very friendly user friendly format.

116
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.300
So from here you can always tell that when dates are present like that you can always tell it to say

117
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.320
a year this month and this is the day.

118
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.760
And then of course our minutes seconds so there's no confusion whatsoever.

119
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.710
It's very easy to read.

120
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.090
So there we go we've converted our time.

121
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:22.120
And now if we look at summary for you till what we'll see is that even though this time was recognized

122
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.610
as a factor and you can see it's actually counting the number of records.

123
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.790
POSIX time is recognized as time.

124
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.800
So it's telling you the minimum the maximum median and so on.

125
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.850
So that pretty much all we wanted to do.

126
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.720
But finally I wanted to give you an extra tip.

127
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:44.250
So he's going to be a tip how to rearrange columns in a door frame.

128
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.480
Let's have a look at that.

129
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.320
This is handy so we want to obviously we want to get rid of this column right so let's get rid of it

130
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.030
first.

131
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.430
Util and we want to say time stamp because we don't need it anymore why would we need to tone stamps

132
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.950
just know that.

133
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:07.080
So now if we look at this line you'll see that we've got Basok stamp stamp on the rights not really

134
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.230
convenient.

135
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.710
Let's put it on the left where the old time stamp used to be how do we do that.

136
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:21.040
Well we'll say you still and will override it with a rearranged utile So all of the rows comma and then

137
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:28.390
four columns will just say pass on a vector of 4 1 to 3 so we're saying First take a fourth column this

138
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.180
one and then one two three.

139
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:38.640
So if you run that and now we look at the top couple of rows you'll see that another pause timestamp

140
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.130
is on the left.

141
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.920
So there we go.

142
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:48.270
We not only learned about PASOK city today and how to convert our time which I hope was pretty straightforward

143
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.840
you just have to help the computer a little bit with the format that your time is in and then use that

144
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.830
as puzzle city function.

145
00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:02.560
And we also learned how to rearrange columns in a doorframe just so that it's easier or more convenient

146
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.570
to work with.

147
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.270
All right so that's all for our dollar pression.

148
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.290
We are ready to proceed to lists.

149
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.230
I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

150
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.020
And until then happy coding
