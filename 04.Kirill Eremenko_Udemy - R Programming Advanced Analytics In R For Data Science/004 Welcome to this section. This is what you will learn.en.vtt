Hello and welcome back to the course of our program in this section we're talking about preparation

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.630
.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.660
So why is this session so large you probably have noticed that it's very big and it's got a lot of tutorials

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.710
.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.280
Why are we focusing on our operations so much.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.110
Well the reason for that is if you've been in the fuel analytics or does science for quite a while now

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.640
you probably know that information is by far the most tedious and time consuming task of all.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.480
And that is why this section is so large.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.190
Because Wolfers proportional to how much time we spend on the operational and actual projects which

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.300
for my experience is about 70 percent of the time spent on projects I spend on our operation.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.030
And at the same time this issue is life because we want to learn those advanced techniques to understand

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.980
how to best prepare our daughter how to be most efficient of going out to learn how to do it quicker

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.900
and learn how to streamline the process of down preparation so we spend less time there and we will

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.680
make less errors we have less room for error because we know what we are doing.

15
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.590
And also we want to investigate the potential threats that we're faced with when we prepared TARP and

16
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.050
in this session we're going to be talking a lot about locating missing data how to find it and find

17
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.650
not missing data on how to replace missing out what to do about it.

18
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.040
We also have a few methods of placing missing daughter.

19
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.420
One of the more advanced ones will be the main method and the immediate imputation method.

20
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.060
Are very powerful techniques that are used in our programming for different types of analytics.

21
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.160
So those are very important methods to know.

22
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.000
Also refresh factors.

23
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.360
And one of my favorite tutorials in this section is the factor bearable trap.

24
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.590
This is a total of about eight people that exist in our lives because the way our language structure

25
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.730
.

26
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.070
And if you don't nobody that first time you start with with factors in trying to convert different data

27
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.470
types you are very likely to fool people so it's always better to know it in advance.

28
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.380
And personally I fall into that trap lots of times and I know how it feels and how long it takes to

29
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.620
figure out where the air is.

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.290
So that's why I decided that destiny has to be included in this section.

31
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.350
So when you watch it and after that you will know how to deal with Factor variables when you're performing

32
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.860
those conversion.

33
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.930
That's what we're talking about.

34
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.870
So very exciting session ahead.

35
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.310
Lots of different tips hack's knowledge is going to be thrown at you so be prepared for the cold and

36
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.730
learn a lot of new stuff.

37
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.260
And of course lots of fun and I'll see you in the first tutorial.

38
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.740
Until then happy coding.
