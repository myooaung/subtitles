Hello and welcome back to that was of course in our programming.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.050
Congratulations on completing yet another section of this course.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.940
And today we're going to have another recap lecture just so we summarize what we covered off in this

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.570
section.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.280
Let's go straight into it.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.610
In this section we learned number one how to handle dates times in our So this section was devoted to

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.660
lists mostly.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.300
But at the same time in order to work for Dora said we had to work with a bit of daytime's and there

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
was another type of daughter preparation so we're still learning more and more about our progression

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.630
as we go on through the course.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.940
And so here we learn how to handle daytime's how to convert them into a format that is friendly for

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.970
our and friendly for us and that we can work seamlessly in our analysis.

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.910
Next we learned about the pause ex-city time we learned what it is and why it has been created what

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.130
it's used for how this time is stored.

15
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.450
And so we went into all that nitty gritty about POSIX time and hopefully that gives us now that confidence

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.310
to work with this new type of Datto or this new type of format for Time Next we learned what a list

17
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.490
is.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
Finally we got to the concept of lists we talked about lists and theory and we applied the concept in

19
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.520
practice.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.170
Specifically we learned how to work with lists we all learned how to create them.

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.150
We learned how to add components to lists how to remove components from lists how to rename components

22
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.270
and lists and pretty much everything we need to know about accessing components of lists and working

23
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.610
with lists.

24
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.990
After that we talked about the differences between the three ways you can access in this single square

25
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800
brackets that double square brackets and the dollar sign.

26
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.260
And now we should know that the single square brackets are used for subsetting lists and the double

27
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.410
square brackets are identical to the dollar sign if the list has named components and they give you

28
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.960
access to that specific one individual component in its unique format rather than as a subset of the

29
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.210
list.

30
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.650
Then we talked about subsetting lists so that's the single square brackets and then we learned how to

31
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.980
create a time series plot and there wasn't much to creating time series plots and as long as your data

32
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.270
is stored in a convenient format specifically the day times as long as they're stored nicely and Arcand

33
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.280
deal of them then is pretty much like creating a line chart and our takes care of the rest.

34
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.010
But here we had a really good hands on example of creating a time sweet spot which looked pretty good

35
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.190
.

36
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.790
So there we go.

37
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.400
Those are our top picks for this section hopefully that you're now comes off lists because you will

38
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.540
definitely need this knowledge going into the next section.

39
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.390
And there we will be applying lists all over again and you'll actually see a second way of applying

40
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.690
this so in here in this section we focused on using lists as a structure for storing data in the next

41
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.690
section you will see how lists together with certain types of functions create a very powerful tool

42
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.200
and that befouled lists.

43
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.450
That's functionality in our wouldn't have been possible so you'll see a bit of a different application

44
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.360
of lists but yet it will be even more powerful than what we saw even in this section.

45
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.950
And I look forward to seeing an external Until then happy coding.
