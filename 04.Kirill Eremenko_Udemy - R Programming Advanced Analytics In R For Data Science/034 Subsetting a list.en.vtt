00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.310
Hello and welcome back to that math course in our programming it's really great how much recovering

2
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.570
.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.340
I'm very excited how much we've already gone through in terms of lists and as you can see these tutorials

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.960
aren't as complicated.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450
It is all pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.010
After you know all those things that we do already know about doorframes and vectors and all those operations

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.760
with them lists are just a natural progression.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.930
And just to kind of reiterate the things we've talked about before we proceed with today's Tauriel I

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.100
wanted to throw a quick challenge.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.420
And so just to kind of recap on what we've learned so far we've got a list all one and here we've got

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.240
quite a few elements already on components.

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.420
So you'll notice that we've got one two three four five components.

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.620
My question to you was our challenge is how to how would you access this date.

14
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.630
So the first date in the component which is called Unknown hours.

15
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.260
So go ahead and post a video you should you should be able to do it in two different ways.

16
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.380
Pause the video and see if you can solve this challenge and access that component in two different ways

17
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.270
should take you literally a couple of seconds.

18
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.130
OK.

19
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.770
And now I'm just going to show you how to do this.

20
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.660
So quick challenge.

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.950
So the first way is to go list underscore our old one and then we know that this is the one two three

22
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.830
four four components so I would say list on Squirrel one double square brackets 4.

23
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.180
And then we want the first value of this vector so this would give us the vector.

24
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.570
This would give us the first value of the vector.

25
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.360
There we go.

26
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.820
That is the value we're after.

27
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.240
And the second way of doing this would be a list on the score or a one dollar sign.

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730
And then you've got this pop up.

29
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.130
And here we need the unknown hours.

30
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.520
So that would give us the vector and then it would say number one it might look a bit confusing at the

31
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.250
start right.

32
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.910
If you saw this before you started this section if you so construct construction like this or like this

33
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.240
it might have looked a bit confusing but now you must be totally comfortable with what's going on here

34
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.520
.

35
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.480
And that means you're keeping up with the tutorials which is great.

36
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.190
And now we're going to proceed with today's topic.

37
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.440
Subsetting lists right so let's proceed.

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.880
All right so what are we going to do.

39
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.750
Full lists.

40
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
Well this is actually going to be a very quick tutorial because we already know how to subset lists

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.470
.

42
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.780
It's interesting how we learn it but we just didn't actually outline it.

43
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.080
So here we've got our list are all one which has all those components.

44
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.060
Now remember we talked about the we've been using the double square brackets quite a lot and we've been

45
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.850
using it all same quite a lot but remember we're also talking about the single square brackets.

46
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.940
And we said that if you select an element let's say here we select let's say the first element like

47
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.730
that.

48
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.230
It won't give you back just the actual component.

49
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.970
Ill give you a list containing a component of our on this.

50
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.300
That's right I forgot to Listowel 1.

51
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.240
So are all one.

52
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.960
So if you if I were on that list are all one first component you'll see that it just gives me the first

53
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.010
component but it gives it to me in the list.

54
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.110
Well what that is telling us is that you can actually subsets you get from more than one component in

55
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.170
the square brackets you can say 1 to 2.

56
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.260
So this is a vector of 1 and 2.

57
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.370
And if I run that it'll give me a list containing two components so basically what we've just done is

58
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.960
we've subsidized all list.

59
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.920
Or we're can say one two three.

60
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.630
Right.

61
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.310
So there we go.

62
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.500
We've got a list which contains three components.

63
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.690
Another thing we can do is we can say see.

64
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.470
And let's say we want the first.

65
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.390
And what do we have what came forth.

66
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.950
And we want the timeframes right.

67
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.770
So the unknown times we want just the name of the machine and the known times when there's unknown information

68
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.970
there the that.

69
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.180
Get the machine and not we get the unknown hours.

70
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.350
Very good very good.

71
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:25.140
And another way we can do that is we could say list underscore our L-1 and we could say see and we could

72
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.890
address them by name we could say machine and let's say stats right.

73
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.350
Run that's there we go.

74
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.840
And if we go and put this in a separate list we'll say sublist are a 1 and you run that then you look

75
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.340
at sublist 1 you've got your own list and then now you can access stuff in this list.

76
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.050
You can work with it separately you can say all right I want the second element second component which

77
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.270
is the stats and in the stats I want I mean the average How do I get the average.

78
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.020
There we go.

79
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.690
That's how you get average.

80
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
Very convenient very quick.

81
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.910
And as you can imagine if you're doing some analysis and you've got this big list which we have here

82
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.680
right before that information and you don't need all that information well then just like we did with

83
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.750
the doorframe you'd subset your list you would find just what you need just subsided to those element

84
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.920
the components that you need and then you would just go ahead and work with it.

85
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.420
And moreover here you can you as you can see the names carry over so you can just go and call it by

86
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.940
name.

87
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.900
So you can say stats and second element.

88
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.320
There we go.

89
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.860
That's how you subset lists.

90
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.640
And the other thing I want to show you here is a lot of programmers are beginners and are often get

91
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.620
confused with the double square brackets in single square brackets.

92
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.270
So just be careful that double a single square brackets are four subsetting double square brackets are

93
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.460
for accessing elements of a list.

94
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:01.540
So let's have a look at that double square brackets are Noss for subsetting as have a look.

95
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.240
So here you'll see if I go a list on the score are a 1 and let's say I try to do something like this

96
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.620
right.

97
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.560
Like so I've got this line which gives me the first three components.

98
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.320
Let's say I try to do that in a double in the double square brackets.

99
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.370
You'll get an error it says recursive indexing failed at level 2.

100
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:32.190
Basically what it's saying is that you can do it because the double square brackets are designed to

101
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.210
allow you to access the compile a single component of the list.

102
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.880
So you either access this vector or this vector or this vector or or this doorframe or whatever else

103
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.210
is in your list but you can only specify one thing in the double square brackets maybe like or there's

104
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.850
no 7 of course.

105
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.140
Let's say like five right.

106
00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.050
That's going to be our doorframe or four is going to be those hours.

107
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.410
So there you go.

108
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.560
So you can only specify one thing or you can just use the dollar sign to specify that one thing that

109
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.010
your officer but you cannot specify a subset so you can go one to three because you will get an error

110
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.210
.

111
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.760
So I'm just going to comment this out so it doesn't bother us and will just say error here.

112
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.390
So be careful of that.

113
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.000
That is like the way we've covered these topics.

114
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:29.730
It should be completely intuitive that obviously the square double square brackets are practicing elements

115
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.550
or components of lists and the single square brackets are for subsetting lists.

116
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.820
However sometimes when people are just learning these topics for the first time they can get really

117
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.070
confused between the two.

118
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.100
So hopefully that's not going to be huge because now you know completely well which is which and which

119
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.760
is just for subsetting which is used for accessing components.

120
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.240
There we go.

121
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.860
That is how you submitted lists.

122
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.860
And that brings us to the end of the day Sterle have a play around with that.

123
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.180
And I look forward scenics them until then happy coding

124
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.190
.
