Hello.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.460
Welcome back to the advanced course in our programming.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.590
In the first tutorial we created our very first list as you can see it's a very interesting type of

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.590
data structure.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.160
And today we're going to learn how to name components of a list.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.900
So here we've got three components.

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.670
Right now they just have indices one two three and these double square brackets today is going to be

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.450
our transitional step in learning how to work with lists and we're going to learn how to name these

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.320
components.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.750
So let's get straight into it.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.710
All right so I'm going to just print out the list again.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.760
There we go.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.490
And now I'm going to check the names of list are all one very similar to how you check the names of

14
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.890
a named vector or how we check for a doorframe.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.980
We check call names or roll names and or from Matrix as well.

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.530
So here we're just going to use names of lists or a one if I run that you'll see that it's no.

17
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.570
Meaning that it doesn't have a name is just using the default indexation 1 to 3.

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.790
So how do we set names.

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.330
Very simple.

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.460
We just use the same function and we just assign a vector to this function.

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.820
If you aren't in the basic course we discussed this this is quite an interesting feature of our that

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.010
you can actually not only get values out of functions so you parse a parameter into a function and then

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.850
you get a result like here we did.

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.680
But you can actually also sign something to a function and then it will alter this object that you are

25
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.580
passing to it.

26
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.990
So this is what we're going to do today and we want to name these.

27
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.140
So again name them.

28
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.430
Well here we're going to call this component.

29
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.170
We're going to call it machine.

30
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.040
This component we're going to call it stat's because it contains stats.

31
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.580
And this component we're going to call low threshold because it is telling us did this machine drop

32
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.920
under that law threshold.

33
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.740
It says go ahead and do that.

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.340
So just type it up your machine stats and low threshold.

35
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.920
All right so far on that no.

36
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.300
And I look at my list of 1 you'll see that it's changed instead of the double brackets one brackets

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.830
two de-lurk three we've got a dollar sign machine or Sandstad store sign a low threshold.

38
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.000
It's already kind of giving us some hints here on how we can access these elements and it will definitely

39
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.580
talk about that in the upcoming tutorial.

40
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.270
For now I just wanted to show you another way how you could have renamed or given names to elements

41
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.550
or components of this list.

42
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.970
So let's look at another way because we want to know everything we can about our like with doorframes

43
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.250
.

44
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.960
So similar how we could do this with our friends so let's remove I-List list are all one let's completely

45
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.020
remove it.

46
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.080
So if I check it now you'll see that we don't have that list anymore.

47
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.270
And what we want to do is we want to take a list of one so basically we want to just take this line

48
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.310
here that we had when we created the list.

49
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.590
And here as we created we can give names to the components so we can say machine.

50
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.900
And here you won't need the quotation marks so orwill Nunda will understand that this is the name of

51
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.580
the component stats and low threshold.

52
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:37.170
So if I run this now and I look at list are and 1 you'll see that it was already created with the correct

53
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.410
names.

54
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.650
So that's a great great easy little trick to save you some space.

55
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.370
Basically so and some coding so instead of just creating lists first and then assigning the names to

56
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.460
the components of the list you can assign the names of the components right away as creating a list

57
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.940
.

58
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.950
Now the question is of course why do we need these name named components.

59
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.680
Why why would somebody assign names to a component.

60
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.600
Well we'll see how handy this is how.

61
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.590
How much more convenient working with Lisp becomes when they have named components we'll see that in

62
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.730
the upcoming tutorials.

63
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.040
And that's all for today.

64
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.710
We had quite a quick tutorial.

65
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.080
Have a play around with that maybe try giving them some different names see see how you go that will

66
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.410
create a list of your own and see if you can create a named list right away.

67
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.600
And I look for in the next tutorial.

68
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.120
Until then happy coding
