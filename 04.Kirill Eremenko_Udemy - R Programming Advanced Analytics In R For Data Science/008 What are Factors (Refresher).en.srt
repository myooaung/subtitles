00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,930
Hello.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:12,510
Welcome back to the advanced course on our programming in the studio we loaded up our data set into

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,700
our studio so we can see this line here.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,110
And we had a look at the different snapshots of our daughter so we looked at the top rows we looked

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,960
at the bottom rows we saw that there was indeed 500 rows we saw what columns we have there we looked

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,050
at the structural dataset and we looked at the summary.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,550
Now from the structure we noticed that there's quite a lot of factors that have been recognized in our

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,640
data and that's why today we're going to talk about factors.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,670
We're going to refresh on the nausea factors.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,160
We're going to find out what they are and how to deal with them in our.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,420
So it's going to be a quick recap and I think it's going to be useful because further down in the section

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,330
we're going to be dealing quite a lot with factors.

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,530
All right so what is a factor and why is our recognizing some of these variables as factors Well if

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,370
factor is basically a categorical variable in our.

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Now let's look at one of these as an example.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,870
Industry for instance right.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,990
It's a factor with eight levels.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,350
And if we go down here to the summary we'll see that there's I.T. services health software financial

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,150
services construction government and that makes six.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,390
So there's two more here.

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,200
And one of them is an empty category so the empty carrier that we see here as well.

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,040
So here you have a few examples you've got empty categories and example in construction and then there's

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,610
more.

24
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,690
And then you've got these numbers Well these numbers are the identifiers that are assigned to each one

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,670
of the categories.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,940
For instance the empty category has been assigned identifier of.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,860
And construction has been assigned the identifier of six.

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,180
And that's basically how our deals with these categorical variables because it is a programming language

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,500
and all happens in your computer for our.

30
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,020
It's just easier to deal with numbers rather than with words.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,420
For us humans is easier to deal of words like construction I.T. services health and so far is just easier

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,830
to deal with numbers.

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,370
And this is going to be an important point that is going to come up again.

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,730
And one of the future tutorials so just remember that our dogs deal with factors in a numerical sense

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:26,790
rather than in a word a sense or character sense and the way our picks up factors is if our cannot recognize

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,620
it as an integer or as other type of number or a boolean variable some kind of a variable that has meaning

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,410
to it then are just recognize it as a category as a category.

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,670
And most commonly that happens with words with characters because for instance here we've got names

39
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,720
of companies right.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,080
So we've got all the names of companies and our has also recognized that is a factor a factor a variable

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,430
with 500 levels because every single name is unique in our data set and therefore it's created this

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,480
factor variable which doesn't really bother us that's just how are is going to deal if it's going to

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,090
treat as a categorical variable if we wanted to we could change it back into a character because ultimately

44
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,040
it's not really a category it's just the names of the companies.

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:20,420
Then if we go down we find something interesting so inception is the year when the companies were created

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,290
and here are has recognized that as an integer and same thing id so IDs identifier of the row and R

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,400
has recognized it as an integer.

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,220
Now if we really think about that do we really want ID to be an integer.

49
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,250
Do we really need a minimum do we need a median a maximum or are we going to performers arithmetic rip

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,200
operations with this variable.

51
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:50,520
No it's just a numeric variable that is assigned to our rows and we don't want to perform an energetic

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
operation.

53
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,150
So it could it probably is better if it's recognized as a factor and that will be less confusing to

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,820
us.

55
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,820
And same thing for Inception.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,550
We're definitely not going to add these years are not going to subtract any of these years for us it's

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,940
just going to be more convenient if we see this variable as a factor.

58
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,280
So those are two examples of when a variable is not recognized as a factor by our.

59
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,550
But we wanted to be recognized as a factor.

60
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,270
Now another example here that you'll see is an example of the opposite.

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,570
So here we see a state is OK as a factor series.

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,980
Okay.

63
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,270
And then we see revenues recognize the factor and expenses are wickednesses affection and same thing

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,150
for Grof.

65
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,690
So while profit is recognized as an actual number these three are not.

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,810
And let's have a look at why this is happening.

67
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,690
Well this is happening because for instance in revenue we've got this dollar sign and we've got these

68
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,210
comma's which are cannot convert into a number it doesn't know that this is the numbers recognizing

69
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,560
it as a character and then converting it to factual and then expenses.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,450
Same thing we've got the commerce we've got the space and we've got the word dollars and that is preventing

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,070
our from recognizing this verbal as an actual number.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,620
And finally in growth we've got when do we have we have this percentage sign which is preventing our

73
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,840
from recognizing this as a number.

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,540
So that's an example of when something is recognized as a factor but in reality it should be numeric

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:15,780
.

76
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,250
And that is also something that we're going to need to fix up.

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,720
So in this tutorial we're actually just going to correct the first thing because it is actually very

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,790
easy to change something from a non-factor to a factor so let's go ahead and do that.

79
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,820
So here we're going to say changing from non factor to factor.

80
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,940
Let's have a look at how we do that.

81
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:46,950
So here we've got a variable or a column which is a thin dollar idea and that gives us access to the

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,670
ID column.

83
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,700
So as you can see there it is as a vector.

84
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:57,430
And now we're going to turn to factor just use the factor function and put it around you ID.

85
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,180
We run that.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,030
Now you can see that same thing.

87
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,890
This is the vector for that column but at the end it actually has levels and as we said levels is a

88
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,660
give away for factors.

89
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,030
And now we're just going to override the ID with our variable over here.

90
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,100
So our new factory airball.

91
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,440
So now if we look at a summary or fin you will see that ID is also recognizes factor and we can confirm

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,640
that by looking at S-G or for in.

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,800
So here you can see that now it is also a factor.

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,140
So let's go ahead and do the same for Inception.

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,500
So we're going to say in dollar sign in ception is going to be overridden by a factor of when a dollar

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,800
sign inception around that.

97
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,890
And we look at those go to Estuardo way here you'll see that Inception is now a factor.

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,550
So it's as easy as that.

99
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,450
And if we look at the summary so just copy this way here.

100
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,380
So here you can see that if your conception now it's on giving you the minimum the maximum the median

101
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,450
and so on is just giving you the categories that you have and you can actually tell that there's 93

102
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,240
companies that were started in 2011 83 in 2010 18 2012 and so on and so it's much more committed like

103
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,790
this and not confusing.

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,770
And moreover it will be it will allow us to categorize the companies by the year of their foundation

105
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,150
.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,110
So there we go that's what factors are and how to convert and non-fact into our factor.

107
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,220
Moving forward we'll talk about some other interesting aspects of dealing with factors.

108
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,020
And I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

109
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,900
Until then happy coding
