00:02.320 --> 00:08.160
There is another place where we all want to work with a and that allows us to edit the posts.

00:08.470 --> 00:15.610
And that is here under admen dynamic post ID here I want to read and edit posts and that of course means

00:15.850 --> 00:19.350
I can simply load the post into my post for him.

00:19.600 --> 00:27.160
So in that component here all create a template with some depth that could be admen post page so that

00:27.160 --> 00:29.100
could be to see us as colossi I mean.

00:29.530 --> 00:36.590
And now I want to have my update for him in there so I will add a section which says update for him

00:37.170 --> 00:43.260
and in there I want to basically have the same form as in the new post component and page.

00:43.480 --> 00:48.370
I just want to maybe change the caption of the save button but even that would be optional.

00:48.370 --> 00:54.090
One big difference of course is that I want to load a post into the forum which should be edited but

00:54.100 --> 00:55.910
there are ways to achieve this.

00:56.050 --> 01:04.630
So let's create a new component the components folder maybe under a new folder named admen where admin

01:04.660 --> 01:07.960
related components should go in there.

01:07.990 --> 01:13.590
I will add the admin host forum view file.

01:13.600 --> 01:21.580
The name is up to you as always but in this file I want to store this form code we created in the last

01:21.580 --> 01:22.410
lecture.

01:22.720 --> 01:29.290
So I'll add a template here and now I will just go to the index that you file in the new post folder

01:29.680 --> 01:32.470
and grab the anti-reform from there.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.060
Cut it out and now move it into the admin.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.510
Post forum template.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.560
Just like that.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.500
Now of course we all need to bring the methods that handle saving and cancelling.

01:44.630 --> 01:47.580
So let's go back to the index that you follow.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.920
We will also WIPs this one.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.610
We will also need the imports.

01:51.680 --> 02:00.500
So essentially I can't just copy the entire script section from the index file to my admin post form

02:00.890 --> 02:03.910
just like that here.

02:03.970 --> 02:09.790
With that we can go back to the index that you found in your post file and adjust our imports.

02:09.790 --> 02:14.950
We only need one import which now points to admin post form.

02:14.950 --> 02:21.020
So to add a new component we just create it which you can find under admin admin post form.

02:21.130 --> 02:27.250
So the Potthast components admin and then admin Post forum.

02:27.300 --> 02:34.250
I only need to register this in my components here then and I actually don't need the data anymore for

02:34.250 --> 02:37.660
now so I'll get rid of my data property here.

02:38.490 --> 02:45.800
I also don't need the methods in this file anymore at least not right now because we are having them

02:45.800 --> 02:53.660
in the admin post him and now I can just include admin post form like this with this change in place

02:53.680 --> 03:02.110
we can go to the dynamic route admin post ID where I also want to use that add a script section so that

03:02.110 --> 03:12.210
I can import add and post form from at component's admin admin post form and just it here in the components

03:12.220 --> 03:13.630
property object.

03:13.870 --> 03:20.840
So here and now just included in this section admin host forum.

03:21.020 --> 03:28.730
Just like get now as I said the one difference will be that we're here we want to load a post into this

03:28.730 --> 03:35.720
forum so therefore I'll actually add my data method to this view component here.

03:35.930 --> 03:42.620
Data return an object and then there let's say we have a loaded post and we will later of course all

03:42.620 --> 03:44.960
the dynamically fetched it from a server.

03:45.350 --> 03:55.130
Now that loaded post should be the post one that will edit and for that let's provide a javascript object

03:55.760 --> 03:58.550
where we have an offer all enter my name here.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.910
Feel free to use yours of course.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.470
A title like my awesome post.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.460
The content which is super amazing.

04:09.670 --> 04:13.530
Thanks for that.

04:13.690 --> 04:21.630
And then the thumbnail link which can be the default link we use and all the other pages too.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.990
So which we can find in our posts list.

04:23.990 --> 04:27.360
Therefore of course you can pick a different link though.

04:27.580 --> 04:33.520
So I will enter this as a thumbnail link so in the string here and with that we get a loaded post.

04:33.550 --> 04:39.140
Now the admin post for our reuseable form component should simply accept this.

04:39.160 --> 04:45.370
So to do that I'll bind a post property year to my loaded post.

04:45.430 --> 04:50.120
That of course requires some adjustments in the admin post for him because by default it doesn't except

04:50.120 --> 04:52.150
as it doesn't know what to do with that.

04:52.620 --> 04:57.200
So let's go to the admin Post forum here and in there.

04:57.220 --> 05:07.140
Let's now accept some props so I will go to my javascript object here and add my props key so that I

05:07.140 --> 05:10.010
can register props we can work with.

05:10.260 --> 05:20.870
And there it could have my post object where to type shouldn't b object which is not required though.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.600
And therefore set to False.

05:25.620 --> 05:31.110
Now the only thing I want to do is I want to initialize my data with that post object.

05:31.130 --> 05:35.770
You might get from the outside we might get if it is available.

05:35.940 --> 05:40.230
So edit that post will actually check if this post is true ish.

05:40.230 --> 05:48.510
So if it is a stair if it is an object in which case I want to create a new object which is based on

05:48.510 --> 05:54.840
the incoming object and for that I can use the spread operator which will just pull out all the properties

05:54.930 --> 06:00.430
of the bound posts of the object we're receiving and pass them into a new object.

06:00.930 --> 06:06.950
Otherwise I will bind this to a default object which can be the default object we had before.

06:07.080 --> 06:15.300
So let's restructure just as DLC case after the colon the case if we have a post is that I pull it out

06:15.480 --> 06:19.350
like this is to spread operator and does it just using a ternary expression.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.620
Where does our conditionally check.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.870
This is the case or the code we execute if the condition is true.

06:24.900 --> 06:32.430
So if we got a post and if we got in on then we'll initialize everything with this default object now

06:32.430 --> 06:33.940
with that in place.

06:34.200 --> 06:38.450
Let's go back to our application to the admin area.

06:38.820 --> 06:45.510
Let's create a post nice and that's now ensured that we all can edit up posts by clicking on it.

06:45.510 --> 06:53.080
The problem cestus right now if we click on a post we go to the single post page for every user.

06:53.160 --> 07:00.090
Now we need to go to admin slash post ID if we are the admin and we can simply enable this by going

07:00.090 --> 07:05.570
to post list to the post list component in the posts folder in the components folder.

07:05.760 --> 07:14.850
And by adding a property here so prop's is admin would be a fitting name and here the type is a Boolean

07:14.910 --> 07:18.880
because it should be true or false and the default is false.

07:19.110 --> 07:23.830
If it is true however so if we set this then I want to adjust my links.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.460
Now the links are not in this component but in the post preview component.

07:27.630 --> 07:31.420
So what I will do is I will simply pass this information down.

07:31.470 --> 07:34.180
I'll add is admen equal to is admen.

07:34.320 --> 07:39.300
And if you're wondering where this dash is coming from this is an alternative syntax if you automatic

07:39.300 --> 07:40.290
The gives you.

07:40.350 --> 07:46.500
If your property is is admen in camel case you can also binded by adding a dash between the different

07:46.500 --> 07:49.450
words and it is recommended that you use this approach.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.920
That is what you find in the official you style guide.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.900
But back to what we're doing.

07:53.970 --> 08:02.100
I'm just passing down the admin information to post preview so I will also add it as a prop here is

08:02.300 --> 08:04.880
admen although it is a Boolean here.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.570
And here it actually is required.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.540
We can require it here.

08:10.940 --> 08:16.430
Let's set this to true true because we're always passing information from the post list because we have

08:16.430 --> 08:18.660
a default value there which is false.

08:19.130 --> 08:25.760
So post preview gets the information and now that adjusts our link here I will calculate the link with

08:25.760 --> 08:33.380
the computed property so I will add computed the normal view computed property feature and dare I want

08:33.380 --> 08:39.980
to have my post the link computed property which returns the link want to go to and here I check if

08:39.980 --> 08:47.170
this is admen is true in which case we return slash adman's slash dis ID.

08:47.460 --> 08:56.480
Otherwise return slash posts plus this ID and post link is what it will now use in my template.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.270
Here in the tool section.

08:59.270 --> 09:08.320
With that if we save everything we can go back to our admin index page where we have that list of posts

09:08.760 --> 09:13.100
and they simply pass is admen like this which will set it to true.

09:13.570 --> 09:20.830
Now if I save this and reload my admin posts list and I click on a post we actually go to the post form

09:21.100 --> 09:24.220
with the posts pre-filled into it.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.470
If I'm on the block though and I click on a post I'm only single block post page and not in the admin

09:29.470 --> 09:37.420
area so that is already a great improvement with that all I want to do is just add some styling to my

09:37.420 --> 09:45.230
new post and my edit posts so the post ID pages by adding the style section and scoping it and then

09:45.230 --> 09:48.130
in there in the new post in the fall.

09:48.160 --> 09:54.910
I provided two styles attached to this with you which you can add these here and then in the post ID

09:55.120 --> 09:56.510
page here.

09:56.590 --> 10:01.990
I also provide certain styles you can add this style block here.

10:01.990 --> 10:08.620
Now all that does is really restrict the width so that if we added a post this looks nicer now here.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.200
And with that we're almost done.

10:11.200 --> 10:16.130
There is more we can do though especially here in the admin area.

10:16.330 --> 10:18.760
Let's take a closer look at what this is in the next lecture.
