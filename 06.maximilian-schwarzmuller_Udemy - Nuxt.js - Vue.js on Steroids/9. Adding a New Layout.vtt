We have to look at pages pages our view components which can have some special properties as you learn.

00:08.950 --> 00:14.140
We only learned about the belly Deshaun property as of yet but we'll learn about more from the scores

00:14.560 --> 00:18.100
and pages are loaded on the entire screen.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.680
Basically One road leads to one page being loaded or even multiple pages.

00:23.740 --> 00:27.160
If you're using the nested approach now.

00:27.190 --> 00:32.920
Besides pages we got the debt layout which provides the application frame as I said.

00:33.340 --> 00:39.940
Now we can see that in the layouts folder there is a default dot view file and the file name is important.

00:39.940 --> 00:47.390
If this file exists it is used as a default for all the other pages and it should exist if we expect.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.960
We see it's pretty empty.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.500
We got a div and then interesting.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.560
We get this next component in here.

00:54.610 --> 01:00.160
Now this is of course a component provided by the next framework and it essentially means this is the

01:00.160 --> 01:04.420
place where the different pages should be loaded in.

01:04.420 --> 01:08.910
Now then we get a style section here because it's a normal single file view component.

01:08.920 --> 01:14.920
In the end and can be used as such and this is no scoped style as you can see therefore this simply

01:14.920 --> 01:18.130
is the default style for our entire application.

01:18.550 --> 01:21.460
And there are different places where you could put it.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.670
And of course you can still style your individual components differently.

01:25.810 --> 01:33.580
But for an application wide style it's indeed recommended to use the default layout which is well a

01:33.580 --> 01:35.520
great place for such styles.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.920
There are other places though and that will show that later in the course.

01:39.940 --> 01:43.760
Now let me remove that entire style and then save everything.

01:44.020 --> 01:48.100
And this instantly shows you a difference the font changed.

01:48.260 --> 01:52.240
Now this is because I removed the style here.

01:52.240 --> 01:59.470
Now that is how we use a layout we could add a second layout if we only wanted to use it on some pages

01:59.620 --> 02:02.410
like for example users view.

02:02.950 --> 02:08.320
Then we could copy the default layouts set up here and to see a difference.

02:08.470 --> 02:15.900
We could add a header at the top where we simply say users section.

02:16.030 --> 02:22.720
Now to use dad lay out instead of the default one we go to the page is where we want to use it like

02:22.720 --> 02:31.130
for Slash users and all to 40 users view file and they're in the script section in that object.

02:31.210 --> 02:38.080
We add a number of special property which is understood by next not by view but by next and that special

02:38.080 --> 02:39.040
property.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.760
Now is the layout property.

02:41.980 --> 02:46.820
And there you simply pass a string like users without the dot view.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.690
And this will now look for a user that you file in the layouts folder and if it finds it it will use

02:52.750 --> 02:55.120
this instead of the default one.

02:55.420 --> 03:01.490
So we can copy this and copy it to our indexed or you fall in the Users folder.

03:01.510 --> 03:10.440
So let's add it here to and let's add that same logic to the index that you fall in this ID folder here.

03:10.500 --> 03:16.420
So in the nested folder for a dynamic parameter there I'll add layout users.

03:16.680 --> 03:25.950
If we save dat and we reload the page we see user section at the top of slash users one as well as just

03:25.950 --> 03:27.110
slash users.

03:27.300 --> 03:34.040
If we go back to the main page however we don't see it because there we did sign that layout and instead

03:34.200 --> 03:36.350
the default one is used.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.470
So this is how that all works you can have multiple layouts in a lot of apps.

03:40.470 --> 03:47.160
You only have one though I will say that and this allows you to create a frame around all your pages

03:47.160 --> 03:50.340
or some of your pages whatever your set up is.
