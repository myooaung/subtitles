00:02.230 --> 00:08.930
Now to learn about middleware let's use it in a practical use case let's implement authentication with

00:08.930 --> 00:16.660
this help we already got a firebase project in the back end and firebase offers all indication capabilities.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.270
So user creation path for validation.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.260
These are all features built into firebase.

00:22.360 --> 00:29.270
All you need to do is go to the often taxation area here and set up a sign in method hearable choose

00:29.300 --> 00:35.280
email password which basically stores users in our firebase account with that enabled.

00:35.290 --> 00:39.420
We can start implementing often dictation in our application.

00:39.460 --> 00:46.180
Now we already got a router it that the offer out there we have it email and password field and we have

00:46.180 --> 00:48.730
a button that allows us to submit the form.

00:48.730 --> 00:53.440
Right now we're not submitting the form and we can change this and we do store the information whether

00:53.440 --> 00:59.920
we are in log in or sign up mode so we can also take this into account to take appropriate action.

00:59.950 --> 01:06.690
So let's now implement sign up for firebase and we could use the firebase SDK for that.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.290
But I want to show you a reusable approach.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.420
So we will use the rest API for firebase self indication.

01:13.420 --> 01:19.310
You can simply google for firebase all the rest API and you find you firebase off rest.

01:19.330 --> 01:25.630
API docs now in these thoughts you find all kinds of operations you can do with the rest API including

01:25.630 --> 01:29.510
sign up with email and password which is just what we need right now.

01:29.770 --> 01:33.420
So this is you are all we need to send our request to.

01:33.550 --> 01:34.770
So let's do that.

01:34.780 --> 01:35.730
Let's copy that.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.810
You are L and let's go back to our index.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.020
W fall in the off section here.

01:42.070 --> 01:45.280
I want to handle the form submission when we click that button.

01:45.430 --> 01:49.160
So I will add a listener to the overall form element.

01:49.300 --> 01:55.150
Submit listener and I will use the preven modifier to prevent the default which would be to immediately

01:55.150 --> 01:57.400
send HTP request to the server.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.020
This page is coming from.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.630
Which is not what I want to do.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.770
So instead you're all handler.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.010
Execute my own set method and this method therefore of course needs to be added.

02:09.070 --> 02:12.700
So I'll add the methods key on submit like this.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.900
And in this method I now want to send D.H. to the request.

02:15.910 --> 02:22.590
I can use this dollar sign ex-U.S. for it is using this ex-U.S. module we added in the last core section

02:23.080 --> 02:26.470
and there we want to send a dollar sign post request.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.930
We need to send a post request to this endpoint.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.570
As you can see here in the documentation.

02:31.810 --> 02:35.520
So we need to send a post request to diss you l.

02:35.650 --> 02:36.580
Now there it is.

02:36.610 --> 02:41.200
AP Ickey part which we need to replace with our API key.

02:41.200 --> 02:47.440
You can get it from your firebase project console simply by clicking on the web set up in the off indication

02:47.440 --> 02:48.330
area.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.950
Now you don't need to copy all of that.

02:50.110 --> 02:51.990
But here is your API key.

02:52.120 --> 02:59.110
So grab it and once you've got it replace this API key thing here including the square brackets with

02:59.110 --> 03:01.040
your actual API key.

03:01.090 --> 03:08.250
You could also remove it from there and go to the next conflict to add an environment variable here.

03:08.350 --> 03:16.470
So here you could enter FP API key and store your string here.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.240
With that you could access this environment variable in your code.

03:20.410 --> 03:28.120
So in the off indexed you fall here we could simply append process and FBA API Ickey and now we have

03:28.120 --> 03:32.170
only one place in our app where we need to change it if it ever changes.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.860
So with this we're sending a post request.

03:35.050 --> 03:37.850
But of course we need to attach some data to this post request.

03:37.870 --> 03:42.690
So we need to pass a second argument if we have a look at the documentation of that rest.

03:42.700 --> 03:50.110
API endpoint we see that we need to send email password and does return secure token field which should

03:50.110 --> 03:51.490
always be true.

03:51.970 --> 04:01.490
So let's send such object in our project you're all send a javascript object with the email field with

04:01.490 --> 04:03.060
the password field.

04:03.080 --> 04:08.150
And with that return secure token field which should be set to true.

04:08.570 --> 04:13.770
Now the e-mail is something we can of course get from our input here.

04:13.940 --> 04:20.030
Therefore I need to set up to a binding with we model and I will bind to e-mail and I'll do the same

04:20.030 --> 04:21.020
for password.

04:21.030 --> 04:24.030
The model equals password.

04:24.050 --> 04:29.510
Now these are two properties I don't have yet but I do have a data property so in there I will simply

04:29.510 --> 04:34.430
add an email which has an empty string initially and a password property that holds an empty string.

04:34.700 --> 04:39.860
And now we get these two properties in our component from which we can pull the values we want to send.

04:39.860 --> 04:42.610
So this email is what I'll send an email.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.980
This password is what I want to send as a password.

04:46.190 --> 04:48.500
Well that we get an onset method.

04:48.500 --> 04:54.790
Now let's also add a then look to see any new result we get and see if it worked.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.540
So here I will simply console lock result.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.290
And let's also catch any errors we might get here an error.

05:04.300 --> 05:08.370
I also want to console Lochend dead.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.770
If we get it so let's save this and go back to our project here.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.510
We'll navigate to the admin area.

05:16.810 --> 05:20.700
And for now I manually need to go to the off page.

05:20.740 --> 05:25.830
We will change this with middleware soon and we will automatically redirect the user to this page.

05:25.870 --> 05:32.020
If he's not offended I hate it let's for now ignore if we switch to sign up or not because we haven't

05:32.050 --> 05:38.170
hooked this up and let's simply enter the e-mail address here and some password and let's hit log in.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.860
And does this looking good.

05:40.900 --> 05:48.120
We're getting back a response that doesn't look like an error which has this strange token because remember

05:48.180 --> 05:54.760
since we're still building a single page application that just is pre-rendered on the server.

05:55.020 --> 06:00.390
Since we're still building this we typically use this JWT token approach.

06:00.390 --> 06:05.970
So does Jason Webb token authentication approach where we get back such a token that we should store

06:06.240 --> 06:11.330
and where we then send this token with future off indication requests.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.650
And if this whole procedure is unclear.

06:13.650 --> 06:14.880
Check out my complete view.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.660
Course I do dive into this in detail there.

06:18.660 --> 06:21.290
So this is essentially a token we should store it.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.310
Now we will do so in a second.

06:23.310 --> 06:30.000
For now let's first go back to our firebase project here and refreshed that users page and that's looking

06:30.000 --> 06:30.710
good.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.510
So indeed we successfully created a user.

06:33.810 --> 06:40.370
Our next two DUIs are to ensure that we only submit this request if we are in sign up mode.

06:40.380 --> 06:45.050
Right now we're ignoring this and to store a token we get back.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.630
Let's work on that in the next lecture.
