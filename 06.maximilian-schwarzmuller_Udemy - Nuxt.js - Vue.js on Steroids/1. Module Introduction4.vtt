00:02.220 --> 00:08.750
OK let's dive into our a course project and let's build a complete blog with next.

00:08.770 --> 00:12.230
S. and therefore also with the U.K.'s behind the scenes.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.170
This will be a project which we gradually extend throughout the course and where we add more and more

00:17.170 --> 00:18.650
features as we learn them.

00:18.730 --> 00:25.300
And it's therefore a great opportunity for you to see what you learned in kind of theory in the previous

00:25.300 --> 00:28.960
module in action and to practice these things.

00:28.990 --> 00:35.910
Now I created a brand new next project year with the Create next app seal.

00:36.020 --> 00:44.770
I used Norne as a server side framework template so I just use next on its own no UI package just the

00:44.770 --> 00:47.450
settings you saw at the beginning of the course.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.680
I therefore have that default folder with the index page with the default starting content and I started

00:53.710 --> 00:55.000
my development server.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.920
Well to see that page here.

00:57.040 --> 00:57.860
Awesome.

00:58.210 --> 01:05.110
Now lets add a bunch of pages and components and layouts and stuff like that to turn this into a more

01:05.110 --> 01:10.870
beautiful blog like page which we then can extend with more features from the course.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.410
Lets start.
