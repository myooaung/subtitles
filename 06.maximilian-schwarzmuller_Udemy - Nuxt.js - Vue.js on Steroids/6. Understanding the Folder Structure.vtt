WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:09.150
So heres the project opened in Microsoft Visual Studio code which is Microsoft's Web development I-T

00:09.420 --> 00:15.480
which I can strongly recommend for future US development and attached to this video you find at PBF.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.260
With my configuration and all the some alternatives.

00:18.660 --> 00:25.770
And this is what next created us or what create next gave us a folder a project with a lot of folders

00:25.770 --> 00:32.650
and files so let's walk through that quickly and let's see what leads to this screen here.

00:33.090 --> 00:37.440
Now I will give details about all these folders later in this course.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.260
Assets essentially is for storing images and so on which will be then handled through web Pech the build

00:43.260 --> 00:47.830
tool behind the scenes so that the images are optimized a bit and so on.

00:48.010 --> 00:53.850
Component's is where you create ordinary components to use your app layouts as some Masroor layouts

00:53.850 --> 00:58.890
which you can use as frames and I will dive deeper into that whole layouts components and how they relate

00:58.980 --> 01:05.280
thing middleware is which is some middleware you can add to run whenever a user wizard to a certain

01:05.280 --> 01:10.920
page will also have a look at this later when we talk about authentication pages is the heart of this

01:10.920 --> 01:13.450
folder and it will come back to it in a second.

01:13.500 --> 01:20.700
Plug ins is important to add some shared functionality in your next app and this will become clearer

01:20.790 --> 01:23.040
later also and that's ignored for now.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.920
Static can be used to store some static assets which unlike the things you store in assets should not

01:28.920 --> 01:32.530
be handled by well-packed so should not be optimized by.

01:32.550 --> 01:36.360
And so on store can be used to add a view x.

01:36.360 --> 01:42.060
Stuart your next project also something we'll have a look at in a separate module and then some conflict

01:42.060 --> 01:47.170
falls regarding debt and so on but also most important about next.

01:47.190 --> 01:53.910
Now we will revisit this fall in detail later in this fall we see which kind of nextstep we're getting.

01:54.090 --> 01:59.820
We have this strange thing which will become important for rendering appropriate meta tags on each page

02:00.480 --> 02:02.480
and we can set up a couple of other things.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.640
Again we'll dive into this detail later.

02:04.650 --> 02:08.430
Now is that that sentence a lot but we have old course right.

02:08.430 --> 02:11.510
So let's instead focus on what we see on the screen here.

02:11.630 --> 02:15.650
And the important folder for this is the pages folder.

02:15.660 --> 02:22.110
One important thing I can already say you too is that as I said on an earlier slide next is all about

02:22.110 --> 02:25.630
configuring the project through folders and files.

02:25.680 --> 02:31.500
You have one conflict file that you mostly set everything up by naming your folders and files correctly

02:31.740 --> 02:34.260
so the folder names your all are set.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.570
You can't change them.

02:35.940 --> 02:43.790
And there's one rule next simply follows files in Paychex have to be new components single file components.

02:43.800 --> 02:49.810
As of this year for the index that you file and will then be interpreted as routes as you are.

02:49.810 --> 02:52.530
Else you can visit if you have indexed a view here.

02:52.530 --> 02:58.770
This simply means if you just enter localhost slash nothing this page this component will be rendered

02:58.770 --> 03:00.570
to the screen behind the scenes.

03:00.570 --> 03:05.330
This uses your router but it sets everything up with your router for you.

03:05.460 --> 03:09.170
And we'll dive much deeper into this in the next course module already.

03:09.270 --> 03:15.090
But here this is essentially what we see on the screen a single file view component with a template

03:15.090 --> 03:20.400
where we render some HMO code and where we even use some Ivory's you component which we can include

03:20.400 --> 03:20.840
here.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.440
Again more on this later.

03:22.620 --> 03:30.690
And then some styling and therefore if we go here and remove this defeater and simply say hello I am

03:31.050 --> 03:31.720
first.

03:31.830 --> 03:39.370
You next app and we save that and you still have that process running.

03:39.370 --> 03:45.250
It will automatically watch these changes and pre-rendered your page even Hawtry load the page so that

03:45.250 --> 03:49.360
if you go back to localhost 3000 you just see that.

03:49.630 --> 03:56.720
And this is one Clor take away this page for one is rendered on this node server that's running.

03:56.740 --> 04:02.360
We don't see that but that is happening and that is something we can confirm if we reload this app or

04:02.380 --> 04:04.290
simply.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.600
And then we inspect the source code.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.380
We can see that we see in the source code what we see on the page Hello I'm a first you accept it's

04:13.380 --> 04:18.360
part of the source code and if you inspect the normal views single page application which you create

04:18.360 --> 04:24.180
without next and you have a look at the source code you won't just see some hook here like a root def

04:24.530 --> 04:27.450
where you will then render everything in the client.

04:27.450 --> 04:30.010
Now here it's already coming like this from the server.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.030
So this is the first important take away.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.320
This is really pre-rendered on the server.

04:34.560 --> 04:40.590
The second important takeaway is that we configure everything from folders and files like the routing.

04:40.620 --> 04:44.440
We simply add files to pages we can add a number route.

04:44.520 --> 04:53.270
Users dot view and simply add a template in there where we say this is the user's page nothing else

04:53.280 --> 04:56.220
don't even add a script sections onto this file.

04:56.220 --> 05:03.170
And now with the additional Justice File we can go back and simply enter slash users behind localhost

05:03.290 --> 05:10.260
3000 and you should see this page or reload once if you don't see it immediately does then simply related

05:10.260 --> 05:16.650
to the configuration not updating immediately on the def sir but this is deep principle by which it

05:16.650 --> 05:21.340
works every file here in pages is interpreted as a route.

05:21.450 --> 05:26.430
Nerves a bit more to it and you can also add dynamic route parameters but that's something we'll dive

05:26.430 --> 05:28.170
in in the next module.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.920
This however is how next works easier.

05:30.930 --> 05:35.540
View development by using folders files and server side pre-rendered the.
