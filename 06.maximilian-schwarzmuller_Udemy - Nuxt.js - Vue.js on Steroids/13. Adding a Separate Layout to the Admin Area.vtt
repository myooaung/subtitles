00:02.070 --> 00:06.550
So let's finish the admin area by adding a separate layout for it.

00:06.630 --> 00:08.730
We only get the default layout this far.

00:08.730 --> 00:09.540
Now I will add.

00:09.550 --> 00:16.560
Edmund dot view fall here because I want to have my admin layout I will for that just copy the content

00:16.560 --> 00:22.830
of the default that you fall added in here but remove the site nav and header because let's say we don't

00:22.830 --> 00:24.800
want to have that in the admin area.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.870
I will therefore get rid of the entire scripts section because I don't need it but I want to keep my

00:30.870 --> 00:31.760
styles here.

00:31.830 --> 00:38.450
My application wide Stahl's with that we just need to assign this to our admin pages.

00:38.500 --> 00:46.860
So let's go to these pages and on each of them let's add layout and set it to admin and you need to

00:46.860 --> 00:55.590
do that on a per page level because next by default thankfully assumes that you use the default layout

00:55.880 --> 01:00.680
so therefore you should add it manually whenever you want to deviate from that.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.010
So let me quickly finish that here.

01:04.270 --> 01:05.810
And with that adjust it.

01:05.830 --> 01:08.430
You'll see on the admin area.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.940
I can still use my admin features but the header is gone.

01:12.980 --> 01:18.760
Now of course you could implement a different one or at the old one but I want it to show that it is

01:18.760 --> 01:19.560
gone.

01:19.570 --> 01:24.190
Of course if I go back to adjust the starting page here it is again.

01:24.190 --> 01:27.840
And if we switch on log and bowed it stays there.

01:27.910 --> 01:33.850
It's just the admin area which uses a different layout now and what we're talking about layouts let's

01:33.940 --> 01:36.890
also add an error page shall we.

01:37.240 --> 01:44.380
So on the layouts folder in there let's add this error dot you fall which has to be named like this.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.510
Otherwise it won't work here.

01:46.570 --> 01:49.710
I also prepared some code which you can find attached to the video.

01:49.820 --> 01:55.820
It's just some HTL code where we output a message and then provide a link back to the starting page.

01:55.840 --> 02:03.610
Important with a normal anchor tech because if we get year because our javascript code crashes then

02:03.670 --> 02:08.930
next link would also not work anymore because our javascript app might be dead.

02:09.280 --> 02:16.240
But using a normal link and therefore totally normal aged female features we always can reload the app

02:16.270 --> 02:19.770
on the route page so that is why I use a normal link here.

02:19.810 --> 02:26.110
Then have some styling and with that you can try this out by simply entery slash admins which is a page

02:26.110 --> 02:27.230
that doesn't exist.

02:27.370 --> 02:31.640
Here is our custom error page which allows us to reload.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.450
With that we edit our own layouts.

02:34.450 --> 02:39.610
We added a bunch of components and a bunch of pages where we work with these components.

02:39.820 --> 02:46.540
I guess we're velt prepared to make the next step and now finally add some dynamic data step by step

02:46.690 --> 02:48.250
to our application.
