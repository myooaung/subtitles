Walk into this module we had a look at how we can fetch data from within our next step.

00:08.060 --> 00:14.010
And in the last module we used dummy data and we used sets time to simulate that.

00:14.010 --> 00:17.500
We had an async action like a real HTP request.

00:17.570 --> 00:22.310
I did this so that I could focus on the different ways of getting data into your next app.

00:22.460 --> 00:29.580
But now I want to connect the app to a real data source so that we can really see this in action.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.090
Now there we will also see that there are different ways of connecting next to a back and because it

00:35.330 --> 00:38.080
doesn't next already run on a server.

00:38.180 --> 00:41.520
What does connect to a back and really mean here.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.150
Let's take a closer look.
