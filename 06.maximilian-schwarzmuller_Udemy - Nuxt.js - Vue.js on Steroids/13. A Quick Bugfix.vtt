There's one tiny box I want to fix before we conclude this section in our index just fall in the store

00:09.490 --> 00:13.360
folder in the log out action there.

00:13.420 --> 00:17.650
There we have code to clear our local storage.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.550
This can be executed on the server side though.

00:20.590 --> 00:26.680
Frood a check of middleware when it runs on the server side so we should implement that check to check

00:26.740 --> 00:29.440
if local storage even exists.

00:30.340 --> 00:34.400
The best check here is to simply check the client environment variable.

00:34.450 --> 00:40.450
If that is set to true then the code executes on the client so it's safe to access client side API eyes

00:40.480 --> 00:41.590
like local storage.

00:41.590 --> 00:45.840
So it is just a tiny addition I wanted to make to make sure that this runs correctly.
