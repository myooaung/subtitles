00:02.090 --> 00:04.940
Crusie we had a look at the root dher property.

00:04.940 --> 00:06.650
Now we all have source dear.

00:06.790 --> 00:12.290
Now here we can set the source directory of our next falls throughout the year ahead to include the

00:12.290 --> 00:15.340
node modules folder source year.

00:15.350 --> 00:20.570
So really just means where are all your next folders like components layouts pages.

00:20.660 --> 00:28.400
If you put them into a separate folder like client app then you can just pass that name of the folder

00:28.450 --> 00:31.720
you're directly to source.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.370
However this should be a string not an object.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.590
So you can just passed that name here and now.

00:36.590 --> 00:42.320
Next we'll look into this folder for all the pages folders middleware folders and so on.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.660
So if you want to have a different folder structure and put all these next folders into a subfolder.

00:47.660 --> 00:54.560
This is how you can make next aware of that that transition property is a useful one for setting page

00:54.590 --> 00:59.450
transitions i.e. animations during route changes.

00:59.450 --> 01:07.610
This can be a simple string like page which will then look for certain C S S classes to apply them as

01:07.700 --> 01:15.760
a transition or is a javascript object where you have a name property that could then be page for this.

01:15.770 --> 01:16.610
C is S class.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.950
Look up I'll come back to.

01:18.170 --> 01:24.560
And then also the mode which could be out in to say the old page should be animated out before the new

01:24.560 --> 01:30.760
one comes in and is using the default view Chia's transition settings and features.

01:31.220 --> 01:38.180
Let me show you an example for this I'll go to the esus folder and create a new styles subfolder and

01:38.180 --> 01:40.600
then add a main dot see as follows.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.830
Now I attached some code to this video.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.870
This is the animation code I want to play.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.720
It's taken from the U.K.'s official docs.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.220
This is the code to basically any made elements in and out by changing your past.

01:53.690 --> 01:59.990
Now this is something I will save and now and next can't think of first of all include this ask global

01:59.990 --> 02:06.850
C as s by going to the CSSA array pointing to the exits folder with the told the side at the beginning

02:06.980 --> 02:10.180
and then stalls and then may not see as S..

02:10.220 --> 02:16.550
Now the name is fate because view chase transitions are always structured to have the name and then

02:16.550 --> 02:19.590
different states which are not part of the name.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.440
So Fayed is our name.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.270
With that we can go back to the conflict and set the name to fade here.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.730
To use that animation.

02:26.940 --> 02:34.470
And now if I save this I can go back to my application and reload it and now let's see what happens

02:34.470 --> 02:35.520
if I go to blog.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.270
You'll see it smoothly fades out and the new page fades in.

02:39.270 --> 02:44.400
So this is now the animation we added and you can of course add any animation you want like sliding

02:44.400 --> 02:50.040
effects spinning effects fading effect or no transition at all if you want.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.590
So this is all possible.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.170
If you don't set transition then no transition will be applied.

02:55.170 --> 02:58.470
Now that's it for the main conflict I want to walk you through.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.580
Again check out the last lecture in this module to find links to detail conflict settings.

03:03.780 --> 03:09.570
There are also some things will dive in later in this course still but for now let's move on to two

03:09.570 --> 03:09.870
things.

03:09.870 --> 03:15.540
We also saw in this fall plug ins and modules and let's find out what's up with these.
