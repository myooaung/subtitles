00:02.180 --> 00:05.310
So we started working on our application.

00:05.330 --> 00:11.880
Now I also want to improve the global styling of the entire layout application.

00:11.940 --> 00:13.490
White funds would be great.

00:13.490 --> 00:16.780
And I want to start working on reusable components.

00:16.790 --> 00:19.570
Let's start with the application wide styling.

00:19.580 --> 00:26.330
I want to add some fonts and there is One Fund I want to use I mean Google funds you can simply google

00:26.330 --> 00:30.570
for while Google Faunce and you should find that fun start Google dot com page.

00:30.860 --> 00:33.790
And there I just like the Plus next to open sense.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.440
Then click on the element which opened at the bottom.

00:37.610 --> 00:43.880
And now this is how we can add it to our application we just need to add that link to our HTL page in

00:43.880 --> 00:45.410
the head section.

00:45.410 --> 00:50.600
So let's copy and where's our h G-mail page.

00:50.630 --> 00:53.710
Is it that page the indexed of your file.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.570
But then which one would we use.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.220
Do we maybe we used to lay out.

00:59.330 --> 01:06.950
But here's a secret the lay out also is just included in and number wrapping.

01:06.980 --> 01:10.170
H G-mail page 2 is created by next.

01:10.340 --> 01:17.360
The problem just as we don't see that page but we can add elements to the head section because it's

01:17.360 --> 01:23.940
such a common requirement for the next conflict Jarius fall although half way deeper into it later.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.900
But in there you will find this head property if not add it.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.120
And then there you find ways to set the page title page meta data.

01:33.130 --> 01:40.760
Again I will revisit this but also link which is an array of link elements.

01:40.760 --> 01:45.230
So these elements here which you want to add to your page.

01:45.230 --> 01:52.670
So in there I'll simply add a new link which is a new javascript object which has a real property of

01:52.670 --> 01:53.800
whatever we have here.

01:53.860 --> 02:01.120
So Stahl's sheet in our case your so well a string style sheet.

02:01.430 --> 02:03.420
Then we need a ref right.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.720
We need that ref.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.400
So we just copied and pasted it in there.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
But it's a property.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.370
So the equal sign has to be replaced with a colon.

02:11.600 --> 02:16.160
And now this will be added to every HTL page generated by next.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.860
So to every page.

02:17.870 --> 02:21.330
So now we're importing this from that global CDN.

02:22.070 --> 02:30.240
And with dead we can now go to the default layout because I will only use that lay out in this application.

02:30.320 --> 02:36.800
So I will use that instead of a global C-s as fall which would be an optional alternate lead and will

02:36.800 --> 02:43.770
remove the existing styling in there and instead I want to style the H T.M. content.

02:44.030 --> 02:52.040
I want to assign a default font family to the entire page H-G email and that will be open sand's with

02:52.040 --> 02:54.310
a full bag of sensors.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.210
If that can be loaded.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.470
And I also want to start my application wide body.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.610
I simply want to set the margin to Ciro.

03:04.640 --> 03:10.280
Now with that if we go back to our application you'll see the font changed.

03:10.400 --> 03:19.490
And if we inspect it we can indeed see that if it brings up that it has this fun family applied that

03:19.510 --> 03:21.610
fine until this it changes back.

03:21.610 --> 03:22.940
So this really works.

03:24.120 --> 03:31.790
This is now Blyde because I added to the next config file the import and then the stylus side and to

03:31.790 --> 03:34.350
the default layout.

03:34.430 --> 03:42.620
Now of course we can do way more styling on the individual pages and then also of course on the components

03:42.650 --> 03:44.590
we may use in these pages.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.910
Speaking of that let's add some.
