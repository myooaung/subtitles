00:02.300 --> 00:09.770
Let's continue working on our application in the pages folder on the main page where we start let's

00:09.770 --> 00:13.180
get rid of the content we have in there right now.

00:13.220 --> 00:19.250
Let's get rid of the entire script and Style section therefore because I want to start from scratch

00:19.250 --> 00:23.280
there and build a nice landing page for our blog.

00:23.630 --> 00:26.250
Now how would such heavy landing page look like.

00:26.250 --> 00:34.050
Typically what we need to have a wrapping diff because view components must have only one root element.

00:34.130 --> 00:41.270
I'll give that a class of home page but the name is totally up to you now in there we might have a class

00:41.390 --> 00:48.990
section with a class intro or ever you like where we might have at age one tech where we have some greeting

00:48.990 --> 00:50.000
sentence.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.990
Our main theme of the web page whatever you want Hirose get the latest tech news.

00:57.220 --> 01:05.440
Now below that starting section we could have another section where we simply have some featured posts.

01:05.450 --> 01:14.510
Let me add an appropriate CSSA class now in here I want to have a list of well my posts I want to show.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.450
And on this page of course I want to show the full post.

01:17.450 --> 01:21.550
Just let's say the title and some preview text in.

01:21.570 --> 01:27.930
Obviously each post should be a link so I can add my next link here.

01:28.170 --> 01:36.070
And leads to let's say slash posts slash and then whatever ID we have here.

01:36.380 --> 01:43.610
So therefore two will actually be bound to a dynamic value with a colon in front of it or be bind in

01:43.610 --> 01:44.200
front of it.

01:44.220 --> 01:49.930
Whichever syntax you prefer then we need to wrap the text in single quotation marks.

01:50.030 --> 01:55.990
But now we can also add some dynamic value like one for example.

01:55.990 --> 02:01.530
Now we'll revisit this to actually get this value dynamically and not hardcoded in there.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.050
So this is now my link and I want to wrap.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.960
Let's say an article element.

02:08.180 --> 02:15.090
So a normal h him l element that is where I give it a class of post.

02:15.180 --> 02:24.070
Reveal maybe and in which I have let's say a div which I'll use to display some thumbnail for the post

02:24.070 --> 02:25.670
with a background image.

02:25.750 --> 02:33.740
So let's give Does a class of post thumbnail and below that we could have a deth with a class of post

02:33.890 --> 02:41.480
content where we let's say have age one tag with the post title and where we don't all have a paragraph

02:41.480 --> 02:46.640
with their preview text so not the full text just a short preview snippet.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.180
This could be a single post.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.840
Of course we typically not just have one.

02:51.890 --> 02:58.420
So I will copy and paste as to also have a post which leads to post 2 with the post titled who approve

02:58.430 --> 03:03.280
it takes to again will dynamically generate this soon.

03:03.290 --> 03:10.510
Now if we do that and we go back to our starting page we actually see our posts here and if it clicked

03:10.510 --> 03:13.360
then I'm taking to the detail page.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.800
The styling is a bit off though so let's add some styling here.

03:18.840 --> 03:26.520
For Degel at the Styles section and will also scope that styling here to only apply to this component.

03:26.710 --> 03:31.380
And I already prepared some styles so you again find them attached to this video.

03:31.530 --> 03:32.800
Just paste them in.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.430
We got styling for the entire post preview container to give it a border and a little bit of baulks

03:38.430 --> 03:41.280
shadow to give it this card like look.

03:41.490 --> 03:45.360
And then we got Stahl's for the different parts in that cart.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.900
So now this is what a post preview looks like.

03:47.910 --> 03:50.020
We've got these huge cards here.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.990
You can zoom out a bit here to make it a bit easier to see.

03:55.140 --> 04:02.440
Now the styling is a bit off because we don't have thumbnails so let's quickly search an image.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.230
We want a display here.

04:04.230 --> 04:11.040
I simply searched for a tech on google images and now simply pick any image you like or search for anything

04:11.040 --> 04:11.460
you like.

04:11.460 --> 04:15.250
You're totally free to use whatever you enjoy.

04:15.270 --> 04:25.170
In my case I ended up taking a specific image which I now simply apply Bligh's setting on these posts

04:25.180 --> 04:35.150
here on these diff which should host the thumbnail by setting the style equal to background image.

04:35.280 --> 04:40.730
You are L and then suddenly entered a u r l u grepped pointing to the image you want to load.

04:40.860 --> 04:45.570
If you do that you see the image here on the first post.

04:45.570 --> 04:49.410
Now I will simply duplicate that entire diff to the second post.

04:49.410 --> 04:53.580
And of course that means I use the same image there but now it looks a bit nicer.

04:53.610 --> 04:59.080
Now we need more styles to adjust the positioning of our post cards though because right now they're

04:59.100 --> 05:01.020
a bit ugly to be honest.

05:01.020 --> 05:08.010
The same is true for our starting sentence here for that I provided more styles attached to this video

05:08.280 --> 05:15.300
which you should also grab and which you now can simply enter into that scoped styling down there.

05:15.630 --> 05:22.530
So if you enter this content that we're at a Stahl's I added here with all the media Querrey also then

05:22.530 --> 05:29.910
it looks like this if you reload it and Deira should grab the close to post proof class and move it

05:29.910 --> 05:32.770
from the article to the next link.

05:32.820 --> 05:35.040
Same for the second post.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.610
And with that we should end up with a nicer display that's also responsive.

05:40.650 --> 05:43.950
So this is now how we can display the posts.

05:43.950 --> 05:48.270
Still we get no header and so on but it is an improvement already.
