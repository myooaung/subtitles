00:02.100 --> 00:10.550
So we want to build a blog and I want to have three main You are adults or sections in that block.

00:10.710 --> 00:17.130
Therefore I will add them as folders to pages because I will use that folder based approach because

00:17.160 --> 00:20.230
one I will have some pages.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.630
So slash posts slash the idea of a post for example.

00:24.630 --> 00:31.800
So I need to be able to nest folders and files and I personally preferred the folder based approach

00:32.010 --> 00:39.550
because it's easier to understand really replicates what you enter in your l locally on your fault system.

00:39.840 --> 00:47.390
So you're in the pages folder I want to enter for example a Post's page so post as a folder name because

00:47.430 --> 00:53.550
I want to have pages like Slash posts which gives me a list of all my posts and then slash posts to

00:53.550 --> 00:56.700
one to give me the details or word of full screen.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.800
She was ability for post number one.

01:00.210 --> 01:03.690
Additionally I'll add another folder directly in the pages folder.

01:03.720 --> 01:11.310
So not nested in the posts folder but in the pages folder which I'll name admin here will add some admin

01:11.310 --> 01:17.460
related routes where we will later also add authentication so that we can sign up and sign in and write

01:17.460 --> 01:25.120
blog posts and then I'll add my About page let's say website should not be nested in admin but to add

01:25.140 --> 01:32.380
direct route page and pages so we get these free folders about eminent posts now about.

01:32.400 --> 01:40.890
I'll simply add index w files and then we can load slash about and the content of this about page can

01:40.890 --> 01:44.010
be found attached to this video here.

01:44.130 --> 01:50.660
So dessous the page content just some dummy text and hear some sculped styling.

01:50.820 --> 01:55.430
Remember the styling lectures at the end of last module here.

01:55.470 --> 02:02.040
I got styles which are scoped which only apply to this component and therefore only to this page with

02:02.070 --> 02:03.150
about page.

02:03.210 --> 02:09.330
I'm simply referring to disempowered page C as S class and that's all that's my About page.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.460
It's really simple and we will not revisit it.

02:12.540 --> 02:19.480
No worries though will add far more functionalities to post an admin in the posts folder.

02:19.580 --> 02:23.610
Add index though you fall to be able to reach slash posts.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.130
Now the question is what do we display in there.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.530
Here I'll add a template.

02:28.530 --> 02:37.930
First of all and then a div with a class of hosts page maybe the name is up to you though.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.950
And then there I want to render a list of posts.

02:42.050 --> 02:47.440
Now I'll come back to how we actually use state and how we rendered that list in a second.

02:47.450 --> 02:54.410
For now let me add some styling here and I will also scope these styles by adding the scoped attribute

02:54.470 --> 03:03.510
to ensure they only apply to post page in this component and I will add my posts page HDMI out class

03:03.510 --> 03:11.030
selector and will therefore add a display flex property here to use flex box.

03:11.070 --> 03:18.390
I added a link where you can learn more about this CSSA concept at the end of last module and then justify

03:18.390 --> 03:23.400
content which I set to center and align items which I set to center.

03:23.430 --> 03:29.610
This will center what ever I enter here and here I will enter my individual posts.

03:29.670 --> 03:33.300
I will come back to creating these later.

03:33.390 --> 03:36.350
Now in the host's page area here.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.010
I also want to have a separate page with a dynamic parameter.

03:41.010 --> 03:46.040
The parameter should be called ID and how do I add this year in the post folder.

03:47.350 --> 03:55.140
While you've got two options you can create a file named underscore ID that view or the approach I like.

03:55.150 --> 04:01.520
You create a folder named underscore ID and in that folder you create indexed view file.

04:01.840 --> 04:09.340
Now in that index W4 I want to load a single post of course so I'll add a template here and then a diff

04:09.700 --> 04:10.770
with a class.

04:10.780 --> 04:14.900
Maybe single post page to name is also up to you here.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.490
And here I want to show the details of a select that post.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.000
Therefore here I'll add.

04:21.040 --> 04:27.890
Let's say a section which I'll give a class of post and now in that post you can output whatever you

04:27.890 --> 04:28.790
want.

04:28.790 --> 04:34.970
You could ever age one title where we'll have it later have the title of the post of course will load

04:35.030 --> 04:42.770
this data dynamically later below the time we could have a div with a class of post details where we

04:42.770 --> 04:51.370
output details like when the post was published or updated or who wrote the post so we could have devs

04:51.440 --> 05:02.780
in here where we have like the last updated on Def which will later also populate dynamically and maybe

05:02.800 --> 05:07.780
one where we say written by name.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.820
So we'll replaced this with real content of course.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.260
And then we could have a paragraph where we have the actual content of the post.

05:16.380 --> 05:21.190
So this could be the structure of a single post of a simple post below there.

05:21.300 --> 05:30.030
We could have a class section with the class post feedback maybe where I simply say let me know what

05:30.030 --> 05:32.480
you think about the post.

05:32.610 --> 05:40.730
Send the mail to and then we had a normal anger attack where I simply add D Mail to adjustment here.

05:40.760 --> 05:50.710
Mailed a few feet back at my awesome domain dot com or whatever your awesome domain is and we can repeat

05:50.770 --> 05:58.870
this as a caption for this link so this could be the dummy structure for our single post.

05:58.870 --> 06:01.200
Now let's inspect what we bought thus far.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.070
We'll work on the admin section later.

06:03.070 --> 06:03.800
No worries.

06:04.030 --> 06:10.720
So we can reload the starting page and we haven't changed ad yet so it still looks as before but we

06:10.720 --> 06:17.410
can go to slash about to see the about page with that styling here and will work on the styling a bit

06:17.410 --> 06:17.980
more later.

06:17.980 --> 06:25.630
No worries we can go to slash posts and don't see anything here which makes sense because right now

06:25.810 --> 06:27.290
we got no posts.

06:27.580 --> 06:34.190
But if we go to slash posts one for example we output our dummy post content.

06:34.210 --> 06:41.530
Now this is not looking super bready and here I want actuate up ready page so I'll add Stahl's step

06:41.530 --> 06:42.500
by step.

06:42.700 --> 06:47.120
Let's start with the ID page here for a single post.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.810
I'll add a style which should be scoped and now any here.

06:51.940 --> 06:55.000
I'll quickly paste in some prepared styles.

06:55.190 --> 06:58.420
Now you can find these attached to this video.

06:58.510 --> 07:02.580
I just don't want to bore you by typing CSSA for 10 minutes.

07:02.590 --> 07:08.160
Here are just some styles which you in order to work correctly need some additional classes in VHDL

07:08.170 --> 07:08.990
code.

07:09.070 --> 07:15.700
One is post detail which should be applied to the device in the post details death and the one tag will

07:15.700 --> 07:22.290
get a class of post title just because the styles I pasted in used these classes the content.

07:22.300 --> 07:30.010
All this should get a class of post content and if we do that now it looks a bit nicer already.

07:30.010 --> 07:33.300
Now will work on the font a bit more later and so on.

07:33.820 --> 07:39.450
So this is just how this single post page could look like.

07:39.460 --> 07:45.330
Now of course we want to continue working on this and we want to work on the admin section too.

07:45.340 --> 07:52.660
We probably want to have a header and that all screams for us having a look at the layout and having

07:52.660 --> 07:55.210
a look at re-usable components.

07:55.210 --> 07:55.840
We could build.
