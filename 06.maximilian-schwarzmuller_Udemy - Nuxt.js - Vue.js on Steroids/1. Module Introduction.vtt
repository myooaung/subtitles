00:02.150 --> 00:09.020
Welcome to this module now that we had our first look at next JSA and how it works and created our first

00:09.020 --> 00:17.450
app Let's dive deeper into it and into all the different folders and files we have a next project specifically

00:17.450 --> 00:18.890
in this module.

00:19.010 --> 00:23.120
We'll have a look at pages routing and views.

00:23.180 --> 00:27.680
These are some of the core building blocks of a next chess application.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.430
And one of the things which is the most obvious that it's changed compared to a normal view say app

00:35.300 --> 00:37.790
specifically next does one thing.

00:37.790 --> 00:43.570
It allows us to configure our entire routing by creating folders and files.

00:43.610 --> 00:50.240
The naming matters as you will learn but it's really trivial and it spares you writing your own route

00:50.270 --> 00:51.220
config.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.690
Let's have a closer look in the next lecture.
