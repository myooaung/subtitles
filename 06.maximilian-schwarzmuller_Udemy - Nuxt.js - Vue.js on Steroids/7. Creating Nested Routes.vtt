Let me show you how you can create nested routes with that.

00:05.680 --> 00:13.000
I don't mean nested folders which allows you to construct you are else like Slash users slash one.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.930
These are also kind of nested.

00:15.100 --> 00:22.690
But I mean that you load the content for a to be loaded into a number page like let's say here for a

00:22.690 --> 00:24.000
single user.

00:24.130 --> 00:31.550
Right now all our routes simply replace each other always the entire screen is occupied by one page.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.920
Now let's say we want to load the user id the route for the user id right below our input field and

00:38.920 --> 00:41.530
button on the slash user's page.

00:41.530 --> 00:45.790
We can do it as with next and doing it is really simple.

00:45.790 --> 00:49.960
One thing is that you need to adjust the naming.

00:49.960 --> 00:55.840
The first thing you have to do is you have to create a new file next to that user's folder.

00:55.840 --> 01:00.430
So next to the folder where you want to have a nested route in this file.

01:00.430 --> 01:06.670
Therefore in our case is created in the pages folder directly has to have the same name as the folder

01:06.730 --> 01:09.100
so users don't view.

01:09.430 --> 01:15.160
Now with that file created you of course have to add a template in there and this template is now a

01:15.160 --> 01:21.950
wrapper for both the index that you fall in the Users folder and any other nested droughty want to load.

01:22.180 --> 01:31.720
So if you want to load this part here and put in the button in both the just slash users you and the

01:31.720 --> 01:37.960
nested views then you should copy or cut the code from the index that you followed the users folder

01:38.200 --> 01:40.920
to the user rest of you fault template there.

01:41.020 --> 01:47.340
And of course therefore in this case you also need to cut the script portion into the users view file

01:48.550 --> 01:56.890
and now you add a special component to that user thought you fall the next child component which you

01:56.890 --> 01:58.750
can write as a self-closing component.

01:58.840 --> 02:06.960
It's provided by next J.S. and it simply marks the place where the different sections of that nested

02:06.970 --> 02:08.380
route should be loaded.

02:08.380 --> 02:09.880
Now we have two sections.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.010
We have just slash users which currently doesn't show anything in the index that you follow.

02:15.280 --> 02:22.240
And we got our selected users so to say so in just slash users we could output a paragraph where we

02:22.240 --> 02:29.500
say please enter an ID and click the button and this will be replaced with the output of the user's

02:29.500 --> 02:30.300
ID file.

02:30.310 --> 02:39.160
Once we did so with that if we go back and we reload slash users we see the input the button and our

02:39.160 --> 02:47.200
text and event or a number here then this text gets replaced with that Id text for the loaded single

02:47.200 --> 02:55.240
user and that is a truly nested route where we nest the content that should be rendered into a number

02:55.270 --> 02:56.440
page.

02:56.440 --> 03:03.340
Now this is of course purely optional but if you have some page where you have some rapin content and

03:03.340 --> 03:08.770
want to then exchange certain parts of the page depending on the Suppe routes then this is the approach

03:08.770 --> 03:09.660
you want to take.
