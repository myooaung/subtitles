Well I can do a natural course module and this module will dive into middleware and number features

00:08.880 --> 00:10.930
supported by next genius.

00:11.220 --> 00:18.390
And since it's commonly used together with authentication I thought why not also dive into this and

00:18.390 --> 00:26.250
show how of education could be implemented in Anax chase app because in our blog we do have that Adman's

00:26.250 --> 00:27.270
section right.

00:27.330 --> 00:34.440
So what makes sense to really connected to firebase which offers authentication features and ensure

00:34.440 --> 00:38.970
that only authenticated users can create new posts and so on.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.980
So let's dive into all these things in this module.
