00:02.170 --> 00:03.180
Enough of the talking.

00:03.220 --> 00:04.720
What's inside this course.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.130
We're pretty much done getting started in the next module.

00:08.140 --> 00:14.490
We'll have a look at Page's views and routing so you will learn some of the core features next offers.

00:14.540 --> 00:19.450
Thereafter we'll start building a real project because it's always better to see the things in action

00:19.690 --> 00:25.730
than just listen to theory and we'll then have a look at how we can handle data in next apps.

00:25.740 --> 00:26.110
How.

00:26.110 --> 00:32.030
GEEWAX So do state management system of view integrates into next apps and things like that.

00:32.380 --> 00:37.300
When we are already working with data we'll then also have a look at how we can fetch and store data

00:37.480 --> 00:43.150
on a server because if next is only about the server side rendering and not a service framework the

00:43.150 --> 00:50.050
question of course is how do we connect this kind of server side app to a real service site back end

00:50.380 --> 00:53.260
we'll have a look at this in this module.

00:53.260 --> 00:58.290
Thereafter we'll have a look at the next configuration we can set up and features which are called plug

00:58.290 --> 01:00.030
ins and modules.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.470
Let's find out what that is.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.940
With that we got very solid fundamentals.

01:03.940 --> 01:09.530
We'll then have a look at middleware and authentication how we can add this to our next application.

01:09.610 --> 01:12.720
Then it's time for a closer look at next.

01:12.730 --> 01:13.750
And the service side.

01:13.750 --> 01:22.350
How well can we integrate our next ep with cover suicide features beyond the pure pre rendering or rendering.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.300
In general of our view apps.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.380
So what else can we do.

01:25.390 --> 01:28.320
Can we connect to a database from our next app.

01:28.510 --> 01:31.200
We'll have a look at this question and this module.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.550
And then it's time for deployment.

01:33.550 --> 01:39.490
Now in this module will focus on showing you how you can build your next ep in different modes.

01:39.490 --> 01:45.600
So as you and the worst lap as a single page app and data is a very important feature as a statically

01:45.610 --> 01:49.370
generator that we will dive into all three build options.

01:49.390 --> 01:54.220
And I will walk you through them and explain what the differences and what you would ship to a server

01:54.280 --> 01:58.330
if you decide to use a certain option and that's it.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.930
I'll then round the course up and I'm sure you will have learned a lot about next.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.240
Once we reach this point.
