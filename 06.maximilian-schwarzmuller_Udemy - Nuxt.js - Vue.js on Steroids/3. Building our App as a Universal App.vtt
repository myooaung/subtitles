00:02.200 --> 00:08.280
Let's start by deploying our app as a uni worth lab for that you should ensure that in the next conflict

00:08.280 --> 00:15.520
the mode is set to Universal and then you get two scripts to execute the first script you should execute

00:15.730 --> 00:23.050
is to build script you rabid with NPM run built this builds and optimize your entire code and gives

00:23.050 --> 00:26.060
you a folder which you should deploy in the end.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.170
So with that finished we get this next folder.

00:31.300 --> 00:36.870
And here we essentially have our optimized code and everything we need.

00:36.930 --> 00:40.250
Keep in mind we're still trading on server side application.

00:40.250 --> 00:47.310
Therefore the command to start your next server on your host in the end is NPM start.

00:47.370 --> 00:49.550
You can still tested locally though.

00:49.980 --> 00:56.150
So this now starts your server and since it's on our machine it's still reachable under localhost 3000.

00:56.250 --> 01:03.810
But now this year which looks just as it looked before is actually running in an optimist way with the

01:03.810 --> 01:04.220
code.

01:04.220 --> 01:10.190
Well it's shipped to a real server so let's quit that process and let's ship it to a real server.

01:10.410 --> 01:15.220
Now if you want to see your application run on a real server you would grab all the files here.

01:15.240 --> 01:23.310
So you would deploy the entire project folder to your node hosting providers so to the folder of your

01:23.310 --> 01:26.600
node host gives you where your application should be.

01:26.610 --> 01:32.160
This includes the package adjacent fall for some providers it also includes the node modules folder

01:32.520 --> 01:37.090
avarice dynamically installed that on the server once you uploaded your code.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.950
So that is something that depends on your provider and went to the ploy.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.940
All that code.

01:41.940 --> 01:46.470
All that folder with the subfolder is to your node host.

01:46.470 --> 01:50.200
You need to run NPM start on that hosting server.

01:50.310 --> 01:54.830
Now some providers run that command for you to address you might need to connect.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.620
This is how you deploy your universal application in the end though.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.770
Now let's have a look at the alternatives.
