00:02.180 --> 00:08.920
So we had our first Plug-In and therefore have the chance of running code before we mount the root the

00:08.930 --> 00:09.850
instance.

00:09.950 --> 00:14.630
And this is good for any code you want to run not just for registering global components.

00:14.660 --> 00:17.810
It doesn't even have to be view related code you run.

00:17.810 --> 00:23.660
You could for example execute a Poley Phil's file where you check whether the prom is object exists

00:23.660 --> 00:28.020
on the browser you're using and load up POLLI full if that's not the case.

00:28.160 --> 00:34.180
So basically any global javascript code you want to execute at application start up create a plugin

00:34.190 --> 00:35.140
for it.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.950
One case that is related to view is that we could also.

00:38.960 --> 00:45.800
Besides registering components register a filter like a date filter because we do have a badly formatted

00:45.800 --> 00:47.220
data an hour.

00:47.660 --> 00:52.720
Now here I attached some code to to this video which you can paste into this fall.

00:52.820 --> 00:58.520
This is just giving you a function that will in the end take date as an input and formatted into a more

00:58.520 --> 01:00.230
readable format.

01:00.230 --> 01:06.990
Now we just need to import view into this file so import view from view.

01:07.140 --> 01:12.590
And with that we can register a global filter with the filter method give it a name by which you can

01:12.590 --> 01:18.350
use it like date and then point to the faulter function which should take a value as an input and return

01:18.350 --> 01:19.720
the formatted value.

01:19.730 --> 01:23.150
In this case it's the date filter function in this file.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.990
With that we just need to go to the next conflict and register this fall as a log into.

01:29.180 --> 01:33.680
So again all point to do plug ins folder and then date filter.

01:33.710 --> 01:41.540
J.S. with this we can go to or a single post here in the ID folder and add the pipe symbol to register

01:41.540 --> 01:43.300
that date filter here.

01:43.310 --> 01:50.890
Now with that we save this and reload the page we got a nicely formatted date here and that is really

01:50.890 --> 01:51.250
great.

01:51.250 --> 01:58.870
Now because this allows us to register such global filters without any tricky work arounds just by using

01:58.870 --> 02:00.040
that plugins feature.

02:00.130 --> 02:06.730
And again because it's important you can run any lobal javascript code that children at application

02:06.730 --> 02:08.640
start up in such a plugin.
