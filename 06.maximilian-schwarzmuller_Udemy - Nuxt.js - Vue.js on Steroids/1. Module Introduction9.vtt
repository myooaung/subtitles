Welcome to this module we're nearing the end of this course.

00:06.080 --> 00:12.950
Thus far we always had a look at the client side and a little bit of service side but we mostly focused

00:12.950 --> 00:19.230
on the single page application aspect and the fact that Nax can be used to pre-rendered pages.

00:19.370 --> 00:23.590
Is this really all though the answer is yes regarding next.

00:23.600 --> 00:31.250
Next is there to give you Uni Wurzel of new applications it's not a full stack framework it's not a

00:31.250 --> 00:38.660
service framework like Express's it integrates nicely with Express though so we can connect that to

00:38.660 --> 00:42.160
our customer service code as I will show you in this module.

00:42.380 --> 00:50.550
But in the end is there to prepare the rendering of your view pages and to then do that rendering.

00:50.660 --> 00:56.960
That is the role of next and that is why I always emphasized that you shouldn't put any over service

00:56.960 --> 01:01.340
and logic like accessing a database into your next quote.

01:01.520 --> 01:07.880
It is more jailable still show you how you can reach or how you can achieve a deeper integration between

01:07.880 --> 01:09.710
next and the server side.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.010
So let's take a closer look.
