00:02.110 --> 00:07.460
So the last week we had a look at the environment variables really useful tool to centralize certain

00:07.460 --> 00:15.060
settings and even inject them from our node environment the next setting is to generate setting dissolves

00:15.100 --> 00:22.750
something you can use to change the way next statically generates pages if you choose to do so.

00:22.790 --> 00:28.130
Now I will dive deeper into this later in the course and the deployment module when I talk about static

00:28.130 --> 00:29.570
page generation.

00:29.630 --> 00:34.740
This is superpowerful useful and great feature and definitely something we will dive into.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.410
But I want to spend more words on that than just some quick sentences.

00:38.510 --> 00:41.140
So let's omit this for now.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.160
We also got a rude dear property.

00:44.240 --> 00:52.940
This can be used to set the root directory where all your next folders live in.

00:53.090 --> 00:57.350
And by default this is simply just slash.

00:57.380 --> 01:05.120
However if you would create a sub directory my app and all your next files and download modules folder

01:05.120 --> 01:11.000
that's important would be in that folder in the map folder then you would set Roueche dear to my app

01:11.000 --> 01:15.440
you're to inform next where to look for its files and dependencies.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.120
You also have a router property.

01:18.260 --> 01:25.610
Now the router property allows you to override some settings of the next router as you learned you never

01:25.610 --> 01:27.490
directly configured a router.

01:27.510 --> 01:32.700
It's using the router behind the scenes but you don't interact with it you just create your pages and

01:32.810 --> 01:35.510
next and first the route configuration from that.

01:35.510 --> 01:40.140
Now if you need to configure some things about The View router you can do it here.

01:40.280 --> 01:46.940
Now since the router is used you can set any of the settings you can set on the router constructor so

01:46.940 --> 01:51.980
you can always check out the official view router docks and there if you scroll to the bottom to the

01:51.980 --> 01:59.360
API reference to the router constructor options these options here can also be set on this router object

01:59.360 --> 02:04.760
here that are things like for example setting the base path in case you are serving your app from a

02:04.760 --> 02:08.900
subfolder in production then you could set this to my app.

02:08.920 --> 02:14.450
This is no not referring to the full structure here but to your web server folder structure and in which

02:14.660 --> 02:19.900
subfolder your app might lie if it's not served from the root and so on.

02:19.910 --> 02:25.680
So you can really set the entire configuration you saw in the docs I pointed you to here.

02:25.970 --> 02:32.310
You can also set Obert settings like for example extend routes.

02:32.530 --> 02:37.950
Now extend routes allows you to programmatically add your own routes.

02:38.210 --> 02:45.370
It's actually a function which receives the routes Naks generated for you based on your pages folder.

02:45.830 --> 02:55.940
And the second is a resolve function which allows you to find your component files and then you could

02:56.240 --> 03:02.630
use the existing routes and push a new route where a new route is just a javascript object following

03:02.630 --> 03:05.050
the route configuration of the view router.

03:05.270 --> 03:11.780
So here you could set up a POV for example a catch all Poth and then you could define which component

03:11.780 --> 03:12.760
should be loaded.

03:12.830 --> 03:17.990
And here you can use resolve to pass Durnan which is a reserved variable.

03:17.990 --> 03:22.800
Available in node environments referring to that directory you're currently in.

03:23.120 --> 03:28.360
And then the payoff to the component you want to load like pages indexed view.

03:28.370 --> 03:36.500
Now we would always load our main page ever while getting into any route that we don't set up here in

03:36.500 --> 03:37.610
our pages folder.

03:37.610 --> 03:42.300
So essentially in this set up we will never get 404 errors again.

03:42.380 --> 03:48.440
This can be really useful in some advanced use cases but a lot of the time you should need to extend

03:48.440 --> 03:49.640
your routes like this.

03:49.670 --> 03:54.800
You should try to really build your routing structure with the pages folder and take advantage of that

03:54.800 --> 03:57.830
core feature next offers you.

03:57.880 --> 04:04.410
You can also use the router config to set the default act of class with Link active class.

04:04.600 --> 04:12.970
Here you could set this to active for example to attached is active C S S class to any active link and

04:12.970 --> 04:13.390
more.

04:13.420 --> 04:19.490
You can set more here and we will dive into some of the features later in the course like middleware.

04:19.510 --> 04:25.210
You can also find a detailed instruction about all the possible settings in the last lecture off this

04:25.210 --> 04:27.020
module there in general.

04:27.070 --> 04:32.090
As you probably already guessed you'll find a lot of resources about the configurations you can apply.
