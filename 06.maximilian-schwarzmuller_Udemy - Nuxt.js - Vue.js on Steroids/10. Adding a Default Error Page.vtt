We had a look at layouts in the last lecture.

00:04.910 --> 00:11.060
Now there's one special layout you can add to the layouts folder and that's the error dot view file

00:11.720 --> 00:19.400
just as default default Doc you errored view is a reserved name and it won't be loaded when ever your

00:19.400 --> 00:25.010
view application froze and error like a 4 0 4 error here.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.900
It's a normal view component again as indicated by Dauth view.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.160
So you can see the output.

00:30.170 --> 00:34.130
Anything you want here like an error occurred.

00:34.330 --> 00:39.290
We're sorry but this allows you to create your own hand tailored error.

00:39.290 --> 00:45.850
View your error page which will look in exactly the way you wanted it to look.

00:45.980 --> 00:50.930
With that if we save that with just the addition of the file nothing else required.

00:50.930 --> 00:58.250
We can go back to the application and let's now try entering your L for user an idea I mean which is

00:58.250 --> 00:59.490
not a number.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.430
And now you see our custom error page.

01:02.450 --> 01:07.130
Remember earlier you saw that default next error page.

01:07.130 --> 01:14.270
Now it's this one because we added our special error layout and this is all important to know with that

01:14.500 --> 01:19.520
you got the possibility of rendering a special error page for.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.620
Well any error that ochreous.
