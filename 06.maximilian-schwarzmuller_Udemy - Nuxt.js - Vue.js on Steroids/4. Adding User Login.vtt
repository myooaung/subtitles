00:02.250 --> 00:09.060
Let's start checking whether we are in Sign-Up mode or not we do have does is log in property which

00:09.060 --> 00:14.640
we switch when we click that button and we actually want to send this request where we try to sign that

00:14.640 --> 00:17.070
user up if we're not in log in mode.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.870
So here to check if we're not in log in mode.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.250
So if this log in is false if it's false that means we are trying to sign up.

00:26.250 --> 00:32.720
So in this case I want to execute this request here else.

00:33.770 --> 00:38.260
If we are in log in mode I want to try logging in for a given user.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.150
And for that we need a different endpoint which we can get from the official docs.

00:42.230 --> 00:44.960
We want to sign in with email and password in this case.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.870
So it's dys you are all we need to send a request to in that case this you or else takes the same inputs

00:50.930 --> 00:52.940
as to sign up request though.

00:53.150 --> 00:59.510
So what we can do is we can actually move that whole code outside of the if else statement and only

00:59.510 --> 01:02.270
change you are inside of it.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.890
So we could have a default.

01:03.890 --> 01:09.280
You are well off you are l which let's say is our log in your l.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.170
Let's say that's our default use case.

01:12.170 --> 01:18.650
So this is this you are el-Din and DHP like he is something we get from our environment variable just

01:18.650 --> 01:20.940
as we do it for signing up.

01:20.960 --> 01:29.190
So I'm setting up this default you are l which would lock to use in if we are not in loggin mode then

01:29.220 --> 01:31.040
I want to set you off.

01:31.050 --> 01:34.750
You are l to this you are l here instead.

01:34.770 --> 01:36.710
Q The sign up Eurail.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.450
So let's copy that code.

01:39.460 --> 01:46.390
Then and Now we can remove the else case and always send that post request.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.260
However you are ELAS something.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.540
We will exchange dynamically.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.760
We just want to use d off your l.

01:53.790 --> 02:00.720
So this variable we're defining in the if else block or in the blog actually or with the default.

02:00.780 --> 02:06.090
So did we always send this kind of request with this data because we always need that data but that

02:06.090 --> 02:08.810
we send it to different view or else.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.380
So let's try this out.

02:10.410 --> 02:16.400
Let's go back to our application and now we should see a difference between logging in and signing up.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.760
And we should also be able to do both.

02:20.010 --> 02:26.280
So let's try logging in which is our default mode all enter to credentials from before hit log in and

02:26.280 --> 02:27.400
adds looking good.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.100
Let's switch to sign up and now we actually should get an error.

02:31.170 --> 02:34.440
And I do because that e-mail address already exists.

02:34.650 --> 02:38.150
If you send a new one then it works again.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.090
So this is working.

02:40.140 --> 02:46.260
Of course we should now store that token I was talking about so that we can use it for future requests

02:46.260 --> 02:48.740
to protect that resources.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.270
Let me show you what I mean in the next lecture.
