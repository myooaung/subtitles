Now get a past a lot of information about how her routing works and next steps and how next creates

00:08.280 --> 00:11.690
the route conflict based on your folder structure.

00:11.690 --> 00:16.630
Let's dive into some other folders we saw in the project the layouts and the components folder.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.950
And let's also understand what the difference between layouts pages and components is.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.090
When do you use which And how do they work together.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.710
So we haven't had a look at it yet.

00:27.710 --> 00:35.150
We'll have in a second but the layout is your main wrapping element on the page you could say you have

00:35.150 --> 00:39.990
a layout in your next app and every page is loaded into debt.

00:40.010 --> 00:47.180
Lay out the layout allows you to define a frame both from a styling perspective as well as regarding

00:47.180 --> 00:53.810
some shared functionality like a shared header and you can have multiple layouts so you can create multiple

00:53.810 --> 00:57.400
layouts for different parts of your page.

00:57.440 --> 01:04.640
Now the page is on the average and can for one have nested pages but can also use components.

01:04.760 --> 01:12.380
These ordinary normal view components which in a next project you would store in the components folder.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.100
These are normal components and they are re-usable.

01:16.130 --> 01:22.310
So one component can be used in multiple pages or just in one whatever you need.

01:22.310 --> 01:24.950
This is how these free things work together.

01:25.010 --> 01:28.310
Now let's have a look at them step by step over the next lectures.
