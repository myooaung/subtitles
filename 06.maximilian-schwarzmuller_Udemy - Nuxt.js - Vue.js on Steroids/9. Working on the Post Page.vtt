00:02.090 --> 00:05.980
So now with the navigation finished let's add more components.

00:06.050 --> 00:11.030
Let's finish our our page just to be precise like the Post's page.

00:11.030 --> 00:12.340
It's empty right now.

00:12.440 --> 00:19.820
So why don't we fill it in the same way we add content to our main index page so I'll actually copy

00:20.000 --> 00:26.880
the featured posts section from that index that you follow here to the index that you follow in the

00:26.880 --> 00:29.490
posts folder like that.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.530
And now I also want to copy the Stahl's day of 4.

00:35.680 --> 00:43.040
So I will grab my featured Post's Style here and put that into that index that you fall here too.

00:43.210 --> 00:52.960
So I got the Post's Page and my featured posts and dad could actually just be maybe post a list or something

00:52.960 --> 00:53.620
like that.

00:53.650 --> 00:54.730
It doesn't really matter.

00:54.730 --> 01:00.760
But we're not really featuring posts should be all our posts and I want to reflect this in D.C.'s S

01:00.760 --> 01:08.890
class with that if we go to the block page now and reload it we actually get an error that post preview

01:08.890 --> 01:15.070
as an unknown element and that makes a lot of sense because we're not importing it.

01:15.100 --> 01:21.340
So let's go back to the next the view file in the pages folder and let's grab that import pointing to

01:21.340 --> 01:22.560
post preview.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.090
And here we see the advantage of that sign.

01:25.120 --> 01:31.330
We won't need to adjust it even though we move into a different folder now and add it to the script

01:31.330 --> 01:37.500
section of this indexed view file in our hosts files so to say.

01:37.600 --> 01:45.070
So I'll add it here and now we can always add the components property and register to post preview component

01:45.160 --> 01:49.140
as a local component in this page here too.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.170
And I will show an alternative to this later in the course.

01:52.180 --> 01:58.600
Now if we reload we all see the posts here on the block page and that is much better now because now

01:58.630 --> 02:00.620
it looks more like a blog.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.650
Now I'm not done yet though since we used the same code here in the Post's Page edit our starting page

02:08.770 --> 02:10.930
for rendering a list of posts.

02:11.050 --> 02:15.200
We could also outsource data into a separate reusable component.

02:15.340 --> 02:23.260
So in the post folder in the cupolas folder we could add a post list to view file in which template

02:23.440 --> 02:32.590
we simply put this section of post lists so this section where we recently changed the C S S Class all

02:32.650 --> 02:41.230
CAPTUS and post it or add it into my post list that you follow like this and now we all need to bring

02:41.230 --> 02:42.050
the styles.

02:42.070 --> 02:49.150
So I'll add my style property and scope it and I will now go back to the index that you follow in the

02:49.150 --> 02:54.170
posts folder and grab the entire styles from the post list here.

02:54.330 --> 03:00.790
I'll leave the Post's page style here because I still want to have that layout in this page so it does

03:01.030 --> 03:02.310
cut out Styles.

03:02.320 --> 03:09.190
I'll add two to my post list doc view file and now of course since I'm using POST preview in the post

03:09.190 --> 03:13.330
list now I should also import that component here.

03:13.450 --> 03:20.530
So let's go back to the index of you fall from before and let's copy that script section and let's add

03:20.530 --> 03:23.290
it to the post list view file here.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.360
And with that we're registering the post preview here.

03:26.740 --> 03:32.770
Now we can use to post list in both our starting page and the Post's page.

03:32.770 --> 03:37.400
So adjust the import there pointing at post preview previously.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.870
All now point to post list.

03:39.880 --> 03:47.830
So to this new component we just created and now we can simply put the post list component into this

03:48.190 --> 03:55.400
post's page component and I'll do just the same in my main starting page here.

03:55.600 --> 04:01.440
I will also just use host list like this.

04:01.470 --> 04:06.420
I don't need the wrapping section because to read the section is actually part of the post list now

04:06.450 --> 04:12.900
so let's remove it and an only child just import an assignment and decomposed into property or two pointing

04:12.900 --> 04:18.680
to post list with all these changes if we save dead and we reload this app.

04:18.900 --> 04:25.590
It should still work all right and look the same as before but now we're actually managing the list

04:25.590 --> 04:30.800
of posts in a separate component which again is the way you should work with next.

04:30.810 --> 04:31.360
And you.
