00:02.110 --> 00:04.570
We're almost done with the generate set up.

00:04.600 --> 00:13.150
Now let's just adjust our store to not Frot local storage Aeros during the generation in in and off.

00:13.150 --> 00:19.990
The problem is that we always enter does local storage mode here.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.580
If we don't have a request object now we never have a request object during the local generation because

00:27.580 --> 00:28.630
no server is running.

00:28.630 --> 00:31.960
There is no request but there also is no local storage.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.880
So we have never we don't have a request.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.370
We're not on the server but we also are not on the client.

00:37.390 --> 00:39.120
We're in a generation mode.

00:39.130 --> 00:47.330
I'd say now to fix this error we should add a condition to this L's case where we check if the process

00:47.340 --> 00:55.470
is client which it only is if we really are on the client and not if we are generating this else if

00:55.470 --> 01:07.160
it's not then token will be null and expiration date equals null or we don't do that because then it's

01:07.160 --> 01:10.240
simply undefined as set up here.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.120
So now if we rerun and run generate with that additional check integrated we shouldn't get that error

01:16.230 --> 01:23.250
anymore because now this code shouldn't be executed during the generation of our pages.

01:23.260 --> 01:26.900
So you see it here you see the middleware was even executed.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.110
So that happens during the generation.

01:29.290 --> 01:36.230
But there's of course only means that our urban area are protected resources are safe because here the

01:36.230 --> 01:43.480
Dedman files which are generated don't actually hold any content which would be sensible or which should

01:43.480 --> 01:48.100
be protected because it was not loaded because there was no token.

01:48.190 --> 01:57.100
So generating content works fine with authentication protected content and that was the last part generating

01:57.100 --> 01:57.780
pages.

01:57.850 --> 02:03.160
If you wanted to deploy this you would simply deployed the entire folder contents of the disk folder.

02:03.160 --> 02:09.070
I mean that the entire contents of that disk folder to a static host and you would still return your

02:09.070 --> 02:12.160
index HVM else file for all unknown routes.

02:12.280 --> 02:18.100
But a lot more routes would be known because you got a real folder structure with real pre-generated

02:18.100 --> 02:24.010
files and if you can I can strongly recommend using the generate command because it really gives your

02:24.070 --> 02:30.610
awesome search engine optimization opportunity without the requirement of constantly running a notorious

02:30.610 --> 02:31.060
server.
