And that's it for this module we had a look at the next configuration and the different things you can't

00:07.660 --> 00:08.930
find one there.

00:08.950 --> 00:14.680
This should really allow you to create a next project the next set up that fulfills all your requirements

00:14.680 --> 00:17.020
and behaves in the way you want it to behave.

00:17.380 --> 00:22.960
You also learn about plugins which allow you to run code right before your application starts.

00:22.960 --> 00:29.500
So to say and modules which allows you to extend the functionalities of your project and easily add

00:29.500 --> 00:33.030
convenience features and third party modules into your app.

00:33.340 --> 00:38.310
I hope this is helpful and helps you during the development of your next project.

00:38.320 --> 00:44.320
Now with that I want to move on to the next course module where we will dive even deeper into next.
