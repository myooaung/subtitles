WEBVTT

00:02.020 --> 00:06.320
Overdue class lectures we worked with page layout and components.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.770
Let's now work with assets.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.930
We load images from the web and there is actually something you do a lot because in your real applications

00:15.990 --> 00:23.460
where maybe users can upload images you're typically stored at on some server like AWOS ESRI some file

00:23.520 --> 00:30.480
server and you just store D you or else to the files in some database and use that you are l in your

00:30.690 --> 00:36.420
application and your view is too loaded loaded through the browser automatically but you sometimes also

00:36.450 --> 00:41.010
have some static assets in your project like in this project.

00:41.130 --> 00:45.710
I want to have a background image here at the top behind my slogan.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.450
And for that I'll go to the essence folder and add images folder and dead images folder is totally optional.

00:52.470 --> 00:53.840
You can name it differently.

00:53.850 --> 00:54.950
You can leave it out.

00:55.140 --> 01:01.770
It's just for organizational purposes in there are copy in the image which I attached to this video.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.130
I pasted it and this is my background image.

01:05.170 --> 01:09.090
Now I want to use that background image in my index of your faults.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.330
And my main page.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.450
Let's go to the index that you follow.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.060
And there I simply want to load it as a background image in my intro section.

01:18.330 --> 01:21.510
I actually already got some styles for the background image.

01:21.510 --> 01:27.460
So now I just need to add background image itself and use a you are able to point to that file.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.090
And now I want to show you how to include static.

01:30.090 --> 01:36.250
SS You don't pass something like dot dot slash essence or something like that.

01:36.420 --> 01:43.770
You can just use Tilda now no slash but directly SS to access this assets folder the tilde itself stands

01:43.770 --> 01:50.880
for the root folder and then your pops in my case images and then the name is called or the name of

01:50.880 --> 01:55.790
the image is main Dasch page dash background dot shape.

01:55.800 --> 02:03.630
In my case now does puffier will be detected by web pack which is used behind the scenes in the build

02:03.630 --> 02:11.520
workflow and it will then automatically search for disk image optimize it and copy it over to your deployment

02:11.520 --> 02:17.710
package so to say and will dive into deployment in a special section at the end of the course so that

02:17.720 --> 02:21.540
the image will be included and if we go back mom here we see it.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.370
So our blog is taking shape.

02:23.370 --> 02:27.200
It's looking better and we can already read you some posts here.

02:27.270 --> 02:29.220
Now there are more components we can add.

02:29.260 --> 02:31.630
Let's dive into this as a next step.
