00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and the previous lectures.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,090
We learned how we first import all our libraries that we would need you know like panda's name pi profit

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,000
and so on.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,870
And we know right now how can we load the data which is often crowded out CSB into a data frame.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,950
I forgot to underscore what we need to do right now that we need to visualize the data.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,800
Okay and explore the dataset let's see what's going on here.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,230
So what we could do.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,590
We're going to say OK let's go ahead and get the data frame which I've got underscored data frame dot

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,910
head right.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,260
And let's run that and we run the head here basically it's gonna give us you know a couple the first

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,060
couple of lines in here which is you know like the lines that we're getting here.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,630
All right.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,950
So basically again total volume.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,030
Here we have the average price per unit.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,540
We have the date here we have the total number of bags.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,800
Here we have the type either conventional or organic.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,880
Here we have the year.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,830
And here we have the region.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,450
Is it like in the United States.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,020
Is it like you know like in east west and so on.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,470
OK.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,940
All right.

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:16,740
What I want you guys to do is to pause the video and please try to remember how can you obtain the tail

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,780
of the data frame if you guys remember we can plot the beginning or the initial section of the data

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,050
frame and we can all we can also as well visualize the ending or the tail of the data frame.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,980
OK.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,370
Please pause video and try to go through that challenge and then we're going to go back right after

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,850
the challenge.

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,550
All right.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,040
You guys were able to figure out the challenge.

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,170
So if you guys remember from previous section within the course what we could do if you wanted to view

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,540
the last elements within the data frame you're going to say OK forgot avocado underscore the data frame

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,470
dot tail.

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,380
Right.

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,090
And that will basically bring us the tail of the data frame the last elements you can see here the index

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:08,190
here from 0 to 4 right here the indices are eighteen thousand going down to let's say eighteen eighteen

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,590
thousand two for eight.

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,090
All right.

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,200
OK.

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,330
What we could do as well if you as a member let's practice a little bit on CNN on data frame we can

41
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:24,460
say OK avocado on the score data frame dot head and instead of just if you leave it blank here you know

42
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,560
that the default maybe it going select the first couple of lines.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,360
What if I wanted to view let's say the first 20 items are going to say OK forget the head and just put

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,840
20 here and let's run it.

45
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,540
And if you see here we actually have been able to plot 20 line items in here which the first pretty

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,670
much line items.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,370
What we have here.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,530
OK.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,610
All right.

50
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,900
Again let's it's time for a quick challenge.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:57,670
I want you guys to plot the last or to plot here on the screen or to view the last 20 elements within

52
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,270
the data frame.

53
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,870
OK.

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,470
Please go ahead.

55
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,060
Puzzle video are going to be back after the challenge.

56
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,780
All right.

57
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,550
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

58
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm asking you to plot the last 20 items within the data frame.

59
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,010
Right.

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,330
So we could do it in a C Okay.

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,240
I forgot to underscore the data frame the tail and I'm going to pass along here 20.

62
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,510
Right.

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,440
So if you leave it blank again here when we left the blank we were able to obtain the last five rows.

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,820
Right.

65
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,150
What we could do here if I want to view the last 20.

66
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,870
You can just run around like that and that will view the overall number of items the 20 items.

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,200
All right.

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,730
OK let's go ahead and do some manipulations to the data.

69
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,320
OK.

70
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,580
So what we could do is that we wanted to view the date OK versus the avocado price.

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,690
All right.

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,130
So what we could do here first is that we can go ahead and sort the values of the date.

73
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,410
OK.

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,330
So the values here based on the data we can have kind of a chronological order you know going for let's

75
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,910
say from 2015 to let's say 2016 17 and 18 and so on to do that.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,600
What we could do we're going to say OK avocado underscore data frame equals to take the data frame again

77
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm going to say dot sort on underscore values and we're going to sort through date.

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:25,870
All right.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,910
So getting used that date column here which is the date here to sort our our data.

80
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,200
Right.

81
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,090
That's actually one that looks good.

82
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,740
Let's run it again let's view it and that's how the value there is sort.

83
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,860
Please bear in mind that.

84
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,170
OK.

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,430
This is the earliest date.

86
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,080
So the earliest date was actually in back in January of 2015.

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,470
And you guys can see here the index has been shifted right.

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,140
So when we do the sorting by date we actually sorted the entire entire row right who selected the entire

89
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,030
row.

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,380
So yes we use the data to sort but we we got the entire row as we move forward.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,320
Right.

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,160
That's why here's the index didn't start at 1 2 3 and so on.

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,150
You will see that the different numbers here you know are kind of mixed based on the data.

94
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,630
All right let's go ahead and let's visualize for example the date versus the average price.

95
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,210
Let's take a look you know with the price going up with the price going down.

96
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,300
Let's take a look.

97
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:32,990
So what we could do here we could say OK I'm going to DPL T dot plot and in order to print the plot

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,560
the date versus the average price what we could do can silky Africa avocado underscore the data frame

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:49,160
and we can say OK I need the dates and I need again avocado on the score data frame and here I need

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,500
my average price.

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,220
You guys remember average price in the name has to match right.

102
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,580
So here I'm trying to plot.

103
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,990
That's right.

104
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,880
So the average price.

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,480
Exactly have to match.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,960
Please note that the A's uppercase and PS uppercase and here the date D uppercase right.

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,270
All right let's go down.

108
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,490
Okay.

109
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,200
Looks good.

110
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,210
Let's run its stake in limit of time.

111
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,310
I have tons of data in here and here we go.

112
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,210
So here you will see that we plotted the date here.

113
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,940
Obviously it's very hard to read and hear the prices you know like it's just it's going crazy all over

114
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,260
the place.

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,950
Going from one point five dollars maybe sometimes it's like three dollars you know it's again it's very

116
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,730
expensive sometimes goes down 2.5 and so on.

117
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,210
That's pretty much the price as we as we see it now.

118
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,530
All right.

119
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,950
OK.

120
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:45,380
What we could do as well in order to make that graph a little bit better what we could do that we could

121
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,300
come here and we could say OK P L T that figures just change the figure size and we can say okay think

122
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,860
size equals two and we can make it let's say 10 and 10.

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,840
For example let's run it.

124
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,520
It should be better to be more.

125
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,140
You know we can view it a little bit more all right.

126
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,210
Looks much better now.

127
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,810
So now I can read it they can look at the variations in the price.

128
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,460
That looks great.

129
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,530
All right.

130
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,600
Let's go ahead and actually we're not going to be using the region that much if you go up here you find

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:27,880
that there is a column here called region let's go here from the region called like West e and so on.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Let's go ahead and maybe visualize the regions.

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,390
Again the objective here is for us to practice as much as you can using seaboard.

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:43,740
OK so we could do that to say OK I wanted to use as an S dot count plot so I wanted to count basically

135
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,060
the the elements.

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,900
Right.

137
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:53,460
And what I could do the data they're going to be using the data is simply our avocado on the score data

138
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,160
frame which is our data frame basically data.

139
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,230
And what I wanted to do.

140
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:06,940
Going to say OK I wanted to count elements based on the region right.

141
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,640
So again my apologies are going to say region.

142
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,170
All right.

143
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,790
So that will simply end and go ahead and plot for us our count plot within a plot the number of regions

144
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,200
here it's really hard to read as well.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,620
So going to make a little bit bigger and let's see how the count how many they come.

146
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,740
The number of elements here as you guys can see here the count how many elements is the data kind of

147
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,160
like

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,270
it.

149
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,710
The question here is the data balanced or not.

150
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,600
And that's the objective what we have done here.

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,070
So the data is pretty much balanced right.

152
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,950
So the count the number of items number of elements are down three.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,030
It's actually pretty much extremely balanced right based in the region.

154
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,190
Let's actually make a little bit bigger to actually view as well the regions if we could we could say

155
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:08,720
it could say OK BLT dot figure and I'm going to use fig size equals two and I'm going to say twenty

156
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,540
five and let's say twelve.

157
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:11,780
All right.

158
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,790
And let's run that's all right.

159
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,800
Looks much better now.

160
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,770
And again it's really tough as well to read here it looks like they are overlapping right.

161
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,610
OK.

162
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,020
What we could do as well here.

163
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,110
Maybe we can try something else.

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,580
What we could do is that we can use what we call it the rotation key.

165
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:36,280
We haven't done that before but maybe let's let's you know learn something new today escapee empty dot

166
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,240
and say X ticks.

167
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,970
So simply I'm just going here to the X sticks here the x axis what we have here and I wanted to rotate

168
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,900
it by 45 degrees so when I say rotation equals to forty five.

169
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,520
So that will simply going to go ahead here and rotate it.

170
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,480
If you guys look take a look here it actually looks much better now.

171
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,140
Now it's actually a bit more readable which is great.

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,300
Let's zoom in more and you guys can see here there is like south east.

173
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,750
That is Chicago.

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,600
There is like you know made mid south the rich Charlot Houston that is South Carolina.

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,620
You know Seattle so it's you know like the region San Diego.

176
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,850
The region is pretty much you know obviously us a base that is Detroit Philadelphia.

177
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,870
And one element here one important element here is that there is one region that will call it total

178
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,030
US.

179
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,450
I'm not sure if it's actually shown in here or not.

180
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,010
OK so but in general there is a reason to call a total U.S. I believe it might be like overlapping here

181
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,880
and actually gonna be using total U.S. mainly in the nexus in this and the second part of the of this

182
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,160
exercise to actually visualize the data is specifically for the total U.S. we're comparing just the

183
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,710
overall market kind of thing.

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,430
OK.

185
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:53,680
All right.

186
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,840
Let's take a look at another graph.

187
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,030
Let's maybe review the the year.

188
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,750
Let's compare for example the sales compare for the year.

189
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,200
OK.

190
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:13,300
What we could do is say OK let's do a census that count plot and what we could do we can pass along

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,410
X as the year and we can use the data which is simply our data frame rate we're going to say avocado

192
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,110
underscored data frame.

193
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,420
All right.

194
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,540
And let's run that.

195
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,890
And that's what we're getting here getting the year is 2015 16 17 18 and that's the counts the number

196
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:37,390
of samples that we have here the count is around you know 50 500 pretty much stable and 2018 because

197
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,320
the year wasn't you know kind of complete the data wasn't complete in this case.

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,780
So it has been you know chop kind of hit a little bit.

199
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,120
All right.

200
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
OK sounds good.

201
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,650
All right.

202
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:56,630
What we could do again right now is that let's go ahead and review the data.

203
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,070
OK.

204
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:03,440
So if you guys remember we have been able to go ahead and get a full gateau underscored data frame.

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,750
Right.

206
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,490
And if you take a look at the data frame and that's all that's the overall data right.

207
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,380
Let me zoom out a little bit.

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,230
That's the overall data we've got we got here.

209
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,350
So we have got data average price total volume and so on so forth.

210
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,940
Honestly speaking I'm not interested in any of this.

211
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,850
OK all what I need I need my date and I need my average price.

212
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,630
That's all what I need specifically for the profit

213
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,590
media operation that's for predicting the time series.

214
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,450
So what we could do.

215
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,150
Going to say OK I forgot to underscore profits.

216
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,860
I'm going to define a new data frame.

217
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,390
All right.

218
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,400
Def and that data frame specifically dedicated for the profit operation only.

219
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,100
OK.

220
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,580
When I say I forgot avocado here.

221
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm going to go ahead into the data frame and then not I'm not going to take the entire thing.

222
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,690
I'm just gonna extract mainly the column that I'm interested in I'm interested in date.

223
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,080
Right.

224
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,870
And I'm interested as well in the average price all right.

225
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,350
Okay.

226
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,800
Looks good.

227
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,070
Let's run it and let's take a look at the profit section.

228
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,180
If you run that that's all we're getting we're getting the date and we're getting the average price

229
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,890
looks perfect looks great.

230
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,030
And it's actually has been you know looks good has been sorted.

231
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,520
If you guys take a look here you'll find the last decade was March of 2013 and that's why when we actually

232
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,270
plotted the count here you'll find that count is not that much as we started 2018 right.

233
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,040
Okay.

234
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,430
All right.

235
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,770
That's great.

236
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,480
All right.

237
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,390
The next step is I wanted to do here is let's go ahead and actually train or you know like prepare the

238
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,330
data to actually apply the profit.

239
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,670
All right.

240
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,410
So that we're going to actually going to be doing in the next lectures and that's pretty much all what

241
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,400
we have for this lecture.

242
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,830
I hope you guys enjoy it.

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,730
And please stay tuned in the next lecture going to start training our actual you know kind of model

244
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,950
per say and try to predict the price in the future using the profit package.

245
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,620
All right see you guys in the next lecture.
