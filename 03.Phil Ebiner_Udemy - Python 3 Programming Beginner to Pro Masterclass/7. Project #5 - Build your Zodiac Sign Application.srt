00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello everyone and welcome to this project and this project we're going to ask the user to input their

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,380
date of birth.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,180
Okay.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:18,090
And then we're going to predict or you know provide the H along with a zodiac sign.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,040
Okay.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,640
So here I tried to kind of include the table that includes all the zodiac signs along the date of birth

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,280
range.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,830
So we have you know alias for example between March 21st and April 19th.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,490
We have let's say cancer between June 21st and July 22nd.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,100
So the whole idea is once the user input the date of the date of birth then you can simply apply and

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,020
if condition they can select key between these do two dates.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,220
OK.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,910
Then there will be cancer between these two days going to be Leo and so on and so forth.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,520
Again it's pretty simple kind of game for say or a project that it's you.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,390
How can we deal.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,640
How can how can we open information from the computer leg to date.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,240
For example today's date because you won't get the expect the Predict the age along with some you know

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,940
like if condition which is again pretty pretty simple.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,170
So let's get started.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,050
First we're going to ask the user to improve the date of birth including the year the month and the

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,540
day.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,140
OK.

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,720
So that would be the first step.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,550
Let's ignore this for now.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,120
First up I'm going to put it as Cookie input.

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,830
We have done that before several times.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,380
What's your year of birth and then going to give them examples.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,550
Well so with the format we're going to be matching our example and they give input our what's your month

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,890
of birth as well as specified let's say October here.

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,300
And then what's your day going to be the day of your day of birth.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,060
Going to be let's say 25 gay and they'll be out a year 1992 month end.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,820
OK.

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,360
All right.

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,150
Once you do that then we can actually print to the use it okay that's your date of birth is and then

35
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,560
we can specify Okay that's our first variable day and they're going to add plus they're going to add

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,630
here our backslash.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,130
OK.

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,190
Just to specify the date as it can kind of you know like a date for a match going to be kind of good.

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,830
Visually I think it adds plus months I think an hour plus as well as the year here too.

40
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,120
And are going to be our.

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,450
You're going to say okay that's going to be your date of birth.

42
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,810
Is that is something.

43
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,890
Let's run it unless it's okay.

44
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,810
What's your birth excepts going to say 1990 for instance.

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,280
And then what's your month or birth at say.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,650
Or five.

47
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,640
And then they let's say 25 and they're going to New York.

48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,310
Good.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,710
They can actually plot it they're going to be plotted to the user your date of birth is let's say 25.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,040
File 5 1990 which makes sense.

51
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,360
And the next step is in order to know the age we need to know what's today's date.

52
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,040
Okay.

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:55,580
I wanted to do that you can actually use an important important date OK to use from Date Time important

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,610
date and then it can actually go there from the computer can exchange information about the date of

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,400
the time.

56
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,450
It's very useful to actually get critical information about what's happening right now.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,850
So I'm going to do here in the UK today are I going now for use a method today.

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,930
What date.

59
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,600
They'll give us our today's date.

60
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,720
Get.

61
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,940
Actually before doing any any activity.

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,800
It's actually it's a little copy here and let's sign it.

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,250
So when you run it or it can actually you these dates they will tell us.

64
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,390
That's what today's data let's say 2013 10 21 for example.

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,030
Right.

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
OK.

67
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,060
The next step is we wanted to simply put the Year because when I think the age we cannot predict the

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,760
age in a very simple form just from a use perspective.

69
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,890
So when I say okay we're going to take today's date.

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,020
Today's date.

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,840
Sorry dot year which is going to be our first argument coming back coming back.

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,360
If we take that if we subtracted minus the input of the user input here which is already year that would

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,760
tell us what in each case.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,610
So you don't get a print of the user.

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,370
Your age is something you know age years old no.

76
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,900
Let's run it.

77
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,730
You are twenty eight years old.

78
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,020
Right.

79
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:19,120
And that will be the kind of you know the first section or the first requirement out of your project.

80
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,360
The next step is that we want it to specify what zodiac sign.

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,800
There's the use of have.

82
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,460
So simply put we're going to create you know if conditions if for example the date was between March

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,070
21st and April 19th.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
Then you were going to print areas and so on.

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,120
If it's between June 21st and June July 22nd they get cancer and so on and so forth.

86
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,880
So if we're going to go here we're going to say okay if and then specify if the month for instance equals

87
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,260
to 12 that means well in December end the day is greater than 22.

88
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,130
Okay.

89
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,180
Or.

90
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:57,680
Right.

91
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,760
And then he would have specified many take.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,450
Capricorn If you have a Capricorn here you will see that it's between December 22nd and January 19th

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,380
which means it's between two month month month of December.

94
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,890
Okay.

95
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,860
There's the you know let's say it last in December and the first nine these in janeway.

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,980
Okay.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,210
So to do that we're going to focus if we are in December end our day was greater then 22nd.

98
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,700
Eight.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:39,040
That means you're 22nd on December or you are between Or if you are in janeway sorry you are in Jena

100
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,800
with the month equals to one.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,460
That means you're jeanne-marie END IF THE days is the 19 then we're just going to print then our side

102
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,130
going to be capricornia.

103
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,660
And then at the end obviously going to the site.

104
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,010
And then you get to do all the conditions for the rest of them.

105
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,100
Again if the save areas there between you then you're And one month of the third or games is a mean

106
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,720
March and the days grow then 21 or in April.

107
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,640
And it is less than 19 and so on so forth there's be much how can you create a condition to go ahead

108
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,360
and scan through the entire zodiac signs.

109
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:15,930
Right.

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,260
Let's action on that part.

111
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,860
They'll tell you okay that's your Gemini and that's pretty much how can you.

112
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,790
You run it again.

113
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,570
Colonel let's start and clear output and let's turn it again.

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,230
So you run it that you're okay what's the year it's 1992.

115
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,510
Let's say you're in one of the bullies to say 10 to 25 and they'll tell you okay that's your data which

116
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,810
is you know 25 10 1990 to get to today's date plotted these days.

117
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,910
Again we'll get the difference of here.

118
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,800
You're 26 years old and if there's nothing you're okay then you're a scorpio and me which makes sense.

119
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,650
Right.

120
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,390
Right.

121
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,900
And that's pretty much all I want to have with this project.

122
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,990
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in my next project.
