00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,700
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,470
I'm going to show you kind of a quick overview of the exercise questions for this section.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,440
So again here.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,180
These exercises are mainly dedicated for the topics that we cover so far.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,520
They are variables datatypes mathematical operations presidents which is kind of an audit of operation

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,830
and then how to perform variable assignment.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,230
OK so again I'm going to walk you through a quick overview of the code.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,730
Okay.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,240
Just you know like of the questions I hope you guys we're going to kind of attempt to solve the questions

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,650
again if you can find if you can solve any of these questions.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,790
That's totally fine.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,070
Just going to include a video right after this video that includes you know all the solutions and then

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,400
I'll walk you through the solutions and the great details.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,130
OK.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,640
Again if you go to any of the of the folder here.

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,030
You guys we're going to find for ANY topic for example you'll find that there is to A B and C there

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,300
is the concept which is you know introducing the concept you know like we're going to cover for example

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,220
a print operation followed by the questions and then followed by the solutions.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,670
OK.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,370
So now I mean the first topic which is one be for the exercise questions.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,280
OK so here for example I'm asking you okay what will this go generate.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,600
So again and I wanted to run the court expecting you guys you know if you're on the court obviously

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,250
you can and you know what the cold will generate heat I'm just asking you okay tell me what you what

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,870
you expect you know based on your understanding of programming in general which one should it be should

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,240
it be 10 20 or 15.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,950
Okay.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,860
Masking looking at what's the type of x for example.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm asking you if let's say if we divide x y y and z working in any part of that again please don't

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,280
run the cell and make it I'm expecting you just you know maybe write on a piece of paper on the side.

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,160
What do you expect to see and then then you run it and then you you know just make sure that you understand

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,690
the difference between for example integer and float and so on.

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,130
Next question here and I'm asking you okay given the area here over a potential you know which is you

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:10,020
know a year or two sites or the emv and asking you to write the code that calculate the area and perimeter

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,040
of a rectangle.

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,910
OK.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,180
And then I'm asking you to assume any values for the length and width so you can define again any variable.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,410
Put a whatever vedat value be whatever value.

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,570
And then you can.

39
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,110
I wanted to calculate the area and skeletally the perimeter.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,690
That's it.

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,220
Okay.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
And then you get an idea called here.

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,630
Here I'm asking you okay what will this could generate.

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:31,900
OK.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,010
So define a couple of variables here.

46
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,410
Ideas to try to get to you on the president's key which operation going to be performed first.

47
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,360
Again please don't trust the code because if you're not into it then there's no point right.

48
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,190
So you know I'm just asking you to do is simply to run to run this quote here.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,720
OK.

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,540
So he is simply I'm just wanted to show this is going to be easy and this is going to be easy.

51
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,170
We don't want to simply run this OK.

52
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,070
Come up with an answer from this.

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,530
Come up with an easy answer and then here we're going to find that a Z.

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,210
And then I want you to tell me OK.

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,740
What's dead value we're going to look like.

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,230
OK.

57
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,300
Here I want you to write the code to test if a number is even or odd.

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,560
OK.

59
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,540
Please try to check and review the mod OK operation and is it is very simple lines of code that can

60
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,370
tell me if number is even or odd.

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,100
OK.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,020
OK question number five I'm asking you to write a code that takes a number.

63
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,150
Square it and then take the result and get it square root afterwards.

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,480
Okay.

65
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,030
So just take a number.

66
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,890
Perform the square and then get the square root of the results.

67
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,210
But pretty much you're going to end up with the original value that you had before in the beginning.

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,590
OK.

69
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,270
That's the kind of you know question for you.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,560
Question 6 I'm asking you to simply write the code that the dimensions of a cube which is a cube here.

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,830
And if its area and volume.

72
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,420
So again define find a value a put it whatever and then basically multiple Again these equations area

73
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,050
and volume.

74
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,040
OK question 7 I'm asking you to write a code that takes a number and increment it three times.

75
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,870
So again you can increment it with the basic idea that we had before or with the specials.

76
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,770
You know like why.

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,960
Plus equal 1.

78
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,010
For example why.

79
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,210
Plus equal 3.

80
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,570
For example look at.

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,810
Question 8.

82
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,790
I want you to tell me what went wrong.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,150
OK so something went wrong here and I am asking you to adjust the code so the answer here or the value

84
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,550
of z would be equal to 255.

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,030
Okay.

86
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,670
Here.

87
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,530
Question 9.

88
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,940
I'm asking you to write a code that perform the following mathematical operation simply to get Z equals

89
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,530
to the absolute value of x minus y.

90
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,180
Multiply the answer by experts way gay.

91
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,410
Again kind of a quick exercise for you to know what you mean how to perform absolute and how to multiply

92
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,050
to perform of the placation operation.

93
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,730
Go on.

94
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,750
Here I'm asking you to simply go through again.

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,810
This didn't cover that mainly in the.

96
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,860
Lecture.

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
He this kind of thing more additional reading for you.

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,820
Okay here there are some kind of restrictions on some of the variables you know that so you can just

99
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,730
go and name value very whatever you want.

100
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,890
You can for example name a variable would call it.

101
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,910
If for example why.

102
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,390
Because if means something else for Python.

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,550
Okay so these are kind of qualities reserved words so you are not allowed to use these words.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,470
Okay so I'm asking you okay go through these valid values and tell me which one should be removed.

105
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,120
And again go here to the print here and remove the values you know so it's basically this called will

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,590
run.

107
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,310
So if you're on it right now you'll see there's tons of errors we're going to happen.

108
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,280
OK try to read more for example see which ones should be removed from here.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,020
Which one should be kept right.

110
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,080
And then here in the print of the print again commend by removing the values that you know that you

111
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,340
think should be removed.

112
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,970
Here to perform or to execute this cells successfully.

113
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,800
All right again.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,880
Section.

115
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,000
Question number 11.

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,180
I'm asking you to write a code that takes Celsius temperature and convert it to for tonight.

117
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,960
Simply put.

118
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,490
Here we have again if you guys are not familiar in general that are kind of two kind of there's a metric

119
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,040
system and there is another kind of you know system in general that we we use you know compare if you're

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,100
living in the US or Canada or whatever.

121
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,810
So there's kind of a conversion between Celsius temperature and Fahrenheit temperature.

122
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,180
Okay so for example if there is let's say 20 degrees C Okay that's equivalent to 68 per night.

123
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,840
If it's let's say zero degrees C that's equivalent to three to four in a night.

124
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,010
So the equation is this.

125
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,020
K. So what I'm asking you to do is to simply dry a code.

126
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,650
It takes any cell system preachers.

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,340
You know maybe pick any cell system prettier here and obviously implement this equation.

128
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,660
So you can convert from Celsius to freedom right value.

129
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
Right.

130
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,130
Again all these codes are in you know like they are simple but they are very useful.

131
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,400
Right.

132
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,980
Because now you can actually use it in practice to like to perform the conversion you call it.

133
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,660
So you can sort of actually implementing that equation mathematically if you write that code then you

134
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,700
can refer to it.

135
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,270
And you know and make use of it basically and then moving forward.

136
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,330
When I'm going to show you with it.

137
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,410
We know we're going to learn how to take input from the user.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,280
So if you're on a code you can actually develop an application and within that application you have

139
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,120
to prompt the user to enter that value.

140
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,400
So you don't have to actually put that value in here.

141
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:24,780
Okay.

142
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,650
And define it beforehand.

143
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,930
You get to take that value as an input from the user perform the mathematical operation on it and it

144
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,910
can actually even printed to the user afterwards.

145
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,870
In Fahrenheit you know which is you know really completely interesting and functional code moving forward.

146
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,980
Question 12 and the last one I believe.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,860
Okay which is I'm asking you to write a code that converts from kilometre per hour into miles per hour.

148
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,750
And I'm asking you to refer to this equation here below.

149
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,050
So I want you to simply assume any value for kilometre per hour.

150
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:04,180
You guys can see here again you know for let's say if it's for example like 85 or 90 for example kilometre

151
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,170
per hour that's equivalent to around 55 miles an hour per say Okay.

152
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,770
So what I'm asking you to do is again simply put implement this equation in a very simple form which

153
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,730
is again you're going to come up with a function of code that convert from kilometre per hour to Miles

154
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,350
per hour and you can do it as well.

155
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,920
Vice versa.

156
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,650
Obviously moving forward too.

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,450
And again in the future we're going to learn how to prompt the users to input the value in km but our

158
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,020
reform the operation and then printed in mind put out our eye.

159
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,300
And again hopefully once you get finished these exercises you're going to become familiar with how to

160
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:44,130
define variables how to perform variable assignments perform presidents and basic mathematical operations.

161
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:44,640
Okay.

162
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,510
You should be proud of yourself.

163
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,170
Once you complete that even again if you if you if you get stuck.

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,070
No problem.

165
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,800
Just go and refer to the solutions.

166
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,720
Jupiter notebook and digital solutions as well.

167
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,400
Video lectures.

168
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,880
Alright.

169
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,370
And that's pretty much all I want to have for this section.

170
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,450
Good luck and see you guys in the solutions section.
