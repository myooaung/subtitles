00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,710
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,500
cases and infected two point one million people in 2015.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,610
Early diagnosis significantly increase the chances of survival.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,630
The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumours into malignant or benign machine learning

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,390
techniques can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,350
Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,260
Why 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine only tickets.

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,620
In this case study our task is to classify tumours into malignant or benign tumours using features of

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,530
genes from several cell images.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,520
Let's take a look at the cancer diagnosis and classification process.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,820
So the first step in the cancer diagnosis process is to do what we call a fine needle aspirin or any

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,940
prosess which is simply extracting some of the cells out of the tumour.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,880
And at this stage we don't know that yuman is malignant or benign.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,210
It may seem a ligament or benign it's as you can see these are kind of the images of the benign tumour.

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,630
And this is a malignant tumour.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,650
And when we say benign that means that the tumour is kind of not spreading across the body so the patient

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,690
is safe somehow it's if it's malignant that means it's it's a cancerous.

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,890
That means we need to intervene and actually stopping cancer growth.

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,560
Right.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,690
And what we do here in the machine learning aspect so now as we execute all these images and we wanted

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,700
to specify if that cancer out of these images is malignant or benign.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,330
That's the whole idea.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,560
So what we do with that we extract out of these images some features when we see features that mean

24
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:54,150
some characteristics out of the image such as radius for example the cells such as texture perimeter

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,190
area smoothness and so on.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,590
And then we feed all these features in to kind of our machine learning model.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,950
In a way which is kind of a brain in a way.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,650
Okay if you guys are not familiar with machine learning techniques in general we're going to convert

29
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,490
to can you separate them from scratch.

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,670
But again if you if this is the first kind of a case study or find a first project that's going to work

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:22,320
on machine learning the ideas we want to teach the machine how to basically classify images or classify

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,440
data and tell us okay if it's malignant or benign for example in this case without any human intervention

33
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,460
which is going to turn them out of the ones the motherless teen would good to go we can use it in practice

34
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,560
to classify new images as we move forward.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,560
And that's kind of the procedure or the cancer diagnosis procedure.

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,850
And by that we conclude the business case.

37
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,710
Now let's shift in to some of the machine learning twirps.

38
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,940
I hope you guys enjoyed that section and see you in the next section.
