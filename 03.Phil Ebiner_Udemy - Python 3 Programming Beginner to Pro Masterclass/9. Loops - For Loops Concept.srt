00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello everyone and welcome to this new section and this section.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,610
We're going to cover very important basics in programming in general which is known as loops.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:11,910
OK.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,630
So we're going to cover mainly two major or two important types of loops and we call them for loops

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,360
and while loops.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,700
All right.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,740
And afterwards we're going to have tons of exercises ready for you mainly dedicated to for loops and

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,300
while loops.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,050
So let's get started.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,080
Let's see how can we actually create a loop first and we'll see how can we go through it in so many

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,470
different exercises and practice through many examples.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,720
All right.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,560
So let's get started.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,520
First of all why do we need loops or what's the point of having for loops.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,630
So the overall idea is that we if let's assume that we wanted for example to let's say print for example

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,170
Hello.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,160
OK.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,460
Very simple basic line of code.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,580
So let's say if a press shift enter you would find that you found here.

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,040
Hello.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,310
Right.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,810
All right sounds good.

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,050
What if you wanted to repeat this let's say 10 times.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,940
All right so maybe one solution.

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,130
Someone can say OK maybe we can copy this and paste here and press shift enter and then copy paste it

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,160
several times shift enter and so on.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,010
This is obviously not an efficient way of performing or of doing this.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,280
Right.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,320
So obviously there is an easier way to repeat if you wanted to repeat certain command several times.

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,950
Then we can use what we called loops which is a way of just instead of repeating the exact same command

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,330
several times within the code you just write it once and somehow you create a for loop in there to actually

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,580
put it in a very kind of it's just two lines of code.

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,700
You can literally print like thousands of these hellos.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,980
All right.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,150
OK that's the overall idea of why do we need loops in general.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,580
And why do we need for a loop for example in particular.

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,820
All right.

38
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,030
OK.

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,570
So let's go ahead and actually delete all this and let's get started and see how can we create our first

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,350
loop.

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,770
All right.

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,330
Let's assume that I want it to that I for example have the lists and lists this list.

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,870
I call it my list and I'd put there one two and three.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,400
OK.

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,460
And if I press shift enter and if I take a look at my list you would find that there is here that there

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,730
is.

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,060
These are the three numbers which is 1 2 3.

48
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,630
Let's assume that I wanted for instance to print all these elements within my list like I wanted to

49
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,190
print one first element within the list.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
Second element within the list.

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,260
And then third element within the list.

52
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,790
How can I do that.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,040
All right.

54
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,950
So what you could do you can then create a for loop to do it.

55
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,690
So let's see how can we do that.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,210
First of all this is the syntax of a for loop.

57
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,440
We're going to say for I n and then you write here the name of the list that you have here which is

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,670
my list.

59
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,720
And then you put column at the end and then once you press enter you will find that here.

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
Basically there's an indent here.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,370
So you actually have there is a space kind of in here.

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,420
And that means that whatever we're going to be writing here indicates that's the body of my four.

63
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,390
OK.

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,690
So that means whatever we're going to be writing here we're going to be repeated several times depending

65
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,470
on this I'm going to.

66
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,560
Again I haven't discussed what's happening here but let's see how can we do that.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,310
It's going to take a for i in my list and what I'm going to do.

68
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,590
All right.

69
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,230
So what you could do afterwards you can say OK I wanted to print my variables I.

70
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,110
OK.

71
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,760
And if you press shift enter here we go then you will find that there is numbers 1 2 3 which has all

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,770
the elements contained within my list here have been printed.

73
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,160
All right.

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,290
So what happened here.

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,390
Let's see how can we read it.

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:38,990
OK.

77
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,070
So what happened in is here.

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm saying ok for I can name it whatever you want to call it index i n.

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,130
And then you indicate let's say the name of the list that you have which is my list.

80
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,310
One two three.

81
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,530
And you simply what you're saying is I think OK Please go ahead grab each and individual elements within

82
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,130
that list.

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,840
So for instance first one we're going to grab the first element which is 1.

84
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,790
So when the first run of the loop.

85
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,950
I will have no equal to 1.

86
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,680
OK.

87
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,030
So I equals to one in the first loop and then I'm going to go here.

88
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,910
I'm gonna say OK print that number.

89
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,820
Print one.

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,900
And that's why we've got print one.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,870
Then what happened is we're actually going to go up again and then we're going to go here take the second

92
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,250
element within my list and that's my second element which is two.

93
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,750
So I in this case will contain that second the value associated with the second element in my list which

94
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,560
is 2 and then going to go here and print to go up again to get third element and then go here and print

95
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,010
it again.

96
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,020
And that's why you print the number three.

97
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,290
All right.

98
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,080
OK.

99
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,690
And that's pretty much how can you run any for loops which is very very easy and very intuitive.

100
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,180
So next step is let's assume that I wanted for example to let's say print Hello world three times.

101
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,920
So when I say okay for I and I'm going to say let's say my list.

102
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,350
All right.

103
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,030
Which is simply what we have here.

104
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,440
Okay.

105
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,020
I know that there are three elements in here and say OK for I in my list I can simply do actually two.

106
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,480
Two things are going to say OK print I can print my variable I.

107
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,320
Which is exactly the same as before.

108
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,990
And I can maybe do something as well maybe I'm going to go and print let's say hello world afterword

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,710
afterwards.

110
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,060
OK.

111
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,060
So every time I'm going to go print i.

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,500
So we're gonna say let's say print one two and three and afterwards after you print each of these numbers

113
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,480
you're going to print Hello World.

114
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,620
So pretty impressive enter.

115
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,170
And here we go.

116
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,860
So now we come in number one which is here.

117
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,690
And then afterwards we print Hello World up again.

118
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,460
The second iteration within the loop I'm going to print number two.

119
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,830
And then I'm going to print Hello World go up again then print number three and then print Hello World

120
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,910
which is great.

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,700
OK.

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,370
Correct.

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,530
So let's assume that I will have for example a list of strings.

124
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,370
Again I'm just trying to expose you guys with like you know like show you different examples within

125
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,010
the for loop.

126
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,430
OK.

127
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,800
And how to create loops.

128
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,720
So this is what we have another list and my list is defined of this my list equals two let's say couple

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,910
of let's say fruits identified them as Apple I mean the five of us let's say blueberries

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,900
blueberries.

131
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,320
GATES Actually they are here.

132
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:22,560
And we are going to let's say specify mangoes specify let's say watermelon actually.

133
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
Again here watermelon and maybe grab one more fruit as well.

134
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,770
Let's call it apricots for instance let's shift enter.

135
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,730
Here we go.

136
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,430
Let's take a look at my list.

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,420
Copy and paste.

138
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,530
Let's take a look at it.

139
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,350
Then you come up here with Apple blueberries mangoes and Waterman.

140
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,800
Let's assume that I wanted to for example let's say print all the elements within my within my string

141
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,330
and here within my list.

142
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,930
OK.

143
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,700
Which is simply a list of strings.

144
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,950
OK.

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,040
So I could do say OK for I can call it whatever in my list.

146
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,190
And then again you press column enter.

147
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,160
You'll find that here you have got the tab.

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,870
You're going to say print the value of i.

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,530
That's it.

150
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,380
Ships enter.

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
And here we go.

152
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,430
First of all you're going to go here.

153
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,470
I in my lists or first we're going to go ahead and grab the first element within the list which is Apple.

154
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,010
And going I come here you're going to say print apple and then you go up again.

155
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,510
You take a second element within my list which is making blueberries we're going to come here print

156
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,200
blueberries or come again mangoes and so on and that's why you're printing all of it here.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,870
OK.

158
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,680
All right sounds great.

159
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,680
So afterwards let's maybe take another example let's assume that I wanted for instance to loop to create

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,760
a loop and that loop was gonna be created over a string.

161
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,110
All right.

162
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,880
So what do you mean.

163
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:47,260
So what could you take it for I in let's say I have a string here it's called mangoes for example.

164
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,120
OK.

165
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,960
Or just mangoes like this and what I could do.

166
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,810
I'm going to say OK every time.

167
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,250
Please go ahead and print I.

168
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,330
So what's going to happen here when I say Okay Please go ahead.

169
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,360
For I in mangoes so every time you were going to go here grab a letter within the string.

170
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,130
So first we're going to grab the first letter was gonna be M and that's why I printed them up again.

171
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,730
You're going to print get get a.

172
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,140
And that's why I printed a and so on and that's what's happening here.

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,910
OK.

174
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,860
So simply put what we have done so far so we're able to go ahead in their print.

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,180
If we wanted to print let's say numbers within the list I would be able to do that phone it let's say

176
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,220
to print you know like hello world or whatever I can do with here too if I wanted to have a list as

177
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,730
well.

178
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,740
But that list contains strings in there.

179
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,510
Let's say Apple blueberries whatever.

180
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,110
Then I'll be able to print it as well and I can also be able to go ahead create the for loop that goes

181
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,810
through the letters each individual letters or characters and actually print them as well.

182
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,800
All right then that's kind of the power of full looks you can actually do it in a way that you can print

183
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,220
20 you can print you know like characters within the strings you can print strings within a list you

184
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,270
can print in print numbers within a list you can repeat on whatever you wanted to do.

185
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,540
All right.

186
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,070
OK.

187
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,330
So one more example example let's assume that I wanted for example to have let's say list of numbers

188
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,040
and define these numbers.

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,050
Let's say one two three three four five and let's say six.

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,850
And what I wanted to do they wanted to sum up all these numbers.

191
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,290
So I wanted to create a loop.

192
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,520
OK.

193
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,650
And this loop was simply going to go ahead here and grab simply like a number.

194
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:23,940
All right.

195
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,310
And added to kind of you know an accumulator we'll call accumulator and then the next time I'm going

196
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,440
to go in the iteration take the second number edit as well.

197
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,860
The third number edit as well.

198
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,180
And that's what I keep doing until I actually sum all the numbers in there.

199
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,160
So to do that.

200
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,210
OK first step I'm going to take some equals to zero.

201
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,390
So when I say some equals to zero I can actually let's call it let's say some of numbers equals to zero.

202
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,450
And this is simply what we call an accumulator.

203
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,400
This is just a variable that carries or accumulates all the variables or the summation let's say let's

204
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,400
say multiplication and so on and then initialize it to zero first and what it could do afterwards.

205
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,610
I'm gonna take a for number in numbers all right.

206
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,600
And that's kind of a famous way of actually writing kind of a for loop here.

207
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,170
I have a list of numbers right.

208
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,960
What I could do.

209
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,150
I'm going to say Okay I'm going to create the for loop and that for loop will go ahead.

210
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,760
Here take a number.

211
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,170
Within numbers.

212
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,070
Think about it.

213
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,240
Okay.

214
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,860
I'm going to create.

215
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,520
Take one and then for the first iteration and then take 2 for the second iteration and so on.

216
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,330
So number one simply cannot be assigned to each and every individual variable in here within my list

217
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,920
afterwards I'm going to say okay some.

218
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,370
All right.

219
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:45,960
Or some underscore numbers which is my accumulators accumulator equals to some underscore numbers plus

220
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,600
no.

221
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:48,850
All right.

222
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,690
OK.

223
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,880
So what happened here.

224
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,820
So what happened is is kid OK.

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Let's go ahead and take my some numbers which is initialized to 0.

226
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,540
So let's take a look at the for loop when we actually starting just starting in the beginning.

227
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,540
So what happened is numbers num for number in numbers.

228
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,680
So numbers we have here have 1 2 3 4 5 and 6.

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
All right.

230
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,880
So first iteration I'm gonna go take number the first one in numbers.

231
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,310
So number here will have the value of 1.

232
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,330
So here I have one right.

233
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:26,890
So 1 plus some numbers which has initialized to zero so zero plus one equals two one.

234
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,190
All right.

235
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,730
So what we are doing was simply simply kind of overwriting every time taking the some numbers old add

236
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,830
number to it and write it over to some numbers and create a new accumulator.

237
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,080
And that's why we call it some numbers new per.

238
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,960
So in the first iteration we're going to be doing we're actually gonna be adding 0 plus 1 and that should

239
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,760
generate simply the new value is going to be 1.

240
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,070
And what's going to happen is in the second loop we're actually going to go ahead.

241
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,190
Again I'm going I think the next number which is gonna be two.

242
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,880
Right.

243
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,090
So I'm going to come here at 2 plus 1 and that will become 3.

244
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,600
And so on I keep repeating this simply like several times and they'll be going to be actually our let's

245
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
say second loop or second iteration.

246
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,010
So second iteration will gonna be let's say I'm going to take the new some numbers play one add to it

247
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,910
the second value here which is 2.

248
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,220
Right.

249
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,410
And that should generate number three and so on.

250
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,240
I keep repeating this several times until I actually finish all the numbers in here.

251
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,860
And that should generate simply our accumulator.

252
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,540
So we could do afterwards going to take a print and print some underscored numbers.

253
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,280
All right.

254
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,570
So please shift enter.

255
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,410
Here we go.

256
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,140
So now we obtain some numbers which is 21 which is basically a summation of six plus five plus four

257
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,240
or three plus two plus one.

258
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,780
All right.

259
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,300
So now it's time for a quick challenge.

260
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,350
What I'm asking you guys to do is to do repeat pretty much the exact same elements in here.

261
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,680
OK.

262
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,380
Exact same code per say but I don't want to attain the sum of numbers I wanted to get the multiplication

263
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,050
of all numbers.

264
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:06,150
I'm going to get multiplication of all the elements all my apologies all the elements in the list.

265
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,820
Please go ahead pause the video and maybe make some changes.

266
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,580
Again this numbers keep it the same.

267
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,960
Maybe some changes to here maybe some changes to here to just be able to obtain the multiplication of

268
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,770
all these elements together.

269
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,470
All right.

270
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,330
Please go ahead pass the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge

271
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,760
all right.

272
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,430
You guys were able to figure out the challenge.

273
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,160
So what I ask you has to do is to simply copy this paste off here and instead of just summing all the

274
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,360
numbers I wanted to multiply all the numbers in order to do that let's actually remove this confusion.

275
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,280
So in order to do this.

276
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,140
Simply put what you could do.

277
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,960
You can say OK I need to multiply all these numbers.

278
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:53,020
So first of all the accumulator here I can set it to zero OK because zero multiplied by any value we're

279
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,190
going to be zero.

280
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,320
I need to said that multiple that variable to one and instead of calling it some numbers I'm going to

281
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,170
call it let's say multiply let's say numbers let's say just call it whatever you call them multiply

282
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,800
numbers which is simply contains the multiplication of all the values.

283
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,170
And what I could do here you're going to say OK go to each number grab the numbers right.

284
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,820
I'm going to grab one two three and so on every time instead of addition I'm just going to make it multiplication

285
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,900
and instead of some numbers I'm just going to define it as multiply numbers or copy paste we're going

286
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,840
to copy paste and here I'm going to go ahead and multiply and print multiply numbers.

287
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,290
All right.

288
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,610
That's pretty much it.

289
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,480
Press shift enter and here we go.

290
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,910
We'll end up with seven hundred and twenty which is simply the multiplication of all these numbers together.

291
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,290
All right.

292
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,880
If you guys were able to figure out the challenge and I hope the lecture was was pretty easy and that

293
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,820
would conclude our lecture.

294
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,990
Let's go ahead and review what we have done so far.

295
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,570
So in this lectures we're able to get a get kind of you know what I can and then head start and learn

296
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,490
how can we create a for loop.

297
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:57,730
All right.

298
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,770
And the overall idea of for loops is that we wanted to repeat a certain part within the code several

299
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,500
times.

300
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,950
And that's what we have done here.

301
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,490
We're able to repeat and print for example all the elements within my list which is one two and three

302
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:16,540
here and we're able as well to let's say if you wanted to repeat like a print operation like I have

303
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,800
done here with print in the numbers and we printed as well hello world.

304
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,980
And then afterwards we'll be able as well to do is to print elements or strings within our list.

305
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,520
So not just numbers we can actually print as well as strings which apples you know blueberries and so

306
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,510
on and then we're able as well to print characters to such as you know like if we do for I n and then

307
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,020
we define any string then we'll be able to actually print all the characters within our string.

308
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,480
And then finally here we're able to create kind of a mini mini code that would help us to define an

309
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,970
accumulator to repeat or sum all the elements within our list them here and also for a mini challenge

310
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,400
to multiply all the elements within the list.

311
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,940
All right.

312
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,860
That's pretty much what I have for this lecture I hope you guys enjoyed it in the next lecture.

313
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,480
I'm going to walk you through again more examples for the four loops and that should conclude that section

314
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,720
and they're going to move ahead to a kind of more advanced forms of loops such as y loops and different

315
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,250
kind of loops nested loops.

316
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,560
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture and see you in the next one.
