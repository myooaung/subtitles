00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,460
Hello everyone and welcome to this new project.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,450
I am super excited because this project is actually one of my favorites because it deals directly with

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:18,090
real data and real views and what we gonna be doing here is we're going to do Amazon Alexa review rating

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,170
analysis.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,920
All right.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,260
So basically you guys are not familiar whether there is Amazon had a device called mini Amazon Echo

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,970
or Amazon where it runs Amazon Alexa.

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,100
So think of it as kind of an assistant you can ask Alexa to do whatever Alexa.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,810
You know like for example play some music.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,520
Alexa what's the weather today and so on so forth and what we are trying to do here is that we are trying

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,000
to kind of do some analysis to the customer reviews.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,210
Actually three thousand Amazon customer reviews and star ratings and it just the overall idea here in

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,030
this project is to show you what we could do when we tried to do some analysis on like you know like

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,970
large amount of data like this especially if it includes you know kind of what we call it sentiment

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,150
analysis how can we do kind of some analysis to like if people love for example a product or not you

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,460
know if let's say people hate it or not if let's say there are some good reviews bad reviews and so

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,130
on to try to understand just get a feeling of what these customers are wanted to to do what to say.

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,190
So in this lecture I actually this project I'm going to dig into it like how to perform like the machine

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,800
learning out of it how can we let's say training classifier for example to let's say predict our star

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,570
rating when I'm going to be doing this.

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,450
What we gonna be doing here is just some data visualization some data manipulation I'm going to show

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,000
you how can we do that some data plotting to how can we actually like take data like this and visualize

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,770
it in an an amazing way.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,630
And that's pretty much what they'll be doing and the projects Project's actually pretty pretty interesting.

25
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,000
I hope you guys were going to be able to enjoy it.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,690
So let's take a look at kind of a project overview and I'll walk you through the key steps we're going

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,860
to be doing in this project and we're going to start again with a blank Jupiter notebook and then I

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,120
build up the project from scratch step by step.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,370
All right so let's take a look at the data.

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,840
So data set consists of three thousand Amazon customer reviews star ratings.

31
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,410
There is a data review that is a variant which is you know if you if you check out the Amazon's Web

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,430
site you would find that there are so many variance there is maybe like you know like White for example

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,160
color there may be like charcoal color there maybe like in a walnut color and so on.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,630
So maybe this information or that variance or call it variation might have an impact for example on

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,630
the customer reviews.

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,270
Who knows we'll going to try to find that information together and then the feedback of various Amazon

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,840
Alexa products which is the feedback column will merely include kind of you know the feedback was positive

38
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,290
or negative.

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,880
We're just going to have maybe like number one that indicates it's positive zero indicates it's negative

40
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,480
and so on.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,120
So the objective the objective is to discover insights into customer reviews and put forward maybe some

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,830
sentiment analysis on the data because when want to take a look at the data the source of the data obviously

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,890
the data is readily available online.

44
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,240
You can go to Kaggle through this link you'll find that information and please what we're gonna be doing

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,240
here in this project we're going to use a package or a library called the word cloud.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,970
Please go ahead and do your command window and do pip in this tall word cloud.

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,740
Okay.

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,540
You should find you know like like you know the if my take on it in my case it took like five seconds

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,150
or 10 seconds or so and it just went and downloaded.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,880
So when we go here and we do import for example word clouds actually coming up down here when we import

51
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,720
when we say

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,610
from word cloud import word cloud when we do this we'll be able to actually we're not going to get an

53
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,100
error right.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,710
But if you actually run the exact same notebook but without downloading workload or installing work

55
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,520
cloud then you know if we will come up with an error which is I don't want to do when it goes you guys

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,220
to to have any errors in here.

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,700
All right.

58
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,050
OK.

59
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,100
So let's take a look at what going to be doing here.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,100
First we're gonna pull the data and this is a data gonna be checking out.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,480
So it looks like we have you know multiple reviews in all of my echo.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,890
Loved it and so on and then we're gonna do some analysis.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,180
You know there's some reviews that we're having here.

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,710
We're gonna check out some you know the list of did some perform some data visualization.

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,220
We're going to check in all at positive reviews negative reviews.

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,890
We're going to see the count how many positive how many were negative.

67
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,600
We're going to see here the count plot the rating.

68
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,230
How many was five star rating.

69
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,170
How many was nothing.

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,070
How many.

71
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,230
We're gonna take a look at the different variations too.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,350
So these are the different variations of the products.

73
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,710
Again I'm just walking really quick because in the next lecture we're gonna start again from the blank

74
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,540
page you're going to do all these steps.

75
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm just when I walk you through what we're gonna be doing here in this project and then here we're

76
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,060
gonna take a look at our reviews and we're gonna do like really interesting kind of visualizations we'll

77
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,490
call it a word cloud.

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,590
It just you know like a plot that shows you like what are the common words that has been you know like

79
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,310
mentioned in the review it's really amazing like I really love this.

80
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,690
This very visual to tell you you know like these are the Commonwealth is Alexa there is love in here

81
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,020
that means you know a lot of people actually love the product that is you know like there's music there

82
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,310
is like great you know which is amazing there is like no everything you know can do everything for you

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,990
or something maybe bedroom.

84
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,810
A lot of people using it in the bedroom for instance there is like better product really and so on it's

85
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,980
it's really powerful where you're actually visualizing the data but I'm actually visualizing all the

86
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,080
data because it opened to visualize whatever data you want maybe bad reviews only good reviews only

87
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,090
and so on.

88
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,750
And then what we gonna be doing afterwards we to do some what we call a data cleaning or feature engineering

89
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,650
which is really amazing to what we're gonna do here.

90
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,840
We're going to look at every single word every single word in there and try to create kind of account

91
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,340
called account vector risers just try to count how many words for example of let's say Love has been

92
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,580
contained within review for example this is a review called Love Love Love for instance we'll going

93
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,450
to try to translate this into a number into a code and that code will indicate you know like an information

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,820
so we can why are we doing this we're doing this so we can know for example how many people for instance

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,250
let's say said the word love for example their comments how many people said the word let's say hate

96
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,420
may be like quality maybe stuff like that we can get a feel of what people are talking about and it's

97
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,880
really powerful.

98
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,440
All right.

99
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,530
And what we could do here afterwards we could

100
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,840
hear plot the histogram so I can show you how can we plot histogram of all the data here and then we're

101
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,340
going to take a look at maybe some of the reviews some of the shortest review some of the longest reviews

102
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,690
and that's pretty much it that we're going to conclude our project it's really interesting project C

103
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,650
stay tuned and I'll see you guys in the next lecture we're going to start with a blank Jupiter notebook

104
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,500
and build all this from scratch.

105
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,840
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
