Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.250
I'm super excited because we're getting closer to mastering Python programming and we'll be pretty much

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.850
ready to go ahead and start the melody practical project section.

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.490
Let's recap all we have done in the past.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.740
So in the previous lectures we're able to kind of get an overview of how to write for loops and we're

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.210
able to write you know for loop to print numbers print strings here and print characters and we're able

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.590
as well to kind of you know sum all the numbers within a list and even multiply all the numbers within

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.340
the list.

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.750
All right let's get going and maybe take a look at two more examples and that should conclude the for

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.840
loop section.

11
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.100
So let's assume that I wanted to define again.

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.310
Pretty much the same list here that I have my list here.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.800
So can I copy it here and paste it.

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.100
So what we're going to do here is I'm going to use kind of an advanced form of for loops.

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.230
We're going to add kind of a keywords and we call it enumerate.

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.470
OK.

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.870
Let's actually do this.

18
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.310
We're going to say enumerate.

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.820
OK.

20
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.600
And I'll tell you exactly what they mean by enumerate.

21
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.840
So let's assume that I wanted to print for instance all the elements here which is apples blueberries

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.880
mangoes and so on.

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.770
But I wanted to add an additional index to it too.

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.570
For example I wanted to say let's say 0 apple and then 1 blueberries and then two mangoes and so on.

25
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.490
So let's see how can we do that in order to do that.

26
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.310
Well are you gonna use again the keyword enumerate to perform this enumerate allows us to loop over

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.970
something and have an automatic counter as well associated with it.

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.120
OK.

29
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.960
Actually have a description here in the in the notes.

30
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.120
And if you actually going to copy that and paste it here this is kind of you know the summary of enumerates

31
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.420
enumerate allows us to loop again over something or whatever and have an automatic counter associated

32
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.470
with it let's go ahead and see how can we do that to do this.

33
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.110
It's going to take a four.

34
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.960
And what we could do and again we're going to use enumerate so enumerate would actually maybe use a

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.950
kind of two elements.

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.850
You need to have an index i and i need to have kind of the element which is the actual fruit that I

37
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.840
wanted to print here.

38
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.110
Which actual whatever the elements contain within the list.

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.280
So going to take a for I element in enumerate and here I'm going to pass along my list.

40
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.980
All right.

41
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.510
My apologies should be my list to be underscored okay.

42
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.640
And put Colin at the end.

43
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.520
Then afterwards I'm going to take a print and he's going to pass along I.

44
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.380
And the elements.

45
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.220
All right.

46
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.330
So what happened here.

47
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.080
Actually let's go ahead and actually let's run it for a split shift enter shift enter.

48
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.740
And here we go.

49
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.050
So what happened here is going to say OK for I an element in enumerate and my lists.

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.980
What happened is every time I'm gonna go ahead and grab the index of the element.

51
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.940
So this first element has an index 0 and I'm going to grab the actual element as well which is the actual

52
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.300
value within that list which is Apple.

53
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.220
So first iteration can grab 0 and Apple I'm going to go here and print I an element and then go up again.

54
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.410
Bring the second index which you're going to be one which is the index of blueberries and the element

55
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.840
which is blueberries and then print one of blueberries.

56
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.940
Go ahead print two and mangos and so on I keep repeating this.

57
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.710
And that's pretty much how can you use the word enumerate to actually predict the actual the actual

58
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.330
elements within the list along with the index too.

59
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.750
All right.

60
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.510
OK.

61
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.150
So now it's time for a very brief challenge.

62
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.660
What I want you guys to do is to use the innumerate as well.

63
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.310
But to go up here because remember this is kind of an example where we're able to go ahead create a

64
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.550
loop and pass along a print every single character within our string because remember the shift enter

65
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.800
that would be for eye mangos print eye.

66
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.550
OK so mangoes all the elements in here.

67
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.370
Well I want you guys to do instead.

68
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.130
OK.

69
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.650
This Please go ahead pause a video and use the enumerate as well to print the index along with this

70
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.160
with the characters as well.

71
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.640
So here I need 0 m 1 a two and.

72
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.300
And so on.

73
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.230
Please go ahead positive view and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

74
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.780
All right.

75
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.620
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

76
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.560
Well I gotta ask you to do is to simply use the innumerate as we have done in the past to perform pretty

77
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.090
much the same operation.

78
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.770
So what we could do again to take you for I an element in let's say here again let's call it enumerate

79
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.480
my list because remember it's going to take a enumerate and are going to pass along mangos and what

80
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.680
I could do here are going to take you.

81
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.400
I wanted to print the I and the element to enter.

82
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.910
And here we go.

83
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.290
Right.

84
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.930
So what happened here again is every time I wanted to get a pin the index which is 0 1 2 3 and so on

85
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.960
and the element which is simply the characters here which is m a n and so on every time I bring them

86
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.230
here and print again the index associated with the character in there.

87
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.190
That's pretty much how to use the word enumerate.

88
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.960
And that's pretty much all we have for this lecture I hope you guys enjoyed it.

89
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.870
Let's recap what we have done so far.

90
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.100
And this lecture we're able to use just learn about kind of an advanced form before loops by adding

91
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.390
the enumerate which is kind of allows us to print the actual elements which the actual let's say elements

92
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.930
within our list along with the index 0 1 2 3 and so on and we're able as well to do kind of a mini challenge

93
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.750
to do repeat pretty much the same operation but four characters if you're looping through characters

94
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.520
not through elements within a list.

95
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.320
And that's pretty much all we'll have for this lecture because I enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in

96
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.920
the next lecture.
