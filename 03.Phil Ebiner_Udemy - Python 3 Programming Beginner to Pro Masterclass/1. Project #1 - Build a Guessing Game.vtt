00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello everyone and welcome to this project and this project we're going to build a very simple what

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.500
we call a guessing game.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.680
So we're going to ask the computers to generate a random number whatever that number is from one to

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.700
let's say 50.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.440
Okay.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.870
And then we're going to ask the users to enter a number.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.700
And if that number matches the computer guess we're just going to print to the screen say Okay you guessed

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.670
that right.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.400
If not then we're going to start to guide the user to either increase the number or decrease the number

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.420
to actually get closer to the to the random number that has been generated by the computer.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.100
It's very very simple game but we're just going to teach you a lot of concepts about how to generate

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950
around the number how to outline.

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.970
IF ELSE condition and so on and so forth.

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.420
All right.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.580
Let's get started.

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.640
So first of all as we'll mention one originate a random number okay.

17
00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.800
So first we're going to import random and then the next step that we're going to generate mainly a random

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.990
number which is going to be an integer number from one to let's say fifty one to 49.

19
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.890
So we were going to specify random dot rent it for rent integer and the word specify the range.

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.450
Any number from one to let's say 49.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.050
OK.

22
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.410
And we're going to put whatever generated numbers we're going to put it in it true.

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.120
And that would be kind of the computer gets that the input of the user input will try to match somehow.

24
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.200
Right.

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.540
So let's run the first two cells so there's the first cells again you press shift and turn on the next

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.860
step of going to again press shift into to run the next cell.

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.390
And then now have a total number.

28
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.840
All right.

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.660
Let's let's see what that tool number is first.

30
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.360
So if we again press a that will create in you you send for us.

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.960
And then we're going to let's say a plot or two number of let's run it and the actual number of the

32
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.070
guess has been 43.

33
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.930
If you actually want to run it again you need maybe like seven hundred again generally thirty nine and

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.070
so on and so forth.

35
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.090
And that's the whole idea is just off with the Asking the computer to generate them around the number

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.800
for us.

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.880
And they were going to ask the user to try to feed or input.

38
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.720
No.

39
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.500
Okay.

40
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.360
So how can we ask users to actually feed numbers to us.

41
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.150
So as we covered earlier in previous sections there were going to use the input function and then were

42
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.740
going to write whatever we want to be prompted to the user as an input.

43
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.590
So were going to press or write inputs.

44
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.360
Right.

45
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.830
And then years between Abraham and prespecified is trained and then would get to be kind of the message

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.490
they were going to be prompted to use.

47
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.900
So if we put input into your guess between 1 and 49 for instance or whatever whatever message you want

48
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.520
it.

49
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.460
Okay.

50
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.510
And then what's going to happen is the user going to feel that input.

51
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.080
So the point is here is that the program will halt.

52
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.060
We're not going to continue until we actually input the value.

53
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.710
Okay.

54
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.730
And then once the input was the user input value you can assume it's an integral casted to become an

55
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.560
integer.

56
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.360
All right.

57
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.010
And then that will be my guess.

58
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.350
No.

59
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.690
So now we have two numbers.

60
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.030
I have my two number which is the guest number by the computer and then we have the what we call it

61
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.890
the guest number which of the input came from the user and then we tried to compare these two areas.

62
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.160
So just very very simple exercise.

63
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.420
But again it's just you know kind of the first project we're going to go into a little way more complex

64
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.680
products moving forward with us to go again kind of a warm up.

65
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.160
That's Let's run it.

66
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.590
So once we're not going to say okay this is the message you specify enter your guess between 1 and 14.

67
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.450
Okay.

68
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.420
So let's assume that I don't know that the actual number is 45 in this case.

69
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.990
Let's assume let's say 30 or eight minutes press enter.

70
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.730
All right.

71
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.070
And then you'll see that other cells has been has been.

72
00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.620
Okay.

73
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.730
So no my total number is 44.

74
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.690
My guess number to 30.

75
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.770
So the idea is here we wanted to compare simply the two Okay actually let's say sure the numbers are

76
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.620
going to 30.

77
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.420
You know our 2 number is 44.

78
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.590
Now we wanted to compare.

79
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.100
Right.

80
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.170
So just to perform a comparison and events and before and more on a platform we use if condition.

81
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.050
Okay.

82
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.180
So first of all if the user is lucky and he insert the number that matches that the computer guess then

83
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.070
we're going to print okay.

84
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.440
Now you're looking good.

85
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.050
You know you're right.

86
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.660
So I'm going to say here if condition if our guess number equals equals which means that's when you're

87
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.630
actually performing if condition or or check for equality equals two to no.

88
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.170
Right.

89
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.010
Okay.

90
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.360
They are going to print.

91
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.030
You're right.

92
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.230
Good job or whatever you want to print.

93
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.760
Right.

94
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.500
And then once you're right then what you need to do is they actually need to break what we call the

95
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.290
weight loop.

96
00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.940
It's happening.

97
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.800
So the whole idea is we're going to write kind of different if conditions.

98
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.780
OK and I'm going to put all of them in a while loop.

99
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.290
OK.

100
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.100
The whole idea is one of the problem to be running all the time until the user gets it right.

101
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.900
Okay so we are only going to break that loop.

102
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.350
Okay.

103
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.540
We're going to break.

104
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.080
We're just simply in a break our way loop only if the user feeds the number.

105
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.230
Right.

106
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.020
Right so here is just to give an idea of the way you look so here we have wave two which means all the

107
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.270
time why one which means all the time we're going to be running that loop.

108
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.150
OK I'm to actually break it.

109
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.020
All right.

110
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.050
OK.

111
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.100
Which again we're going to break it only if our guest number is equal.

112
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.590
That's or not all right.

113
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.980
And then the next step is if our guest number is less then the total number then would total guide the

114
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.380
user somehow will.

115
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.590
Okay your guess is low.

116
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.510
Try again.

117
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.010
Try to kind of you know like a high number or.

118
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.630
And then we're going to feed another input and so on and so forth.

119
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.350
Okay.

120
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.800
The next step is if the guest number is greater than the total number then we're going to assume that

121
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.410
again we're going to go him.

122
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.230
We haven't mentioned.

123
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.040
Your guess is high.

124
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.340
Try again.

125
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.010
So the user would have tried to input a smaller number.

126
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.660
OK.

127
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.180
All right.

128
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.160
Let's walk you through it so that's our condition.

129
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.570
If the user finds it feeds it right the next step is as guest number is less than our number.

130
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.220
OK.

131
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.960
So if the guest number is less than our two number which is our case here they are going to say okay

132
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.040
your guess is low.

133
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.890
Try again.

134
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.940
And then use it will get XP expecting the users to actually feel that it puts it away.

135
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.310
So you're are going to say okay so input into your guess between Again one and 49 or eight.

136
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.450
And they're going to again specify as an integer and they'll be my new guess number.

137
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.210
So going to override the previous guest number which is usable 30 by let's say Whatever inputs were

138
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.770
going to be those are going to get it right.

139
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.300
And then else if if our gas number is greater than the total number giving and say okay print.

140
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.420
Your guess is high.

141
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.390
Try again.

142
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.180
And then afterwards we're going to again as these are input another number simply put we're going to

143
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.120
do a wide loop asking the user to give us whatever number if it's smaller or it's great but if it's

144
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.780
equal we're just going to break that up.

145
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.840
In a nutshell.

146
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.260
Right.

147
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.000
OK.

148
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.660
So let's start at the let's see what's going to happen if we've done it.

149
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.110
I'm going to say okay because I would guess number 30 I'm going to number is 44.

150
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.960
Then one guess.

151
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.260
Okay.

152
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.340
Your guess is low.

153
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.240
Try again which means we didn't execute this.

154
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.840
We did not execute it.

155
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.780
We did not execute this.

156
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.150
We only executed that portion which is you know the part of the else here.

157
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.340
Okay.

158
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.760
So let's assume and do guess as locy Assuming a you know increase the number somehow.

159
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.610
So let's assume they're going to write 35 press enter.

160
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.750
When I say okay your guess is low again.

161
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.290
Try again.

162
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.530
Why.

163
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.850
Because it didn't reach it again.

164
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.720
We did it executed this portion.

165
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.110
We didn't execute that portion.

166
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:59.040
You only executed this portion or let's try again make it 40 and I say again you would get a steal though.

167
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.000
Let's try for three.

168
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.120
But again your guess is still low.

169
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:09.120
And if you want to try 44 that's what you actually say okay.

170
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.840
Now your guess number matches the true number and then you see on Google right.

171
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.640
Good job.

172
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.620
And simply you break the loop and that's why you see here you are not running the loop anymore.

173
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.380
And that's pretty much it very simple.

174
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.950
Again a guessing game.

175
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.650
You can have it look a little bit more advanced by adding for example different bounds.

176
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.950
They'll say okay you a little bit closer to the true number of giffin Giving covering more hints for

177
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.040
instance and there's a lot of additions that you can add to the game.

178
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.270
But again this is a very simple guessing game.

179
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.130
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next project.
