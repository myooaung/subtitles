00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.830
Hello everyone and welcome to this section and this section.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.650
We're going to see how can we use open TV to simply select our and detect our Lean lines with an image.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.930
Okay.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.580
So first it important again our libraries are an important medlocke let that image as MPI mge there

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.830
are going to import parts lip as well plodding as t.

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.280
Many important umpires MP reimported open CV as well which is CV too.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.090
All right let's run that.

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.650
And then we're going to do here.

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.210
We're going to load our image which is again we're going to hit our image providers within the course

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.430
package is we'll call it image underscored lean underscored see our coloured image get another image.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.230
First we're going to convert it to greyscale.

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.460
And once you have any greyscale then we're going to do our design of interest masking that we discussed

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.140
before.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.330
And then the converse selection how can we select the actual pixels afterwards.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.600
All right.

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.980
So what's going to do is going to provoke it.

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.050
MP I mge that imagery they're going to need the image first and that's the image has to be contained

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.230
within our directory and that would be our image quality.

19
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.630
Ah okay.

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.250
Let's actually before doing this.

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.300
Let's press to create a new cell and do it here.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.610
Let's look at the image.

23
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
So first looking around there and that will get to be our image column.

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.210
OK all right.

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.890
So that will be our image.

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.910
If we actually take a look at it's let's take a look at the shape of that image and do shape or it would

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.290
tell us okay the image actually 540 by hundred and sixty by three which means which makes sense because

28
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.060
we have three channels our g.b. channels.

29
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.840
The next step is we're going to take that image and convert it to greyscale.

30
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.520
So going to use again CV to see the t colour.

31
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.530
The message is to give it a longer our image column along with our colour beads are too grey.

32
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.960
OK.

33
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.650
Which is again with an open CV.

34
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.180
It's just of a method that can be used to convert from college degrees scale again.

35
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.140
B R stands for blue green and red K to grey and they'll going to convert to greyscale So the outcome

36
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.430
of this will get to generate our imagery.

37
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.910
And then you plot that image to show our image Grey.

38
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.270
Do colour map equals to grey or they don't get it to let the shape as well just to make sure they were

39
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.810
actually on the same page.

40
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.110
Now you're expecting as we covered it before but our image can have the same dimensions.

41
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.270
Five hundred and forty nine hundred and sixty but only single dimension because only greyscale at the

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.390
moment.

43
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.580
So let's run it and that's it.

44
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.140
So actually before doing this what we're going to do here that we're going to let's show let's actually

45
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350
view the image in a college format first.

46
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.120
OK so I'm going to do it.

47
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.770
We're going to duplicate that image show.

48
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.860
It's to let our image colour here.

49
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.730
Let's sit on it.

50
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.500
And that's actually our first image.

51
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.680
OK.

52
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.450
So before doing any conversion that's our image so we loaded our image and we shown our image.

53
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.090
And here we are in actually the shape of the image and then convert it to greyscale and then that's

54
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.280
what exect think the exact same dimensions but an agreed scale and again confirmed by doing that as

55
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.110
well.

56
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.200
The next step is we wanted to simply select our region of interest okay which we covered before.

57
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.410
First I need to select what our what our vision of interest.

58
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.630
What's the first point that we're looking for.

59
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.780
OK so the next step is we're going to take our image which is our greyscale image that we'll paint here

60
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.750
before we're going to think of that image before doing anything even of interest masking or going to

61
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.130
do.

62
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.830
Were going to simply select the pixels that are white pixels.

63
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.490
OK.

64
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.610
And we can assume these are white pixels which has value of 255.

65
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.270
They are simply white pixels.

66
00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.600
OK.

67
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.180
That's our lead pixels.

68
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.170
Anything else was it going to put it to zero.

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.750
There's much the first kind of you know strategy to move forward.

70
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.790
Okay assuming that we don't have any for example a white vehicle in here in our image if we have white

71
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.100
vehicle for example here or if we have let's say anything that's really Nordic or white collar then

72
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.670
obviously we can't use that technique without applying it even of interest masking which going to be

73
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.840
discussing afterwards.

74
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.460
But the main focus here is that we're not going to apply is just masking which is going to mean we select

75
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.110
our lanes you know.

76
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.850
So if there were the exact same image apply a filter to select mainly to perform or column selection

77
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.460
perform pixels or to exact pixels that has values of 255.

78
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.920
That's it.

79
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.560
OK.

80
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.610
All right.

81
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.520
So we're going to do here is we're going to first of all copy that image so we want to want to mess

82
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.120
around with the actual original image.

83
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.150
We're going to think oh image you're going to do nump hide or Cuppy going to create an image copy and

84
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.300
then actually check the shape as well as look the same shape.

85
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.920
Obviously the previous one.

86
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.900
It's all going to do.

87
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.290
They're going to simply put.

88
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.670
Take a look at the entire image and look at the value of that image and simply put if the value is below

89
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.450
let's say specific threshold which let's say he selected two hundred and fifty for example the skin

90
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.650
is set at zero.

91
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.680
Simply put we're going to collect pixels from two hundred and fifty to 255.

92
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.110
Which has to be very very white pixels.

93
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.030
These pixels we're going to take anything else we're going to say to zero you know make it like black.

94
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.980
So how can we perform that in Python.

95
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.460
So we're going to do here getting our image copy.

96
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.410
We're going to simply put.

97
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.150
We're going to take a look at image Cuppy see Colin here.

98
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.850
That means specifying every one of pixels.

99
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.670
So all pixels we think any any of the pixel values.

100
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.480
OK.

101
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.940
So if we take any of the image copy which is our image if we take a look at any of the bits of values

102
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.460
if any of the pixel values are below or less then 250.

103
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.290
OK.

104
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.770
Right.

105
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.310
So given what we're going to do here if we get a set of key asset our image copy we're going to set

106
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.870
it to zero.

107
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.420
That means any pixel or any value there is simply not white.

108
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.500
We're going to set it to zero.

109
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.270
OK.

110
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.560
And then we had this play our our image copy afterwards.

111
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.230
OK.

112
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.880
All right.

113
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.780
So let's try it.

114
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.240
Let's try it again.

115
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.210
That's our image.

116
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.200
Which makes you know spring interesting.

117
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.460
That means we actually mask everything here else and we just kept our leads and then we watch how the

118
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.790
acts start to add some a little bit of intelligence.

119
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.170
It's like for example the lean lines within a pixel.

120
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.860
OK.

121
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.380
I mean next.

122
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.640
So they can do as well.

123
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.570
It's all going to be good know what we call it easing up interest masking which is again another exercise.

124
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.020
Pretty much the same idea.

125
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.930
OK.

126
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.280
But you have to select specific reason.

127
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.730
OK.

128
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.590
So here we can use that technique won't rely on it if we know that there is any other white pixels anywhere

129
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.540
else.

130
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.830
What we could do here in the region of interest masking combined kind of both together select the region

131
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.870
of interest and then apply the college selection afterwards.

132
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.890
So let's take a look at the region of of interest maslon.

133
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.100
So again I'm going to look at our Image setareh all libraries again we've done that before.

134
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.700
Here we're going to look at our image.

135
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.920
I'm going to show that image too.

136
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.830
Let's run it so that we're going to tell us okay that's what it meant he didn't in this image.

137
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.240
You can specify the width and height so that's with height.

138
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.910
And then I'm going to show our image that's our image.

139
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.810
Looks good.

140
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.590
And that's our dimension of the image which is in FY 14 by 960 by three.

141
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.430
Next step is going to convert to quick scale again.

142
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.130
We've done that before we can run it again.

143
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.110
They'll going to be a great image again.

144
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.480
Here's TV to colour image colour seems to colour BGR to grey.

145
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.960
They'll give us our image grey.

146
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.090
You we get a convert.

147
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.700
Again use plotted image show but we're going to use the greyscale as a colour map.

148
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.700
They'll get to our image and here going to show other dimensions as well.

149
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.200
And then here we wanted to make you focus on how the peripheral region just masking.

150
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.890
If you guys remember we had done it before.

151
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.920
How can we actually select region of the image set at once everything else were going to set it to zero.

152
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.360
OK.

153
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.030
So let's take a look.

154
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.250
So first I need to specify my region of interest.

155
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:14.810
OK.

156
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:22.630
So here I need to specify let's say this pixel somewhere in here somewhere in here and somewhere in

157
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:22.970
here.

158
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.460
To simply mass this region there's the overall idea.

159
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.000
So here is what we could do to specify PI daughter.

160
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.280
And then going to specify the coordinates of the first big sort of the first point sorry.

161
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.150
The second point thirty point and fourth point.

162
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.080
OK.

163
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.320
And that's pretty much how can we specify our regional interests or we specify zero height.

164
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:54.350
That means OK it's first of all first of all this point is the 0 0 that's my that's my audition.

165
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.010
OK.

166
00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.410
So if you want to move on the X dimension that can move your claim of X the dimension of the Y direction

167
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.040
going to move the y direction he is going down.

168
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.850
So you want to specify let's say 0 0 that I mean this point first pacifies 0 and height.

169
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.450
That means we are 0 at X and height.

170
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.970
That means we are going to stop here.

171
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.640
OK.

172
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.640
That means we're going to take this corner point.

173
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.090
That's our first corner point here.

174
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.970
On the other corner point the other point is here.

175
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.580
Right.

176
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.900
We're going to be width and height go which is the basically the variables that we'll put in before

177
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.280
he end up in the shape of the image.

178
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:38.620
So simply put we're going to stop in this corner which is simply going to go do the with value go down

179
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.690
to the high value up to that point.

180
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.010
OK.

181
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.960
That will be my second point with them right.

182
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.880
The second point we need to select let's say two points somewhere in here per say somewhere in here.

183
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.810
Both points have the actual seam seam y axis.

184
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.960
However they have two different essex's.

185
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.310
So first one going for 100 and 200.

186
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.940
That means I'm going to walk 400 and go down to around 200 let's say value.

187
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.700
OK.

188
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.220
Here we actually changed a little bit.

189
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.830
I'm going to show you.

190
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.090
I'm going to show you how can we.

191
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.060
Can we do that.

192
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.670
But let's see.

193
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.020
We can make it let's say 400.

194
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.870
Okay.

195
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.110
And then we go down to let's see 350.

196
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.020
And here we're going to go to x x.

197
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.260
Want a 4 400 foot of this round 500 This is 550.

198
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.190
I'm going to go down to an to.

199
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.780
They'll be there at this point.

200
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.730
It's 550 And so you are right.

201
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.850
And that's the first step and specifying the date that I'm going to be introject of 3 2.

202
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.290
And then afterwards we're going to specify our regional interests.

203
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.270
So we're going to do.

204
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:50.810
The way to define a blank image in the image we're going to be all zeros okay with it within that region.

205
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.020
So how can we do that we're going to get nump.

206
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.720
If we do an umpire godzilla's like and then going to pass along our imagery that means we're going to

207
00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.740
create a blank.

208
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.620
Image.

209
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.690
And their image has zeros only.

210
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.900
Right so the next step is we're going to create a blank image.

211
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.190
Okay that had the exact same dimensions as our greyscale image.

212
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.210
I think a set of pixels to zero first.

213
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.700
They were going to be our kind of oldacre Blank image for us all the zeros.

214
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.460
OK.

215
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.470
Which is all black and then I'm going to specify within the region of interests specified to once.

216
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.340
And that's where the bright pixels would be.

217
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.310
I'm coming to play.

218
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.650
So we have been create n.p..

219
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:38.290
Now I don't feel like that we're simply going to create an image with all the zeros it has executive

220
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.730
dimensions as image greyscale.

221
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.970
And they'll get create a blank image.

222
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.100
Okay so let's run it and let's run it again.

223
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.920
They are going to give us okay that's our blank dot shape that's our blank image which is simply put

224
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.490
image that has.

225
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.920
OK so there are zeroes which is simply black on an.

226
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.100
And the dimensions are 549 a hundred and six.

227
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.040
OK.

228
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.620
Next step is we wanted to specify our region of interests.

229
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.730
We're going to set at once in order to do that we're going to use again in open see if you can you see

230
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:18.250
two dot fill Polly or fill polynomial specifying any of it our image which is our blank image our region

231
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.870
of interest basically dimensions which is our.

232
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:29.920
Simply put our rectangle or our sorry region has specified ones in there.

233
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:36.160
OK which is we specified where before our four main points that was postponed earlier and then were

234
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.800
going to said the colours simply to 255 because we want to fill that region of interest with once.

235
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.460
And that being our mascot simply put.

236
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.700
So the next step is we're going to take our mask.

237
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.180
Okay.

238
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.830
And then we're going to apply what we call it ending operation if you call anything operational we wanted

239
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.980
to take our image and take our mask image which has all these years and someone's going to you them

240
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.500
together.

241
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.750
Okay simply put multiply them to go.

242
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.700
Going to do it.

243
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.160
Do they you CV to the bitwise.

244
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.990
We're going to take our image grey which is our original image and our mask.

245
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.130
And they were going to give us our Maskin in which Let's run it one more time.

246
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:20.550
They'll give us our shape and let's run here and specify simply our of interest which exactly what we're

247
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.170
expecting.

248
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.720
Okay.

249
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.630
So we've got a plus I imagine that will generate this and that we're going to be our region of interest.

250
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.860
What you could do is can do obviously you can change let's say you can make a little bit closer here

251
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.720
or maybe go move in a bit down.

252
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.040
So sort of 100 million let's say two three let's say three thirty.

253
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.510
So here instead of two three thirty two.

254
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.300
And again again again again again.

255
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.900
And you see that we went down in a bit.

256
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.260
And we were down in the y axis a little bit.

257
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.320
What you could do as well you can say change this for example sort of having it at 0 0 we can set it

258
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.660
back to a little bit here for example or more to here.

259
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.420
You can do a lot of stuff with it.

260
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.130
And what we could do afterwards we can combine that has an interest masking along with the column selection

261
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.010
that we've done before to add a kind of you know some sort of intelligence persay so you can specify

262
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.920
your region and specify again the pixels to select for orderly lines.

263
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.460
And that's pretty much what we have for this project.

264
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.480
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next project.
