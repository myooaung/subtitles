00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone and welcome to this project.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.600
All right so let's see how can we implement the learning that we had in the previous section and actually

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.910
fitting that image quality image and converted from college to Wisco and to apply some twin effects.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.690
OK.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.790
So first we're going to import all the modules in all the libraries that we need.

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.520
So we're going to import mad plot lib that image.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.310
MP.

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.960
I m.g. Okay we're going to use it to simply show you how you want to load for example images if you

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.020
had to perform some many policemen to the image you're going to be very handy for us.

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.810
And then we're going to implement met plot leap the pipeline.

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.200
SB ulti we're going to import nump high as MP which is again for four numerical analysis.

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.280
There were going to import the ketu which is the open sea the library which can be used again to the

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.520
image manipulation and so on.

14
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010
So again it's a very powerful library.

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.230
And I say how can we how can we use it.

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.490
So let's run this portion first.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.400
The next step is going to see how can we load an image which has a coloured image.

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.830
We're going to see how can we take that image and converted from colour to greyscale.

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.320
OK.

20
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.140
So again a very simple very easy exercise.

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.490
So we're going to do is a way to save an image which is here just you know like image of of Justin trudeau

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.360
which is again you know like a Canadian prime minister as we speak right now.

23
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.440
So we're going to load that image which is a coloured image.

24
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.590
And what we're going to do with him in that image and convert it to Greece go to in order to do that

25
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.700
we're going to use MP I am geoduck image read.

26
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.270
OK.

27
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.330
And they were going to pass along this ching.

28
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.880
They chose the actual title of the image and the image has to be there working the scene working directly

29
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.910
as you're current folder.

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.430
Again the images actually contain as well within the package.

31
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.650
So for once you don't know the cause speckles you're going to come across the image and then use that

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.620
image you'll get to be loaded and maybe lower hearings or image column.

33
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.480
And you can call it whatever you want.

34
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.450
Let's run it.

35
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.010
That's again a trend.

36
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.790
So let's if what if we want to show the actual image.

37
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.770
So and do it.

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.200
I mean you use plot dot image show and then we're going to pass along our image column which is are

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.850
readable here.

40
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.740
OK.

41
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.460
All right.

42
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.860
So let's run it.

43
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.210
Once you're on it.

44
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.340
You can get the image here and the good thing about you know the Jupiter not books you can actually

45
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.870
view your image right within the notebook itself which is pretty.

46
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.840
Pretty interesting.

47
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.460
OK.

48
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.980
So first node is.

49
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.460
How many pixels do we have.

50
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.030
All right.

51
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.830
So if you look here you would see the images around that say 500 600 by 800 pixels.

52
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.670
That's the basic dimensions of our image.

53
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.180
And again if you go as you call before because it's an image then we have three channels red blue and

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.640
green grey.

55
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.240
It's all going to do it.

56
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.120
We're going to do if you wanted to get the shape up of the shape method it's going to use the image

57
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.210
column which is our image dot shape that we're going to give us the dimensions of our environment that's

58
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.080
actually on it as okay.

59
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.760
Looks pretty good.

60
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.370
So here we have five hundred and sixty nine pixels 569 and we have 800 with.

61
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.100
Okay.

62
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.340
And then we have three three actually indicates the number of channels that we have which makes sense

63
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.390
because we have a coloured image so we have three channels as we speak.

64
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.840
Okay.

65
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.770
That's pretty much how can you leave an image with an open CV.

66
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.590
Okay.

67
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.860
All within python in general because here we actually use MPI mge imagery that should load our image.

68
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.540
All right.

69
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.310
OK.

70
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.160
So the next step is we wanted to show how can we take that image and actually convert it to greyscale.

71
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.560
Obviously you don't want to go and do any like magic in there.

72
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.630
To use all the uranium for us functions and methods.

73
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.320
We're going to be using Treacher do all the conversion for us it's very easy.

74
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.040
All right.

75
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.130
So we're going to do we're going to use again open CV.

76
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.940
So going to use CV to dot CV to choler.

77
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.870
Okay.

78
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.400
Which is a very powerful tool that we can use.

79
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.380
They can pass along our image which is image choler and they're going to pass here.

80
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.670
Our what we wanted to do with the image to get to pass along CV to dot choler b.g. r which is blue blue

81
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.390
green and red which is our basically colours kind of space to grey.

82
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.660
Okay.

83
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.930
My apologies to grey and that we're simply going to convert it again from closed format to greyscale

84
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.180
format that we're going to get in get out of here is simply going to pass that along to our image.

85
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.840
Great.

86
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.500
Okay.

87
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.450
And then we're going to use again that initial going a lot in history but I won't use a colour map of

88
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.850
grey here because again our image right now is not column anymore.

89
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.030
It's actually greyscale.

90
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.840
And we actually one check that we need to do that we need to check the shape of our image to make sure

91
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.840
that's actually one dimension only has only one channel.

92
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.290
OK.

93
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.870
Let's let's.

94
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.730
So as you can see here.

95
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.910
So we plug in we have our image in we have our greyscale image image.

96
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.520
Cindy mentions no problem but it's a greyscale OK.

97
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.240
The next step is we're going to take our image Grey and they apply cheap method to it.

98
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.210
So if one is Intel yorki actually has five other six nine by eight hundred and that's it.

99
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.950
We actually don't have the three here anymore.

100
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.220
Why.

101
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.800
Because we don't have the coloureds space anymore.

102
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:27.350
It's only one dimension Matrix or list that has all the values that we need with each pixel has simply

103
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.860
values that range from zero to 25.

104
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.870
Actually it's confirmed that point if we look at the actual not the actual image when you look at the

105
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.940
actual digital values actual pixels.

106
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.790
Let's stay on it.

107
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.370
So that's our image grey guess can see here.

108
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.010
Simply it's it's kind of a really your list here.

109
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:53.810
We have different pixels with different values so we we have 19 21 161 126 which is simply each of the

110
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.510
pixels here representing the.

111
00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.710
As I mentioned earlier where zero indicates black 255 indicates white.

112
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.350
So all these pixels for instance indicates white so he did this because his actual digital value of

113
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.290
let's say around 255 you're on these black pixels are showing a value of zero.

114
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.980
Ah.

115
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.100
And that's how can you take an image converted from column to greyscale using open civi.

116
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.740
Okay.

117
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.300
You can again try different images.

118
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.320
You can you know we can do a lot of a lot of things again here.

119
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.700
This is not like in our computer vision course persay is just giving you an idea of the power of Python

120
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.640
what we can do with it happening to do with our librans is one or it.

121
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.420
Okay.

122
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.300
Great.

123
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.550
What we could do here is they wanted to show two additional things that we can do first.

124
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.190
We can actually see image.

125
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.620
See the greyscale image.

126
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.310
So going to do here going to use open seabee as well to see to that image.

127
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.980
Right.

128
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.980
And then we're going to pass along our image grey which is what we defined here which has came out of

129
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.900
our function.

130
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.480
The argument that came out out of it and then were going to specify the name of our image.

131
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.400
When I see it again in our working directory but we want to save it we can specify the name so we were

132
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.870
all talking imaged or greyscale g pge.

133
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.100
It did make it true that means we actually see that.

134
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.680
So if you're going out with a working directive you can actually take a look and see that there is an

135
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.410
actual image of descriptive scale object.

136
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.390
OK.

137
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.680
Perfect.

138
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.440
So now we know how can we load that image coloured image converter from colour to Crisco and then save

139
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.570
it actually to whatever the workspace.

140
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:40.440
The last topic that I wanted to discuss here in our hour of kind of you know Minnies get project they're

141
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.350
going to apply cartoon effect on an image take whatever image you not going to be fun because you can

142
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.880
load your own image for instance and you know show it to your friends and family for example and show

143
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.650
you how can you and all that do you learn.

144
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.360
You know some programming skills are going a larger image actually converted to cut down or create some

145
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.280
cartoon effects.

146
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.260
OK.

147
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.920
So again he is going to lower that image but he'll have better luck than image with a different way.

148
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.160
So we actually can use see the or which is key to that imagery.

149
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.260
All you can use.

150
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.210
I'm just giving you all the different ideas actually loading the image or use.

151
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.160
MP I am geed that imagery.

152
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.210
But you know the exact same thing which.

153
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.680
So he would load of the image again.

154
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.040
See that imagery.

155
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.970
Trudeau gcg and there will be Oracle.

156
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.290
And then what you're going to do here is agree to use against open CV has tons of libraries.

157
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.580
You can take you know like open CV there is you know just to cover it.

158
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.800
We need just like I think at least hundred hours course just to cover all the libraries in there and

159
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.830
in are going to be sufficient as well.

160
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.890
So what you going to do here is just going to accept just one kind of function.

161
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.490
OK.

162
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:54.500
Were going to collets Tyler stylisation which is kind of you know like having some style to your image

163
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.450
in a way picking your image adding some to effect to it.

164
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.240
Again you don't need to worry about how this method how this function really has been implemented.

165
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.660
You know how to use it which is the power to open CV you don't need to actually go and become like a

166
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.620
developer.

167
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.910
Everything from scratch you can actually use it and just pass along the tuning parameters.

168
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.270
And that's the beauty of Python in general.

169
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.570
It's an unknown old being being open source.

170
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.970
You can use what other people have done to your own you know like with the learning curve of like let's

171
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.910
say 10 minutes you can learn anything unique.

172
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.860
OK.

173
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.830
So here we have seen the imagery that will be our column image and then we're going to again call that

174
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.190
a function CV these two dot stylization.

175
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.600
I pass along our colour image and then we're going to pass along kind of tuning premolars or quality

176
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.870
sigmet s and sigmar you can open this up in seabee documentation.

177
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.090
They should go through it.

178
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.890
But he had just said to you you look kind of an overview Sigma controls how the image is smooth.

179
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.520
Okay.

180
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:59.000
So if you increase the sigmet s which is you know how the value of that thing s is large again sigmas

181
00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.880
can dig ranges.

182
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:07.780
Values from two hundred and sigmar can think those from little one here I said it to 200 s and sing

183
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:07.950
out.

184
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.280
I said a two point three.

185
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.010
Again you can try whatever values you want here.

186
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:20.350
So largest sigmet s s s s has large imageware going to be more smooth as baby.

187
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360
Way more smoother.

188
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.580
Okay great.

189
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.060
And for Sigma that's for semester four Sigma are or eight which are the other value.

190
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.790
Which seems again from 0 to 1.

191
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.810
Ok if you have small value sigmar that means the image again would be a little bit more both as well

192
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.490
which is kind of you would get only more removing the edges.

193
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.690
Okay I'm going to do as well how can we how can we do it here using these these two values.

194
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:49.420
Again you can take the image stick that code and change the values thing masting are to whatever values

195
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.520
you want.

196
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.000
OK so let's try it right.

197
00:10:54.110 --> 00:11:00.400
So now basically the 7 ran and we have actually the return of that basically line going into 2 in our

198
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.100
image of the image.

199
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.030
Should the effects apply to it.

200
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.230
OK so I'm going to do they're going to use again CV to that image show.

201
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.980
I'm going to pass along here.

202
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.690
Our image comes to image and he'd ogan to pass along our table so we're going to have whatever he can

203
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:21.430
write whatever title you want and then here we're going to simply use cb that we key and destroyed all

204
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.750
windows because the window we want to use open see people were plotting images they were going to people

205
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.250
in a different window or a new window.

206
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.380
I'm going to show you exactly what you mean by this.

207
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.770
So once it's actually going to come across that's actually pretty cool.

208
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.210
So you would see that here we have our visual image before.

209
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.340
This is our original image which is called image.

210
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.840
What we did here that we had kind of know tied to it like having some cause to effect it.

211
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.610
You will see that here you know some some of the edges here have a little bit like blurrily in a way

212
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.600
and some little bit second in a way and here you can again play as well with these two parameters of

213
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.300
Sigma s and sigmar to change simply our values.

214
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.890
Here to make you know to create your own effects.

215
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.880
He chose you know like trudeau's image which is you know my favourite politician you can again use your

216
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.080
your whatever image you want you can use it.

217
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.890
Our place is action to it.

218
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.370
Right.

219
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.820
Okay sounds great.

220
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.690
So in order to destroy it's simply what's happening here.

221
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:29.040
However our image and that image is simply displayed in the code.

222
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.170
We're not going to be complete.

223
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.890
We're not going to pass this lineham on because he Were we have you know we're kind of stuck in a loop.

224
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.100
And that's why you need to see the wachee.

225
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.090
So he was waiting until you actually entered whatever key.

226
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.520
So you need to enter whatever so press enter for example.

227
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.280
That's where the image go to be destroyed our are going to be gone.

228
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.730
And here we can actually keep going.

229
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.080
And then the code is basically complete.

230
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.680
Right.

231
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.870
OK.

232
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.330
So that's pretty much how what you need to know.

233
00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:01.310
If you wanted to get an image coloured image convert it to resko and then dig in a column image and

234
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.640
create some effect.

235
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.290
OK.

236
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.880
OK.

237
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.530
Some of the assignments for you guys I you say your own image.

238
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.190
And instead of having your adheres to those images you can just try to whatever events you want and

239
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.150
apply again your effects to it.

240
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.880
Okay.

241
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.680
One last point that I wanted to outline here.

242
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:26.450
Again if you're an open CV with find get tons of of defecations you could do get an image.

243
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:32.060
So here I just tried to maybe like a different one quality we took the pencil sketch which is simply

244
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.410
trying to take an image we're going to comment that line above that line is dead and that we're going

245
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.090
to to go to college image and going to have Sigma s and Sigma ardc and tune them to and they were going

246
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.590
to kind of like you know a kind of a pencil sketch of the image.

247
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.140
Okay.

248
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.230
It's pretty fun.

249
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.240
And again.

250
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.960
So we have a really begin that's that's pretty much our image again.

251
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.340
So you see that's you know as the exact same image but he would convert it to Walter reskill and then

252
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.500
create some you know some some sketch to it as if it's also been drawn by pencil.

253
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.380
All right.

254
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.330
And that's pretty much all we have for this project.

255
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.930
I hope you enjoy it and see you in the next party.
