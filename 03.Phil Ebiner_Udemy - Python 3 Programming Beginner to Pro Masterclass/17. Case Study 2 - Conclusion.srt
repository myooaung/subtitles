1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,140
So let's conclude this case study.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,190
So as we saw that machine learning picnic's was able to classify tumours effectively into malignant

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,510
benign tumours with 97 percent accuracy which is really great.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,960
Right.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,110
And that's assuming that we don't have any deep learning or any features detection of whatsoever.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,770
We actually provided the machine learning with with our features.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:35,000
We created our features our own which is kind of on a very basic elementary are the meek because moving

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,620
forward we can actually use directly our images using our deep learning strategies to actually look

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,720
at the images directly.

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,800
Okay.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,760
All right.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,590
So the technique as we saw lapilli evaluate breast masses and classify them in in other media fashion

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,710
we don't need an actual physician to be there.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,540
Obviously you know with kind of a second opinion that would be great.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,920
But you know now we're seeing a machine learning model that can simply look at the features look at

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,530
the images and let us walk.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,920
This cancer is meant malignant or malignant.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,310
This cancer is benign.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,970
Right.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,810
Well a tumour is benign.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,050
So as part of the conclusion part of the benefits of that case study in our early breast cancer the

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,050
10 minute detection can dramatically save lives especially in the developing world.

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,440
OK.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,900
And again as we mentioned this can be further improved by combining computer vision and machine learning

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,780
and deep learning techniques to classify cancer directly using tissue images.

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,470
And just a quick overview of the results that we paint we actually each their on precision right now

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,240
97 percent which is really great.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,210
And if we can see here this is kind of the confusion matrix that we achieve here found that we correctly

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,690
classify 45 points correctly classified six to six points.

30
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,610
So in order to classify the summation basically with these two numbers and here we misclassified only

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,780
three samples or a key element as well here is the misclassification was actually when the class was

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,490
zero.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,320
Okay.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
Or the prediction was zero.

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,520
However the tolga class wasn't one.

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,210
So I think that's because you know with the kids met in Melbourne and one indicates benign which means

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,400
our even our miscasts a five point swing actually fine we actually it's okay it's a kind of a type 1

38
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:22,190
error indicating that okay we didn't say that the patient for example is did it have cancer he had one

39
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,220
actually the patient we said that the patient or we assume that the patient the prediction the patient

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,020
said that the patient has cancer.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,240
However he was just okay just fine.

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,120
He just had a benign tumour.

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,890
I hope he has enjoyed their case study and let's build a cancer free world.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,150
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

45
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,470
And see you in the next guest.
