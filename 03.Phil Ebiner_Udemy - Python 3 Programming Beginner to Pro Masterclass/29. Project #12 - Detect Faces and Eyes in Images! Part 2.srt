00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,750
We're able to load specific images.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:08,950
OK.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,070
Which is true though true though image.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,960
And we're able to actually convert the image from color to grayscale.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,480
This lecture.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,040
Let's get started and see how can we apply our face detection algorithm to actually extract the face

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,570
and actually locate the face.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,850
Let's see how can we do that.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,970
First of all let's go ahead and import our what we call a cascade classifier.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,570
Again this this course is not about you know like a like machine learning and artificial intelligence

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,220
total course there is a section on machine learning and efficient intelligence but it doesn't Google

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,020
a little bit deeper.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,470
How can we perform you know all the training for example for using cascade classifiers was kind of an

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,040
advanced computer vision techniques.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,630
What I want you guys just to know here that we have trained model already obtained in there.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,270
OK.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,350
These models are ready trained.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,480
It's kind of you know like in here is called ha cascades.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,730
They have already trained.

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,100
Excel documents that contains hard cascade AI which you simply just can be used to detect AIS within

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,730
any image.

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,280
And this one is what we call it hard cascade frontal face default that can be used to actually detect

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,430
just faces within an image.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:23,940
OK.

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,860
So we have one that tech faces and we have one that tech eyes.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,760
That's pretty much it.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,760
What we're going to do is just going to import that cascade classifier that said we're just going to

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,960
use it in practice.

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,950
Let's go ahead and see what I can do that when I see a face underscored detection equals to CV to dot

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,070
cascades.

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,090
And if you actually press tab it would show you this cascade classifier.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,990
And then here we need to just specify the path of our of our classifiers here because I'm detecting

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,130
faces I'm going to say OK ha cascade

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:13,340
cascades and then get a pass along key at our Ha cascade on the score frontal face on the score default

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,370
dot X AML.

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,390
And if everything works you should have no problem.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,980
So when you press shift enter looks good.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,430
So pretty much now we have kind of think about it that now we have kind of a 3D model called face detection.

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,170
You can use it right away deployed in practice to detect faces within images.

41
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,040
OK.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,170
So how can we do that.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,850
What we could do going to say okay please could you please give me the faces give me what can happen

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,940
here I'm going to return all the coordinates of the face.

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,770
So in those image for instance we cannot attorney OK we're going to turn kind of a rectangle around

46
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,850
his face.

47
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,370
So we're going to do here we're going to take a face as equals to we're going to get our face detection

48
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,110
in here pasted.

49
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:02,490
And what we're going to do then apply kind of a method called detect multi scale detect multi scale

50
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,040
actually tab it will show you on the face detection there is a detect multi scale.

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,130
And what I need to do simply here I just need to pass my image on the school color which is my Trudeau's

52
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,960
image here in color format OK.

53
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,250
And here they need to specify those just two numbers.

54
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,080
I can't tell you exactly what you mean by these two numbers here let's say going to say one point one

55
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,760
and then I'm going to say five.

56
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,780
All right.

57
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,830
So what do you mean by this.

58
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,560
So actually try to include here the information for you guys.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,030
So when we apply a scale classifier or face detection classifier here in this case to detect multi scale.

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,820
You would find that we pass along our input image which is here in each color and we pass along kind

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,380
of two parameters.

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,940
The first one is what we call it scale factor.

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,030
The second one is what we call admin neighbors.

64
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,080
OK what do you mean by this.

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,660
Again it's very very simple might look a little bit intimidating but it's very simple.

66
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,540
So the first one is called scale factor.

67
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,710
The overall idea is that we wanted to kind of scale our image just just think think of it as taking

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,780
just one image and make it you know look smaller versions out of it and larger versions out of it.

69
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,730
And this kind of process we'll call it in computer vision quality limiting you kind of creating like

70
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,600
a different pyramid.

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,490
Think of it you know at the pyramids you know in Egypt for example we have like three kind of you know

72
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,740
like copies of them right.

73
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,800
We have like a large you know other pyramid and then there is an intermediate one and there is a smaller

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,470
one.

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,030
We think they are all pretty much have the same features right they all look like a pyramid.

76
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,970
They have the same color.

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,510
Pretty much the same thing but just different sizes.

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,560
That's the overall idea.

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,080
So scale factor simply when I say one point one.

80
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,840
That means we're just going to reskill the image and you know kind of reduce it to 10 percent of its

81
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,780
size.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,870
When I say let's say for one point two It means image is reduced by 20 percent each time it scale.

83
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,660
That means I'm going to take the image I'm going to reduce it let's say by 20 percent and run the classifier

84
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,180
again and then reduce it again by 20 percent on the classifier again and so on.

85
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,040
So when I say one point two.

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,310
That means each step will going to be 20 percent.

87
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,490
When I say one point one that means each step will going to be 10 percent.

88
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,010
All right.

89
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,800
So think about it here it once we go let's say smaller and smaller let's say to one point or five for

90
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,580
example.

91
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,350
That means five percent it will take much longer time because that means I'm thinking the original image

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,310
I'm Reese and it get several times just making creating multiples of them.

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,530
Why am I doing this.

94
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,020
I'm doing this because the classifier was trained on a specific size of the image.

95
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,790
What I wanted to do is simply when I plot let's say through this image let's actually show it.

96
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,980
I wanted to create the classifier to for example look at faces in here and then look at faces in here

97
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,900
look at facing.

98
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,950
That's one of the classified is doing just scanning through the entire image and trying to look for

99
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,400
the face.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,230
Right.

101
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,910
So for example if my face is smaller let's say here for example if like a little kid in here for example

102
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,180
in here right.

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,430
The face might be smaller right.

104
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,330
So what I need to do that I need to take the image and scale it into different multiple scale.

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
That's the overall idea.

106
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,470
Take the original image and reskill it into smaller ones just to try to look for the face simply.

107
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,050
OK.

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,600
OK let's first step the next step is we'll call it Min neighbors and this parameter is used to specify

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,960
how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it.

110
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,450
Think about it as kind of you know lack of like how many times I won't to be able to detect phases.

111
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,360
So let's say here I'm going to again let's open ours to this image.

112
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,410
So let's say I detected four examples in here.

113
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:44,090
I'm going to detect one face and then gonna shift my rectangle little bit rights and then I say OK I

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,110
detected another face and then one more time I take another face.

115
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,670
So let's say once I detect once kind of you know name in the neighboring in the neighborhood of these

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,110
pixels I detect let's say five times faces or five faces.

117
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,970
OK then we're going to say you know what.

118
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,900
That's an actual face.

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,220
Why.

120
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,440
Because there's a repetition.

121
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:09,170
That means you know like a lot of pixels a lot of you know like classifiers when I scan through the

122
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,220
images.

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,130
A lot of neighbors within that neighboring area says okay you know what.

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,190
There is a face there.

125
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,800
That's the overall idea.

126
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,570
OK.

127
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,940
So the number is generally range from three to six.

128
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,820
The parameter will mainly affect the quality of the detected faces and higher values would result in

129
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,300
less detections but with higher quality.

130
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:36,170
Simply put if you set high values if you said let's say for example that number set it to 10 for instance.

131
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,290
That means I need to have at least 10 neighbors they say that there is a face there.

132
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,960
Right.

133
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,700
Which we're going to reduce kind of the false positives.

134
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,280
However if you said it to let's say 1 you might have kind of you know like a lot of a lot of.

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,170
Like in all wrong for example estimate we're going to say okay you know maybe there is a face there

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,260
maybe that is faith.

137
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,070
Because I'm relying on one single point.

138
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,310
Right.

139
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,480
But if I have kind of maybe three to six that should add more fidelity in there and then we're not going

140
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,930
to be detecting you know random faces somewhere.

141
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,150
All right let's go ahead and run this command so we're on it and here we go.

142
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,180
So now what happened is I have been able to detect phases which is really powerful.

143
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,440
You know if you think about it you know we don't need to learn any artificial intelligence or computer

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,260
vision or whatever just apply this.

145
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,110
You know it has all the not all the smartness in there.

146
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,350
You literally can create an app right now because now in the faces here actually let's take a look at

147
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,240
faces.

148
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,800
Here we go.

149
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,790
It was just tell us these are the coordinates of the face.

150
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,580
OK.

151
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,400
So again it's not that simple this is going to show you what they mean by all these coordinates but

152
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,470
the overall idea that you know like the that this form this function told me OK you know what I have

153
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,440
detected one single face and here you go.

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,070
These are the pixel locations of my face.

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,590
All right.

156
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,730
It's really really amazing.

157
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:00,920
All right.

158
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,500
So what what what are these what are these numbers.

159
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,790
So let's go ahead and actually visualize these numbers.

160
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,060
So if you let's go ahead and run the face here so you'll find that there are kind of certain numbers

161
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,990
here 3 3 2 1 1 2 1 2 0 8 and 2 0 8.

162
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,220
OK.

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,990
What's happening here.

164
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,140
All right.

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:32,220
So the first two numbers these are the coordinates of the top left rectangle index or corner.

166
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,520
Right.

167
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,470
So what happened is the detect faces will going to detect a rectangle here around the face here.

168
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,710
Right.

169
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,800
OK.

170
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:45,960
So in that rectangle in the top left corner this is simply our coordinates.

171
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,550
So what this saying is saying OK if you go here to this is the X and this is the Y.

172
00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:02,340
So X is and my apologies if you go back here to the image please note that this point in here this is

173
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,700
zero and zero.

174
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,370
No y is doing this.

175
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,640
So at this point again is zero and zero please don't get confused.

176
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,110
Again it's very very simple.

177
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,490
This is our origin.

178
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,320
OK.

179
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,620
This is what we mean when we move to the right.

180
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,550
That means we're going x direction when we go down that means we'll go to the y direction.

181
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,800
Right.

182
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,340
So when I say I went here let's say for example three hundred and thirty two.

183
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,770
So I move to the right.

184
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,650
Three hundred and thirty two pixels.

185
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,050
OK.

186
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:38,050
OK the next point here was if you go down the next point was 1 to 1.

187
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,350
All right.

188
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,210
What at this point me.

189
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:46,120
This point is the y coordinate of the top left corner of my rectangle.

190
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,480
So what I'm saying is this one to one point is I go down here one hundred and twenty one pixels.

191
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,570
And that's what I'm getting.

192
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,130
Basically I'm stuck here.

193
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,600
This is the coordinates of the point of the first rectangle that has been detected which is only one

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,700
rectangle.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,040
All right.

196
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,330
Okay.

197
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,200
This looks great.

198
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
What about the other two numbers.

199
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,070
What about two or eight and two or eight you actually go back here you'll find that is 2 8 2 8 2 8 and

200
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,920
2 8 are simply my the dimensions of the the width and height of my rectangle.

201
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,950
So now I have the coordinate right now I need to know how far I need to go east right here which is

202
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,890
2 8.

203
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,360
And how far do I need to go down which is here do it.

204
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,070
It looks like you know it's basic it won't be a rectangle kind of a square because we gonna be drawing

205
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,170
here kind of a square with two 8 dimensions for both sides.

206
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,520
That's it.

207
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,670
That's pretty much what I want you guys to do press shop press enter or press whatever key and let's

208
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,750
go back here.

209
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,430
And here we go.

210
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,300
All right so let's go ahead and actually name them.

211
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,930
So we're gonna say Okay let's take a look at faces and let's go ahead and grab for example one.

212
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,270
So if I see faces of one shift enter that will give me 1 to 1.

213
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,070
If I see faces of zero that should bring me the first element within my an umpire array which is you

214
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,060
know like 3 3 2 1.

215
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,830
Again this is index zero index 1 6 2 index 3 right.

216
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,850
And Section bigger and let's zoom in a little bit okay.

217
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,950
So faces zero faces one faces two.

218
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,970
Let's take a look at it and face it three as well.

219
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,720
OK.

220
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,170
2 8.

221
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,720
If I made faces for to me.

222
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,620
Well I don't know you because index 4 is out of bounds.

223
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,590
This is in the 0 1 2 3.

224
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,450
All right Felix good right.

225
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,070
So what I want you guys to do and that would be our mini challenge in here to shift enter.

226
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,570
I wanted to simply take these faces and name them like this.

227
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,930
I mean to say X equals to something y equals to something.

228
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,940
X is the coordinates x coordinates of of my top left coordinate within my rectangle.

229
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,140
Why is the y coordinate of my tent top left corner of my rectangle and then I'm gonna say my width of

230
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,180
my rectangle and my height or my rectangle equals something.

231
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay obviously we're gonna be faces of something.

232
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,210
Please go ahead pause a video and try to fill out here.

233
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,880
What do you mean by X Y W and H.

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,270
It's just simply renaming of my faces array here into a bunch of variables.

235
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,730
Please go ahead pause the video and then I'll see you guys after the challenge.

236
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,490
All right I hope you guys were able to figure out what the challenge will ask you has to do simply go

237
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,170
ahead and assign faces of all and zero which is my first element here.

238
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,830
It's so easy to one that would be my X coordinates right and then I'm gonna go ahead and take faces

239
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:50,260
of all and 1 and that will be my Y coordinate and then I'm going to have faces all and 2 which is gonna

240
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,810
be my next coordinates and then I'm going to have faces all and 3 which are gonna be my last coordinate

241
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,400
in here press shift enters.

242
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,100
Here we go now I have X Y W and H and here we go.

243
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,840
Now I'm pretty much ready to go ahead to leverage these coordinates and actually draw in a physical

244
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,010
rectangle around the image.

245
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,660
Let's see how can we do that.

246
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,800
What we could do.

247
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,340
We can say okay an open CV which we say see CV to dot rectangle to actually press tab it would show

248
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,490
you that is recovered pose a rectangle reduce the map repeat tons of stuff here.

249
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,290
I wanted to draw a rectangle so going to see a rectangle.

250
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,050
OK where do you want to draw the rectangle.

251
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:37,260
I wanted to draw rectangles actually if you press shift tab shift and tab it will show you here how

252
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,290
can you draw a rectangle to tell you OK.

253
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,290
You need to pass along your original image.

254
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,140
You need to pass along key point one and point two so I need to pass along two points.

255
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:52,110
Basically where point one and point two actually if you go up if you go down here these are kind of

256
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,370
you know like I tell you the opposite corners.

257
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,680
So I need to specify the dimensions of the two opposite corners.

258
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,370
Top left corner and bottom right corner.

259
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,630
Let's see how can we do that.

260
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,080
Okay.

261
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,550
First I need to pass along my image so my image is contained in here which is image color.

262
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,780
Copy that.

263
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,130
It's pasted here.

264
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,440
And let's go ahead and actually specify my make ordinance first I'm going to say Okay I need my top

265
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,350
left corner which is simply my X and Y.

266
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,280
If you guys remember you're gonna say X might end y.

267
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,890
That's my first point or point one and then it'll specify the coordinates for point two.

268
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,110
So if you guys remember that point one is top left corner point two is bottom right corner.

269
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,480
Right.

270
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:47,070
So simply if I take my x value and add it to it my width which is to an eight or two eight that will

271
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,450
give me more the other point of the other X coordinates.

272
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:58,980
And if I do the same thing as well if I say Y plus H if I take my top left point and they added the

273
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:07,270
height to it which is 2 or 8 as well that should bring me down to the bottom right corner again.

274
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,410
If you guys can visualize it let's go ahead and do it here.

275
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,410
Let's see what's happening here is I have this point right.

276
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,620
So I have X and Y that indicates the top left corner within my rectangle.

277
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,210
I'm going to be drawing here right.

278
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,040
What I need to do I need to specify this is point one here.

279
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,430
I need to specify point two right.

280
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,390
To do that I mean I say okay let's go elastic X and add width to it.

281
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,910
Let's take let's take Y which they have here.

282
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,920
Apologies.

283
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,240
Let's take Y which is this point the coordinates of y and let's add height to it which is you know 2

284
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,780
8 as well.

285
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,260
That will bring me down to this coordinate.

286
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,000
That's the overall idea goes a little bit confused.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,870
Don't worry about it.

288
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm going to show you exactly when we actually plot the rectangles what I mean by this afterwards I

289
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
need to specify the color.

290
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,390
Okay what's the color of my rectangle.

291
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,730
So I'm gonna say okay.

292
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,750
0 2 4 2 5 5 we can call it whatever 2 5 5.

293
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,420
That indicates I believe the yellow color.

294
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,190
And we'll see what that.

295
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,760
And then here specify the thickness of my rectangle.

296
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,200
So going to take a sickness let's say three.

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,480
All right.

298
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,270
Okay looks good.

299
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,850
Now I draw a rectangle.

300
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,100
Let's go ahead and use open TV as well.

301
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:30,210
So going to say CV to dot image show and here I'm going to take a single face detection because I'm

302
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:37,350
detecting single face and I need to visualize image C which is the image along with the rectangle drawn

303
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,410
on it.

304
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:46,680
And please don't forget to add CV to that weight key and please don't forget to add as well our CV to

305
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,810
that destroy all windows

306
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,270
all right.

307
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,610
Looks fantastic.

308
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,550
Shift enters

309
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,120
and here we go.

310
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,710
All right.

311
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,980
Actually open in my next my next window.

312
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,940
Here we go.

313
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,010
This is our beautiful rectangle in there.

314
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,910
All right.

315
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,530
So if you guys take a look at it you will find that we have been detecting the top left corner which

316
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:27,580
is x and y coordinate and this is simply the point that has X plus W or x plus width and Y plus the

317
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,860
height which is this point.

318
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,370
All right.

319
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,000
That's it.

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,990
Amazing.

321
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,670
So that's pretty much all what I have for this lectures.

322
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,040
What I want you guys to do is please go ahead.

323
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:44,710
Another mini challenge posed a video and pass along here instead of the yellow color.

324
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,310
Pick any other color.

325
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,240
OK.

326
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,830
So just pick whatever color you wanted here and here change the thickness from three let's say to six

327
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,340
for example maybe 10.

328
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,580
And please let me know what you guys notice.

329
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,890
Please go ahead pause a video and I will see you guys after the challenge.

330
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,800
All right.

331
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,940
If you guys were able to figure out the challenge what I ask you guys to do is simply pick any color.

332
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,540
So maybe we're going to set this to 0 for example that would give me another another color and here

333
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,610
instead of three I'm going to make it let's say six and let's take a look what's going to happen here

334
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,900
shift enter.

335
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,620
And here we go.

336
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,850
Now it became red OK.

337
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,450
And the thickness of the line becomes a little bit different.

338
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,300
Let's actually make it maybe 10 for example shift enter.

339
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,810
Here we go.

340
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,330
The line became more thick.

341
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,760
And here we have again the red red color.

342
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,720
Maybe go here and make it all let's say two five five believe.

343
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,620
Let's go ahead to five five and make this maybe 20 enter.

344
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,520
Here we go now.

345
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,030
1 5 5 2 5 5 2 4 5.

346
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,800
It's white and the rectangle becomes way thicker.

347
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,310
Obviously it looks weird.

348
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,130
So let's go back and maybe set it back.

349
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,150
Let's say 2 2 5 5 0 2 5 5 and said this to 10 shift enter.

350
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,860
Here we go.

351
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,630
Actually a draw.

352
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,030
Plotted on top of it.

353
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,980
So.

354
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,600
So let's go back.

355
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,080
And so every time I'm doing I'm doing this I'm basically taking my image color and then adding to it.

356
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,790
Right.

357
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,550
So if you repeat the entire thing from scratch let's go ahead and run it.

358
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,290
So now I know that the new image right.

359
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,790
So let's do the grayscale too if I wanted to.

360
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,970
It looks good.

361
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,780
Keep going.

362
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,350
Cascade classifier detect multi scale.

363
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,890
Go to the faces faces define the coordinates and do the detection.

364
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,320
And here we go.

365
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,940
All right.

366
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,320
OK.

367
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,660
So I only have one rectangle that has been drawn and with the thickness of 10.

368
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,820
And with that specific color.

369
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,340
All right.

370
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,910
That's pretty much all I have for this lecture.

371
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,960
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

372
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,590
In the next lecture what I'm going to do is I'm going to walk you through my learning outcome too which

373
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,970
is how to detect multiple faces it's very interesting when I take another image and say I'm gonna take

374
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,530
multiple faces and then the next lecture I'm going to show you how can we detect the eyes and faces

375
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,700
as well.

376
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,130
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
