00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,050
Hello everyone and welcome to this new lecture and the PBS lectures were able to detect multiple faces

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,140
within an image and we have been able to apply that to detect many faces of our favorite scientists.

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,950
So let's actually run that again to make sure that guys are following.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:28,970
So we're able to actually detect this is the image for our scientists and we're going to go ahead and

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,200
detect multiple faces.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,280
So if you guys remember that let's actually exit this.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,170
So I'm going to press enter to exit and then here we're going to specify this as five instead.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,320
And press shift enters and here shift enters and we'll be able to detect basically all the faces in

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,780
here which is pretty amazing right.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,920
Yes we have missed couple.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,640
Yes maybe we have misclassified something here but that's fine.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,110
You know it's the idea is amazing.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,440
All right.

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,520
OK.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,360
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and actually start to detect eyes and faces.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,040
Let's see how can we do this.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:10,500
It's going to take an image underscore C equals to c v dot image read and he will get a pass along our

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,270
to those image.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,640
All right.

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,260
Shift enter.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,370
Looks good.

22
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,240
And that's the M.E. the challenging part.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,270
That's the new element here.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,980
What I'm gonna do here I'm going to have two classifiers.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:34,640
The first one is my face classifier which is equal to CV to dot cascades classifier.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:44,200
And here's what I'm gonna do going to load our heart if you guys remember ha cascades and within Hart

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,470
cascades actually do tab that tells me there are two classifiers so one of them for the eye and that's

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,330
what I'm gonna do it for the.

29
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,100
My apologies.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
So actually the first one this I am going to do it for the eye classifier so I'm gonna go ahead and

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,610
call this I classifier I'm going to have another classifier just copy and paste instead of I I'm gonna

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:17,710
call it face classifier and here instead of having this I'm just gonna go back and do tab and you'll

33
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,310
tell me there is one that is called Cascade frontal face default.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,130
If you guys are confused please don't.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,300
So I guess if you guys remember in the course package you will find that that is hard cascades if you

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,290
open it.

37
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,790
That would show you here that we have these are two kind of trained classifiers.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,230
All right.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,410
The already trained to detect faces are trained to detect eyes.

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,020
And here we go.

41
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,970
All right let's go ahead and see how can we simply detect detect this in an image.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
So first of all first we're going to detect faces first.

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:58,350
We're going to take a faces equals to face underscored classifier dot detect multi scale.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,760
And I'm going to specify Okay I am looking for image C and they need the same scale one put in two and

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,390
they need neighbors to be five.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,810
We have done that many times before.

47
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,300
And then we gonna create a for loop for every time I'm going to pass along my X my y my widths and my

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:26,010
height to and we're going to say in faces and every time I'm going to go ahead and do CV to dot rectangle

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,210
and I'm going to pass along.

50
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,650
Here's my image on the court color.

51
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,870
Right.

52
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,250
And every time I'm gonna get the ordinance which is a top left coordinate and the width and height of

53
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,290
the tangle I'm just gonna go ahead and actually draw it.

54
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,570
Right.

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,920
So I need point one and point to if you guys remember you can have point 1 and then he ain't gonna point

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,720
to the need to specify the colors and he's going to specify let's say 3 which the thickness of my line.

57
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:01,130
So you can say okay X and Y and then he'd say x plus W and Y plus H.

58
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:08,010
And he's gonna specify the color let's say 0 2 5 5 and 2 5 5 afterwards.

59
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,990
All right.

60
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,780
And then afterwards we'll go ahead and actually visualize it.

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:21,820
Going gonna say image show we're gonna say let's say Trudeau going to call it face and eye detection

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,250
in color and he'd have in a pass along my image underscore see afterwards.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,250
Please don't forget this please please CV to dot wait key.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,450
All right.

65
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,370
And maybe you can pass.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,050
You can just leave it like this.

67
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,100
And then afterwards.

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,720
So what we have done here simply we have just detected the the face.

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,260
So every time I was gonna go detect the get the face.

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,570
And here we go right now to the challenge.

71
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,460
Well that's a challenging part.

72
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,400
Now for the new part what I wanted to do here is I wanted to get my region of that face.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,430
So what I'm gonna do we're going to say okay let's grab that face because simply when I wanted to apply

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,630
my eyes classifier okay I wanted to I don't want to look for eyes in the sky right.

75
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to look at eyes within a face.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,390
So if a face is detected let's go ahead and extract that region which is these coordinates from our

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,250
image and look for eyes in it.

78
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,400
That's the overall idea.

79
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,420
OK.

80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,050
So first of all I'm going to say you know what.

81
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,310
I'm just gonna skip this step.

82
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm going to say okay let's select the face region.

83
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,660
OK I'm gonna.

84
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,310
And then skip it.

85
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,060
OK.

86
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,040
What I'm gonna do I'm gonna still apply my classifier the exact same fashion I'm gonna take all the

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:49,680
i's that have been detected is I underscore classifier I'm going to say dot detect multi scale.

88
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,440
And here I need to pass simply my region.

89
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,320
So whatever face I may be selecting here I haven't filled it out yet but let's call it face face region

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,050
and he'll face region has to be something right so face region and tell you exactly what you mean by

91
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,050
faith region equals something I'm just gonna leave it for now what I did here I just got the face region

92
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,600
right and put it into I.

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,750
All right so here I detected every single eye and here we go it's what we're going to do here we can

94
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,400
do the exact same the exact same code this exact same code we're just gonna copied and pasted here every

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,710
single step is pretty much the same.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,610
The only difference is and we're not going to detecting faces right I'm detecting I.

97
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,950
So I'm gonna go ahead into every single eye that has been detected here.

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,470
I'm going to call it I X to call it all y I'm gonna call it I w and I'm gonna call it I h every time

99
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,410
I take my here instead of having the image I'm gonna be doing this for the faith region rights exact

100
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,170
same face lesion I'm going to take the face and draw the eyes on it.

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,940
To which I with all these coordinates.

102
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,180
Right.

103
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:06,290
So here we're going to have eye on this X I underscore why and have I underscored X I underscored W

104
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,140
I.

105
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,340
All right.

106
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,590
Looks terrific.

107
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,290
And here we're going to show as well to the face and then here it's color with key and please don't

108
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:30,610
forget to destroy all destroy all windows and the only missing two bits.

109
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,860
Basically this is our code right.

110
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,880
So again it's tech faces and within the face.

111
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,850
I'm going to go ahead detect I is call the classifier and for every I I'm going to go ahead and actually

112
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,860
perform a loop.

113
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,890
Please make sure that this is all tab because this is a body of the four right.

114
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,170
And this has to be in line with this because every time I'm going to go ahead and actually detect the

115
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,710
face and then go here and detect all the I's within the face as the overall idea right.

116
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,680
Because I have more than one eye interface think of it as nested loops in a way it's a great practice

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,170
for our nested loop part of the of course.

118
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,190
So here in order to access this specific image what I'm gonna do I mean to say okay if you go to my

119
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,090
image color which is my image I can go ahead and actually grab my region this region.

120
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,460
So I'm gonna say okay go ahead into Y from Y to Y plus H.

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,300
And from x to x plus H this is simply or w.

122
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,600
Basically here w w h where we're pretty much equal but please make it like this.

123
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,410
We're going to say OK let's go ahead into my Y to Y plus H which is you know like from the height of

124
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,790
my image X plus X plus W which my width of my face.

125
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,860
So you're not my image my face just derision of that face.

126
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,970
Extract this from my original image and that will be my face region all right.

127
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,540
And here we go.

128
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,290
OK.

129
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,730
And then within that face let's take a look at the eyes.

130
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,080
So within the face look at the eyes.

131
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,640
And when you get out of the eyes grab all the coldness of all the eyes and draw them on the face.

132
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,890
That's the overall idea.

133
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,210
Okay.

134
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,880
All right.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,570
Looks great.

136
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,090
So let's take a look at it.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
So let's shift enter.

138
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,180
And here we go.

139
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,400
So now I detected the face.

140
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,950
That's a good good sign.

141
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,480
The shift and just press enter first I second eye.

142
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,920
Amazing.

143
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,550
And here we go.

144
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,460
Excellent.

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,410
That's great.

146
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,380
So now we've been able to actually take the faces and take the eyes.

147
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,830
Maybe you guys can go ahead here and change this for example into let's say zero and instead you can

148
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,140
have different light kind of color for the eyes.

149
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,860
Let's bring in one another.

150
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,840
One more time actually because so what happened is here it detected again another face another eye another

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,070
eye.

152
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,850
But the problem is OK.

153
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,240
That's actually very good point because first of all we didn't load the original image.

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,480
We are overwriting the image it has already that rectangles right.

155
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,790
You guys can realize here.

156
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,780
Yes we detected rectangles redacted it again here rectangles with different colors but they are a little

157
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,890
bit shifted which is good.

158
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,590
That means the algorithm you know is actually kind of smart in a way.

159
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,310
It's not you know it's not repetitive.

160
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,090
It's not like it's not like I'm like memorizing anyway it's actually detecting kind of you know like

161
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,180
several time detecting the pretty much the same region a little bit shifted but that's fine.

162
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,940
OK.

163
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,400
Actually this one mistake here.

164
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,990
OK we don't need this.

165
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,920
So there is a misclassification.

166
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,290
So what we could do again.

167
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,120
Let's go ahead and actually load the image first load the classifiers and run it again.

168
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,780
Here we go one face when I.

169
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
And here we go two eyes.

170
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,760
Perfect.

171
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,690
All right.

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,800
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

173
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,160
I hope you guys enjoy that entire project.

174
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,550
And now it's time for a mini challenge.

175
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:54,180
I want you guys to pause a video and please go ahead and change this instead of one point to maybe try

176
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,420
one point five for example and let's say here instead of maybe 10 one point all five like smaller number.

177
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,570
Let's see what's going to happen instead of five and maybe select like you know like one for instance.

178
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,730
And please go ahead positive view and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

179
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,880
All right.

180
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,850
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

181
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,500
We'll ask you has to do is to simply go here and I tried maybe a couple of numbers to show you guys.

182
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,600
So first I tried 1 point 0 1 OK and 5.

183
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:25,870
OK.

184
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,620
So instead of one point two I believe was before.

185
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,380
Let's set it to 1 point or 1.

186
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,220
Let's see what how what impact we're going to have.

187
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,860
Let's run it Run it run it.

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,840
Here we go.

189
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,830
Enter enter.

190
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,500
Looks good and it looks like nothing has changed.

191
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,460
That's good.

192
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,680
That means you know even if we change the scale to let's say smaller numbers or maybe larger numbers

193
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,360
it doesn't make much of a difference.

194
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,920
But what we could do here if we change the neighbors for example from five which means I need kind of

195
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,390
you know more kind of you know votes you know from five neighbors.

196
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,530
Are going to set it to 1 and let's see if that.

197
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,550
What impact what they're gonna do.

198
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,380
Let's shift enter shift enter enters and we go.

199
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,650
And you guys can see that we detected eyes.

200
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,260
That's good.

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,610
But there's a lot of mess up so I detected a new face here and other new eyes.

202
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,480
Another face.

203
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,860
It's like random basically.

204
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,210
So obviously this parameter is very important very sensitive so please make sure that you here you need

205
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:26,640
again for number from three to six at least two to actually make sure that there is repetition that

206
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,840
there is neighbors.

207
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,910
There are many faces many like pixels have to say that there is a face in there.

208
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,420
So I'll be able to detect it.

209
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,740
And here we go.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,870
Looks great.

211
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,090
And great job.

212
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
I hope you guys enjoyed this lecture.

213
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,320
Let's recap.

214
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,710
We have done so far far in this project.

215
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,620
We have been able to detect one single face with an image.

216
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,330
We have done that was amazing.

217
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,830
And the next one we have been able to detect multiple faces with an image in our scientist

218
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,190
image.

219
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,330
We are able to detect all of them and we have realized that these parameters are actually very important.

220
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,510
The neighbors and the multi scale too.

221
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,360
And then the learning outcome three were able to detect eyes and faces as well.

222
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,760
We have been able to practice some of the for loop skills on some of the nested loops skills as well

223
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,810
along with the open CV along with tons of learnings.

224
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,140
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture and enjoy the entire project and I'll see you guys in future projects.
