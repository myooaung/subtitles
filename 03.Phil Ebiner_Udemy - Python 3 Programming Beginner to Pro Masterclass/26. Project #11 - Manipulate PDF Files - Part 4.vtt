00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.850
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and the previous lectures were able to extract a page out

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.140
of a PD F and actually rotated by 90 degrees and were able to save it in a newly created PDA file.

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.090
Right.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.640
This lecture we're going to do something a little bit different.

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.700
Instead of reading one page what we're going to do here we're going to read multiple pages.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.590
So think of it you know it's kind of a mini exercise to practice our for loop kind of skills.

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.120
Guys remember if you want to repeat something more than one time we just use for loops to actually extract

8
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.600
multiple pages.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.780
Let's go ahead and see how can we do that.

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.250
So what we could do and say F equals two.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.740
We're going to open our again files.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.130
So if you press tab that should show us all the files you must have contended here.

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.690
There's tons of information.

14
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.170
And here we're looking for you know this PDA file Harvard Business School dot PD F and we can open this

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.970
file for reading purposes.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.680
Great shift enter.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.320
Looks good.

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.050
And what we could do after.

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.710
We're going to say OK we're going to create our right read PBF object equal to PD f file reader and

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.000
we're going to pass along here our our file f enter.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.440
Looks good.

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.710
And what we could do here in order to read more than one page that we what we're going to do we're going

23
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.170
to simply create a for loop.

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.570
Right.

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.690
And that for loop will pass along onto every single page.

26
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.000
All right.

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.940
So how can we do that.

28
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.890
What we could do again.

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.520
Okay num page which is a number of pages which need to extract it.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.760
Right.

31
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.110
So to do that we're going to say OK let's go ahead to our EPD F which is our object here base of here.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.270
And what we could do going to take a dot num pages that should obtain for us how many pages are there

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.240
in the PDA shift enter and if we actually try to obtain or visualize what's on page in it is is actually

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.690
we have eight pages which makes sense.

35
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.830
We were expecting something on this.

36
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.670
So now we know how many pages we have.

37
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.750
That's kind of the our full loop right.

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.160
So what we could do here we're gonna say OK for Page in range if you guys remember we're going to use

39
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.960
range and if you say range 8 which is range num page that would help us go ahead and actually loop across

40
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.260
every single page contained within our hour PDA document.

41
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.750
So what we could did here say OK for Page in range num pages.

42
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.020
OK.

43
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.580
So every time we're going to say OK page we'll have kind of certain indices right.

44
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.830
So we can with Page zero one two three four and so on so forth.

45
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.170
Right.

46
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.730
OK.

47
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.390
So what we could do after we say OK let's extract or let's get page.

48
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.430
Right.

49
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
Using pretty much the exact same step as we have done in the past it's actually go up and see how how

50
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.840
did we do it.

51
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.880
How did you actually extract the text out of just one single page.

52
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.210
Because remember this was the command to extract just one single page right.

53
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.980
Let's take it exactly the same but we're just going to make it you know and then and change it a little

54
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.080
bit to make it or to put it in an in a for loop.

55
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.570
So let's go here and press control.

56
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.540
All right.

57
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.380
And that's pretty much it.

58
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.930
So what we have done here we're going to go ahead and to our readers if we're going to Kent get page

59
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.960
but here instead of having a specific number one two three whatever I actually need to get my index

60
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.200
here.

61
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.020
So here I called my index page.

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.030
So let's go here and put this out here.

63
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.240
Right.

64
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.390
And then apply the exact text it's exactly the same as before.

65
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.000
But here I don't want to have six.

66
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.930
Let's make it sample page text or maybe make it.

67
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.210
That's I call it here in the notes one page text because this is just a single page.

68
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.520
All right.

69
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.360
When we start the loop we can start the loop with an index zero so page will have number zero.

70
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.130
So I'm gonna go here say OK.

71
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.730
Get page of zero which is our first page and extract text out of it.

72
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.910
And that will be our first page.

73
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.870
Go up and keep repeating page one page two page three and so on so forth.

74
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.110
All right.

75
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.480
So the problem here is that we haven't done anything with it right.

76
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.500
So what we need to do is that we need.

77
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.240
We're going to we're going to create an empty list.

78
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.650
All right.

79
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.150
And every time I'm going to read text out of here I'm going to append it to my kind of empty.

80
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.640
Think of it as an accumulator.

81
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.330
If you guys remember that concept so I can say okay PD if that's outside the loop PBF underscore text

82
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.840
on this call could all just to indicate you know that's all the information we need that's kind of an

83
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.530
empty list every time I'm going to go ahead extractor page and simply appended to our PD f text all

84
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.110
I could do and say Okay PD f underscore text on the score all every time I'm going to extract one page

85
00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.600
text and simply come here and append it to our one page text press again tab there will autocomplete

86
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.960
Okay that's pretty much it.

87
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.610
Again we created an empty kind of you know list here every time.

88
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.530
We're gonna go ahead create a loop.

89
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.380
Go ahead read our page extract text out of it.

90
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.130
Take that page and appended to our empty kind of list.

91
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.620
And that's it.

92
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.250
That's pretty much it.

93
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.110
To shift enter.

94
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.260
All right.

95
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.710
Looks good.

96
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.950
Took a little bit of time that that's a good sign that means you know there is a loop that took some

97
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.730
time in here.

98
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.280
All right let's go ahead and actually visualize how mean what are the lengths of our our list here.

99
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.740
It's actually copy that pasted here.

100
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.290
Shift enter the eight.

101
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.930
Which is good.

102
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.480
And maybe let's go ahead and actually visualize what's what's happening here.

103
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.760
So if you press control V which is PDA text on which is you know kind of all the accumulated all the

104
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.450
text from all the pages.

105
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.230
And if you press shift enter here we go.

106
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.690
So that's pretty much.

107
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.170
This is our page.

108
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.580
Okay.

109
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.480
And then there is comma.

110
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.120
Right.

111
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.920
And then there is this is kind of our second page.

112
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.250
Right.

113
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.520
And there is a comma.

114
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.940
And this is our third page.

115
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.610
All right.

116
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.680
And there is a comma right.

117
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.660
And this again next page.

118
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.330
And here we go.

119
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.620
This this is simply the Empire PD f contained of the texts out of typedef has been kind of you know

120
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.080
obtained using the using our for loop in here.

121
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.740
All right.

122
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.890
OK.

123
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.190
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

124
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.450
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

125
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.340
What we could do here is I wanted to.

126
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:39.040
I want you guys again to go ahead here and I don't want it to extract all the pages with it within the

127
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.510
PDA.

128
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.950
What I want you guys to do is to simply extract the first four pages only out of the PDA.

129
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.050
All right.

130
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.570
So instead of sitting here nine pages to simply all numbers I wanted to extract only four pages.

131
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.310
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

132
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.270
All right.

133
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.960
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge what else you guys to do is to simply instead

134
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.390
of extracting all the pages I just wanted to extend the first four pages only.

135
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.520
So what we could do here we can say OK instead of reading a signing on pages equal PDA filed nine pages

136
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.040
which is eight.

137
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.610
Let's go ahead and maybe override that.

138
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.270
Let's go ahead and maybe set this to four.

139
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.480
Right let's split shift entered shift enter and shift enter.

140
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.640
You'll find that he would have been updated to four and he put the f text.

141
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.980
All you guys would find that this is simply our first page here.

142
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.510
This is our second page.

143
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.800
This is kind of our third page forward.

144
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.810
And this is our fourth page.

145
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.590
And here we go.

146
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.730
You'll find that we actually like stopped here which is great.

147
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.720
OK.

148
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.750
Right.

149
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.920
And that's pretty much the challenge.

150
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.400
Let's go back and actually set it back just for you guys when you access the documents and that's very

151
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.460
much overhead for this lecture.

152
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.540
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

153
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.350
In the next lecture I'm going to walk you through how can we actually add a watermark to a certain PBF

154
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.530
and that should conclude our our project.

155
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.220
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture and see you in the next one.
