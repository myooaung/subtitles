00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.890
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.630
We're able to extract a certain page out of a sample PBF and actually write it into a newly created

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.010
PDA called sample a file and separately a file to as well.

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.800
And I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.850
It went smooth.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220
Everything looks good.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.250
Let's go ahead and then in this learning outcome three or kind of you know practice example three.

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.190
We're going to do.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.670
We're going to rotate PDX and write them to a new PDA file.

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.480
All right.

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.620
So let's get started.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.610
So what we you do.

13
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.050
Yes okay.

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.010
F equals to open again the exact same strategy we're going to open a file create a PDA file reader.

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.400
All right.

16
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.130
And they're going to create a PDA file writer right object and simply we're just gonna apply kind of

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.410
rotation we can extract the page get page rotate it and then write it in a PDA.

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.220
And here we go.

19
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.530
That's pretty much all we're going to be doing.

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.540
So first up message K F equals to open and we'll going to open this simply file.

21
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.400
OK.

22
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.830
And we're going can open it for reading purposes right.

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.060
Okay.

24
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550
Shift enter looks good.

25
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.920
Let's go ahead and actually obtain paedophile file readers objects are going to say Okay read underscore

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.790
PD F equals to PD f file reader.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
And here we're going to pass along our file that was just open.

28
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.020
All right.

29
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810
So simply here shift enter.

30
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.010
You'll find a repeat f you can refer to.

31
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.370
That's basically the entire PDA here.

32
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.980
Contained within this object.

33
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.480
And that's it.

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.380
You can refer to it.

35
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.460
And don't please go back and refer to the F ever again.

36
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.730
All right.

37
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.820
We're going to talk to it using this re PDA.

38
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.940
OK.

39
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.370
Go ahead create a writer object.

40
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.940
So what we could do going to say OK right on this called PD F and you're going to create PD f file writers

41
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.360
again if you press tab you will get the writers here.

42
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.790
And it's open because we haven't written anything yet.

43
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.850
And let's go ahead and actually extract a page from our read PD so I can say OK rotated on this court

44
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.840
page because I can extract the page and actually rotated when one shot.

45
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.940
So going to say Okay let's open our read PBF object which is you know this one based that get page that

46
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.390
will extract for us our page let's extract page two for example and then let's go ahead and apply rotate

47
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.700
clockwise.

48
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.650
So actually if you say you Tate

49
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.890
clockwise

50
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.690
and you can specify the degrees as well so going to specify that I want to rotate it by 90 degrees.

51
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.700
All right so rotate clockwise 90 and please make sure that the C heat is upper case.

52
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.420
And here the page here is upper case to all right.

53
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.270
OK.

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.160
Shift enters.

55
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.090
Looks good.

56
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.080
So simply our rotated page here.

57
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.370
That's our page that we wanted to.

58
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.090
This is a page it has been extracted which page 2 and has been extended and rotated as well.

59
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.170
What we need to do right now is simply take that page and simply write it in a PDA in our PDA F right

60
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.720
writer object.

61
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.590
That's pretty much it.

62
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.190
Let's go ahead and do that.

63
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.300
I'm going to say OK right on the score EDF which is again our PD f object that we instantiated here.

64
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.700
And what we could do.

65
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.540
We're gonna say dot ed page.

66
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.070
Just to add that page which page you're going to be adding We're going to be adding this rotated page

67
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.090
that we have in here.

68
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.980
That's all copy and paste it here OK.

69
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.380
All right.

70
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.400
Shift enters.

71
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.110
Looks great.

72
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.810
No errors.

73
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.860
That means a good thing that that doesn't necessarily mean that we're able to actually obtain the page

74
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.170
and rotated and so on.

75
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.320
Let's actually write it in an actual PPF and let's see if that works or not.

76
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.700
OK.

77
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.610
So I could do.

78
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.160
Going to say OK F two for example or you can call it whatever you can call it let's say PDL output it's

79
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.900
actually stick with the notes so gonna say PD f underscore outputs equals two.

80
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.690
We're going to open our file which is whatever file.

81
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.320
Right.

82
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.420
So here let's say you're gonna call it like samples page sample PD f rotated so just to make sure that

83
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.620
this is an actual routine PD f and you can open that file for writing purposes and what we could do

84
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.090
after we're going to say OK let's take our right PD f here which is our object.

85
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.290
Right and what we could do is going to say dot right.

86
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.440
And let's take it and write it in an actual in our file right.

87
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.940
Which is this file video output.

88
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.990
Again this.

89
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.640
These two lines are exactly the same as we have done before in the past.

90
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.180
We simply open a file that we create with whatever name.

91
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.390
And then we say OK let's take our writer object.

92
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.700
Write it in our PDA.

93
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.750
Think of it this way.

94
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.000
We're going I think the object like kind of you know like like push it or just you know write it in

95
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.280
our PDA a file and then close close it.

96
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.260
And here we go.

97
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.530
All right.

98
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.850
So now we wrote our our object let's go ahead and actually close it.

99
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.750
So going to take a f underscore outputs

100
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.880
output and we're going to close this and then let's go ahead and take our the other one and closer to.

101
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.380
So again F is our input.

102
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.660
Right.

103
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.830
Which is what we got here.

104
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.970
We gonna close this and we need to close as well PDL output to shift enter.

105
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.660
Looks great.

106
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.820
Hopefully we have a file that's has sample PDA rotate it's OK.

107
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.890
Here we go it has been just created simple video rotated.

108
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.080
It's actually open it.

109
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.930
And here we go.

110
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.320
So we actually expected the page and we have been able to rotate it as well which is amazing.

111
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.420
All right.

112
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.450
So again our mini challenge what I'm asking us to do is to please go ahead pause a video and extract

113
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.860
page instead of page two.

114
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.150
I won't accept page five and let's go and create it in our rotating IDF.

115
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.980
But make it let's say simple PDA rotated let's say underscore one for example please me go ahead pause

116
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.200
a video and make an attempt to solve the challenge and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

117
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.360
All right.

118
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.290
You guys were able to figure out the challenge for us guys to do is to simply obtain page number five

119
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.070
and instead of having Sanford PD rotated let's save it maybe in Sanford Florida too.

120
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:31.580
So please shift enter shift enter shift enter and I hope we got sample PD f rotated two let's open it

121
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.990
and here we go.

122
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.640
So if you guys remember this is temporary protected one business school whatever rights for you.

123
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.810
And here we have school ratings which is you know look a different one basically here.

124
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.190
All right.

125
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.760
OK.

126
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.280
Looks great.

127
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.700
And both of them have been rotated which is the objective of this section.

128
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.930
All right.

129
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.760
That's pretty much all we have for this lecture.

130
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.270
I hope you guys enjoy it.

131
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.860
Let's recap all of them so far.

132
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.150
We have what we have done here is exactly the same as we have done in the past.

133
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.620
The only difference is just rotated clockwise.

134
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.030
We again open the file for reading purposes.

135
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.900
We've got an object CPF and then we create another object for right PD F and then we extracted the page

136
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.880
out of our leading object rotated it clockwise.

137
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.370
We've got to rotate the page and then we took it.

138
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:21.740
We simply wrote it or kind of pasted in our right to object and then we took the object and we write

139
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.670
it into our file which is our PDL output file.

140
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.510
We close both.

141
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.410
And here we go.

142
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.760
We're good to go.

143
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.350
All right.

144
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.750
In the next lecture I'm going to show you guys how can we read multiple pages.

145
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.350
What's the reading.

146
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.460
Just one page.

147
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.660
We're going to learn how can we read multiple pages and kind of extract the text out of all of them

148
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.910
are out of all of them and they're going to be ready to the most fun part of all is to simply add a

149
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.280
watermark to our PDA.

150
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.630
All rights.

151
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.100
I hope you guys enjoy this lectures and see you in the next one.
