1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's get going.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,410
So the question for I'm asking you to develop a script.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,860
OK apology.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,900
This should be a script whose items are squares of the original list.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,220
All right.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,580
So let's go ahead and maybe define any lists of necessary.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,340
My list equals two.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,070
Let's call it range.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,440
And for example the final 121.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,490
OK.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,830
And what we could do here.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,010
I'm going to say OK.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,730
The let's go ahead and print the new list right.

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,320
And that list will simply be what we could do.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,470
We're going to take it for x in my underscore lists.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,850
So every time I'm going to go.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,150
Go ahead in this list which is usually defined before.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,060
Take a number.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,270
And every time you take that number and simply square it we're going to say okay x square.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,720
That's it.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,180
So that's simply a script whose items are squares of the original lists.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,550
Pretty simple really simple it's run it.

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,920
And that's what we're getting.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,420
Let's maybe define for example 10 and let's say 20 for example let's run it.

27
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,980
And that's what we're getting so 10 100.

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,450
And then number eleven you know squared and so on so forth.

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,890
And that's what we're getting here.

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,660
All right sounds great.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,750
Question number five and ask you to write a function that squares a variable and then apply the function

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,940
write a function that Square is a variable then test the function using the list of integer numbers

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,320
ranging from minus 20 to 20.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,270
So basically that's my testing.

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,160
OK let's write the function first.

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,860
So you don't want the function that simply squares.

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,020
No that's really simple I've done that before actually my safe gave.

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,550
Define squared.

39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,140
And I'm going to pass along the variable x and we're going to return to the main our x times x.

40
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,290
That's easy.

41
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,940
Let's call it.

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,880
It's going to say okay numbers equals to a defined range.

43
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,350
Right again here from minus let's say 20 to 20.

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,100
Okay.

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,080
All right.

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,360
And what we could do here.

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,010
What I wanted to do with I wanted you to add to apply or to run if you guys remember the map.

48
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,010
OK.

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,560
The map keywords are really powerful.

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,370
We're going to say OK let's let's go ahead and do it.

51
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,300
Going to see a map right.

52
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,380
You guys remember.

53
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,400
Right.

54
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,110
We're going to use a lambda expression right lambda especially take X correct.

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:45,840
And it's going to return these squared of X right and what we could do here when we do the map when

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,260
I say okay lambda x we're going to turn the squared of X. You can do it obviously here x squared or

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,880
you know X times X and that's it.

58
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,200
You know and with the map you actually pass along the entire list.

59
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,450
Right.

60
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,310
So that's simply our entire list.

61
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,550
You can pass it along here.

62
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,780
Right.

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,740
So what you do here is all that you have to cast it again in the form of list right.

64
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,390
I know it's too much.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,570
But again doing one step at a time.

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,330
Again think of it this way.

67
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,260
We're going to mapping we're doing a map right.

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,850
We're mapping an entire list.

69
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,550
Getting an entire list which is numbers and applying something on all the all the parameters all the

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,530
numbers you need to do for loops you don't need to do any of that.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,220
It's going to say okay my numbers here.

72
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,050
I'm going to do a K lambda.

73
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,120
If you pass X I can do X squared or I can just you know call my function squares a square of x.

74
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,260
And afterwards what you're getting here is you cast it in a list format and that simply will going to

75
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,710
be my number.

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,500
My numbers or numbers call it numbers squared.

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,150
All right.

78
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,440
And let's print that out.

79
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,420
Let's copy it and let's go ahead and print and give you my number squared.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
All right.

81
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:12,410
Obviously that's my kid I'm saying no squared and let's run that and actually you know what.

82
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:21,230
Let's make it better so I can say okay the square of the lists and it's defined as list is like this

83
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:30,660
is this for example if you guys remember we can do that list close to the brackets and let's pass along

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,010
our numbers right.

85
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,910
Which is simply our input and he ain't gonna pass along our numbers squared.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,730
All right.

87
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,940
Please don't forget to do the format.

88
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,960
So you have a format and we can dig that.

89
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Copy it here.

90
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,510
And that's it.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,560
OK.

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,990
All right let's run it.

93
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,400
All right.

94
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,050
So let's take a look here.

95
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,210
Here it looks a little bit weird so it seems OK.

96
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,980
Range minus 20 to 20 right.

97
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,840
So in order to convert that order to make it like you know maybe a little bit like like like readable

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,280
what we could do here.

99
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,100
We can go here to the numbers.

100
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,760
OK.

101
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,220
Because the numbers here's data type is actually range.

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Let's take a look at it.

103
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,660
So we say okay let's say type of numbers.

104
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,700
Let's run it.

105
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,660
And it's actually range.

106
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,510
Right.

107
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,780
So what we could do is that we can take that numbers right.

108
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,830
And if we cast it here like that.

109
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,980
Convert it into a list and then call it let's say num if we run it.

110
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,260
And if we take a look at num run it you can actually kind of come up with a list here and you can actually

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,170
take a look at the type of this you will find that the type is lists.

112
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,680
So now you actually convert that kind of from range you know into a list.

113
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,400
What we could do here you know we don't need to repeat it again.

114
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,710
We're just gonna go in and say OK.

115
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,100
Lists of numbers.

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,090
Let's run it.

117
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,240
And that's what we're getting here.

118
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,550
All right.

119
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,150
Looks great.

120
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,940
Actually we could do as well is maybe like add backslash n for instance.

121
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,450
So that's what we're getting.

122
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,680
You know obviously it's not very readable.

123
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:18,370
We can do as well or we could do with a square of lists and maybe add backslash and here's two.

124
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,380
OK.

125
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,740
Let's run it.

126
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,150
That's what we're getting to the square of the list.

127
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,260
This list is this.

128
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,920
All right.

129
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,130
It looks perfect.

130
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,210
All right.

131
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,170
Last question five.

132
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,630
Question number six.

133
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm asking you to write a function that takes a radius of a circle and it's in the diameter actually

134
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,860
ask you to see functions to the diameter area circumference and just the function using an input from

135
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,220
a user.

136
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,580
Let's see how can we do that.

137
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,490
All right.

138
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,750
So let's define our first function it's actually very easy question so we ask you to define.

139
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,370
So I'm going to say Circle K OK call.

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,560
I call it his diameter.

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,430
And some of them are going to take the radius.

142
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,030
Ah OK.

143
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,760
All right.

144
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,780
Looks good.

145
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,830
And simply the radius is our radius of a circle.

146
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,750
If you guys remember it two times whatever input I'm getting right.

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,800
OK.

148
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,890
So that's the diameter is simply two times the radius.

149
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,130
All right.

150
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,160
That's good.

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,690
Let's define that next function's trying to define again.

152
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:28,350
Circle area obviously can drive that in one function but here the objective is for you guys to practice

153
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,920
as much as you can writing the function doing all the column doing all the returns and so on.

154
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,320
So we can hit again return and what we could do to turn math dot Pi of this end into defined math and

155
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,730
defined right now we're going to take a radius and that would be radius squared.

156
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,900
Right.

157
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,230
Okay.

158
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,340
And before that let's go here and define import math right.

159
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,740
Okay.

160
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,090
Looks good.

161
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,750
And the third want to go define circle.

162
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,770
Let's call it that conference.

163
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,070
All right.

164
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,250
And I'm going to take the radius as well.

165
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,710
And the function should return my 2 pi r if you guys remember it was two times math.

166
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,510
The PI and times the radius again.

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,360
All right.

168
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Let's go ahead.

169
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,490
Let's run.

170
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,970
That looks good.

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,290
And let's test it.

172
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,720
So let's take an input from the user.

173
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,430
OK.

174
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,190
And let's bring them out.

175
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:40,770
So I'm going to say OK R equals to say and then ask leaves of input and we're going to say OK enter

176
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,820
a radius

177
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,220
OK the user will enter the 80s and then here will get a call basically the functions are going to say

178
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,690
print.

179
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,340
Right.

180
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm going to say a circle diameter equals two.

181
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,410
All right.

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,250
We could do here is a format method or we can just use this.

183
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,310
We can call the function circle right on the score diameter.

184
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,860
Please make sure it's the same exact same words to circle diameter looks good.

185
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,070
And I'm going to pass along the variable R.

186
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,920
All right.

187
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,970
Let's do that copy and actually going to do that three times.

188
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
Second one will get a copy the area.

189
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,370
So that will be the area and here are going to copy these at conference.

190
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,810
Copy this at conference and I'm going to call the area and we're going to call that said a conference.

191
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,790
All right.

192
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,280
Perfect.

193
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,570
Let's test that and radius let's say.

194
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,950
Let's start with this is number two.

195
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,350
So simply radius two becomes four.

196
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,150
Okay.

197
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,160
Good.

198
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,430
Circle area 2.5.

199
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,810
All right.

200
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:55,270
And then the set conference here is two math Pi which is twelve point five.

201
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,440
OK.

202
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,680
It looks like we are OK.

203
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,720
Two math pi.

204
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:02,950
OK.

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,620
Looks good.

206
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,790
That's pi are squared.

207
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,040
OK let's run it again.

208
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,900
Obviously here it's really simple because here we just the radius here was too right.

209
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,390
So it was it had the exact same answer.

210
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,040
Right.

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,830
Because here you you're multiplying two times two as one times math Pi which is exactly the same at

212
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,630
the area.

213
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,900
This little little bit confused I thought that might be we made a mistake or something.

214
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,460
Let's maybe try three.

215
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,150
That's what we're getting.

216
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,040
Actually yes they are pretty different.

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,980
So the diameter is six and the area is 28 and the circumference is eighteen point eight seven.

218
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,030
All right.

219
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,000
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,400
I hope you guys enjoyed it and we'll see you guys in the next lecture.
