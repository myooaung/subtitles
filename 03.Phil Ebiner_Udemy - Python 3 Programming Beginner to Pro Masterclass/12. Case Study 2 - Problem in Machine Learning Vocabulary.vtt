00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.750
This section we're going to describe the case study all of the problems at hand in a forum of the machine

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.860
learning terminology's.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.460
OK.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.550
So let's get started.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.290
The first step is here we have our images there we acquired it using the innate technique.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.020
So we have some images that are indicating that the cancer is malignant or in some other images that

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.220
detect the cancer is benign and in weeks checked out of this basically 30 features okay which indicating

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.170
radius texture premiered area and smoothness.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.700
All right.

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.920
And all that data said has been done for you.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.320
So obviously we're not you know like physicians or doctors of cancer experts.

12
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.310
We're going to look into the images per say.

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.020
Our focus right now is to accept all these features in other data you can access it from here it's in.

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
If you just follow that link it will give you the access to the data and there's data you will see that

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.930
we have 30 features and these 30 features we're going to feed them into the Classifier or the machine

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.030
learning model they can classify to us if the cancer again is malignant or have been our own.

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.260
So the first step is how many datasets we have.

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.760
So in this case study we're going to have five hundred and sixty nine instances which means that we

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.860
have 500 in 69 instances divided between them some of them again malignant some of them are benign.

20
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.790
And in this case study we have two hundred and twelve malignant cases and 357 benign.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.810
It's all right.

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.240
So what we do again and how would the Classifier is that we tell the machine learning model when we

23
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.310
train it when we teach it how to classify it.

24
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.270
We look at these features which is in this case we have three features and we're going to feature the

25
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.350
part of the class.

26
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.840
We're going to say look if you look at these features then indicate that the cancer is let's say zero

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870
which is malignant in this case.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.410
And then if you look at the 30 features may be classified as one which is kind of a benign.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.070
So it's kind of the opiate is is a binary in a forum indicating zero or one for malignant or benign.

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.560
And that's how are we going to feed or teach our machine learning model how to classify cancer.

31
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.480
In this case.

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.790
Right.

33
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.890
So let's take a look at the technique we're going to be using in this case study which is what we call

34
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860
it supported vector machines.

35
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.410
OK so let's assume that we have peed on the x axis the first feature of one of these speeches one of

36
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.490
the three features we call a feature one on the y axis we have another features feature to.

37
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.600
And as you can see here we have these two classes per say in this hour.

38
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.320
In our case let's assume this for example in the malignant case in this case these points are of the

39
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.370
red points are the benign case.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.580
And what we do is we want the machine learning strategy or technique to simply cypriani the two classes

41
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.440
in a very simple form.

42
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.170
We can just draw a line in between here which indicates Okay that's the line there that's or separate

43
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.490
the two classes.

44
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.750
Someone can tell me okay maybe that's not the line maybe we can put this line instead or maybe this

45
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.030
line is dead and so on.

46
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.670
OK.

47
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.310
So the objective of the training of our model using of the support we get getting machine method is

48
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.620
to find the best line that separates the two classes.

49
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.290
OK.

50
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.710
So that best line in this case we are going to rely on mainly these two points in these two points in

51
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.480
our study we're going to call it the supported vectors.

52
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.300
OK.

53
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.540
Again we're not going to dig into the maths mathematics of that which doesn't give you an intuition

54
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.810
of what supported vector machines are.

55
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.550
And how can we apply it in practical Python environment.

56
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.380
So I guess I can see here this is basically what we call the maximum margin hydroplane which is the

57
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.420
hydroplane or the line that separates mainly the two classes.

58
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.020
OK.

59
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.090
In order to get this line we use a distance of what we call the maximum margin distance and that's the

60
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.900
objective of the support detector machine classifier is to find and maximize that maximum margin distance

61
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.690
between the two classes.

62
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.380
And in order to do this we use these two many points.

63
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.510
And in this case we call them supported vectors.

64
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.140
Right.

65
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.490
So what do you mean by supporting the active support that there are points there.

66
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.660
We assume that these points are kind of on the boundary or a kind of an on a grey area.

67
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.290
Okay.

68
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.850
The unthoughtful the malignant in this case or benign in this case it's kind of in between what human

69
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.520
eyes for example or physicians might be able to I don't know.

70
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.670
This cancer is malignant or benign or if for example of this like image is a cat or a dog or right.

71
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.080
And that's why the support that they have classified is very unique in this sense that it's simply uses

72
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.800
the points or the support vectors that are on the boundary to draw the boundary out to classify the

73
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.930
classes.

74
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.470
And actually you can see here as well in the case study there is a point that the machines are very

75
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.050
powerful.

76
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.740
Really powerful techniques and why.

77
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.100
Because it's kind of an extreme algorithm.

78
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.860
It doesn't classify for example.

79
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.670
It's like samples of these samples.

80
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.260
It just focus on the support of doctors or the points on the boundary and cypriani them somehow.

81
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.750
All right.

82
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.790
So let's take a look at a practical example to get an maybe more understanding of the intuition.

83
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.350
So if you can see here again we have two classes we have our hyper hyper plane.

84
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.460
And here we have these other two supporting actors.

85
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.070
OK.

86
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.470
So it is assumed that we wanted to for example classify images or to teach the machine learning model

87
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.120
to classify images of cats and dogs.

88
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.890
OK.

89
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.590
So for example this point indicates let's say the blue indicates the cat's in the red and the heads

90
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.590
the dogs.

91
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:50.190
So if you wanted to classify cats these points which is kind of have it completely distinct or completely

92
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:58.260
different feature compared to the other points you would see there it's very easy it can easily identify

93
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.140
that this is a cat which has this simple white good features of the care that are very distinct.

94
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.230
Anyone even if you teach a kid can tell you Okay this basically a cat or a.

95
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.880
If you look at these points on the far left.

96
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.100
In the case of these features are for a dog.

97
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.380
OK.

98
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.810
You can tell that from the feature from the nose from the years from so on the from the colour.

99
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.090
These features indicate.

100
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.320
OK.

101
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.330
This is my 100 percent dog.

102
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.570
It's very difficult for the machine learning technique to misclassify them to me basically mix cats

103
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.500
and dogs.

104
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.700
However for support effective machines what we do in order to teach the model that we rely on the support

105
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.270
that is which of these two main points there is a kind of lie in the boundary okay which is basically

106
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.690
where gays can see here kind of an image that you know maybe I had a hard time is like a dog that has

107
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.990
some features of a dog at the same time has some features of its kind of a mix or I and these are the

108
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.180
points that mr. disport of a machine uses to classify or separate the two classes.

109
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.130
All right.

110
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.960
All right.

111
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.430
I hope you guys enjoyed that section and supported better machines section and in the next section we're

112
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.660
going to look in to the Jupiter book and start a visual ever did you guys enjoy this section.

113
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.050
And until then enjoy machine learning.
