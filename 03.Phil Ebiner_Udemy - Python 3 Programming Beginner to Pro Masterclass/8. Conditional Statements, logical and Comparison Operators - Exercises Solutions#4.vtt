Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.990
This lecture I'm going to solve questions eight nine and ten and that will conclude.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.630
Basically the exercise is questions for comparison logical operators and if statements.

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.190
All right.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.330
So here I am asking you to write a code that takes an input from a user and indicates how many number

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.720
of digits do we have.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.570
OK.

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.120
All right.

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.930
Let's see.

10
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.600
So first we're going to input the user data from the user to say x equals two ends.

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.300
We're gonna say input and we're going to ask the user to enter a positive number.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.440
Okay that's our on that's when I say for example 40 tell me Okay let's take a look at X and X has the

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.350
value of 40 it looks good it's entered in a couple of cells and it's go ahead and compare basically

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.260
perform the comparison.

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:01.910
I mean I say okay if my number if X is simply less than or equal to zero.

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.100
So I'm saying okay if X is simply less then I'm sorry if x is greater than or equal to zero.

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Right.

18
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:22.230
And if it's less than or equal to nine then we're going to print going to say okay single digit that

19
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.060
mean our number is a single digit in a second.

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.400
Else f sorry.

21
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.670
Else if my apologies if the number is between 10 and X

22
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.010
and ninety nine we're going to print normal the number is double digits right.

23
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.370
Okay.

24
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.660
It sounds good to say else if the number is between 100 and X

25
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.050
and nine nine nine.

26
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.950
Right.

27
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:10.450
Gonna say Okay print let's say you're going to call the three digits or triple digits and else if the

28
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.890
number is between a thousand right and X

29
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.230
and we're gonna do this as well between 9 9 9 9 2.

30
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.880
Okay.

31
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.580
Okay print and I say okay our

32
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.170
number is four digits.

33
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.180
Okay.

34
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.850
And then if none of this basically has been satisfied we're going to say OK.

35
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.540
Else which is.

36
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.280
Now that has been satisfied.

37
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.550
Masaki prints our number is greater than four digits.

38
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.840
Obviously can't keep going but that will you know will take us basically forever to the finish rate.

39
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.110
All right.

40
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.120
Let's take a look.

41
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.190
So here we have X equals to 40 right.

42
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.730
Let's run that then.

43
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.500
Well 40 is actually double vision because here we satisfy this condition right Senate.

44
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.650
For example let's actually remove this.

45
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.190
Let's delete this.

46
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.940
So d d to delete.

47
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:24.470
I'm going to copy this here just to put it in one single cell so x pasted here and let's remove the

48
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.280
D to remove the cells just to have it in one in one cell.

49
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.530
Let's run that into the number.

50
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.060
I'm going to say for example one hundred ten me well the number three digits looks good.

51
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.380
Let's run it again.

52
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.820
Number is 50.

53
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.510
Double digit.

54
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.790
Let's run it again.

55
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.820
Let's say a hundred thousand then.

56
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.390
Well number is greater than four digits.

57
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.890
Why.

58
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.250
Because we actually implemented this here.

59
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.240
Let's run it one more time we're going to see in nine nine nine for instance would tell me Well the

60
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.080
number three digits.

61
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.660
That means we satisfy this condition.

62
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.530
And so on so forth.

63
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.220
All right.

64
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.550
Question 9.

65
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.240
Let's write a code that takes an input from the user and indicates if it's even or odd.

66
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.460
That's actually pretty easy to say okay x equals two.

67
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.190
And we're going to say input and we're going to ask the user to enter a number right.

68
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.180
And then we're going to compare the number if it's divisible because remember X divided by two and let's

69
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.750
actually have ADD the condition if X is divided by two and the remainder was equals equals to zero.

70
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.180
That means we the number was even going to print even number.

71
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.330
I'm going to say OK.

72
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.530
Else we're going to print

73
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.670
odd number not off.

74
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.880
Obviously an odd number.

75
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.620
All right.

76
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.500
OK.

77
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.290
Looks good.

78
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.430
Let's give it a shot.

79
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.890
Let's run its internal number.

80
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.400
Let's say 5 then.

81
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.540
Well that's an odd number.

82
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.700
We know that five is our number and therefore even number that's running.

83
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.780
Let's try a large number.

84
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.540
Five hundred.

85
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.100
Even number.

86
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.220
Let's try let's say 5 1.

87
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.160
Odd number.

88
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.530
All right.

89
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.690
Let's get the last question here is that we wanted to write a code that takes the value of the dictionary

90
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.830
below which is here we have a dictionary with like let's say Sally with age 23.

91
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.010
Dina of age 30 and holy of age 50.

92
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.070
And what we asking to ask him to output only values that are twenty five in an output list.

93
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.380
OK.

94
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.150
That are more than 25 or greater than 25.

95
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.370
All right.

96
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.720
Let's see how can we do this.

97
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.990
Actually we did pretty much similar similar one before what we could do here.

98
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.470
I'm going to say OK let's define an output list first to define as an empty list here and I'm going

99
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.160
gonna say I'm going to say OK let's go ahead and what we could do first is that we can actually have

100
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.620
to kind of two solutions to this this issue.

101
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.360
OK.

102
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.080
What we could do is that we can convert that dictionary.

103
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.630
Take these values and put them into a list and that's actually pretty much the objective of this exercise

104
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.170
is to try to teach you how can we learn how can we actually convert from a dictionary kind of to enlist

105
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.520
or obtain the values from a dictionary here which is the key value pairs.

106
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.560
We wanted to obtain them and put them in a list.

107
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.350
How can we do that.

108
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.290
Okay x equals two lists.

109
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.200
And I'm going to say okay go to my dictionary dot values.

110
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.090
So when I say my dictionary dot values we apply that values method that will simply obtain only our

111
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.820
values 20 23 30 and 50.

112
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.410
Okay.

113
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.400
All right let's run that let's run that and let's take a look at X X has basically the values twenty

114
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.960
three 30 and 50.

115
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.850
Right.

116
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.400
And now we can simply implement or if condition and say okay if the value of x of 0 which is the first

117
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:09.080
index first element which is 23 was greater than 25 Okay what we could do we're going to say okay out

118
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.530
which is our empty list here.

119
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.580
When I do append and we're going to append basically whatever what's inside x of 0.

120
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.180
Right.

121
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.250
I'm going to say okay that's actually Peter as well.

122
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:37.210
Again one more time if X of 1 was greater than 25 out out dot append and I'm going to pass along our

123
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.410
x of 1.

124
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.870
Right.

125
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:49.030
And one more time I'm going to say if X of 2 which is simply here this value which is 50 was greater

126
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:58.270
than 25 we're going to say out dot appends and I'm going to pass along our value here x of 2.

127
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.640
All right let's run those and let's take a look at.

128
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.860
Outs and that's what we've got here we've got 30 and 50 which makes complete sense because simply we

129
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.620
didn't take Sally we only took you know like Deena values and holy value to 30 and 50 that are greater

130
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.730
than 25.

131
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.750
All right.

132
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.800
And that's pretty much all what I have for the section again.

133
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.770
Now you should be familiar with logical operators comparison operators and if statements.

134
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.080
Great job he should be proud of yourself.

135
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.060
Now we're actually pretty much ready to move along to the next section.

136
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.480
We're going to learn how can we do for loops.

137
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.380
We're going to learn how can we do functions as well and lambda expressions.

138
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.610
I hope you guys enjoy that lecture and see you in the next lecture.
