Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,880
We're going to walk you through the questions that we have four sets of tuples and give you skylander

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,440
a quick overview and then in the next lectures we're going to walk you through all the videos that include

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,590
the solutions.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,610
So first I wanted to print Hello followed by the name and the age in a tubal.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:27,000
OK so for example for you to have I found my cuple that has let's say a name and age and they ask you

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,370
to print Hello followed by the name and the age within that specific people are pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,190
Next one is I want to define a tuple with six of your favourite friends.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,770
Right.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,560
And then print all the tuple the last element and the first two elements.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,140
OK.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,590
So for example if you find this tuple I want you to print the all the tuple which is basically all the

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,310
elements in here last element only which are Steve for example.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,200
And the first two elements which is let's say here it's Chanel mitsch.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,590
Question three the final tuple with your first name last name and age.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,510
Find the length and the type as well.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,150
So again the five For example you know Tupelo that.

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,240
And then you wanted to give the length which is you know how many elements are there.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,600
And then you get together type of that tuple which is going to end up basically with a chop.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,170
OK.

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,020
Again these are very simple straightforward questions.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,930
If you guys followed the concepts lechery should be easily able to follow the lectures that we have

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,510
here.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,130
Question for print the number 40 here.

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,500
So this is kind of you know look out interesting one.

26
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,380
It's a tuple that has kind of list in there and couple of things as well.

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,160
So SQL OK.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,560
So I wanted to print the number forty one to in the word the word the word world here when I print the

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,750
number 25 print the entire list.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,700
And duple listed below as well when I print the tuple and will print this list or something like that.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,270
Question 5 executed the following commands anticipating what went wrong and what went right.

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,890
OK so obviously you don't just write a check.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,370
What do you mean by the way assignments.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,820
When it comes to tuple which is kind of you're not allowed on it.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,420
Question 6 execute the following commands then explain what went wrong and what went right.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,560
Okay so I'm asking you to you know kind of explored what happened here and you question 7 and ask you

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,660
for a check of the named Python exists in a tuple.

38
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,260
This is kind of an research which didn't cover that.

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,010
Okay to actually search for a name within a tuple but you guys need to kind of do your own research

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,630
and see how any search for a word within its people.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,500
Question 8.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,490
Remove the duplicates from the following lists.

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,990
Here have a list and then ask you to remove the duplicates.

44
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,230
Ok kind of you know tried to relate to sets as we've done before.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,880
Question 9 add your name to the following set and convert it into a list so wanted to add your name

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,340
here and convert it afterwards to a list he did for example added Let's see Ryan for example and then

47
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,590
you can add to a list line and then the last question I ask you to run the code then explain what what

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,590
it does.

49
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,970
We will cover that if you know kind of because we are looking to use if condition of conditions is moving

50
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,270
forward.

51
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,680
That's why I didn't ask you to actually run the code or sorry write the code.

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm just asking you to run it and tell me what do you know.

53
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,790
What do you get out of it.

54
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,430
Okay again again have you known in time lectured that exercise is just for if condition moving forward

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,230
right.

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,620
And that's pretty much what a half with the section.

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,940
Best of luck and see you guys in the solutions lecture.
