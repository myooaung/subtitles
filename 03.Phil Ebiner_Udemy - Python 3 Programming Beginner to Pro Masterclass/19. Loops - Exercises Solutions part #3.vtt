00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.660
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.960
I'm super excited because again we're getting closer to mastering four and why loops.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.410
We're gonna be moving forward to more kind of advanced topics in the future so let's get started.

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.140
Here I am asking you to tell me what does this code generate.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.850
So here I have basically again please don't run it.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.460
That the objective is not Do not run it right.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890
We must take a four letter in hello world.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.970
And basically I am comparing if the letter was equals to Oh all right we're going to do.

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.870
Going to say continue.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.170
Basically we're just going to skip this right.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.560
Not if else.

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.070
What we're going to do going to print basically our letter.

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.400
All right.

15
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.820
Okay.

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.140
What do you mean by this.

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.940
So basically if we run it you will get to simply print out all the letters.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.110
So we're gonna print basically H print e print print L and so on and you'll see that always been missing

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.680
and all he does well have been missing.

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.720
So basically we just kept printing the letter.

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.110
Oh that's all what it is.

22
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.460
Okay.

23
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.950
It's again pretty pretty simple exercise.

24
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.390
All right.

25
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.630
Question 8 I'm asking you to write a code that takes a list of temperatures from the user and convert

26
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.840
them from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

27
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.560
Okay.

28
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.960
All right.

29
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.630
Let's see how can we do that.

30
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.170
So going to say OK first I need to find a way to actually get data from the user.

31
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.150
Right.

32
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.610
And basically separate them by space.

33
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.890
Right.

34
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.470
That's going to be a little bit mind might be a little bit challenging.

35
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:43.370
So can we do that going to separate print when I say okay enter a list of temperatures separated by

36
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.670
a space day.

37
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.510
All right.

38
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.450
So the user will simply going to enter a list of a list of characters or just say this temperatures

39
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.910
let's say 30 40 whatever.

40
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.840
Right.

41
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.970
And what I wanted to do here which is liberty gonna be a little bit tricky.

42
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.460
OK so I gonna do here.

43
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.460
I'm gonna say OK.

44
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.230
When they use it insert all these numbers.

45
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.490
All right.

46
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.110
So simply I need to have kind of an input statement somewhere.

47
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.180
So I need to have an input statement right.

48
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.620
So the user can enter numbers right.

49
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.390
And what I'm going to do here I'm going to say OK I wanted to take this number and actually because

50
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.670
we have separated by space basically dot splits.

51
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.350
Right.

52
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.640
And that should split basically our our numbers into different strings.

53
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.850
Right.

54
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.430
You can have string of 30 string of 40 for example single 50 and so on.

55
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.350
Right.

56
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.130
So what I wanted to do I'm going to say OK I need to take this and actually converted into into an integer

57
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.910
as well.

58
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.220
So I'm gonna say OK for x in and every time I'm going to think Okay take the input take whatever input

59
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.980
things are going to get going to split it right into these like different buckets.

60
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.290
Right.

61
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.660
And every time I'm gonna turn okay our integer of X please remember that we need to actually cast it

62
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.480
into an integer.

63
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.790
Right.

64
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.690
And that should be returned here in our lists of temperature underscore C which is temperature C again

65
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.640
one more time.

66
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.820
And I say okay for x in input.

67
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.540
So basically using an insert input values and input strings right.

68
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.570
And every time I'm gonna go ahead I mean I think okay for X an input that split.

69
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.720
So I take whatever input gonna be used are gonna be inputting splintered right.

70
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.600
So gonna be splitting it because they are separated by space.

71
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.890
Right.

72
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.480
And then every time I'm going to take it and actually convert it in a way into an integer.

73
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.750
Right.

74
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.750
So we can have numbers then we can do the conversion afterwards.

75
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.770
All right let's run that.

76
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
And here I am asking okay to enter numbers are going gonna say Okay 40 30 50.

77
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.920
Ninety two hundred whatever.

78
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.990
Press enter and let's take a look at temperature see.

79
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.460
So temperature underscore see and that's what we've got here.

80
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.940
Perfect.

81
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.150
That's temperature C actually is a list.

82
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.380
Let's actually make sure let's do type temperature let's run it.

83
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.740
And actually a temperature.

84
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.050
It's a list which looks great.

85
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.630
Which makes sense.

86
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.010
And if we take a look at temperature C that's basically what we're getting here 30 50 1922 and 200.

87
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.300
All right.

88
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.040
Perfect OK.

89
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.060
So what we could do afterwards.

90
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.180
I'm going to say OK we wanted to take these numbers.

91
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.300
OK so every one every time and these numbers are going to take.

92
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.400
Get them and they're going to convert them into Fahrenheit.

93
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.660
All right.

94
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.520
So how can we do that.

95
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.500
We're gonna say okay four again you guys can write it in a separate for loop right here.

96
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.830
I'm just defining it in a list comprehension form kind of kind of thing when I say okay for i in temperature

97
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.380
on the score c.

98
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.960
Okay.

99
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.370
So every time going to take for i in temperature C every time I go take a 30 take 50 take 90 and so

100
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.860
on.

101
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.500
And every time I'm gonna get it and basically going to convert it into Celsius into Fahrenheit.

102
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.830
How can we do that conversion.

103
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.400
Because remember you guys can look it up as well.

104
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.110
I'm going to say Okay nine divided by five.

105
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.400
Right.

106
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.900
And that would be times the eye which is the number two gonna be getting in Celsius.

107
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.540
And you're going to say plus 32 right.

108
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.550
And let's cast that.

109
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.840
Let's put it as a list and put this in a temperature underscored Fahrenheit.

110
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.040
All right.

111
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.610
Again let's review something here for I in temperature of seats.

112
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.700
Every time go take the elements in the list every time.

113
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.500
Go ahead here take it and simply do the conversion.

114
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.440
Take the I multiplied by 9 0 9 over 5 and then add onto it 32.

115
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.060
Please make sure that the president's here makes sense.

116
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.650
So the present actually makes sense why because this is multiplication and then this is addition right

117
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.130
afterwards.

118
00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.660
Right.

119
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.620
K let's run.

120
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.240
That looks good.

121
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.940
And let's take a look at temperature on the school Fahrenheit.

122
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.270
Let's.

123
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.390
Let's see it.

124
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.390
It looks looks men looks a little bit doesn't look you know doesn't look too bad right.

125
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.060
So here we have 33 became eighty nine.

126
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.530
Here we have 50 becomes 122.

127
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.400
And then one ninety four.

128
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.960
And then two hundred becomes three hundred ninety two.

129
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.420
Let's actually take a look at some you know familiar numbers.

130
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.390
Let's assume that you know that we know familiar numbers put zero point twenty five and so on.

131
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.580
All right let's do it again insert for example familiar numbers zero.

132
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.360
Let's put let's say 25 and let's put well familiar with let's say 35.

133
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.610
Right.

134
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.630
OK.

135
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.190
Looks good.

136
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.920
Let's run it again here.

137
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.440
Run it again run it again.

138
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.340
And that's what we're getting.

139
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.580
OK.

140
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.240
So zeros translate to 32.

141
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.340
That makes sense.

142
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.070
Twenty fives actually 77 degrees and then 35 is actually ninety five degrees OK.

143
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.570
That makes sense.

144
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.240
All right.

145
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.970
And what we could do afterwards you can actually print both.

146
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.120
We're going to say okay let's print both.

147
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.660
When I say print say temperature my apologies.

148
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.650
Temperature in Celsius.

149
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.210
I will.

150
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:20.350
Let's call it degrees C and fair in heights OK.

151
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.740
What we could do.

152
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.850
Gonna say OK let's printouts let's actually do that.

153
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.800
And let's print our two variables temperature underscore C and let's print temperature underscore Fahrenheit.

154
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.790
All right looks good.

155
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.860
What we could do here as well we can you know put just backslash and just to make sure that we can print

156
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.390
that in a new line.

157
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.320
Actually backslash and if you remember has to be inside here.

158
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.040
Right.

159
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.280
So whatever is coming after this we're going to be printed in a new line.

160
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.330
That's on that that's and that's what we're getting here.

161
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.440
Perfect temperature.

162
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.620
Degrees C OK and then temperature in degrees Fahrenheit we can put it basically versus for example.

163
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.170
So something like that temperature degrees C versus top temperature in Fahrenheit.

164
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.990
All right.

165
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.750
Looks great.

166
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.480
Let's keep going.

167
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.720
So question number nine I'm asking you to create a password generator that takes the required password

168
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240
length from the user and generate the password.

169
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.270
The password should be a mix of characters numbers and special characters.

170
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:18.500
All right.

171
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.130
So basically here just the quick review.

172
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.200
So it's kind of you know the extent of research they guys need to do is let's say if we put string dot

173
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.170
digits.

174
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:32.950
OK.

175
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.120
And if we're on that you will find that basically that it's generating an error so you need to basically

176
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.720
import.

177
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.100
And that's what we're going to be using.

178
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.770
We can import string and we wanted to import as well.

179
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.110
Random OK because when I use it at some point.

180
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.440
OK let's do this again.

181
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.780
And that's what we're getting here.

182
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.460
So if we do string dot digits you will find that basically you come up with all the combinations of

183
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.880
the digits right from zero tonight.

184
00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.130
OK.

185
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.170
All right let's try.

186
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.880
If you wanted to do string OK dot and let's do ASCII letters.

187
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.170
Let's see how can we do this.

188
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.690
Okay ASCII underscore letters.

189
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.860
If we do that.

190
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.890
My apologies.

191
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.360
This should be string.

192
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.240
Let's run that.

193
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.100
And that's what we're getting.

194
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.330
It's got all the characters right.

195
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.270
So all the lower case characters and the uppercase characters.

196
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:23.570
OK.

197
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.660
Looks good.

198
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.820
Let's do again string dots and let's do the.

199
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.810
If you wanted to be it like exclamation marks and all that we're going to say OK.

200
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.830
Punctuation.

201
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.720
OK.

202
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.450
And let's done that.

203
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.310
And that's what we're getting here we're getting all in all a dollar sign you know percentage you know

204
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.260
like summation Mark perfect.

205
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.050
So now we have kind of an idea of what do we need to do.

206
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.420
Now we have the basics now have the foundation right.

207
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:58.880
Let's go ahead and ask the users to input and we can ask you to enter the length let's let's call enter

208
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.130
the required length of the password OK.

209
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.830
And these are going to insert a numbers game going to make it an integer.

210
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.760
And let's go here and let's set that to Lance right.

211
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:22.760
So that would be our length is basically our masking for a number let's say 4.

212
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.710
And if we take a look at the lens that would be number four looks good.

213
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.340
All right.

214
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.130
What we could do here is that basically we just want to go ahead and generate a random random numbers.

215
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:41.210
We're going to go here and basically just select you know like random random numbers out of out of all

216
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.660
of them right.

217
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.700
So we need to kind of a mix between ASCII characters between the special characters and between the

218
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.870
digits.

219
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.850
So what we could do.

220
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.630
We're going to say OK this is basically our list of characters.

221
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.520
Let's add them up let's add string the digits.

222
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:06.210
This copy that's put it here and we can concatenate just some of them up to this string that ASCII letters

223
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.260
and let's add these special ones as well.

224
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.060
All right.

225
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.410
OK.

226
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.870
Looks good.

227
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.920
Let's run that and let's take a look at car.

228
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.880
And that's basically the mix.

229
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.660
That's kind of our pool that we can use to generate a password.

230
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.040
And that's pretty much the pool that you know anyone you know any user will get to use to set their

231
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.610
passwords right.

232
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.660
So just going to select one of these combination of these obviously there's like you know like like

233
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.110
millions maybe billions of combinations in here.

234
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.140
Right.

235
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:40.140
So we could do here we're going to say OK we wanted to randomly go ahead here and select these numbers.

236
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:40.620
All right.

237
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:47.410
So can we do that that we can say OK the secret for I in range.

238
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.170
And we need to generate numbers from 0 2 lengths which is in the length of the password that you sort

239
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.770
of enter.

240
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.800
Right.

241
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.070
And every time I'm going to say OK let's define before this.

242
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.760
Let's define a password which is going to be kind of an empty string right.

243
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.880
So every time you go ahead and basically just concatenate take the previous password and concatenate

244
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.620
a random number.

245
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.840
So every time going to go here get a random number and concatenate it to the password.

246
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:22.150
Say keep password equals to password plus random.

247
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.060
Right.

248
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:30.500
And we can do random dot choice if wanted to select random basically characters within our car string

249
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.030
here.

250
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.050
So we have our car right here to this basically just going to go ahead and generate random one it's

251
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:41.720
maybe five and then add it to the password go back again maybe generate let's say uppercase Q And then

252
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.340
go back again.

253
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:49.580
And then you know do this say select the percentage sign and go back again and so on and basically going

254
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:55.610
to do that repeat it until we actually go ahead to the length of the number of the the user have entered

255
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.690
already.

256
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.940
All right.

257
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.730
And that's it.

258
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.660
It's afterwards we can actually go ahead and print our password.

259
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.120
All right.

260
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.230
I know it's a little bit confusing but let's give it a shot let's see if it actually works or not.

261
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.980
Let's run it digits digits.

262
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:14.710
Looks good and past passwords let's say six maybe make a simple number let's say five.

263
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.760
Let's go to the length.

264
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.620
It's five.

265
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.520
Looks good.

266
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.700
Here with credit card.

267
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:25.010
That's the mix of characters defined that initial password here we printed the password and you find

268
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:30.220
they have one two three four five basically just randomly generated numbers.

269
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.500
Actually if you run it again you come up with a new with a new one.

270
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:33.770
Right.

271
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.780
And if you guys notice that basic hit it has been concatenated on top of it.

272
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:38.990
Right.

273
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.260
Why.

274
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.020
Because the password didn't change.

275
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.800
So here I'm not defining a new password every time I'm running it's anything new password.

276
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.370
You have to run this first.

277
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.500
So this will going to initialize it set it to zero.

278
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.240
Right.

279
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.550
Go here will generate five values to seven hash tag and ze I.

280
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.820
One more time be asked you know whatever.

281
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.900
One more time it's actually really powerful passwords.

282
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.140
Really hard to guess.

283
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.420
All right.

284
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.340
You guys again can use it to develop your own kind of you know like password generator or whatever.

285
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.660
OK.

286
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.580
And that's it.

287
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.220
All right.

288
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:20.890
So basically here in this section we learned how can we let you two took three questions so far.

289
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.200
How can we learn how that could generate.

290
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.730
We learned how can we use continue.

291
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:32.660
Here we learned how can we feed data from the user and split it and actually converted into a list outcome

292
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.270
list output list from census to Fahrenheit.

293
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.050
And here we learned how can we generate randomly generated passwords.

294
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:44.120
And we learned how can we to use random along with the utilization of all the digits of the letters

295
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.180
and all the special characters within the English language.

296
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.680
I hope you guys enjoy the lectures and see you guys in the next lecture.
