1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:08,870
Hello everyone and welcome to this new project and this project we're going to learn how can we manipulate

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,300
PDA files or even deal with PDA files in a python environment.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,460
So we tried here to summarize kind of you know the learning outcomes that we're gonna get out of this

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,460
project.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,650
So first we're going to learn how can we extract information from a PDA if kind of you know extracting

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,540
text for instance.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,940
We're going to learn how can we copy a single page and paste it or put it in a newly created PDA.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,800
Another learning outcome they want to know how can we rotate PDA FS and write them to a new one to a

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
new PPF as well.

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,510
And then we're going to learn in learning outcome for how can we read multiple pages.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,220
So instead of just reading one single page we're going to try to apply you know of the techniques that

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:02,000
we have learned so far in Python such as for loops for instance just to go to every single page and

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,510
actually extract information out of it.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,910
And then finally learning outcome five we're going to learn how can we add watermark to a PDA.

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,290
So for example let's say if you have like a file and you wanted to add let's say it's confidential or

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,170
something like that then it will learn how can we do that.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,710
All right.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,110
OK.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,070
That's pretty much all what we are going to learn in this project.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,200
It's pretty interesting because you know we're gonna be learning without dealing with real data and

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,530
with real you know PDA Fs.

22
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:37,730
So the first step is before doing anything we need to install a library Python libraries called Pi PD

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,400
F2.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,490
OK.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,830
All right.

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,470
This is basically a common python library to work with with PDA files and the library can mainly be

27
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,930
used to read text from PDA files.

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,330
So we're not going to be able to actually read for example like images.

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,640
OK.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,460
It's not like kind of mature yet.

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,300
There are tons of packages out there but this is just piping the F F2 which is the one we're gonna be

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,990
using.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,770
We're only going to be able to read text files text information and then to install the library.

34
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:16,070
Please go ahead to the command window and just write pip install pi space pi PDA F2 please make sure

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:24,650
that P here is uppercase Y is lowercase PD F is uppercase and then to write and then it should take

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,350
like like in my case it took like almost I don't know five seconds and then you will find that there

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,550
is a bar going on and then wants to teach hundred percent then we'll get to go and then that means pipe

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,740
EDF when you actually import the library in here I'm going to show you we can imported like non pirate

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:50,390
pandas and once we do that that's it then we'll be able to apply all the all the functionalities basically

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,940
Piper you have to.

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,420
All right let's get started.

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,750
So first of all let's go ahead with the learning outcome 1 Let's see how can we do a very simple task

43
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,040
when we're going to extract information from a PDA.

44
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,740
Ok so my objective here is to just get a PDA file and simply just read it get some information about

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,020
it and maybe get some text out of it.

46
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,260
All right.

47
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:12,980
So let's get started.

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:22,220
So first of all we're going to say okay from pi PD F2 we're going to import what I'm going to do here

49
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,460
is I'm going to I'm going to import PD a file writer and PDA fi reader.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,060
It's pretty much works like a FLAC files if you guys recall in the previous section in the fundamental

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,620
section of the course we would able to just use kind of you know like a file reader and fired writer.

52
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,420
It's pretty much the same as here.

53
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,380
We're just gonna use pi the F to module instead.

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,970
All right.

55
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,180
Okay.

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,010
I hope it's very clear for you guys now.

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,350
Let's zoom in.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,660
All right.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,560
Looks good.

60
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,680
So we're going to load PD f file writer.

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,950
Actually if you press tab it will show you that there are three options so that a speedy a file reader

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,140
and there is PBF file.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,220
Again writer these other two stuff that we need.

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,640
OK.

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,010
Two classes that will each shift enter.

66
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,470
All right.

67
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,640
Well tell me invalid syntax because I need to insert the comma here shift enter.

68
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,380
Here we go.

69
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,870
All right.

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,090
So the first step is.

71
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,250
OK.

72
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,880
What is the PD.

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,880
Where does the PD file.

74
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,850
They're going to be dealing with.

75
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:23,900
So if you guys go here to the course package again you will find that under practical projects in python

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,760
there is working with PD files folder.

77
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,300
These numbering might be changed.

78
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,720
OK.

79
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,600
So just go to the working with video files and here you will find that there is a PD f called Harvard

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,940
Business School.

81
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,930
Again this is just a PDA file you know readily available online that show showed you how can you apply

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,100
to business school.

83
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,770
OK.

84
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,270
Within just just a sample PD.

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,160
And you know if you guys take a look at it you'll find that there is you know a bunch of text here.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,720
There is an image here so we're not going to be able to capture that information.

87
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,340
If you go down here to this page you'll find that there's you know 20 18 President and fellow Harvard.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,770
You know you go down here is business school right for you.

89
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,150
I'm just trying to read it for you so when do we actually captured or off in the page.

90
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,700
You guys can know what to expect the text you're going to expecting.

91
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,970
So you know getting the MBA can be found almost any organization standing here what is MBA view by the

92
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,540
industry with an MBA improve your chances of getting hired and so on.

93
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,780
And what should you do to prepare for business school.

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,050
And if you scroll down you'll find here like a lot of information anyways the most important information

95
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,840
here that we have almost around eight pages.

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,040
OK.

97
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,140
So we have this speech four out of eight.

98
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,360
And if it keeps calling down these are all the information they're going to be dealing with or treating.

99
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:41,900
All right.

100
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,140
OK.

101
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,730
That's basically the PDA file and the video file is contained within the course package.

102
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,900
Or you guys can download it as well from Harvard Business School Web site.

103
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,240
All right.

104
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,020
So let's get started.

105
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,020
So first of all what we're going to do here we're going to want to open our file so it's very similar

106
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,730
to see as we file operation what we're going to do I'm going to say OK F equals to open and what we're

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,420
going to do here we're going to open our Harvard again if you do tap autocomplete.

108
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,560
It should show you OK.

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,720
That is a PDA file called Harvard Business School.

110
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,580
The PDA.

111
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,590
Which makes sense because this file is actually contained within the exact same notebook so that you

112
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,220
put a notebook here which is PDA file manipulation project filming you guys won't have this because

113
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,390
that's the file that I'm building.

114
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,550
As we go you guys we're going to have basically the solution right away which is PDA file manipulation

115
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,790
project.

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,140
All right.

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,710
OK.

118
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,370
So what we're gonna do we're going to open that file.

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,370
We can open it merely for reading purposes you can say read and we can read binary because going to

120
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,390
see that file in a binary format and we're going to be dealing with it in a binder format as well and

121
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,200
we'll write as one in binary format shift enter looks great.

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,540
All right.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
So as long as you didn't get any errors.

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,210
That's a great sign.

125
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,780
And obviously as long as you didn't get any error in here that means PBF to have has been correctly

126
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,120
installed.

127
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,770
So the next step is we're going to create a PD f reader object to the overall idea is after we open

128
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,850
the file we are going to use mainly either PDA reader object or PDA right to object and then take the

129
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,260
object do whatever you want to it except pages out of it.

130
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,220
You know write pages to it and that's pretty much exactly the same as we have done in files before.

131
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,640
So what we gonna do is get a key read on the scores PDA if you guys can call it whatever equals two

132
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,240
will get instantiate an object out of PDA file reader because I wanted to read the file.

133
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,870
Right.

134
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,530
So I want to read the file which file I mean are either one of 3D file F so I wanted to read the file

135
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,650
F and using a file either are going to instantiate an object.

136
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,880
OK.

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,590
Kind of an object we'll call it three it read PD f or repeat f shift enter.

138
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,140
Here we go.

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,680
This is basically contained all the information we would need.

140
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,890
So let's assume that I wanted for example to get let's say some information regarding the documents.

141
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,270
All right.

142
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,570
So let's go ahead and obtain some information.

143
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,910
So going to take a read underscore PBF and then dot and then we can start to get some document information.

144
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,710
So I'm gonna say okay get document and actually if HEB it will tell me okay read get document info.

145
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:22,470
So if you press on it and then here please don't forget these two just you know empty parentheses and

146
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,330
shift enter.

147
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,930
And here we go.

148
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,000
This is simply just kind of you know like the information related the documents or the author was Andrew

149
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,610
you know Barlow Barlow the company is Harvard University creation date was 2018 you know like of August

150
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,280
and here it shows you like you know even the creator the producer and so on so forth.

151
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,730
It's pretty interesting.

152
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,120
And please go ahead and you don't give it a shot for any of the PD files but please when we are building

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,520
here our project let's stick with this because this function what I realize it's just it's not fully

154
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,050
mature.

155
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,390
The PI PD F2.

156
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,550
So it's not like if the file the P A file for example is let's say encrypted or there is like a lock

157
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,940
to it you know or there is any password it would be very difficult to actually obtain that information.

158
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,370
It might you know crash or you might not be able to get any information so please stick with this video

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,020
file first and maybe like you know try like all a couple of samples as well.

160
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,310
And and here we go Battier again as we learn as we build up our knowledge please stick with this video

161
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,900
file.

162
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,610
The next step is let's go ahead and maybe get some information and this information gets a free dot

163
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,830
underscore.

164
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,570
And what we could do.

165
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,050
We're going to say OK maybe show me how many pages we're going to say numb as you press tab it will

166
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,600
tell me on pages.

167
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,420
All right.

168
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,030
Just enter.

169
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,060
Tell me Well there are eight pages in there.

170
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,320
All right.

171
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,730
Which makes complete sense.

172
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,260
All right.

173
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,110
OK the next step is let's go ahead and actually grab a page.

174
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,750
Let's see how can we do that.

175
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,540
So what we could do.

176
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,200
Okay.

177
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,370
Read underscored PDA which is again our read reader object and there is a method called get page.

178
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,560
So if you press actually get any pressed have you'll find that there's a lot of information here.

179
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,720
Get page get outlines get object get on pages get is encrypted.

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,130
You know like I actually have not like I haven't tried all of them but let's go ahead and maybe try

181
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,950
to get page so going to say it get page and what we could do we can specify okay which page do we need.

182
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,500
So here for instance I'm going to grab let's say page number zero.

183
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,710
Okay.

184
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,230
All right.

185
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,370
Okay.

186
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,310
And the point is here once we grab the page basically you'll be able to grab the entire thing.

187
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,550
Right.

188
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,030
What we need that we need to get it were extracted text out of this page.

189
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,430
So afterwards we're gonna say dot extract text.

190
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,660
All right.

191
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,620
So that will extract the test text out of this page which is coming out of our read PBF kind of object

192
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,140
which is simply the file.

193
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,980
Think of this replay F as the file.

194
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,520
All right.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,950
So we're going to get page number zero out of our file and then going to extract text only out of this

196
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,620
page because this page comes with images comes with tons of stuff.

197
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,130
Right.

198
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,480
OK shift enter.

199
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,970
And here we go.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,850
So there is undergraduate resource seeders carried services.

201
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,890
So if you go back to our PD off file you can have it open here.

202
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,320
So

203
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,180
so here we go.

204
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,260
That's our Video file

205
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,950
so you'll find that because I specified page zero.

206
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,680
So this is an image that I wasn't able to grab that information but I was able to grab that right.

207
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,130
So we were able to obtain you know like 6 1 7 and so on.

208
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,870
Let's actually make sure that we have this.

209
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,530
OK.

210
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,010
So here are the numbers 6 1 7.

211
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,510
And there's Harvard University news and so on so forth.

212
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,830
All right.

213
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,490
Perfect.

214
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,010
OK.

215
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,450
Let's keep going.

216
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,680
So this is simply our how can we expect the text right.

217
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,840
But what we could do is that we can grab that and put it for example in let's say sample under a score

218
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,440
page on the score page on the score text.

219
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,040
Right.

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,180
This is simply our sample.

221
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,160
So this shift enter and we can actually go ahead copy this and paste it here and we're going to get

222
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,530
the same text right.

223
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,940
Maybe let's go ahead and try page one.

224
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,800
All right shift enter shift enter.

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,700
Here we go.

226
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,520
So now would we be able to obtain you know like all these like information.

227
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,030
And if you go back to page one you would find that there is some information in here.

228
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,380
2018 President and fellow you know like Office of key services and so on so forth all right.

229
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,280
So what I want you guys to do is to simply please go ahead pause a video and please try to print or

230
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,470
try to obtain sample text for page five and Page Six.

231
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,430
So I wanted to simply create kind of two kind of variables in here that has text for page five and text

232
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,480
for Page Six.

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,330
Please go ahead positive video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

234
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:09,990
All right.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,870
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

236
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,200
When I ask you guys to do is to simply obtain page five and Page Six so if you can copy that piece of

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,010
here and we can obtain here before page let's say page five.

238
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,490
And if you please press shift enter and if you take a look at it maybe we can call this for example

239
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:35,530
like page five for instance you know so sample page let's say page for example five underscored text

240
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,870
and we can come here.

241
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,310
Copy it pasted.

242
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,480
And here we go.

243
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,760
So that's all the text that we contain in here.

244
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,200
All right.

245
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,500
What we could do as well is you can say Okay I need Page Six too.

246
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:53,380
So I'm gonna say Okay page six and I can come here and do this and come here and do this.

247
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,870
And here we go.

248
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,200
All right.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,670
So again that's all the text we get.

250
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,530
With these bare in mind that the documents talked with index zero.

251
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,780
Right.

252
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,180
So what I meant I need page 5 or Page 6 I just need like index here 5 or six.

253
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,110
OK.

254
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,440
All right.

255
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,670
OK.

256
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,770
So that's pretty much the challenge.

257
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,610
And the last step they wanted to do after we do that is because we open the file in here we said F equal

258
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,470
open.

259
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:28,660
Harvard Business School I need to actually go ahead and close the file so I'm gonna say OK f dot close.

260
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,280
And that should cause a shift enter.

261
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,000
He would go.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,650
Now we close the file and that's pretty much how can we read any information from our PDA.

263
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:36,920
All right.

264
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,540
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture.

265
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,850
And let's recap what we have done so far.

266
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,980
So in this lecture we're able to go ahead and actually extract information out of a PDA.

267
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,380
So here we just obtained.

268
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,850
We first we imported Piper the F two and then we open it read PBF will pin some document information

269
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,640
and then within a couple of number of pages and then we're able to actually extract text out of our

270
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,960
sample text PDF and we're able as well to do kind of the mini challenge to extract so many pages and

271
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,090
as well afterwards we go ahead and close the file.

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,070
And that's pretty much all we'll have for this lecture in the next lectures.

273
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,430
Going to walk you through how to copy a single page and put it in a newly created PDA.

274
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,530
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
