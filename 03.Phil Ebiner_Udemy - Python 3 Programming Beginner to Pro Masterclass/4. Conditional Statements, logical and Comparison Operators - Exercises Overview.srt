00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,390
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,050
I'm super excited because here we can actually apply what we have learned in the concept lecture and

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,540
see how can we implement comparison logical operators.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,540
And if else statements as well.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's go ahead and walk you through the exercises.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,340
OK.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,490
I'm gonna walk you through what we need to do here.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,270
Here we actually have 10 questions.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,340
So in this lecture I'm just gonna show you.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,270
I'm gonna walk you through the questions please make an attempt to actually solve the questions on your

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,160
own.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,580
All right.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
And in the next lecture we can have detailed video explanations for all these questions.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,930
If you guys get stuck in any of them.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,810
Okay.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,180
So I'm asking you what will this code generate again please do not run the code here we have a couple

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,180
of you know like comparisons and I'm asking you which one you know is should that generate false or

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,650
true.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,330
Okay.

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,300
All right.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,980
The question too.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm asking you what would this code generate as well.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,770
So here we have a couple of questions.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,300
Okay.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,330
We have some and some and here and we have all conditions well.

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,260
And we're asking you what will this code generate.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,500
All right.

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,290
OK.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,830
In the third question I'm asking you again what will this code generate.

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,620
So I defined a variable X equals 20 and define other variable Y equals 30.

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,290
And here I am comparing using pretty much all you know like the easy comparison operators that we have

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,240
done before.

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,920
I'm asking you to tell me okay.

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,470
You know like how can we what do we expect to come out of this code.

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,930
All right.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,650
All right.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,120
QUESTION FOR I'M ASKING YOU GIVEN THE DICTIONARY below.

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,290
So here I am giving you a dictionary which is a little bit kind of an intermediate level.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,530
Please bear in mind that these questions are intermediate level.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,920
Okay.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,820
So we pretty much passed the beginners level which is we have discussed before in the previous section

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,610
here we learned what they mean by dictionary if you guys remember we can have key value pairs which

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,260
is let's say key one that associate the value of 20 key to us here 20 30.

44
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,830
And Casey had the value of 50 and I'm asking you given the dictionary below please write to code write

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,150
a code.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,230
My apologies here.

47
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,010
This should be a write a code.

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,140
Write a code to select dictionary elements that are greater than or equal to 30.

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,540
And place the values in a list.

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,400
So I'm asking you guys to go here and simply try to obtain the values of the dictionary all the various

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,020
within the dictionary and compare them to the value of 30.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:44,050
If they are equal to or greater than 30 then place them put them in a separate list.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,850
OK.

54
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,870
Again that might be a little bit challenging please if you feel a bit of a challenge you don't want

55
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,130
about it.

56
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,970
We're going to have again detailed video explanation to illustrate how can we do this.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,620
All right.

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,250
Question 5 I wanted you guys to write a code that takes a number from a user and compare it to a randomly

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,740
generated number and states.

60
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,700
Which one is larger or smaller.

61
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,230
So simply put here I'm going to ask the user to insert a number and I'm going to generate a random number.

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,240
OK.

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,450
And we're going to simply compare the two together and print to the user.

64
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,360
If that number is greater than or equal to the randomly generated number.

65
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,080
OK.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
Again this is kind of little bit advanced intermediate advanced.

67
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,100
Again the objective here is not to challenge you guys.

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,890
The objective is to give you as ton of exercise as possible.

69
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,530
So pretty much in the first like let's say three examples were pretty straightforward.

70
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,330
You guys we covered that before.

71
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,560
Here a little bit more intermediate a little bit more advanced.

72
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,280
Don't worry about it.

73
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,060
We're going to solve all of them in Question 6.

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm asking you to write a code that takes a number and indicate if it's positive negative or zero.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,980
So I'm going to ask the user to insert the number and they're going to compare that number to zero to

76
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,560
see if is greater than zero.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,770
If it's less than zero and if it's equals to zero.

78
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,910
All right.

79
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,950
In the next question I'm asking you to write a script that will prompt a user for an input and checks

80
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,340
if the number is divisible by five.

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,540
But not a multiple of 7.

82
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,400
So I'm asking the user to insert the number and simply we're going to compare.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,600
We're going to see if that number is divisible by five.

84
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,760
And it has to be not a multiple of seven.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,110
Okay.

86
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,370
All right.

87
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,700
In Question 8 I'm asking to write a code that takes an input from the user and indicates it's number

88
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,040
of digits.

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,710
So I wanted to see OK how many digits are in there.

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Again that's a little bit advanced.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,330
Don't worry about it here.

92
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,360
I just wanted to introduce you to the questions.

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,860
And the next lecture we're going to go ahead and answer all our all these questions together in Question

94
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,400
9 I'm asking you to write a code that takes input from the user and indicates if it is even or odd.

95
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,710
So if you guys remember to check if the number is even at all we can take the number divided by two

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,730
and if we don't have any remainder then the output is even or the number is even if it has the remainder

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,420
then the outcome is odd or the number is odd.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,080
Right.

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,140
And the last question here I ask you to write a code that takes the value of the dictionary below.

100
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,990
So you have a dictionary Sally with each twenty three Dina of age 30 and holy of each 50.

101
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:41,190
And I'm asking you to take these values the dictionary below and output values more than 25 in an output

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,940
list.

103
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,100
So basically I going to compare all these values if they are greater than or less than basically sorry

104
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,430
if they're greater than twenty five.

105
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,570
We're just gonna use them we're going to basically kind of export them in a separate list.

106
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:55,840
Okay.

107
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,640
You can call that list out took a call list whatever afterwards.

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
All right.

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,920
And that's pretty much all what I have for these questions lecture please make an attempt to solve at

110
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,080
least let's say the first three questions.

111
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,940
Okay.

112
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,600
And afterwards we'll get to in the next lecture we're gonna go ahead and have a detailed explanation

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,140
to all these questions.

114
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,160
I hope you guys enjoy the lecture and happy learning.
