00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm super excited because we're getting closer to actually training our model.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.080
OK.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.990
So in the previous letter we're able to revive our data set in to extreme an X test using gene test

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.910
split.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.470
So were able to have again now all our data is ready for training.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.350
We have extreme ecstasy.

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.160
Why try away.

9
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.800
That's that's all what we need.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.790
Okay.

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.590
Let's go ahead and treat our model.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.250
So what we're going to do you know going from the esky learn we're going to import a linear regressive.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.140
Okay let's see how can we do this.

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.770
Okay.

15
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.770
From scaler in.

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.370
Dot linear.

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.770
The squid model and and going to import our linear regression.

18
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.010
That's the first step.

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.260
So going to import our linear regression class which is again does all the magic for us.

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.520
It drums are the least square of the you know magic for us.

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.070
And all we need to do just plot our and be values which is our best fit line that best fit the deed.

22
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.960
Okay great.

23
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.610
That's first step.

24
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.100
Let's run that shift entered again ran successfully That's great.

25
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.870
And what we're going to do here we're going to import after we import of the class we're going to end

26
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.430
essentially an object out of our class.

27
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.450
How can we do that.

28
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.610
When I say okay regressors equals two.

29
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660
Again you can call it whatever you want.

30
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.380
Again huge linear regression n mcginnis say fits underscore intercepts equals to K or 8.

31
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.930
What do you mean by fit into step.

32
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.620
So first.

33
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.420
First of all he said what we have done is that we are we loaded or we imported our class and what we

34
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.220
have done here.

35
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.450
Let's make sure this isn't uppercase.

36
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.130
All you have done here is that we instantiate with an object which is doing a regression and we call

37
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.820
it aggressive.

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.460
You can call it whatever you want.

39
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.510
And here we assume that fit into SEP equity.

40
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.940
When we when we say fit into step backwards too that means we're asking the model to simply update for

41
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.490
us not just the slope m but toppin as well.

42
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.870
Our intercept which is valuev if we set fit intercept equals false and then the norm is that going to

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.820
the model we're going to be forced to go through the audition which is go to through the 0 which means

44
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.260
if we if we set foot intercept equals to false that means the line will only or the model will only

45
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.090
get to turn the value which is the value only and the B will be a by default.

46
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.940
We're going to be zero.

47
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.880
OK let's go ahead then as you see fit into step backwards.

48
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.370
True.

49
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.110
And our challenge for this lecture is going ask you guys to go ahead and set it to false and see how

50
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.240
can you know what.

51
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.280
Like what changes are going to be made to the model.

52
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.250
All right.

53
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.320
So after We'll pick that aggressive we're going to apply the fit method on our object sort of the sake

54
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.000
of regressors dont fit.

55
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.220
And then he'll we have to pass along our teeling data and testing our training data which is our input

56
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.680
output and so x underscored teen n y and discord T.

57
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.580
So again just to again looks a little bit weird if you guys haven't seen that before.

58
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.560
First we instantiate our our class which has been their aggression.

59
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.030
And then he twisted instantiate an object out of our class and then we assume fit intercept liquids

60
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.580
through.

61
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.940
And that would add to our aggressor and then we used the fit method on our aggressor using the taining

62
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.240
end.

63
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.170
Mainly the input output data or the trailing data for us it.

64
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.680
Let's run this shift into shift into game looks good then say okay fit and set to normalize faults and

65
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.910
once you get that feedback that means that one has been three that set the model has been tweaked.

66
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.530
Let's take a look at our officiants.

67
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.750
Let's take a look at our optimized values which is our.

68
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.220
And be polymers.

69
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.820
All right.

70
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.670
Let's print them out.

71
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.630
So massive say prints say okay linear model fission and we're going to call it m.

72
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.360
So that's I would add a slope simply Actually our slope we're going to be returned in our aggressor

73
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.120
here which is what aggressor's actually going to copy it.

74
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.260
And if we use dot efficient underscore that we're simply going to obtain all our coefficients our slope

75
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.380
it's action on debt so we're latrun it.

76
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.160
And that's pretty much it's always our slope is twenty one point three to our right.

77
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.420
Great.

78
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.500
That's the optimized value that we're in the least square.

79
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.180
Again we haven't seen any leads squared.

80
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.330
We have seen all the residuals calculations of the minimum of some square or these wearing or the or

81
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.760
the optimization that has been done.

82
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970
All that happened in the background once we'd end the fit message.

83
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.670
Okay.

84
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.800
So don't worry about it now you're ready have the slope of the line.

85
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.810
Let's go ahead and print going to print.

86
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:12.550
Linear model coefficients and this time I'm going to say that's OUR be value our B value which is our

87
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.470
y intercept that will be our aggressor.

88
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.430
God's going to call it intercept underscored.

89
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.640
All right let's run that.

90
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.760
And that set us back.

91
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.030
Actually our model got efficient.

92
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.700
Our y intercept is intercepting the at 47 here.

93
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.460
Let's actually confirm this if we go up.

94
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.000
If you as a call to our plot our plot here if we take a look here you will see that simply the line

95
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.040
here should be like a linear line.

96
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.600
Right.

97
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.340
So the linear line basically the best line that the media has contributed or pain or the you know the

98
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.830
optimization least square optimization was actually a line that has cotey of the y axis at 45 which

99
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.710
is the line should look like like this in a way.

100
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.510
OK.

101
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.170
Actually going to along the line of the next section going to see what does it look like.

102
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.020
OK.

103
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.160
And so again just to recap all we've done so far here we imported our linear regression.

104
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.670
Afterwards we instantiate an object out of our class and then we said the fit intercept equates to to

105
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:27.340
be able to actually or pime a y value or an intercept value and then we use the fit method on what aggressor's

106
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.090
using the extreme and whity.

107
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.570
And then he would plot of the coefficient of the slope which is M and we were able to plot as well The

108
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.450
Intercept which is the y intercept B or I.

109
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.850
And now I'm going to leave you for a quick challenge.

110
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.780
I'm going to ask you to set the intercept equals the false.

111
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.360
And please let me know run all these lines again and please let me know what's the value of that call

112
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.940
fissions.

113
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.080
And what's the value of our of our interceptors work.

114
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.320
Alright.

115
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.920
Okay.

116
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.320
So please go ahead and pop the video and when you see you after the Pops.

117
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.780
All right.

118
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.210
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

119
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.170
The challenge was pretty simple.

120
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.170
So what I ask you to do is to go here in sort of true.

121
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.770
Just set it to false.

122
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.880
OK.

123
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.910
Let's run in all the cells again.

124
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.140
That's sunrun done.

125
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.070
Okay.

126
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.250
And let's run.

127
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.800
All right.

128
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.220
That's pretty interesting.

129
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:28.640
So I think what you guys saw here is the officiant which is the y intercept has been set to zero.

130
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.290
Why.

131
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.810
Because we said fit in step equals supports.

132
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.040
That means you are asking the model to simply obtain the slope okay and force the line to pass through

133
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.400
the audition path through this point zero and zero.

134
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.650
And that's pretty much that's pretty much it.

135
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.890
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture actually in the next section.

136
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.010
See I can kiss the model and you know visualize the modern kind of plot the best fit line you know the

137
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:59.950
best line that you're themed along with our data using both fit intercept true and fit intercept equal

138
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.820
efforts.

139
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.330
I hope you guys enjoyed that lecture and see you in the next lecture.
