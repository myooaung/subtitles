00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.330
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.310
We're able to read text out of a paedophile.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.190
And in this lecture I'm going to walk you through how to copy a single page and put it in a newly created

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.670
PDA.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.900
All right.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.010
So let's get started.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.850
So what we're gonna say we're gonna do here we're going to say okay F equals two.

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.030
We're going to open our file so that's again simply our file that we have.

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.400
If we press tab.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.870
That's the file and we can open that file for reading purposes.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.880
You're going to say okay four read binary.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.840
Right.

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.110
And as we have done before we're going to create again an object we're gonna call it read PDA F equals

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
to p IDF readers

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.280
PDA file reader.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.830
All right.

17
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.020
And we're going to pass along here our file which is with the file that we opened F.

18
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.580
And afterwards we're going to say OK maybe let's get a sample page.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.350
Going to say sample on the score page equals to read PD f.

20
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.170
All right.

21
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.250
And we're going to say dot get page.

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.030
So that's how we're going to get a sample page and actually not gonna text get text out of this page

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.540
which is gonna get the entire page as is press shift enter.

24
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.110
And he was selected maybe for example which port for instance.

25
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.380
All right.

26
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.790
So that's how we read.

27
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.060
Right.

28
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.050
So let's actually do that and that's okay.

29
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.410
Let's read PBF.

30
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.320
Okay let's go ahead here and let's see how can we actually write a PDA f write a page in a new PDA.

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.790
So the important point here is we in the same fashion as we created a reader objects what we could do.

32
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.960
We're going to create a writer object so going to say OK right on the score PBF and that would be kind

33
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.290
of you know like the the the object they're going to be referring to whenever we wanted to write something.

34
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.380
So I'm gonna say okay we're gonna go PD f file reader again if you press tab there is a reader and the

35
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.930
writer.

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.700
We're going to select the right one and we can open here empty parentheses.

37
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.970
All right.

38
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820
And then what we're going to do we're going to say Okay let's take write underscore PD F and we're gonna

39
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.470
do we gonna take a dot ed page and please make sure that P here is uppercase and here we're going to

40
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.750
pass along here our sample page.

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.780
Again this is the reading reading part right.

42
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.650
So here we read the PD f we got page and this is this is our page right here.

43
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.690
We created a right PD object and here I just wanted to into that object which is kind of empty right

44
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.950
at the moment.

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm going to ed page.

46
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.890
The question is which page you're going to be adding I will be adding this sample page.

47
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.230
Copy I'm going to pass it along here which is simply I'm just adding a sample page which is I read from

48
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.210
here and put it into my right PD F which is my right to object to shift to shift enter looks good.

49
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.640
Let's go ahead and actually put that into an actual PD file.

50
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.710
So now I have my right object which is looks good looks great.

51
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.290
Let's go ahead and actually save it in the specific files that are going to create out of your own justice

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.000
system.

53
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.450
Give it a specific name.

54
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.900
So going to say OK PD f underscore output equals 2.

55
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.080
We're going to open our.

56
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.200
And here we actually get a name whatever files we're gonna say OK this is my you know like sample file

57
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.600
sample you can call it whatever sample PD file for example take it off PD F and I can open that file

58
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.710
again obviously for writing purposes mistake.

59
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.130
Right.

60
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.530
Binary WB.

61
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.140
Right.

62
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.140
That's good.

63
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.100
So again this step is exactly similar as this step right here we call it F here we call it PD f output.

64
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.960
You guys can call it F 2 for example call it whatever.

65
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.480
Again we're opening this file which is simply because we're writing we're just going to create this

66
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.160
new file and then we're just gonna go ahead and actually write our object here right PD F which is the

67
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.950
object that contains our page we're going to take it and actually kind of you know paste it or put it

68
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.800
into our f output so to see how can we do that.

69
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.210
We're gonna say OK right underscored PD F which is our object here that contains the single page that

70
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.310
we obtained.

71
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.330
What we're going to we're going to separate dot right and we're going to pass along our PD f output

72
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.750
which is okay I'm saying okay let's go ahead take the object and simply write it in our PD f output

73
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.520
in our file that was just open or we just created that's it.

74
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.960
Let's go ahead and actually close both of them when I say okay PD f just create some space I'm gonna

75
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:45.100
tell you why PD f underscored outputs which is we're going to close this going to say f got close as

76
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.420
well.

77
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.270
We're going to close the other one too.

78
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.570
So again we closed that file that we open for reading purposes for writing purposes and we closed the

79
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.220
other file as well F which is we open as well for reading purposes.

80
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.550
All right.

81
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.420
And that's why I separated them here.

82
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.290
So these two lines pretty much we're going to use them all the time when we want to read write something

83
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.820
into a new file.

84
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.610
We're going to say OK whatever you know F or whatever equals to open you specify the name of the file

85
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.350
here.

86
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.510
We're going to split open it for writing purposes.

87
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.140
And what we could do you get a say OK right PD f dot right and whatever is contained within this object

88
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.960
which is IPF we're going to be written we're going to be passed along to our PD F which has had hold

89
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.590
of this name.

90
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.910
Basically that's what it is.

91
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860
And then we have to close the both files the one that we open for all reading purposes and then when

92
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.020
we open for closing purposes.

93
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.500
All right.

94
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.200
For writing purposes my apologies.

95
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.800
Let's go ahead.

96
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.100
Press shift entered shift enter again and shift enters.

97
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.760
Here we go.

98
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.660
Looks great.

99
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.110
So I should go back here and you will find that there is a file called sample underscored PDA file which

100
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.390
is what we have here.

101
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.900
Simple PDA if on this court file.

102
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.050
So let's open it.

103
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.760
And here we go.

104
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.860
So basically this is this is like just one single page that we're able to extract out of PD F and just

105
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.420
put it here.

106
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.020
OK.

107
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.810
All right.

108
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.300
OK.

109
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.970
It looks great.

110
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.350
OK.

111
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.340
That's pretty much all what we need to know when we wanted to.

112
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.450
Right.

113
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.690
Except the page and write it in a PDA.

114
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.850
Now it's time for a quick challenge.

115
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.570
What I want to ask to do here is to simply go ahead extract page number five.

116
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.050
So I want extract page number five.

117
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.350
And I wanted to write it in a.

118
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.380
Another PDA file.

119
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.280
They'll call it simple on this score PDA f underscore file on the score too.

120
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.020
OK so that would be our PD file.

121
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.830
So that's what I want you guys to do this exact page 5 and save it in a new PDA file called this and

122
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.960
just please me go ahead make sure that when you do that saving that there is a newly created file called

123
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.610
sample PDA file too.

124
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.790
And it's actually working and function function properly.

125
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:07.170
Please go ahead pause the video and I will see you guys after the challenge.

126
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.740
All right.

127
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.700
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

128
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.530
What are they asking us to do is to simply go here extract instead of pitch for make it in a six page

129
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.240
five and it's pretty much the exact same stuff we're going to do here in the file.

130
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.680
With that said we're just going to say file on this court too and that's it.

131
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.350
All right.

132
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.150
Let's shift enter shift enter shift enter.

133
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.890
Looks great.

134
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.530
Let's go back and make sure that we actually created that file to find out that a sample on the underscore

135
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.840
PDA and this could file on this court too.

136
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.620
So let's open it.

137
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.450
And here we go.

138
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.110
You will find that there is a new page called school ranking.

139
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.860
If you start to compare this to our previous one you have the first page was pitch for had advantages

140
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.090
first and then we had school ranking right.

141
00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:00.530
So if you actually go to the original file you find that we have here our advantages.

142
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.290
Right.

143
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.890
And then afterwards we're going to have here the school rankings.

144
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.100
Right.

145
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.640
So these are the two page advantages first and then school ranking afterwards.

146
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.320
All right.

147
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:11.670
OK.

148
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.340
Looks great.

149
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.320
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

150
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.750
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

151
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.860
And in the next lectures I'm going to walk you through how to rotate PDX and write them to a new PDA.

152
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.660
Let's recap all I've done so far.

153
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:30.700
So in this lecture we're able to simply read a PDA file just get one single page out of a PDA and then

154
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:40.930
create a writer object and simply just put that on page and and kind of you know like pasted or put

155
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:47.320
it or write it in a simple PDA file too which is the file that you created and then you go ahead and

156
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.180
close both files.

157
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.120
And that concludes this section.

158
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.100
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture and see you in the next lecture.
