00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,030
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:11,650
We were able to detect a face and we actually applied it to detect to those face face.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,820
Let's go ahead and actually run it and let's take a look at at it.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,910
So a precious entry shift enters.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,410
Here we have the face.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,130
We're able to actually convert from color to grey OK and we're able to obtain image on the score G stands

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,260
for image underscore great shift enter.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,700
Here we go.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,070
This is a great image.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,620
And here we're able to actually run our cascade classifier just load it first and then use detect multi

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,540
scales on OUR IMAGE TO RETURN BACK THE COORDINATES FOR OUR FACE enter.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,120
Here we have all our coordinates for our face.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,570
And then here we realize that we've got the coordinates of the face okay.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,180
Which is x and y coordinates for the top left corner point.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,160
And here we have the width and height.

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,310
And here we're able to actually draw the actual rectangle on to those face and that's the first step

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,920
in our project.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,070
The next step is going to learn how can we detect multiple faces not just one single face.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,180
So say how can we do that.

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,390
First of all actually gonna do pretty much the same steps as before.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,190
So that's how can we do it again to see a image underscore color equals to CV to dot image read and

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,310
what I've got to do here instead of reading to those I'm just going read scientists.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,170
Actually if I press tab because the image is contained within within the same folder we're just going

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,490
to load it here.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,410
Looks could shift enter if I wanted to take a look at it.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,990
I'm going to take a CV to that image show and he'd I need to let's call it something so classic here

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,110
scientists in color and I'm going to pass along my image on this court see Oh my apologies I can actually

28
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,850
ask you before never to never to do that.

29
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,040
That's my bad.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,670
So if you actually do that you'll find that you come up with this image this figures showing not responding

31
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,830
and you know the kernel will crash and please don't do it.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,880
You know like like like I did right now let's call the program OK.

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,660
And in order to do that in order to avoid this.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,890
OK so going to restart please restart.

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,380
We need to make sure that we have CV to the wheat key and destroy all the windows as well.

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,240
Whenever we whenever we use CV to image show it.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,750
All right let's actually run it again.

38
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,070
So you're tell me CBT is not even defined says go ahead and find open CV enter.

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,040
Good.

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,160
Go ahead and load it.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,930
All right.

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,040
Here we go.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,910
That's our image basically of all the scientists in color.

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,660
So and the image is still running.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,660
If you guys can see the kernel is still running.

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,810
So let's go ahead and please press whatever key enter for example just to exit.

47
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:56,900
All right let's go ahead and actually apply more than one face detection suffering and a Jew going to

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,050
say OK face underscored detection equals two.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:10,950
We're going to say CV to dot cascade classifier if you press tab it will show you a cascade classifier

50
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,270
and then all we could do here is we could say OK ha cascades

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,050
backslash ha cascades underscore.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,510
Actually if you press tab it will auto complete.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,650
OK so it found frontal face the default example shift enter.

54
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,290
Looks good and the next step so it could do here.

55
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,890
You could say OK let's go ahead and use face detection multi scale to actually turn my face.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,520
So to say face as equals to face detection dot detect multi scale.

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,670
So I'll tell you again tab detect multi scale.

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,550
We can pass along our image underscore see and we here specify let's say one point one and five when

59
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,510
five guys remember from previous lecture that one point one.

60
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,950
This was just you know like please kill the image every time at 10 percent of its of its value just

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,800
to try to find every single image every single face basically in our image.

62
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,920
And here when we say five that means I need to have five neighbors effect

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:31,540
to simply detect five pages or 35 images to simply detect five faces kind of next to each other to make

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,570
sure that this will going to be kind of you know like a positive or a face that's been detected.

65
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,220
All right.

66
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,430
OK.

67
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,490
The shift enters it's taken care of while that's good.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,070
Good sign.

69
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,390
Okay.

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
And then we can go ahead and instead of just plotting one phase.

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,620
What I need to do now think it is to go ahead and actually create a for loop.

72
00:04:50,740 --> 00:05:01,380
I say for every time we're gonna say yeah return x y width and height and I'm going to go into faces.

73
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,620
So here faces contains simply every single face that has been detected.

74
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,280
So what I'm going to do here I'm gonna say okay please go ahead.

75
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,360
Interfaces return x y w and H in every single phase afterwards.

76
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,610
When I say okay CV to dot rectangle I want to draw the right angle.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,610
Right.

78
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,180
And I want to draw their finger on my image color and every time I'm gonna pass along my X and Y which

79
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:37,350
is a top left coordinate and then I'm gonna say okay let's return x plus width and then Y plus the height

80
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,550
is plus my apologies.

81
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,590
And then here again specify the colors too.

82
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:52,450
So when I say okay 0 2 2 5 5 and let's say 2 5 5 and then maybe we can make it let's say thickness with

83
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,170
3.

84
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,180
And then afterwards once we do that then we can go ahead and actually plot our image of the Mississippi

85
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,480
to that image show.

86
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,910
And here we can call it multiple face detection or multi multi face detection.

87
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,670
And I can pass along my image underscore see which is the image with along with all the tangles drawn

88
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,000
on top of it.

89
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,160
And then please again don't forget to add CV to dot wait.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:37,390
Ki and afterwards after we exit the loop make sure that you include as well CV to dot destroy all windows.

91
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,710
All right.

92
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,090
That's it.

93
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,880
Let's take a look.

94
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,960
Let's actually test it.

95
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,150
So let's run that once again my color image looks good.

96
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,870
Let's run this.

97
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,660
We should take all the faces and let's do this.

98
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,260
All right.

99
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,390
So it's telling me something is not right CV 2 is not defined yet.

100
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,490
My apologies should be CV too.

101
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,010
So again we're stuck in a loop.

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,820
Let's close the program okay.

103
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,590
Colonel is dead.

104
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,080
Let's go back again and run.

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,810
Open CV because that's what we need.

106
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,640
First let's go down here and run its case and I will have my image again.

107
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,950
Zoom in a little bit too.

108
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,460
We're going to run the classifier looks good and let's run this afterwards.

109
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,010
OK.

110
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,420
Another error source telling me CV 2 has no attribute weight key.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,650
So here wait.

112
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,800
Key key K here has to be uppercase.

113
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,300
Again my apologies you guys might be running through all these new like problems already.

114
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,610
So let's close the program again and let's run it again.

115
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,560
So let's run.

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,510
CONAN Has died.

117
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,780
Okay so let's run it again.

118
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,920
Shift enters looks good.

119
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,870
Let's go back here.

120
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,750
Run it.

121
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,270
There we go.

122
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,530
My image.

123
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,350
We're going to take the faces good and go ahead here and run it.

124
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,000
And here we go.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
So finally.

126
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,680
So here as a guest can see here this.

127
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,830
Let's show you.

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,040
You'll find that this is simply my first my first face it has been detected.

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,830
OK.

130
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,200
All right.

131
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,080
If you press Enter you find that you know like every face starts to appear right.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,200
So we have another face here that appeared entered one more time on other face another face.

133
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,070
It's really amazing.

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,790
You know another face another face detecting every single.

135
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,900
This is like this is a false.

136
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,780
So which means that maybe I can.

137
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,840
I need to increase the number of neighbors maybe from five make it let's say seven or eight maybe.

138
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,820
Again you guys there's tons of improvements that can be done here.

139
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,840
Another face another face.

140
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:54,450
Amazing so again this is kind of like the petition probably one more time seconding all the faces

141
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,570
looks good looks good and that's it.

142
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,720
It actually missed I think it missed already two faces which is you know like still not not too bad

143
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,490
let's actually go back here to our notebook.

144
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,510
All right.

145
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,400
And that's it.

146
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,740
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

147
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,630
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

148
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Please go ahead and pause a video and maybe try to change this for example from one point one maybe

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,040
change it to let's say one point three or one point four OK and change this for instance from five and

150
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,860
make it let's say seven or eight.

151
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,380
And again please go ahead try different numbers.

152
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,310
You know maybe pick two numbers and let me know if you realize any difference in your results or not.

153
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,050
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

154
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,520
All right.

155
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,870
Hey you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

156
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,560
What I ask you has to do is to go ahead here and maybe try to tune the the colors here and sessions

157
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,250
here.

158
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,790
So I I just went you know I picked maybe two samples you guys are free to pick whatever.

159
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,200
So what I tried first is maybe set one point or 1 and 5.

160
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,810
OK.

161
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,480
So if you guys remember before it was one point one or one point two which means you are scaling it

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,960
to 20 percent or 10 percent of its value and then five.

163
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,010
Right.

164
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,290
Which means I need five at least maybe neighbors to detect what I did here is this maybe change it to

165
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,160
one point or one and five.

166
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,770
So when I say one point or one that means they're just gonna scale it every time into one percent.

167
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,890
That means I can have tons of like pyramid zing permitting.

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,080
So I'm gonna have like you know like 100 percent image and then you know like scale by smaller by 1

169
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,800
percent and then by 2 percent to 3 percent and so on.

170
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,630
And he'd only keep it to five as well.

171
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,780
Let's see how that would going to impact please mixtures that to run before running this.

172
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,880
Make sure that you load the image again to make sure that you cleared all the rectangles from from previous

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,050
step shift enter.

174
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,840
Looks good on the image.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,880
New image right here.

176
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
1 point 0 1.

177
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,830
It's taking a little more time which makes sense then shift enter.

178
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,000
And here we go so I guess I can see here first that because now I'm scaling the image it's a much much

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,480
smaller.

180
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,100
You might find that a lot of like false rectangles have been detected.

181
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,180
So please shift and so see this is directing this as a face you know which is a joke and then go down.

182
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,990
This is a face.

183
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,250
It says his tie for example.

184
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,090
Why.

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,870
Because here I am looking for kind of you know like smaller ranges as well that's missing a lot of information.

186
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,640
So it gets C's just maybe one right face here.

187
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,750
Couple of right faces but there's a lot of like Ed or a lot of lots of mistakes with the tuning of these

188
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,030
parameters actually very critical

189
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
because I've been detecting faces right.

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,690
So which is good.

191
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,340
But it's a lot of errors right.

192
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,810
See so simply here in this algorithm I was actually been able to detect all the faces so one two three

193
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,780
all of them pretty much at the same time.

194
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,520
This comes with a cost right that comes with a cause I have been detecting garbage a lot of a lot of

195
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,340
where all of this I don't need it.

196
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,210
I don't need to see that right.

197
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,180
And even like this one is even mistakes missed another mistake too.

198
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,140
So detecting tons of mistakes but I've been able to detect lots of these.

199
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,690
However if I go back to the original settings and from what I said at one point one if you guys recall

200
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,930
and let's run it again let's roll the new image and it's going to come here and load the new image to

201
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,910
and faces you'll find that we have been detecting faces.

202
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,620
It's actually pretty accurate pretty amazing right.

203
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,660
Yeah maybe one mistake here but we didn't get a lots of mistakes in there which is good detecting faces

204
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,170
but it comes with a cost too.

205
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,970
What's the cost.

206
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,040
The cost is a missed couple of faces and I'm going to show you.

207
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,100
So right now we have three faces missing right.

208
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,660
So we've got this.

209
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,730
And then we missed two phases right.

210
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,440
So we need to have kind of you know try to find that sweet spot.

211
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:58,140
What's the best value that we need to put here to be able to obtain all the faces and minimize all of

212
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,980
the garbage in there or minimize all the so-called false positives or maybe false negatives as well

213
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,690
within our image.

214
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:11,500
All right let's try one more sample a set that here to one point one and instead of having one of having

215
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,680
five my apologies was five neighbors and he just said it one which means whatever you guess in one single

216
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
you know like rectangle that there is a face.

217
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,870
Let's take it.

218
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,840
OK let's run it let's run it on that one.

219
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,630
It's good and it's on that one.

220
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,530
And you.

221
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,070
Here you go you'll find tons of you know like random points because we don't.

222
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,340
There is no validation.

223
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:42,330
There is no like like you know like a confirmation from other from other sample so we're again detect

224
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,070
a couple of faces but there is again more mistakes.

225
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,660
Look there's tons of mistakes here too and so on OK.

226
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,430
All right.

227
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,480
And that's it.

228
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,520
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

229
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,010
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

230
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,380
In the next lecture we're going to do a little bit more exciting stuff as well.

231
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,090
They're going to detect eyes and faces within our within our image.

232
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,310
I hope you guys enjoyed this lecture and see you in the next one.
