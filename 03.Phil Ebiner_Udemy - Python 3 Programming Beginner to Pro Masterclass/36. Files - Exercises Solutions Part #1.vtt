00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.540
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.420
Let's get started with the solutions lecture for the finance operation.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.060
So for the first question I ask you to read the file fruits underscored input which is again provided

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.860
to you in the course package.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.980
If you guys go here you will find this in the course package you will find there is S&amp;P 500 we're going

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.780
to use that and I'm going to use fruit's input file.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.120
Right.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.820
OK.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.420
Looks good.

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.250
So let's go ahead and read that.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.330
So again I'm going to say with open and I'm going to pass along the name of the file.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.490
I'm going to say okay fruits underscore input dot text right.

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.900
And we're going to open that for reading purposes and we're going to say that as file.

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.280
Right.

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.350
And then we're going to do it to say OK now we open the file.

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.640
We're going to read file Dot.

17
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.050
I'm going to read lines right.

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.550
And whatever is going to be reading I'm going to put that into let's say fruits for example.

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.910
All right let's run.

20
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.880
That looks good.

21
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.110
And let's go ahead and just simply print fruits on that.

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.080
And that's what we're getting.

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.570
So basically we just got the entire content of the file.

24
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200
It looks like it has you know like here's a list of fruits.

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.700
And then it started the list and then you know all the names of fruit apples you know Africa whatever.

26
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.650
You know like all these like like names of different fruits.

27
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.050
OK.

28
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.290
Looks good.

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.220
All right.

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.350
The next question is I ask you to read the file fruits input again and remove all the new lines.

31
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.390
Spaces and special characters and then save the output file foods the text.

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.590
OK.

33
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.980
Let's actually go and delete all of this.

34
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.550
Need instructions and this insert new cells and let's get started.

35
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.160
Let's open the file so we have done that before.

36
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.610
Let's copy it OK so we copy that.

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.680
Put it here.

38
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.460
All right.

39
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.850
And let's take a look at fruits again.

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.070
And that's our fruits again.

41
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.710
You guys take a look here.

42
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.130
Here we have here is a list of fruits we have started the list and so on.

43
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.480
If we keep scrolling down you will find that's pretty much all our.

44
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990
Our file.

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.010
Right.

46
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.270
What I'm asking you to do is to simply go ahead and we wanted to remove all the backslash ends and he

47
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.600
wanted to remove you know that the the the backslash and then wanted to remove as well.

48
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.640
Any special characters.

49
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.960
So let's say exclamation mark in here.

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.530
We want to get rid of.

51
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.350
Let's see how can we do that.

52
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.020
So what we could do we could say OK let's do a little bit of an F. If condition.

53
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.500
All right.

54
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.610
That will go into fruits.

55
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.630
Take that they all of these elements.

56
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.370
And if you find backslash and just strip it just remove it from the fruits.

57
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.670
All right.

58
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.990
Let's see.

59
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.930
Can we do that we're going to take in the new fruits equal to and let's put it kind of in a form of

60
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.590
a string and let's see how can we do that.

61
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.110
All right.

62
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.070
Think of it this way.

63
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.870
Get to say okay for car in fruits.

64
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.380
So please go ahead into the fruits get every single element in there and put it in a character.

65
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.760
Right.

66
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.060
OK.

67
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:42.830
And then put the condition if you find backslash in if you find backslash n in there which means a new

68
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.410
line in car.

69
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.700
Right.

70
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.160
So if you find backslash and in-car what what are you going to do.

71
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.860
Take the car take the character and basically strip it out strip out from it the backslash and just

72
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.880
if you find backslash and just get rid of it just in a nutshell.

73
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.230
All right.

74
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.960
OK.

75
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.330
Let's run that looks good.

76
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.510
Let's take a look at fruits again.

77
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.900
And here you go.

78
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.630
If you check it out you will find that we got rid of backslash n which is perfect.

79
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.430
Now we wanted to simply go ahead and remove all the special for example characters in there.

80
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.590
OK.

81
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.980
All right.

82
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.980
So how can we do that and actually can remove as well.

83
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.320
For example like empty spaces here.

84
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.940
All right.

85
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.880
We could do.

86
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.590
Going to say OK the new fruit's again equals to what we could do let's write it again in that manner.

87
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:50.890
I mean I say OK for car and fruits take basically all these like you know different elements within

88
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.270
the fruits.

89
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.410
You can call it elements or characters or whatever and then you can say OK if you phone if you find

90
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.020
the car.

91
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.240
Character is not equal to empty.

92
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.360
So if it's not empty.

93
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.460
OK we'll get it right.

94
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.230
So if not empty Let's filter it think of it as a filter going to take a go for every element within

95
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.010
the fruits.

96
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.380
If you find any element not equal space ok not equal empty.

97
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.450
So that is something that is lemon that is lime.

98
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.380
That is you know like mango whatever.

99
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.040
Get it.

100
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.400
OK.

101
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.290
So we're going to return it back.

102
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.830
There is no.

103
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.940
That's the filter right.

104
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.520
So let's run that's.

105
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.450
Let's take a look at fruits you will find if you take a look here you will find that we got rid at least

106
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.420
of the spaces right so we don't have any empty elements which is good.

107
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.660
What we could do as well here is that we could actually copy that exact same stuff here.

108
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.460
Put it here and say okay go ahead do the exact same thing.

109
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.750
But what we could do we can you know that here for the exclamation mark contains only one element.

110
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.910
Right.

111
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.010
Like here this one contains only one element right.

112
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.550
Okay.

113
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.780
And we don't have any fruit that has only one character right.

114
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.500
We don't have that.

115
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.290
So what we could do that we can't if we count the number of elements which are the lengths of characters

116
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.770
and we found that not equals to one.

117
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.260
So if it's not if it's one we don't need it.

118
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.530
Right.

119
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.840
So if it's like this for example just one the length is one or the let's say there's one we don't need

120
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.330
it other than that we need it and that's pretty much the second filter.

121
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.000
Let's run that.

122
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.270
Let's look at it.

123
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.140
And here you go looks clean and looks perfect.

124
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.680
We don't have any spaces we don't have backslash ends and we don't have any exclamation mark.

125
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.290
What I'm asking you to do here this question as well that I'm asking you to save the output file into

126
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.020
fruits underscored output dot dot text.

127
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.700
That's actually pretty easy.

128
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.960
So now we have the fruits right.

129
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.460
So let's.

130
00:06:50.470 --> 00:07:02.110
In such a couple of lines let's say OK with open let's open fruits let's call it fruits underscore out

131
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.370
the text.

132
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.410
You can call it whatever let's call it fruits on the score.

133
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.660
Our trial texts so we can look at it.

134
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.190
I'm going to open that file and can kind of create that file from scratch for writing purposes and I'm

135
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.710
going to say s file right.

136
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.950
I say okay every time for car in fruits let's go ahead and do file Dot.

137
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.400
Right.

138
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:32.900
So let's write down all the elements all the characters and let's add backslash and as well so we can

139
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.760
kind of you know like write them and my apologies.

140
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.100
That said so card plus NC Basically.

141
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.440
Go ahead take all the elements within fruit and write them just go ahead and write them to the file

142
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.670
and add new backslash and so you can add a new line in within the file.

143
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.600
Let's start on that.

144
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.200
Looks like something happened.

145
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.370
You know there's no error which is great.

146
00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.700
Let's go here and let's take a look at the trial flutes out trial which is you know that we have just

147
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.080
created.

148
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.740
And here we go.

149
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.410
Here we have our beautiful file.

150
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.660
So here we have all the file that has no spaces no

151
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.450
exclamation marks looks great already.

152
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.310
Perfect.

153
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:21.740
Question number three I'm asking you to read the file again fruits the text but remove all the new line

154
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.640
spacing of them that all new remove all the special characters with them that as well.

155
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.800
But I want you to as well to remove any lines that does not represent the fruit so anything that does

156
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.480
not represent the fruit.

157
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.560
Let's remove it as well.

158
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:34.460
All right.

159
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.600
So in this case let's go ahead and actually open our our file that we just had right now.

160
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.000
So if you take a look at it.

161
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.280
OK.

162
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.520
This is the original file food is important.

163
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.490
We don't need this right.

164
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.650
We don't need here is a list of fruit fruits right.

165
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.180
We don't need start of lists.

166
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.900
We don't want to get rid of this.

167
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.370
And if you take a look here as well it looks good.

168
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.550
There is no problem.

169
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.030
So what we could do that we need just to remove these two lines right.

170
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.330
All right.

171
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.780
So again pretty much we're going to do the exact same thing as we have done before.

172
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.980
Let's actually I'll just sort of writing it down all of it again.

173
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.760
What I'm to do here is just get a copy solutions because it's pretty much the same rights I was going

174
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.300
to copy it and put it put it here and say OK well we could do here.

175
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.950
I'm going to say let's open the file.

176
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:29.300
So here we opened we open the file so with open fruits input the text we open it for reading purposes.

177
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.750
We read the lines right.

178
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.500
First step that we need to remove backslash n we remove that.

179
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.110
It's exactly the same as we have done before.

180
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:43.250
Second step we wanted to remove any spaces so any spaces we don't need it right here.

181
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.970
If we find the length of the words not equal once we can remove any exclamation marks.

182
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.150
Right.

183
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.660
And here you can actually do it manually.

184
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.200
You going to say Okay I know that there is.

185
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.470
End of lists.

186
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.640
Actually this end of list does not exist anymore.

187
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.690
Just keep it you know it won't hurt if you find start of list.

188
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.160
Just remove it if you find here is a list of fruits.

189
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.480
Just get rid of it.

190
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.440
That's pretty much it.

191
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.020
So pretty much an asking to go ahead and the fruits and just remove the first two lines and there is

192
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:17.370
end of list just remove it as well and then save it again to fruits out let's call it trial trial underscore

193
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.660
to fix for instance.

194
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.920
All right let's run that's key looks good.

195
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:31.760
Let's go ahead and open our file trial to and here you go you find that we got rid of the first two

196
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.070
statements and it is only pure fruits in here which is perfect.

197
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.420
That's exactly what I was looking for.

198
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.090
All right.

199
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.150
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

200
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.610
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

201
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.080
And the next lecture going can keep going and solve questions for till night.

202
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.520
See you guys in the next lecture.
