00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.830
Hello everyone and welcome to this election.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.240
I'm super excited again because we're getting closer to actually training our model and testing it.

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.430
So let's go ahead and actually train our model so I'm going to go ahead.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.510
In the previous lecture just to maybe recap what we have done in the past he had we just imported all

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.650
our libraries or packages and then he and we actually built our model right.

6
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.060
We built within a sequential four we build again our first evolution layer.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.420
We did all our max layer and we did the drop out and then afterwards will be another convolution layer

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.730
with its mext pulley with flat and it's and then we did our fully connected layer in here.

9
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.380
Looks great right.

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.390
Let's go ahead and actually start compiling or changing our model.

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.230
So again Tsuki CNN underscored model dot com pioneer and he too we need to specify our function so he

12
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.510
We're going to use binary cross entropy.

13
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.870
Why.

14
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.450
Because he we have our equities binary rates we have zede all in one.

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.090
So going to say okay you're a binary on a score of cross entropy or if the output is keddy.

16
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.550
So let's say for example if you're classifying 10 categories used to use binary underscore categories

17
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.800
not cross entropy.

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.560
Okay.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.640
Great.

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.110
Let's if he goes again go here.

21
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.650
End price shift shift tab that will open up what do we need to do.

22
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.600
How can achieve right.

23
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.350
CNN model the compile.

24
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.070
So you find they need to define our optimizers.

25
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.870
We need to find as well our lost function our metrics of efforts.

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.030
If you would just leave it all a blank.

27
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.200
That will simply going to use the default values and he if he was screwed down you might find as well.

28
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.100
Some of the options that we have here.

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.950
I hope it's listed so you can see here.

30
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.450
You will see that he that's a it's a loss.

31
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.350
So this is basically optimizers indicating look what optimize it will you were using.

32
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.940
Here we have all the metrics we use here we use the actual accuracy for our metrics and you can find

33
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.900
all the details as well.

34
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.880
If you go into the detailed documentation to see okay what options can I write here.

35
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.030
If it's buying across and shipping or getting water or whatever mystically optimization at too we're

36
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.860
going to specify okay we need to specify them optimize it so are going to say Okay Adam n me to specify

37
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.490
as well our learning great.

38
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.900
Okay let's say it's point or 1 so we're learning great.

39
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.750
It's basically how fast the network are going to stop learning.

40
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.680
Okay if you said it for example to a small or large number of that will impact your rate of learning.

41
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.180
So you will set it as a point or one and then he would define lucky key metrics that we wanted to treat

42
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.030
our modern with is basically our accuracy.

43
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.580
This is kind of pretty much standard all what you need to do is just to make sure that the here if you

44
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.710
have a binary output that will be binary cross entropy right.

45
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.450
OK.

46
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.280
Let's see.

47
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170
That's and looks good.

48
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.450
And let's go ahead and actually start training and model.

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.890
So what are you going to do here.

50
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.820
We're going to specify how many epics we need.

51
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.210
So here we're going to see let's say five epics.

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.810
Again when you say epic that mean how many times we're going to be our tweets.

53
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.450
All right.

54
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.430
He was.

55
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.400
Let's go ahead then.

56
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.520
For example it wouldn't change it for let's see four five times ONDI.

57
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.690
So going to do five epochs to go ahead and beat outwits going to say saker history.

58
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:36.410
Equal to CNN underscored model dot fits n or in a person on our X underscored team will get a pass along

59
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.440
our y underscored team.

60
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.400
I'm going to pass along.

61
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.040
I want a bed size.

62
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.000
So when you say bed size that mean how many images would get to be fed.

63
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.090
It's kind of fun to figure out a dealer which is estuarine and whiteread in batches of 30 images per

64
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.350
batch.

65
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.710
And then he would specify the number of books so you can see it in B underscore.

66
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.440
Epic.

67
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.820
Equals two epochs.

68
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.610
Which is simply our premier that we find here.

69
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.270
We're going if he did he would come right directly.

70
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.430
He won.

71
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.340
And let's go ahead and say very bo's equates to one.

72
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.380
That's simply how many how much details we're going to be sure we actually performing the training.

73
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.720
OK.

74
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.180
I'm going to show you exactly what they mean by this now.

75
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.000
All right.

76
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.240
So that's that's pretty much it.

77
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.050
So no actually can pirlo a model.

78
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.290
Let's go ahead and actually perform the training.

79
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.490
So as you can see here it is truly interesting.

80
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.040
And I say okay now we have epics of one over five.

81
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.600
So simply this is the first.

82
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.980
OK.

83
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.610
OK.

84
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.230
You can see that's the loss.

85
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.350
And that's our accuracy.

86
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.840
The accuracy this point five is going up.

87
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.310
Let's say two point six as we move forward.

88
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.420
So every epic Watson network is doing is China is trying to simply go ahead and adjust the weights as

89
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.840
we move forward.

90
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.420
Wouldn't you say adjust the weight.

91
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.410
That means well actually training our network.

92
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.660
It's learning how to minimize the error or improve the accuracy of the model again it's when the eckert's

93
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.380
went from point five point five eight point seven again going up again.

94
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.230
That's good.

95
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.450
Are eight extra each.

96
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.750
Even point eight.

97
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.790
Or room or point seven nine so four.

98
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.750
That's epic five or five right.

99
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.090
That's looks actually pretty pretty great.

100
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.500
OK.

101
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.060
Obviously that's not you know like that's not amazing Why first of all we didn't fully optimize the

102
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.290
network.

103
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.940
Second of all we said the books only to five five is not generally enough to actually test our network.

104
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.720
So a little bit of challenge.

105
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.890
What I'm asking to do is please go ahead.

106
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.590
Pause the video and I want you to go ahead and observe the number of epics and make it let's say 20

107
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.270
or 25 or 30.

108
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.840
OK.

109
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.220
Obviously the the it would take a little bit longer time but that's kind of you know the media challenge.

110
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.810
And let's see if the accuracy here is being improved or it is go ahead.

111
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.380
Go ahead and try the challenge and see you right after the challenge.

112
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.530
All right.

113
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.180
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

114
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.510
So what I ask you to do is simply go ahead and change the number of books here 25 or 30 or whatever

115
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.300
and compare the accuracy before to the accuracy to it now.

116
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.210
So if you go down here he will find that each 98 percent accuracy which is pretty good.

117
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.060
Again please bear in mind that this problem is kind of pretty simple because we only have zero or one

118
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.320
so that's pretty simple.

119
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.320
We don't have let's say hundred categories or 50 categories of whatever.

120
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.690
So that's pretty good.

121
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.430
All right.

122
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.940
And that's pretty much what I have for the selectors.

123
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.330
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

124
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.600
And in the next section we'll get started actually evaluate with the model and see if that model makes

125
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.970
sense or not.

126
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.720
OK.

127
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.860
Please stay tuned and see you in the next election.
