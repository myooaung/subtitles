00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.300
All right.

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.790
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:13.170
The previous lecture we actually viewed our our model performance and we been able to go ahead and plot

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.400
our image and show our guess which is our predicted class and our true class and were able to even count

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.110
how many semples it had been correctly classified and how many samples that have been misclassify.

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.690
Let's go ahead and review the data or view the data in it a little bit better format.

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.310
OK.

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.590
So we're going to do here.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.500
We're going to use what we call confusion matrix to indicate how many samples that have been correctly

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.210
classified and how many sample of it have been misclassified.

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.630
So going to see it from is killer.

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.310
Dot metrics.

13
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.630
And you say imports were imported confusion underscore matrix.

14
00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.640
And again I say okay our crm or sense for coffee semitics equates to confusion and discord and Matrix.

15
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.810
And here the confusion confusion the confusion Midget's my apologies.

16
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.600
What it needs.

17
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.140
It needs the predictive class anything's a true class.

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.610
So good to see.

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.780
Okay.

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.450
That's Will my wife tests which the testing class and my predicted underscored class.

21
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.050
All right.

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.320
Okay looks good.

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.300
Let's go ahead and plot penalty don't figger what again to use let's say fig size of let's say equal

24
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.970
to 10 and 10.

25
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.900
And let's go ahead.

26
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.180
As well you see more and as soon as the heat map to actually plot our crm and its view of the patients

27
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.860
to liquids.

28
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.670
True.

29
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.120
And let's run that right.

30
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.870
That's our confusion matrix.

31
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.330
Okay.

32
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.450
What do you mean by confusion metrics.

33
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.830
We covered that before in the past let's go ahead and covenanted again simply what we have here the

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.030
ROEs are our predictive classes.

35
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.750
Okay.

36
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.390
So that's our you know like classes of the zeo order one here we have our 2 class either zuel order

37
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.760
one.

38
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.330
OK.

39
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.380
So if our predictive class matches our true class here this have a number the total number of centres

40
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.380
that have been correctly classified.

41
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.610
So it was actually zero.

42
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.720
And our model train model that said it's zero as well.

43
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.770
So we go in 63 semples which is good here.

44
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.930
The numbers here these are the number of samples that have been correctly classified in which they contain

45
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.130
within class 1.

46
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.750
So again the model said that predictions would one and the true Hude was one.

47
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.940
So that we have 75 at 77 sample that's good.

48
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.120
So simply when you look at the confuser matrix you look at these two corners and you see these numbers

49
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.650
are kind of big numbers a large number.

50
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.790
That's a great thing.

51
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.280
That means you know the network has been trained in a way.

52
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.490
If you find here these kind of maybe one of these like is literally let's say let's say zero samples

53
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.970
that mean those are true are in trouble.

54
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.010
I mean there was a problem.

55
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.880
Why.

56
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.020
Because these years the number of semples here these are the issues these out of the air or semples.

57
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.410
These are the misclassified samples.

58
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.980
These are the samples in which let's say the predicted class was zero.

59
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
However they are classified as one.

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.200
So we have three sample that have been misclassified.

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.660
Here we have the predictions were one and the RS zero.

62
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.280
Okay.

63
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.240
And they are seven samples.

64
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.110
All right.

65
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.610
So simply put if you sum them up if you sum all the semples that will give us the moon or the one hundred

66
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.950
and fifty samples that we had in the past which is all our training data set these are quickly classified.

67
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.740
These are misclassify.

68
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.830
OK.

69
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.420
One last way to actually give you the deal or use of data we're going to use We'll call it classification

70
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.060
report.

71
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400
OK we're going to save it from this killer.

72
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.880
Dot metrix aggressively import.

73
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.960
Good to see classification.

74
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.510
On Discordia report anyone going to say here where we're going to basically plot our top of the class

75
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.150
and our classification report.

76
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.700
So let's see how can we do this.

77
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.440
We're going to say okay print.

78
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.050
We're going to see classification.

79
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.970
Underscoring reports we are going to pass along our y underscored test.

80
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.310
Anyone going to pass along our predicted underscored class.

81
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.670
And that's it.

82
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.520
All right.

83
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.920
Let's go ahead and actually print this.

84
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.340
And that's our classification report right here.

85
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.670
So if you can see here we are pain that now 94 percent accuracy in total.

86
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.280
Okay.

87
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.720
And that's actually really good.

88
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.000
All right.

89
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.280
That's pretty much all what we know.

90
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.230
But for sure that we care about at the moment it's that we have 94 percent on testing they said that

91
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.550
have been correctly classified.

92
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.660
Well you know that's the axis of the model.

93
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.540
If you go back here during training we actually all pay 98 percent accuracy.

94
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.540
However doing testing we obtained around ninety four percent accuracy.

95
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.350
OK.

96
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.570
And that's pretty much all what we have for this lecture.

97
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.600
Again let's recap what we have done so far.

98
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.570
What you have done so far is that we were able to view the confusion matrix and we showed how many sample

99
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.540
that had big reclassified how many samper that have been misclassified and we actually as well viewed

100
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.420
the classification report showing 94 percent accuracy.

101
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.050
And again here.

102
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.740
Great job.

103
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.390
You're getting better at all like Python programming.

104
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.760
A normal machine learning.

105
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.250
Keep it up and see you guys in future lectures.
