00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,260
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,020
And the biggest lecture I want to see how can we extract more than one page from a PDA.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,380
And we simply just obtained or created our 3D PBF object and we simply looped across every single page

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,240
within our our PDA.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,930
And we're able to obtain the entire text simply here.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,750
What we're going to do here in this kind of you know mini project per say that we wanted to add a watermark

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,370
or PDA.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:28,940
OK.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,850
Which is a little bit different.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,680
So the first step is in order to add the watermark to a PDA if you think about it that we have we need

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,820
to have two sources.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,520
Right.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,270
We need to have two PDA FS Our original PDA if that we wanted to simply add a watermark to it.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,550
And the second one is the actual watermark which is going to be a PDA.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,350
Right.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,760
And then what we need to do that we need to simply merge these two Fs together once we merge them.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,270
That's it.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,570
That means you added a watermark already.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
So let's go up here and see OK.

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,250
What is the watermark.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:13,020
So while you guys can see here you'll find that there is a watermark kind of confidential you know like

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,640
PBF I created here.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm going to provide you guys with it too.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,690
This is can you get can I please go ahead and tell you whatever you know like PBF.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,660
The idea here is to show you how can we merge two PDX together which is kind of addition.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,020
The idea of adding a watermark so simply and you just needed to add confidential here to whatever PDA

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,470
or whatever sample you have they're going to be working with says go ahead and see how can we do that.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,890
All right.

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,970
So the first step I need to simply open two files for reading purposes and open one file for writing

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,020
purposes.

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,030
Right.

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,810
OK let's go ahead and read the first one.

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,970
So first I need to open my watermark

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,530
so you find that there is watermark underscore confidential on the score to PD F and we can open this

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,450
for reading purposes.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,890
OK.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,250
And what we could do after is we're gonna say okay let's create an object and let's let's actually name

38
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,340
it.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,620
So we won't be like you know like confused afterwards I'm gonna call a 3D but this is read mainly read

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,730
for the watermark right.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,420
So this an actual watermark I'm going to say PBF file reader because I can open it and can open that

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,970
file F and let's go ahead what I need I just need to get page but I need to get the four page number

43
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,490
to zero only because it simply contains just one single page going to say OK watermark

44
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,650
on the score page equals two.

45
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:51,200
Again read watermark which is our simply object that refers to the PD f that had the watermark and one

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,400
of that saying I need to get page and I need to get page number zero.

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,620
So that means we just obtained in here just one single page which has the confidential kind of you know

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,360
like sign in there here.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,990
Okay.

50
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,160
All right that's good.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,250
Shift enter looks great.

52
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,530
Next step is we wanted to create our file to be watermark right.

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,090
It's going to take a F equals two open and I'm going to say here I'm going to open let's say you know

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,260
the exact same simple file and I'm going to open it again for reading purposes

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,100
it's actually do this shift enter looks good and afterwards I'm going to say okay let's go ahead and

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:44,010
create three PD F equals to PD f reader again because I'm gonna be reading right and I want to read

57
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,270
that file again.

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,650
It's exactly the same as these two lines exactly the same because I'm reading APD f it's exactly the

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,280
same idea but this one will just read it because this is a watermark file.

60
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,340
This one is simply our file to be watermarked which is you know our let's say the exact same text that

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,640
we had that shift enter shift entered Osgood.

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,320
So simply now I have to read re PD Fs.

63
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,020
Okay.

64
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:15,930
Now I'm pretty much ready to actually create my right to object and do the actual writing.

65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,870
So let's create our writer objects are going to say okay right underscored PD F equals two.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,270
We're going to create PD f writer so PDL file writers.

67
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay.

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,840
And that'll be my first object here.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,250
Okay.

70
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,240
Here we go.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,410
Shift enter.

72
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,080
Good.

73
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:43,980
And let's go ahead and actually loop across every single page out of our PD F and do that kind of merging

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,270
in there.

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,830
That's the overall idea.

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,880
So what we can do is say Okay nine pages let's go and obtain how many pages we have because I'm gonna

77
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,120
do that every single page in there myself KP The F dots get num pages

78
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,880
get numb pages.

79
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,690
And here actually that will be our because we're reading our read PDA.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,390
So let's go ahead and actually Captain our EPD F to obtain get nine pages.

81
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,110
Let's run that.

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,600
Let's take a look at it.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,220
Let's take a look at number pages.

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,730
Here we go.

85
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,550
Now we have eight eight pages which is good.

86
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,690
All right all right.

87
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:36,370
Now we're pretty much ready to go ahead and do our full loop so going to take a forward page in range.

88
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,220
We're going to pass along here our nine pages.

89
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,270
Right.

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,640
OK.

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,790
So we're going to loop on every single page every time I'm going to go there obtain a page out of our

92
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:57,200
read PBF object which is our original PDA of the PDA that wanted to watermark and merge that page with

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,840
our work watermark page watermark page which is what we obtain here.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,170
OK.

95
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
This is simply our watermark right.

96
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,330
So every time I was just gonna grab a page and merge it with this.

97
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,120
Grab another page merged with this and so on so forth.

98
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,200
Let's do it.

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:24,740
So I'm gonna say okay our single and the score page equals to re PD free to underscore PBF dot get page

100
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,590
of page.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,480
So every time I'm just gonna go ahead go ahead in here and obtain a single page.

102
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,930
All right.

103
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:42,170
Let's so every time I'm going to go here over this Loop go to my red PBF which is my you know sample

104
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,000
the that I wanted to have more watermarked obtain a certain page with specific index.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,820
And we're going to call it single page and take that single page object or that single actual actual

106
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,910
single page.

107
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:02,540
And what we're going to do going to see emerge page along with our water mark the underscore page which

108
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,670
is simply what we have here.

109
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,240
Watermark on this page.

110
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,540
Looks good afterwards.

112
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:16,010
Let's go ahead and this is simply right now single page contains the actual just sample page that has

113
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,730
been watermark.

114
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,720
Let's go ahead and do it or write it into our right PBF object which is simply going to be our out output

115
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,080
file.

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,810
Right.

117
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:33,850
So going to take a right underscore PD f I'm going to say dot ed page and we're going to pass along

118
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,350
here our single underscore page again.

119
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,220
So here we merged our watermark page to our sample page that we obtained.

120
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,610
Take that simple single page and added to our right PBF object.

121
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,120
So by the end of the loop and we keep going our right PD field will contain eight pages and all of them

122
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,950
are watermarked right shift enter the caliber of time looks good.

123
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,480
Let's go ahead and simply take our IP F and just put it into like whatever document you call it whatever

124
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,400
it's going to take APD f underscore outputs equals to open.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,350
And here we can pass along our let's call it sample PD f watermarked.

126
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,370
This is gonna be our new newly created PD F and we can open this video for writing purposes when I say

127
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,720
right binary.

128
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,780
And then afterwards we're gonna say Okay let's take our object which is IPD F right underscore PD F

129
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,360
and dot right our information again.

130
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,710
Right.

131
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,960
Object write it to our PD f output right.

132
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,330
Our file K looks good.

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,930
Let's go ahead and close both of them.

134
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,800
So PD f underscore.

135
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,150
Output dot close.

136
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,440
And let's go ahead and actually close f close as well which is our file in there.

137
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,600
Shift enters.

138
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,120
Looks good.

139
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,980
My apologies actually we forgot to do this.

140
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,290
Shift entry looks good.

141
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,220
Let's go ahead and check said check out sample the F watermark PD F so let's go here.

142
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,100
Samples.

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,990
I call that sample PD f watermarked.

144
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,990
Let's open it.

145
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,420
And here we go.

146
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,510
This is our beautiful file obviously because this speedy video is kind of you know like it.

147
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,060
This is not transparent.

148
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,890
So yes we actually merge it.

149
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,300
OK.

150
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,660
But we were unable to actually obtain here to make it transparent.

151
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,960
Right.

152
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,250
No please go ahead guys and try to maybe like you know change that confidential thing and added he'll

153
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,570
make it transparent somehow and merge it.

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,030
But as the overall idea of how can we actually add the watermark to our PDA.

155
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,070
Okay.

156
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,680
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

157
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,410
I hope you guys enjoyed the entire lecture and the entire project as well.

158
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,230
All right.

159
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,170
That's all what I have for this project.

160
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,450
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

161
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,190
Let's recap what we have done so far so far.

162
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,090
So in this project we were able to master kind of our PBF manipulations.

163
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:14,170
We're able to add our first part of the project to extract information from a PDA file so we're able

164
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:21,090
to actually you know learn how can we get document information or even extract text out of a PDA.

165
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,340
And in the next learning outcome we're able to copy a single page and paste it in a newly created PDA.

166
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,300
Again the overall idea is to create a reader object create a writer object and simply just write your

167
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,890
PDA f object into whatever name you want it to specify in the learning outcome three were able to rotate

168
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,310
PDA PDA files and right into them.

169
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,520
So able to actually extract pages rotated clock clockwise and then write it in whatever PDA you have

170
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,520
here and then in learning outcome for we're able to read multiple pages overall idea is exactly the

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,970
same.

172
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,340
You can open our our PDA.

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,770
And then here instead of just writing or extracting a single page we're just gonna create the for loop

174
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,440
to go ahead and pass over every single page and extract it.

175
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,820
All right.

176
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,640
And we're able to actually set every single text within our PDA.

177
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,470
And then learning outcome 5 which is kind of know the most fun part of out of all is to simply merge

178
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,760
two PDX together.

179
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:32,200
So we're able to kind of you know get a simple PBF and then merge into it a watermark.

180
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,710
All right.

181
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,540
And we did that every single page.

182
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,600
That's why we had to do again on other for loop in here.

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,620
And then we closed all files and that should conclude our project.

184
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,940
All right I hope you guys enjoy this project and see you in future projects.
