00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.110
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.220
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.340
And let's answer.

4
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.700
Question number eight.

5
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.510
So for question number eight here we have a list of salaries.

6
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.020
OK.

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.490
Kind of you know the names along with the salaries and I'm asking you to create a list of all keys and

8
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.560
list of all values only.

9
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.230
OK.

10
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.850
So to do that you what you could do you know say okay I'm going to go to my.

11
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.440
And this causality which is my dictionary that I defined before.

12
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.550
Let's define it first stood on it.

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.520
Now go get a head to my salary.

14
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.070
If I said Dot values we have done that before.

15
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.010
That should open simply all my values here.

16
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.890
But the key point is here.

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.320
In order to keep a list out of it I know what I need to do.

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.820
They need to do casting and to do simply to cast the values I'm getting here into a list of say okay

19
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.480
whatever I'm getting out of this I'm going to make it or convert it into lists and ganas name it let's

20
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.490
say whatever it names.

21
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.950
For example if I and that's and if I wanted to make it take a look at names then you'll come up basically

22
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.420
with a list value that has all the values associated with it 25 28 and 30 perfect.

23
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.270
If I wanted to keep the keys which is Alex Sally and Dina again what I could do in a silk in my salad

24
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.280
is it's the values I mean to say came my keys if I'm that I mean I'm going to call it names my apologies

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.030
he they're going to call it.

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.290
For example salads go equality.

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.970
So my apologies here.

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.800
I'm going to define the values.

29
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.870
So here I'm going to call it Saturdays.

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.120
And he said I'm going to call it names.

31
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.550
Right.

32
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.690
Because he wanted to give the keys which is the names of people and salaries which is the actual value

33
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.200
that I'm getting.

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.150
Let's find it again.

35
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.140
If I get on it's and if I want it to view here on my SATs and they wanted to view my names and if I

36
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.200
read it again.

37
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.780
So salaries will get a shawqi 25 twenty and thirty four names.

38
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
And if so what the names we're going to call me Alex salley and Dean which is basically the keys that

39
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.320
we have here.

40
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.670
She looks great.

41
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.840
Now I wanted to get the total of all the values.

42
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.320
So we have done that before.

43
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.220
I'm going to say okay please go and opt in the summation for example of my salary K Dot values.

44
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.360
All right.

45
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.080
And that should open in the summation.

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.230
You can call it let's say tall and I fold on that looks good n can come here and print.

47
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.400
For example my total value of the land that you'll come up with a value of 83 which is a summation of

48
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.010
all the values that we have got here.

49
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.370
All right.

50
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.510
That's pretty much it for question number nine.

51
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.270
I'm asking you to update the length of the value of the following dictionary and sort its elements.

52
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.860
OK.

53
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.640
OK.

54
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.950
How can we do this.

55
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.240
So in order to get the length of the values here of the dictionary you know what you could do here.

56
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.720
And I say okay I can apply the length function of them before lents Okay.

57
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:06.760
But I wanted to go to my dictionary K Dot values all right to do it in the lenth n I can basically just

58
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.400
just print it.

59
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.320
So Fred do print here.

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.600
There should.

61
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.580
Prints.

62
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.380
My values are saying okay that's it are five elements.

63
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.810
Looks great.

64
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.820
And if I wanted to saw it's basically the elements.

65
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.540
I could do that by saying okay now I've got a function called sorted alright.

66
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.720
And what I can do you are going to copy this.

67
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.730
That's it here.

68
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.120
I'm going to say coming up as well.

69
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.980
But it's sort of lenth.

70
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.270
I wanted to paint this sorted which is a function that you can run to just sort of the element of the

71
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.800
value of my dictionary.

72
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.100
See you guys can see that they have sorted it to 10 22 23 in an ascending fashionable ascending order.

73
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.800
Ah.

74
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.000
The next question that we have it's kind of advanced or gay.

75
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.860
Again I'm not expecting great two to solve this one.

76
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.170
It's fine because it has tons of like you know that has fallen loops that is if conditions within him

77
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.250
cover any of that you know like and you can please feel free to give that until we actually cover the

78
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.620
loops and if conditions.

79
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.660
But he is just going to show you how can we do it in a very very simple format.

80
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.810
I've just got a copy of the solution for you.

81
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.080
OK.

82
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.700
Again please don't get intimidated.

83
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.010
We're going to cover it again in tons of details moving forward.

84
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.930
But what we're doing here again say okay so please this is my dictionary and I won it to simply filter

85
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.560
out value that greater than or equal to 30 right.

86
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.560
So what we have done he'll say okay please for a loop for is means you know where we want to create

87
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.540
a loop wearing like for example go ahead and go to each of these elements.

88
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:51.670
Okay masik for or for each key and value in my dictionary the items go to my dictionary which has items

89
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.590
here or pain all the keys and all the value so simply hiragana in all.

90
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.010
If each key each value.

91
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.580
OK it's a very interesting forum to just write.

92
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.440
Comes over you know like codes in just one line.

93
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.880
OK.

94
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.250
And for each of these basically value.

95
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.690
If you find the venue less than or equal to 30 or 8 please go back and return my key n. y value.

96
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.980
Simply put you're doing kind of filtering.

97
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.460
You are going through with a key dictionary and you're opening kind of only the keys and values associated

98
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.460
with this.

99
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.620
Only if the value is less than or equal to 30 or.

100
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.490
And then I ask you to print the results.

101
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.420
Let's run it.

102
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.540
And if I it you'd find that you come up with only these two keys which is 20 and 30 here because at

103
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.410
least it's less then or if you wanted to get that that are greater than or equal to 30.

104
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.580
You can just make it okay.

105
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.010
Greater than or equal to 230.

106
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.280
If I do that if I'm there to come up with basically 30 and 50 which is basically what we're looking

107
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.870
for are.

108
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.670
Again please don't get intimidated with this because it has tons of and within it cover if conditions

109
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.680
yet we didn't cover for loops yet.

110
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.770
It is one give you an idea of when we mix everything together.

111
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.820
We can do tons of activities in just one line of code.

112
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.570
All right perfect.

113
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.030
The last exercise that we have which is you know kind of exercise for the booleans are eight which is

114
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.840
asking you what this code will going to generate.

115
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.510
Let's assume that have x and y.

116
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.580
And I'm asking you to print is X greater than y.

117
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.240
Yes x is greater than y that's false right.

118
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.020
So here I'm expecting you guys to just write here false.

119
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.210
And here I'm asking is X less than Y.

120
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.490
That's actually true C.

121
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.560
I'm expecting this to be true and I am asking you to e x equals to Y.

122
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.870
That was actually false.

123
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.240
And here I am asking you to tell me okay is x.

124
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.370
This is looks weird you know but basically not the exclamation mark equal.

125
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.050
That means it's not equal.

126
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.620
GM I'm single is X not equal Y.

127
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.540
Yes that was actually true.

128
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.920
And that's pretty much what I'm expecting to if I write this so you'll come up with false true false

129
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.200
too.

130
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.080
Which is exactly what we're expecting.

131
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.100
Again false in the kids 0 and 2 indicates one are right.

132
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.880
And that's pretty much all what we have for this section.

133
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.840
I hope you guys have mastered by now.

134
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.300
The dictionaries and booleans you guys should be proud.

135
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.000
Great job.

136
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.310
And see you guys in the next section.
