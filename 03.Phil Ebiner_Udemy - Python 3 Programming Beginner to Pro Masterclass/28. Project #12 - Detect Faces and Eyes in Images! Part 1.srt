00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,150
Hello everyone and welcome to this new project and this project we're going to detect and learn how

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,860
can we detect faces and images.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,700
And we're also going to learn how can we detect eyes and images too.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,180
It's actually really really fun project because you know like you can actually apply it and maybe upload

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,970
your own picture and see how can you detect for example your face or maybe upload your family picture

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,750
for instance and see how can we detect you know the entire families you know like faces and we'll also

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,920
be able to see and detect eyes too which is really fun.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
All right let's get started.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,700
So in this project we're going to have kind of three parts.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,650
So the learning outcome one we're going to learn how can we detect one face just one single face in

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,950
an image and then afterwards we're going to learn how can we detect multiple faces or more than one

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,480
face in an image.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,370
So think of it you know that might be for loops in there and we might detect more than one face and

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,660
then learning outcome three we're going to take eyes and faces too.

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,060
So within that face I want to go inside and try to extract information related to the eyes too which

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,640
is really fun.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,770
All right.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,970
So the first step is.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,250
OK.

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,450
What's what.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,970
What images are we looking for.

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,630
So in the course package OK it's actually go back here's so in the course package you would find that

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,170
there is two JP images.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,210
OK.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,640
One of them is called scientists.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,750
And the other one's called Trudeau let's open Trudeau one.

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,260
So this is basically the image of Justin Trudeau the Canadian prime minister as we speak.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,400
And he's one of my favorite politician actually.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,460
So we're going to see how can we apply.

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,860
Kind of you know like an official intelligence in a way and to just go ahead and detect you know this

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,740
specific face and then afterwards we'll see how can we detect the eyes as well within this image.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,530
OK.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
This is the first step.

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,230
And then afterwards there is another image called scientists.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
It's open it.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,310
And these kind of you know one of my favorite images of all this kind of you know a list of all the

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,270
scientists basically you would you would have here and we'll see how can we apply you know kind of face

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,790
classifiers to actually go ahead and detect all these faces within the image.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,130
It's pretty interesting pretty fun too.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,450
All right.

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,580
So that's kind of the two inputs and other input that we're going to have as well.

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,650
It's what we call it the hard cascades classifiers.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,350
OK.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,860
So this is a folder here is called Hard cascades.

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,780
You open it you would find that there are two files in there Excel files.

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,050
OK here this is this course is not about like you know an entire artificial intelligence machine learning

47
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,270
course but the overall idea here and that's what I want you guys to know is that these two classifiers

48
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,690
here this is kind of think of it as two train models.

49
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,910
So these are models that have been trained already.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,280
OK.

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,810
They have been you know like like already taking care of what we're going to do here we're just going

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,270
to use them in practice.

53
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,050
OK.

54
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,480
This is specifically used for AI detection.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,500
So if you send it to it any image it should detect ice into it here.

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,290
This is what called a frontal face if you once you use it.

57
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:24,840
It would simply going to detect just just basically faces or within any image.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,690
You know it's already trained already beforehand using multiple images to actually detect certain image

59
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,820
within within a picture.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,510
OK.

61
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,330
That's the I'm sorry it detects certain faiths within an image.

62
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,310
My apologies.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
That's pretty much all what we need to know.

64
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:39,560
OK.

65
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,960
That's overall information they're gonna be using throughout this project.

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,180
OK.

67
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,490
And that's pretty much what I have for this lecture is just a quick overview of what we're going to

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,610
be doing.

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,650
Let's get started.

70
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,700
In the next lecture I'm gonna walk you through the learning outcome one which is how can we detect a

71
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,810
single face.

72
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,910
Best of luck and see you guys in the next lecture.

73
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,280
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

74
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,070
The previous lecture I walked through a quick overview of the files what we're going to be doing and

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,180
let's get started right away and let's detect one single face.

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,830
Let's see how can we do that.

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,230
All right.

78
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,710
So first of all let's go ahead and import our important packages.

79
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:27,730
Case we're going to import num pi as MP and we're going to import open CV which is CV 2.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,240
OK.

81
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,130
If you guys

82
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,070
and we're going to import open service we're going to import CV to.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,730
If you guys please go ahead to the setup lecture and try to see how can you install open CV.

84
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,790
Okay.

85
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,790
And I'm going to have like a lot of detailed instructions on how to install an open CV in there.

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,100
Okay.

87
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,760
Let's press shift enter.

88
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,730
If you have it installed you should you have no problem no error.

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,280
We're going to appear here.

90
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,980
All right.

91
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,390
The next step is when I want you guys to do is to simply go ahead and read one single image.

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,490
So we're going to be doing we're going to be detecting one face.

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,930
So if you guys remember in the course actual course package you'll find that there is

94
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,150
there is two images here Trudeau and scientists.

95
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,170
So what I wanted to do is to read the Trudeau image and that's in that.

96
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,740
That's the main image you're gonna be working with in this learning outcome this section.

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,240
So let's get started.

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
So let's actually zoom in a little bit because we're able to see it very clearly.

99
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,340
So let's go ahead.

100
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,560
We're going to see OK CV two dots image reads.

101
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,770
And here I just need to pass my image.

102
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,010
So the name of the image is Trudeau dot JP.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,650
That should read the image.

104
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,000
And I'm gonna take it and put it in image C stands for color.

105
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,740
So this is a colored image.

106
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,150
All right.

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,110
Shift enter.

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,280
Looks great.

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's go ahead and actually visualize this.

110
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,360
Go ahead and see it.

111
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,820
So we're going to use open CV as well to visualize the image.

112
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:10,380
So going to say CV to dot image show and here I need to specify the title for the image.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,090
She recalled it.

114
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,610
Let's say Trudeau

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,490
face.

116
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,200
You can call it whatever you want and actually call it in colors because it's colored.

117
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,650
And I'm going to specify comma and here I need to pass along what image I need to be printing.

118
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,960
So so I can copy this and paste it here.

119
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,640
OK.

120
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,230
Please please do not go and run this.

121
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,470
OK.

122
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,470
Because if you run it you know you're going to get into loops and then the kernel will crash in order

123
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,340
to do this.

124
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,550
You know it could only open CV you have to include these two lines as well.

125
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,850
So going to say CV to dot.

126
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Wait.

127
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,190
Qui OK.

128
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,760
And then afterwards we're gonna say CV to dot destroy all windows actually free press tab and you will

129
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,750
autocomplete and say destroy all windows.

130
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:13,390
Simply put here when we put these two lines because once we show the image OK you will find that here.

131
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,070
It's kind of you know the that's the code is actually kind of you know stuck in a loop.

132
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,850
Right.

133
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,050
So in order to exit that loop we're gonna be waiting for specific keys.

134
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,980
If you enter any key once you enter any key it will destroy all windows.

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,930
We're just gonna destroy the image.

136
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,310
OK.

137
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,650
Just gonna hide the image again and that should be able to exit that loop and keep going and actually

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
run the next cells.

139
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,310
OK let's go ahead and give it a shot.

140
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,060
Press shift enter and here we go.

141
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,000
So first first step is this is our image right.

142
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,490
Actually let's go back then the way it did this.

143
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,420
So if you guys take a look here at our colonel you'll find that there is astro here which means it's

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,230
kind of we're stuck here.

145
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,700
The program is just waiting for you to provide something provide an input do something.

146
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,080
OK.

147
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,870
So again this is the image.

148
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,000
This is again we're stuck.

149
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,280
If you press enter it you'll find it here the ASIC is gone and we destroyed all windows.

150
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,600
The image is gone already.

151
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,250
It's like Snapchat we're in a way.

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,820
All right.

153
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,540
Okay looks good.

154
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go back here.

155
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,500
All right.

156
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,710
So the next step is what I wanted to do.

157
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,330
Kind of you know quick exercise.

158
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,520
We're going to go ahead and actually convert that image into grayscale and visualize the image again.

159
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:40,690
So to do that we're gonna see a image underscore grey equals to CV to dot CV t color please make sure

160
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,060
that C is uppercase and what we're going to do here we're gonna pass along our image color which is

161
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,290
our colored image in here and we have to specify what do you want to do with it.

162
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:58,700
We're gonna say OK CV two dots actually if you press tab it would show you tons of information here.

163
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,480
These are kind of you know everything you could you can normalize image you can do aspect ratio can

164
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,580
do focal lens.

165
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,300
You know like tons of stuff you need like like I don't know like ten peach these to actually go through

166
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,530
all this stuff there is tons of information here.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
We don't care about all this stuff.

168
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:20,910
We just wanted to convert from a color to grayscale so going gonna say OK See I'm gonna say color on

169
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:30,960
the score BGR which is stands for blue green and red to gray and that's what we wanted to do was to

170
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,880
convert from colored to grayscale.

171
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,180
That's what we want to do.

172
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,980
And the this simply will just going to convert our image color into our image Great.

173
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,530
OK.

174
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,380
And what I'm gonna do we're gonna copy these to actually copy the entire thing here and paste it here.

175
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,140
And they're going to do two though face in grayscale because I wanted to plug the entire image in grayscale

176
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,310
instead of image underscore color.

177
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm going to save the image underscore the gray.

178
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,000
OK.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,070
That should plot simply our image gray here.

180
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,220
We can do the exact same Wakey and destroy as well.

181
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,100
All right.

182
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,230
Looks good.

183
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,020
Shift enter.

184
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,170
All right.

185
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:18,750
It will tell me that you know like this model is not is not defined so CV to see that the colors actually

186
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,130
this has to be all uppercase.

187
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,780
My apologies.

188
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,190
So going to say this all uppercase with color on the score.

189
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,230
Be sure to Gray.

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,770
Please make sure that these two are lowercase c v 2 2 and then this has to be all uppercase shift enters.

191
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,500
Looks good.

192
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,170
OK.

193
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,950
Now there is no errors.

194
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,160
Error was gone shift.

195
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,850
Enter.

196
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,470
And here we go.

197
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,210
So if you actually go here.

198
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,620
You will find that this is my grayscale image.

199
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,390
OK.

200
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,980
And looks good.

201
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,320
That means the function actually worked.

202
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,850
And if you go back to our step here we funded what stuck in a loop right.

203
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,370
So in order to exit this loop let's go back to the image and press enter and that should exit our loop

204
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,850
in here.

205
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,410
All right.

206
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,670
Looks great.

207
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,640
So that's pretty much all what we need to know right now at the moment.

208
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,330
Just are just like how can we actually just load the low that image converted from colors to grayscale

209
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,520
and actually plot our image.

210
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,380
OK.

211
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,270
All right.

212
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,750
And what we going gonna do here I'm just going to conclude this lecture at the step at the stage and

213
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:32,820
in the next lecture I'm gonna show you how can we start to actually like take specific our face classifier

214
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,770
and start to detect specific faces.

215
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,350
But before we do that what I want you guys to do here is to for that mini challenge I want you guys

216
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:48,240
to insert a couple of new cells in here and I want you to instead of reading through though image I

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,750
want to treat the other image which is what we have here provided quality scientist image and converted

218
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,230
crude grayscale as well.

219
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,270
Please go ahead positive video and they will see you guys after the challenge.

220
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,880
All right I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

221
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,830
What I ask us to do is simply instead of having Trudeau dodge JP I just wanted to have scientists instead.

222
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:18,200
We're gonna take a scientists I hope it is exactly the same scientists.

223
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,390
There is an S at the end.

224
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,020
So here which is an add s all right.

225
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,800
And that's it.

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
So let's run it run it run it.

227
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,520
And here we go.

228
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,170
This is the image of all the scientists right.

229
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,000
And then we're stuck in a loop.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,060
Press enter again it's colored image.

231
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,440
Here we converted from colors to grayscale.

232
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,250
And here we go.

233
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,880
This is our grayscale image.

234
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,320
Okay.

235
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,010
Okay looks good.

236
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,150
Shift enter looks great right.

237
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,140
And that's it.

238
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,780
Let's go back to actually our image again.

239
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,610
Trudeau okay.

240
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,530
Make sure that's actually functioning properly looks great.

241
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,730
Go back here.

242
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,350
Run this.

243
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,670
This looks great.

244
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,360
And here we go.

245
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:56,990
All right.

246
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,450
That's pretty much all I have for this lecture.

247
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,310
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

248
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,680
In the next lecture we're gonna go ahead and actually start to classify and detect faces.

249
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,690
Best of luck and we'll see you guys in the next lecture.
