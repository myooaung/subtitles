00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.700
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
I hope you're enjoying the tutorials so far in this quick video.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
I wanted to give you a heads up about the Udemy review system.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.340
Now I know we haven't done much of the course it's really hard to judge the quality and the content

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.910
of the course.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.050
However the Udemy review system is simply such that they will ask you for a review very shortly.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.490
And what I would like to ask you to do is please have a look through the remaining Charles in this course.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.430
Look through the sections the preferred the topics that will cover look through the different data sets

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.590
and we'll be working with.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.280
And if you think that this is a five star course then please read it appropriately.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.630
On the other hand if you find that you have any concerns or issues with the course then please let us

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.600
know beforehand before leaving a review so we can address your concerns and maybe even update the course

13
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.640
and change things so that you are totally satisfied with the contents and the quality of the force.

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.380
The reviews are very important because they help other students understand what to look out for inside

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.840
the course and what's quality and content awaits them.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.240
On that note I called away to see you throughout the tutorials and let's get straight back into it.
