00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,180
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm so excited because now we're actually going to start evaluate our model or test our model and see

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,920
if it makes sense or not.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,520
OK.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,890
And the P.S. We show how can we actually build our model.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,430
So we built our model here in a sequential fashion using all the convolutions mext pooling drop out

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,490
flattening and then we actually use the EDM optimizers to optimize our models so we optimize it and

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,090
we as well went through a little bit of challenge mini challenge and we plotted using 25 epics to actually

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,280
change here and teach our model.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,860
Let's go ahead and please evaluate our model.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,280
Okay.

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,650
So how can we do this.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,730
So simply on our model or were network Wheat's everything is simply contained here within our object.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,880
You see in an undiscovered model that has everything all the information we want.

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:01:00,570
So you say okay eveil equals two CNN underscored model dot evaluate.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:07,900
Then we can pass along our testing data and then say okay X underscored test and let's see why underskirt

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,890
tests work.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,550
All right.

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,950
And that should simply kind of you know look evaluate our our performance using the testing datasets

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,530
Let's try and that's to get an matterless Okay.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,610
That's the valuation again you know we have 150 semples.

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,540
All right let's go ahead and actually print our evaluation.

23
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,070
So let's go ahead and say okay print.

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,210
We're going to specify here our test accuracy what we do use the format method.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,570
We're going to say that there was less accuracy and we're going to use Quilly bracket huge figures in

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,170
a membership to see Dot format.

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,760
And basically the eveil here what we are pains in here when we then evaluate method simply give to our

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,620
accuracy in the location number one.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,980
So we we have simply event contains two value zero on one and he would in number one.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,440
OK.

31
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,710
And the umpire Ray simply we're going to update our accuracy in here.

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,710
So that's on that.

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,960
And here we are actual page 93 percent accuracy which is really good.

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,110
All right let's.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,290
Over the pure testing dataset.

36
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,160
OK so what we need to do here is that we wanted to actually visualize the results and that's pretty

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,330
interesting.

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,650
So what we do here we wanted to plot render images.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,350
OK.

40
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:33,280
And we're going to simply plot our intended index okay which is the right index or like a label persay

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,660
which is for example if we have a smiling face that will have output one anyone going to clock as well.

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,690
The predicted opiate kind of out of our model.

43
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,510
So simply put we're trying to get to basically print both at the same time when to print the right or

44
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,600
target label.

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,050
And we're going to print as well.

46
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,390
The predictions coming out from model.

47
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,080
So let's take a look and actually view the predictor class when they say okay predicted.

48
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,500
Predicted underscored class.

49
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,160
Are going to say it equals to CNN underscored model which is our twin one.

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,450
Anyone going to say okay CNN that underscored model dot predict underscored classes or can pass along

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,330
our testing datasets were simply here.

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,970
We can say okay we use our.

53
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,620
This is again our teen model.

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,590
We're going to use the product classes method.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,120
We're going to pass along our testing dataset and here that will give us a little section on there.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
Let's see what's going to happen.

57
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,550
Okay let's go ahead and actually view with a pretty big classes.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,480
Let's run it.

59
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,120
And that's very interesting.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,460
So I guess I can see here this basically a bunch of zeros and ones.

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,660
And there are one hundred and fifty values.

62
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,160
OK.

63
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,390
So we have one hundred and fifty of predictive classes or a that's kind of you know the the the guests

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,800
coming out of our trained network.

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,440
Right.

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,360
OK.

67
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,210
So let's go ahead and add a couple of the lines he had because you have tons of information coming.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,820
Let's go ahead and actually view our predictive classes dimensions.

69
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,950
So this book it predicted underscored classes dot shape.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's take a look.

71
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,660
So predicted underscored classes.

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,110
They're cheap.

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,690
So predictive clatters is not defined.

74
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,030
So it's actually called predictive class.

75
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,500
My apologies.

76
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,290
Let's run it's a classic.

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,490
That's 150 by one.

78
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:23,810
OK.

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,210
That's looks looks good.

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,060
Well one to compare is simply wouldn't it wouldn't in our predictions going to compared it to why underscored

81
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,480
tests.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,660
If you remember to test our right labels straight this is our predicted labels coming from our far from

83
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,380
our model.

84
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,190
So let's compare the dimensions of both actually 150 and 150 that looks good.

85
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:50,050
Now one actually pretty much ready to go ahead and plot our data or visualize our out of date.

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,840
So to the final key I would agree that again we're going to say eliquis 5 equal to 5 and I'm going to

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
say a figure as a member figure and axes.

88
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:14,390
Axes equals two BLT darts sub plots figure as a member of the logo at l o w n our fig size.

89
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,970
Equals to Ghana.

90
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:26,240
Let's say they find us 12 and 12 and we're going to use axes equals two axes dot travel.

91
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,360
Right.

92
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,720
To flatten it up against exactly the same as we've done before.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:41,500
And I say okay for are in N P dot arrange in a pass along from zero up till L multiplied by W..

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,990
N or against the Iraqi axes of index II which is or any number that is generated image show an on going

95
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,210
to say okay I need to go ahead and view our next guests of index II.

96
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,600
So when to show the retesting the actual imaged excess of index either the actual image and reaction

97
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,370
want a plot as well.

98
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:03,940
Two things.

99
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,460
On top of it we wanted to plot our predictive class and our true class as well.

100
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:17,880
Okay axes of index I got Seth underscored tidal.

101
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,720
We're going to say okay let's sure litzman Shami predictions.

102
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
This is my apologies this is my predictions.

103
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Or a prediction class let's call it so it makes sense to us and brings a friend met method trick in

104
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,040
this book that's really bracket's you.

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,580
And what really do we do in and use becs flesh.

106
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,070
And if you remember it that we're going to print the next whatever going to write it afterwards to be

107
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,500
printed in a new line.

108
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,890
What I wanted to do with I wanted to show prediction class equals let's say one or zero and then in

109
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,620
the new line we're going to print our our tooleybuc afterwards as well.

110
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,380
So it's okay.

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,810
Our true class equates to going to have brackets as well.

112
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:05,870
And good to see Dot formats anyone get a pass along our predictive class classes predicted underscored

113
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,560
class of index.

114
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,180
And we wanted to show us why underscored tests of two rates.

115
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,810
That looks pretty good to me.

116
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,520
Okay let's actually run there.

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,930
Let's see if we if that makes sense.

118
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,870
Ah right.

119
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,320
Looks pretty great.

120
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,920
So now we have all our images five by five.

121
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,400
And if you take a look here he did sure this our prediction class of 1.

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,260
So that's kind of our comfort of the upper coming from our network.

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,060
Okay during testing fees and there were two classes what that means.

124
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,680
This is correct.

125
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,090
This is good one on one.

126
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,380
This is a good one and one great that's a bad one.

127
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,740
OK is this prediction class was actually zero.

128
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,270
While the tool class was actually showing one.

129
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,220
OK.

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,520
Which is simply put that's that's that's kind of you know one of the one of the sources of the area

131
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,590
that's why we didn't achieve for example 100 percent accuracy on the testing data.

132
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,870
We actually had showed 93 percent accuracy on the testing dataset.

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,580
Right.

134
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,670
And here we can view that much.

135
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,940
So what we could do here.

136
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,630
I'm going to say okay let's go ahead and do the space.

137
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:25,010
If you as a member of the there before BLT dot sub plots on discord adjusts as a member and were going

138
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,790
to say Okay deblieux space or H space would be let's say point five that will shift us.

139
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,820
Let's let's find each piece first equates to let's say point four.

140
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,390
And let's try on that.

141
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,420
All right.

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,190
Looks a little bit better.

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,710
Let's actually make it even point six.

144
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,090
And it looks way better now.

145
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,220
So we actually now have our image.

146
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,390
We have our producer class and I was to class as well.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,770
OK.

148
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,730
Looks pretty good.

149
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,310
Well we could do as well that we can disable our Sukie axes of index.

150
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,400
I would say Dot axis.

151
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,300
Then we can send that to off.

152
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,500
Let's say from that that we're just going to disable simply all our you know 64 64 pixels because we

153
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,870
know that the are 6 4 6 4 pixels anyways.

154
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,460
All right let's go ahead and parse the video.

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,190
Please go ahead and try the challenge.

156
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,430
Well I wanted to do here.

157
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,670
I wanted to again instead of printing 5 way.

158
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,280
I want to print 10 by 10 matrix.

159
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,780
Please go ahead and tested yourself and piece let me know how many semples have been corrected been

160
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,310
classified and how many samples have been misclassified.

161
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,060
Go ahead a positive you and see you after the challenge.

162
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,090
All right.

163
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,040
You guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

164
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,170
So what you were asked to do is simply to go ahead and change.

165
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,330
Here's this from five let's say to 10.

166
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,810
Right and two please go ahead and run this so let's try it.

167
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,920
And that's what we've got here.

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,560
It looks pretty cramped.

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,770
You know like you actually can't read it much because of ask I've asked you to count how many semples

170
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,000
have been correctly classified and how many Semper that have been misclassified.

171
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,760
So we could do it that we could say okay maybe we can adjust the width here between the semples.

172
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:25,970
OK we're going to keep realty sub plots against say pythian Suppose underscored just N we're going to

173
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,640
see a key deblieux space equals to let's say point five.

174
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,640
Let's run that.

175
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,540
And that's what we've got here.

176
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,080
Again it didn't help much.

177
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,370
So maybe we can adjust the H space so we can dual kill it's go ahead and just the H space.

178
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,760
Make it for example a little bit more.

179
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,700
Let's say one point five for example just to make it you know look as much as as big as we can.

180
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,940
And again it's really tough to see your heart actually read it.

181
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,480
OK.

182
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
So let's go back and exchanged point five an organ to do here.

183
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,000
Again do a little bit of kind of a trick ok.

184
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm going to see okay let's copy this.

185
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,160
Let's keep it as is going to.

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,790
Copy.

187
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm going to go here and paste it.

188
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,060
Let's have a basically comment this out and here it seems the prediction class in auxilary new long

189
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,690
word the word I'm doing and I say okay that's our prediction right.

190
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,770
So were going to say okay that's our let's see.

191
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,520
Quick guess and let's make it as efficient as possible.

192
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,490
And were going to make the true class let's call it true.

193
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,120
And that's it that's run that.

194
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,820
And that's what we've got here.

195
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,610
Actually maybe you can increase the each space make it let's say point nine let's run notes.

196
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,190
And it's much better now.

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,890
That's actually way more readable.

198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,640
Okay so while yes cats do hear construction accounting.

199
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,070
So here we have one misclassify.

200
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,390
He we have all that are good.

201
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,070
We have two.

202
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,000
Three okay.

203
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,540
And then keep going.

204
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,810
You basically count all the number of samples that have been critical as a fibre misclassified.

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,440
All right.

206
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,230
And that's pretty much all of what I what I would ask you to do for the challenge in the next election.

207
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,890
I'm going to show you in much better way.

208
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,590
Actually the present of the data okay in a very beautiful kind of format.

209
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,280
Right.

210
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,750
More confusion matrix.

211
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
Please stay tuned.

212
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,120
I hope it doesn't do with their letter.

213
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,900
And see you in the next lecture.
