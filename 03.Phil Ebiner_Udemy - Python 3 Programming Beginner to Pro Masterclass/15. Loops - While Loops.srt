00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello everyone and welcome to this new lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,780
We're able to learn a lot of information about for loops and we've covered a kind of wide range of of

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,430
options within for loops like you know like how to perform range how to do nested loops how to do list

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,630
comprehension.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,850
Now to the fun part let's take a you know kind of a little bit of shift and and see and call a different

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,000
type of loops which are all called Y loops.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,350
So while loops can be used to execute a set of statements as long as a certain condition holds true.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,620
All right.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,290
What do you mean by this.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,540
Let's assume that I wanted to print numbers let's say from 0 till 10.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,690
What I could do.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,030
Say OK let's define an index when defined it is set at a 0.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:55,500
And what I could say would say OK while i is less than four equals to 10 and then add the column press

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:05,530
Enter print I and every time I'm going to say I equals two I plus 1 enter.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,370
Here we go so I'll be able to print one to ten.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,500
Let's see what happened here.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,510
So what happened here is I defined a variable.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,320
I set it to zero and I defined Heatwole called a while loop.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:15,640
Ok.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,610
Think of all a loop as kind of you know like.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,270
That's kind of you know it's it's a loop with an if condition in it at the same time.

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,440
So think of it here I'm saying OK while OK as long as for a while if you find that condition is true

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,850
please go ahead and execute this.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,170
Keep repeating repeating repeating as long as that condition is true.

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,620
Think of it again as kind of you know doing a loop with an if condition associated with it as long as

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,190
i is less than or equal to 10 print I an increment i with one go up again and do it again.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,060
Let's take a look at you know look at this loop from scratch.

28
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,180
First one first run we're going here and saying OK I equals to zero.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,050
That was my initialization.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,610
I'm going to go here and say OK is zero less than or equal 10.

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,510
Yes.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
That means that condition is true.

33
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,560
So while true Some think that condition was true.

34
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:09,850
Right.

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,390
That's good.

36
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,630
That means I'm going to go here and print i.

37
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,270
And that's why I was able to print zero and then come here to zero add one to it becomes one and put

38
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,630
it here becomes one.

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,930
So I'll go up here again.

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm not going to go here.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,680
This is initialization.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,270
This is just something in the past.

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,540
I go here in a while and check again is one less than 10.

44
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes.

45
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:39,280
So go here print one and then go here increment one comes to go up here again is two less than or equal

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,490
10.

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,330
Yes.

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,330
So print two and to go here it become three go up again and do do repeat repeat until you actually print

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,080
Number 10 which is here you print it out and then you come here to say OK 10 plus one is 11.

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,540
You go you go up here.

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,230
Here is 11 less than or equal 10.

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,030
No.

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,470
Right.

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,100
This is this.

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,480
This is the element that's where the loop will going to be broken so that what's happened is again is

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,180
just going to skip this you're not going to execute the body of the wild anymore.

57
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,990
You go here and there is more lines.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Well we get executed if not exit.

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,350
And that's why we're able to print numbers from zero till 10:00.

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,250
And that's pretty much how I loop works in a nutshell.

61
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,200
OK.

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,510
All right.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,570
OK.

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,020
Let's take a look at another example.

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,250
Well I've got to ask you guys to do kind of as a quick challenge I want you guys to print numbers from

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,700
three till 20.

67
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,140
OK I wanted to print numbers from three to 20 using while loops OK.

68
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,800
All right.

69
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,230
So that's kind of a mini challenge.

70
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,360
Please go ahead pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

71
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,910
All right.

72
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,770
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge will ask us to do is to simply pretty much go

73
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,040
out here.

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Copy that code.

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,900
Put it here and I want it to print numbers from city 20.

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,970
So here are a set of initializing to the zero initial initialized to three and here instead of stopping

77
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,390
at ten I'm just gonna stop at 20 enter.

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,970
Here we go.

79
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,850
So now I'll be able to print three four five and so on.

80
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,240
Up until reached number 20.

81
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,670
OK.

82
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,420
That's pretty straightforward.

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,680
All right.

84
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,550
Let's take a look at another kind of example if we do Y in true.

85
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,200
So if I say let's say Y equals two let's say zero.

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,940
Okay.

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:26,090
And if I say while true Okay print let's say I.

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Okay.

89
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,220
If I do this.

90
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,690
All right.

91
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,580
This is a disaster.

92
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,840
OK.

93
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,180
That means it's we'll call it an infinite loop.

94
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,010
When I say while true that means I'm asking all the time just to repeat this and do it all the time

95
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,580
forever.

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,370
OK.

97
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,380
Let's actually give it a shot.

98
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,220
Let's see what's going to happen.

99
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,400
OK.

100
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,860
Obviously with the corner we'll get a break.

101
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,430
So please if you're going to run it expect that you need to go and actually stop the colonel or interrupt

102
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,900
somehow shift enter.

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,390
Here we go.

104
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,000
So I'm printing 0 0 0 0 to just keep going and I will do Colonel interrupt.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,270
OK.

106
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,350
Just stop the colonel and maybe restart the colonel restart.

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,470
OK

108
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,300
so all right.

109
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,800
Still

110
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,800
case interrupted.

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,820
That's good.

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,790
Let's go ahead and actually do Colonel maybe restart and clear output.

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,980
All right here we go.

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,710
So what happened here is I said OK let's go ahead and while to to all the time just print i print zero

115
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,260
all the time forever which is crazy obviously when I don't want to do this.

116
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,070
What I want to do.

117
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,530
Maybe add a little of smartness.

118
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,710
I'm going to say OK every time I think I and maybe I increment i plus 1 and maybe make a condition if

119
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:44,900
you find if I was greater than or equal let's say 10 were going to break enter.

120
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,950
It we go.

121
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,250
Now we're able to print numbers from 1 to 9.

122
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,770
OK.

123
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,070
OK let's take it.

124
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
Let's read it one more time.

125
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,380
So I got the idea here.

126
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,950
I want to just to illustrate for two guys wedding by While to the idea of went through simply just go

127
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,900
ahead execute the commands forever basically which is something that we wouldn't want to do.

128
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,840
So when I say while true print I every time I go here is increment i so I becomes here at 1 and then

129
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,240
2 and then CNN 4 and so on.

130
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,660
And here we can add simply what we have done here.

131
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,660
We can say okay go ahead repeat the entire loop unless a certain condition is satisfied.

132
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,650
And when it says the condition is satisfied you just gonna break.

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,950
All right.

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,950
So I say if you find I greater than or equal to 10 you're just gonna break.

135
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,150
And that's why we're able to print simply numbers from 1 0 to 9.

136
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,610
If you wanted to make it let's say eleven enter.

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,760
That basically would be equivalent exactly to this code because the outcome is exactly the same.

138
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,020
Zero to ten.

139
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,660
Here the number is zero to 10.

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:43,940
All right.

141
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,250
The only difference is when when we do while and then we add the condition after it it's kind of think

142
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,680
of it again.

143
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,680
We added a while loop with an if condition just both of them intact in one spot.

144
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,760
OK.

145
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,600
What we have done here is we separated the while.

146
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,720
So we set it to the loops.

147
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,380
We make it way to just repeat forever and we separated we load the if condition manually separately

148
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,420
here and this it's pretty much the same printing.

149
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,040
Pretty much the same content as the previous time.

150
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,730
All right.

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,190
OK.

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,920
Let's go ahead for a quick challenge.

153
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,280
I wanted to print numbers from three to 20.

154
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,010
Using that format exactly the same format.

155
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,940
I just wanted to print numbers from three to 20.

156
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,760
Please go ahead pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,500
All right.

158
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,270
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,910
We're just going to copy that paste it here and simply I wanted to print numbers from three up until

160
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,420
20.

161
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,930
So just gonna stop it to 21.

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,860
Enter.

163
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,740
Here we go.

164
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,570
We're able to print numbers from 3 4 5 and so on.

165
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,660
Up until 20.

166
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,540
And that's pretty much equivalent to what we have done here in this section.

167
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,470
All right.

168
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,810
OK.

169
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,740
And that concludes the four and why loop section.

170
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,090
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

171
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,380
In the next lecture we're just gonna get started and actually start doing a lot of exercises because

172
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,440
we can have hopefully have fun when we can have.

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,230
I think we have like almost 10 plus exercises with tons of videos and tons of explanations.

174
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,480
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
