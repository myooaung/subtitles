00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.475
Welcome back.

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.365
In this particular entire training,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.460
we will not talk about what, what are the new features has been introduced in Java 11.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.095
So not only we are going to talk about Java 11 as part of your going through Java 11,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.465
we're going to talk about something from Java nine,

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.940
and we're going to talk about something about java tin.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
And there is some point of time we'll talk about what is in Java 8,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.940
because Java 11 has the continuity,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.395
or Java 11 has the enhancement of what is already introduced in the previous versions.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.405
And not only that,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.470
there are few things we are going to discuss in this particular session,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.055
which means we're going to talk about what is Oracle JDK,

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:40.300
and what is OpenJDK.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.905
So far we were only concerned about 80.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.530
If you want to run your application,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.195
all you need is Cherokee,

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.055
Oracle, JDK. That's all.

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:56.045
But now we should know about What is the OpenJDK and what is their rule play for OpenJDK?

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.580
Because after Java 10,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.620
data is no more free,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.330
which means Oracle JDK,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.465
it's normal free but still OpenJDK is free.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:10.770
So we're going to talk about what is OpenJDK IN what they are doing.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.785
Let's see what we are going to cover in this entire session.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:20.120
The topics which is going to be covered in this entire course.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.865
The first, what are the topics?

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:24.905
As I mentioned earlier,

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.020
Oracle JDK versus OpenJDK.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.880
We need to know the difference between these two of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.280
them because ergogenic aids normal free.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.795
And then we need to understand why Java 11 is so important.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.660
There is a reason behind it and where you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.570
can download because they can download it from Oracle JDK,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.430
and you can download it from OpenJDK,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.995
but which is preferred to use.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:52.490
And setup your I d,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.830
which is Integrated Development Environment.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.840
So where do we need a separate API for that?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
Because most of the time we will use Eclipse IDE.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.180
But here we're going to use intelligent idea.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.594
The reason eclipse is far behind,

00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:07.160
not supported by Java 11 till now.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.780
So intelligence is the idea of just supporter Java 11.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.955
So we are going to use the intelligence ID in this entire course.

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:24.470
And we're gonna talk about load of new features were only coding built-in features we are

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.830
going to talk about because there are a lot of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.415
announcements on the virtual machine and hotspot.

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:36.725
Okay, so what we're going to want to talk about the code impacted feature.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.980
Okay, So let's say each other in the next video and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.210
we start talking about what is Oracle JDK and what is OpenJDK.
