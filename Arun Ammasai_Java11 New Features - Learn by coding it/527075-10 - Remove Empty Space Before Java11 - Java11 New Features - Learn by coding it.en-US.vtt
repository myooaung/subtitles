00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.730
In the last video we discussed what are the new string a payment that

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.150
has been introduced as part of Java 11, right?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.870
So now we're going to explore each one of them.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.485
So this is a project which we created.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.785
So now I'm gonna do is I'm going to,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.095
so we have com dot Java 11 debt features.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:27.105
So inside that I'm going to create a one more package to saying that string API methods.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.985
So string APIs.

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:32.010
So it's under the string API,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.330
I'm going to create a new class,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.810
java 11 string API.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.219
My thoughts.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.440
Okay, so now we have the Java file created.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.540
So now let's start exploring it.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.845
Before that, I want to use the presentation mode so you can only see the code changes.

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.790
To go to the presentation mode you can go to view and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.910
the appearance you should be able to see into presentation mode.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.180
Okay, so here we can see shift is that

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.165
here because by default it won't be shifted, is it?

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:12.980
So I manually configured that if you want,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.405
you can configure that also.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.550
So if you want to configure,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.660
go to intelligent and you are,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.580
do you have to go to the preference?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.305
And this, you know that.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:25.230
So now I'm going to presentation mode.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.585
Okay, so fine.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:35.710
So first thing first,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.030
let me create a main method.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.670
So we're going to talk about the string you UP my, That's right.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.915
The first thing which we need to know.

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:43.780
So although it has been done before Java 11, okay,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.980
So let me create a simple method how the same thing has been achieved before Java 7.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.465
So let me tell you.

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:51.985
So create a new method, static void,

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:56.920
and I'm going to create a method called before Java 11. So this is the method.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.435
So here what I'm gonna do,

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.630
I'm going to have a variable called content,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.980
which contains a string.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.085
And it contains some space here,

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.855
and Java 11 and some space.

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:14.225
Okay? So now what I'm gonna do is I want to remove the,

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:16.505
the empty spaces here.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:18.275
So how we can do that?

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.435
Just poverty IS out.

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:21.770
So the shortcut is S out.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.265
And if you press Enter, it'll bring you system.out.print Ellen.

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:28.985
So now what I'm gonna do it again.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:31.730
So now I'm going to print,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.995
i'm, I'm going to trim the content.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:38.030
So content don't trim.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
So now, so not only this method,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.490
there are some other mothers also,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.465
we have built-in methods also available, right?

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.595
So we can try that as well.

00:02:49.595 --> 00:03:00.095
So what I'm, what I can do is so string no space, SGR.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:04.340
I'm trying to remove the spaces from the content because other way we can do that.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.045
And 10 dot replace all.

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:10.505
I'm using expression, okay?

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:16.969
So I'm just providing parameter so we know all the empty spaces.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.214
Okay, so this is a character which needs to be replaced and replacement.

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:23.330
This is the expression for it.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.555
So and then what I'm gonna do,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:32.160
just friendly, no string, no space.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.960
Okay?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.150
So now let me call this method from the main method.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.680
So let me run this code just right-click and then Java as a main.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.290
So let's wait for a few seconds.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.625
See now we've got D outcome here, Java 11.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.200
So I'm just selecting them.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.890
See, there is no spaces in the left side, right side.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.200
At the same time, there is no space on the left that asset,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.075
which means this space has been removed and this phase also has been removed.

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:08.260
Okay, which is good.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.345
And Java 11, the next one,

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:11.950
you're using the regular expression.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.360
So I'm using a replace all matter.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.784
I'm using the regular expression here to replacing the empty spaces.

00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:20.060
Okay?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.575
And here, again, it's removed the spaces from the right side and the left side.

00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:27.185
So this is a before Java seven.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:30.830
Okay, so in the next video we're gonna talk about how this can we actually,

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.270
because there is nowhere here,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.385
I can only remove the left side.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.245
Empty spaces are right set empty spaces.

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:41.960
So we have tried to explicitly code to remove space after or before the word.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.765
Okay, So let's see in the next video and

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:48.630
we'll probably talk about the East blank example. Thank you.
