00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.400
In this video, we're going to talk about what are

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.030
the new feature we are going to explore this entire session.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.765
Okay, the first thing, so this is going to be interesting one.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.435
So running a Java file without compiling,

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.600
which means, so I have a HelloWorld.java file.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.525
So normally, how do we run the file?

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.685
I'm in? How to execute a Java file normally will compile the code.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:31.545
And then we will execute the class L.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.080
But now we don't need the Java SE anymore.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.680
We can directly then the Java file is there first change and the second one.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.870
So then a lot of new utility methods as been introduced as a part of string class.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.590
And we're going to explore all of them.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.915
And the third important one,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.910
this is going to be mind-blowing one,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.610
because we all know how to create a variable.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.080
You know the syntax right?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.760
Data type and variable name is a called a data value.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.875
For example, int x is equal to 10.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.845
That's all we know about since Java want.

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:09.395
But that is changing, right?

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:14.930
That is changed in Java are not exactly in Java 11 because it java 10,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.804
the content has been introduced.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:21.755
But in Java we need aspirin enhance or to even further.

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:27.320
And then the next important thing is nested based access control,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.840
which means how the inner class as aspirin,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.080
communicate to each other and what is the change in it?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.930
And another important thing, how should it be client?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.720
We all know that asked you to pick client has been introduced devotion to in Java nine,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.130
but in Java and any visa experimental version.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.905
So that is the reason the hashtag client is available in incubator module in Java name.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.835
But now it is no more experimental module.

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:57.785
Now it has its own module,

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.349
Java dotnet dot height utopic lines.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.230
And we're going to talk about are some new things available in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.830
their reading and writing the strings from the files.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.630
For example, if you have a file late,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.300
so how to read them and how to write them.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.800
So we all know that if you want to read or write to file and open a stream and you have

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
to write the stream redis stream readLines lot of things which we need to do, right?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.995
And now it is even simplified and we're gonna see what all of them.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:29.750
And another important thing,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.205
this is going to be performance impact our future flight recorder.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:38.720
So it will monitor our entire JDK and what it is doing.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.555
It is a kind of a black box, right?

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:42.290
That's what they're in.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.870
They flights right.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.760
Safe if the flight is crashed.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.255
So if we want to know what happened in the flight when the incident happened,

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:53.540
so you need to go look for the black box there.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.020
Similarly, if something goes wrong in a virtual machining to look for the flight,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.805
I got it to see what went wrong.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:02:59.960
Right?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.500
And the final one down 11 collections in

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.520
just a few announcements and changes in the collection.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.445
And we're going to talk about all of them one by one.

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.955
Okay? So, okay, in the next video we're going to talk about

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:20.070
the first future running Java file without Java compiler.
