00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.535
As we discussed in the last video.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:07.380
In this particular session,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.560
we're going to talk about mainly that won't is a difference

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.980
between Oracle JDK and open dedicated.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.575
Let me give you some difference between these two.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.090
And then probably I'm gonna go to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.460
the official website and I'll show you what you need to do.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.195
The first thing we need are the different.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.175
So let's say Oracle JDK.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.290
So Oracle JDK, Bayesian OpenJDK,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.314
which was donated by some microsystem.

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.520
So we all know that SUN microsystem.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.480
So some microbes from hasn't caught up to two oracle.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.695
So then it becomes some dedicated to Oracle JDK, right?

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.010
So or we can simply say Open JDK is a development region and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.775
Oracle JDK is a production region,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:48.935
okay, to be simplified.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:50.435
And ever OpenJDK.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.270
Openjdk is developed and maintained and supported

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.690
by Oracle along with the Open Data gay community.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.270
So which means OpenJDK is act as a different environment or a different concern,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.930
but still it is funded by the Oracle JDK.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.940
The next point, Oracle JDK was licensed under the oracle binary code.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.670
Which means if you want to use Arthur JDK,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.804
you may need a license.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.115
But when you're going for OpenJDK, that is,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.585
that has a GNU,

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.670
which means general public license.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.665
So you don't need the license.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.100
But when you're going for Oracle JDK for using the Oracle JDK for

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.455
commercial purpose, you need license.

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:38.390
So when we have a license then only the oracle will provide LDS support,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.965
which means a long-term support.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:44.600
Again, the open data does not require a license for commercial purpose.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.160
It doesn't need a license,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.385
but it is not going to provide a long-term support.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.625
They'll provide only short-term support because it's free, right?

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.160
And if you want to download oracle JDK,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.000
you can go to the oracle official website and you can download it from there.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.770
And if you want to OpenJDK,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.185
you can go to a JD good at java.util.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.010
And there you can find out a different versions of IJK and you can download them.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.710
And again, if you're going for Oracle JDK,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.765
you will get GD castles GRE.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.340
But when you go for OpenJDK,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.375
you'll get only the zip file which contains the JDK.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.685
Okay, so now let's go back.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:23.210
And I mean, let's go back to Oracle,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.520
we've said and let's go back to OpenJDK side.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.770
We'll see, well, how would it look like?

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.050
Cells open the browser here.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.965
Okay, So here the first thing,

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:39.980
Oracle JDK or Oracle JDK download.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.840
So the moment when you click Oracle JDK download,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.690
it takes you the article dot dot oracle.com.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.745
You might think I'm, we are working on Java 11.

00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:51.430
Why do you need to teach me how to download the Java?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.520
Because that is the difference between the previous ocean and the dispersion.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.195
Okay.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:03:00.340
So just click and then it'll take you to the official Donald page for now,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.775
Java 15 AZ, current version.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:07.195
So if you want to look for the older versions, you know what to do, right?

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:08.710
If we have a different versions here,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.830
we have Java 8 and we have a Java 11,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.835
which is the LTS, which means a long-term support.

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:17.660
Okay, so you can download a specific version, Jerry,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.640
good here when you click the Download it automatically

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.670
download EXE file and you can install them.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.160
Okay, So it contains a JDK and as far as the GRE, okay, So now,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.170
okay, So after Java,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.970
JDK becomes a licensed one for Oracle, right?

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.440
Sort of by Oracle.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.315
So if I want to use a free versions of JDK still you can use them, okay,

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:44.990
so as a firm using commercial purpose only you need the license,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.340
but if you're using your home or some small business purpose,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.410
it would be problem.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.440
But it is safer to use OpenJDK if

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.020
you're going for a commercial purpose or if you're willing to pay,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.180
you can go over follicle.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.910
So let's go to Open JDK, Open JDK download.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.870
So it will take you to Open JDK Java dot Jordan it.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.910
Here, you should be able to find

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.475
different versions of Java here it's just come down here.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:20.600
You can see JDK 6778 is 88 updates nine.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.130
And here we have the 11,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.390
12, 13, 14, 16.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.650
So if you want to know the 11,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.195
just click this one and you should be able to find the Oracle JDK 11 here.

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:37.125
Okay, So URLs just go to the grocer and remove the ocean and provide 11 here.

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:42.055
See, these are all the CDK London new features

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:44.755
and you can download the package as well here,

00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:47.090
I mean the JDK package.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.990
This is just telling you what are

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.330
the new feature that has been introduced as part of JDK 7,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.890
but now we need to download rate.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.050
So download I think I can probably something like that,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.375
open JDK 11 download.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:05.020
So here's a link and here you

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.080
won't be able to find it here because the current version is 15.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.610
So if you want to check the older version,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.565
you need to open the R K and then you can find a different versions, 14.11413.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.475
And the one which we are looking for is 11.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:23.015
So they say lebanon version which is g m into general availability.

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:26.225
So you can download the zip file if you're using Windows,

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:32.300
and you can use the tar.gz TAR file if you're using Linux or Mac system,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.345
and you can simply extract it and you can start using it.

00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:36.935
So you set the path.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:40.100
And we'll talk about how to set the path in our Windows,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.305
a Mac. The next video.

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:43.980
Thank you.
