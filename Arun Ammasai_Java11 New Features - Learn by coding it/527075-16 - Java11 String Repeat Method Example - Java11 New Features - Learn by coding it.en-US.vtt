00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:03.645
So the last one, repeat,

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.239
repeat the string number of times.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.475
So let me go back to our Eclipse and I'm going to create a new example here.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:15.520
So let's create a new example.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.930
Sorry.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.255
Java 11.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.770
String.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.719
Repeat example.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.310
It's going to be a simple one.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.430
Let's have a main method here.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.230
So I don't want to get a new button.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.290
It says influence I'm going to provide inside the main method itself.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.540
So let me create a simple string here.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.040
String STR 1 is equal.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.130
So normally there are times that I places where we need to repeat a specific letter.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.740
For example, experimental character, okay?

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.690
For example, you're, you're welcoming someone

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.210
and you are adding CIN 3 is going to be two symbol, right?

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.205
So i'm, I'm going to try that now.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:13.609
So welcome to 11.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.130
So after that I want to add distinct,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.500
so these three exclamatory symbol,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.420
but I don't want to add it manually here.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.570
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.519
I'm going to use a method,

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.455
the method to create that.

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.015
So how are we going to do that?

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.780
So SDR, string, repeat.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:47.240
So STAT1 dot append or simply provide a plus.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.375
And this is the value you are going to repeat.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.380
How many times?

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.180
Repeat three times.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.085
So which means what is happening here.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.875
So you're printing the year,

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:05.195
you're printing the escalator character along with the welcome to jar.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.100
That is there isn't. I'm just concurring in the data here.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.610
Okay?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.710
So now I'm going to print them.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.740
So I'm going to provide SDF one here.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.165
So just save it and run it.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.275
It is pretty simple,

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:19.730
so it might come in handy in some times.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.170
So welcome to Java.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
And so 11, okay,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.460
I should print the repeat non-STEM one.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.575
Okay, so just run it again.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:34.970
So you should be able to see the data which upended today exclamatory simple,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.770
okay, So this is how we needed to make use of string ng-repeat, right?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.380
So let's go back to the presentation.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.480
So we discussed I would ease blank method.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.990
We discussed the vote lines month and strip and that this

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.800
should be how a strip strip leading spaces and slip trailing spaces.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.030
And as well as we discussed,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.120
there won't be a repeat.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.370
Okay, So let's meet each of the next video.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.880
Thank you.
