00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:02.745
Let's continue.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.860
So I have a members,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.025
which means that goodness members which will provide all the members of the nest, right?

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:12.750
So what we can do,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.145
we can simply print the data, right?

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:15.795
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make the,

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.460
unless it's a stream in the first place.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.820
So Stream dot of matter,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.110
I'm going to pass the array.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.480
So it will becomes a stream of classes.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.515
Okay?

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.140
So once I got the classes than not,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.605
I'm going and I'm going to use the map method to retrieve the class names.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.160
Okay?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.330
So map, we know that it's a functional interface which will take one kind of input,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.460
it will written another kind of input.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.075
So I'm going to, Here's a class,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.155
and from the class, I'm going to use it get simple name.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:50.630
So basically in the first line, line number 17,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.920
I'm trying to get the single glass name, the input class name.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.710
Now, I would read multiple classes using

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.430
that particular class name and I'm trying to find each, every one of them.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.900
So once you've got it,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.580
then we will print the data.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.170
So I'm going to use forEach method and I'm going to use

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.125
the mantle references to no doubt.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.960
And you're going to use print LN.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.965
Okay, so now we've got the nest numbers.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:23.555
So let's run the example and we'll see what's going to happen, right?

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.855
So first of all, we need to call them at the right. Fineness matter.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:29.750
So I can call the finest mother here, financed.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.000
And what are the className which you are going to pass?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.210
I'm going to pass this class,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.910
which means our control,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.000
we shot glass assault.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.725
So now when you run the class,

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:44.510
what is the expectation here?

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.175
So Java 11 deflection method is a class which conduct multiple classes.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.890
So when you run the code, you will get B.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.360
What are the NUS members?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.660
Let's run and see what you like and end of file.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.475
Okay, so here the class name,

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:06.085
the input which I am passing is a Java 11 deflection method.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:07.645
That's my class name, right?

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:11.485
So what are the members of this particular class?

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.019
So the first one is Nestor,

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.300
class a, class B,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.240
and instead class a.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.465
So a and B, all of them are available.

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:27.085
Correct. So which will give you all the information. So so far.

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:28.945
So we're good, right?

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:30.910
So now I'm trying to find it.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.695
Okay, so I don't want the nist members.

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:33.925
So what you need to do,

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.590
I will give you a className.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.475
All you need to do is Find the host, right?

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:41.210
Can I do that?

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.135
Okay, So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna copy this same method here.

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:47.450
So I'm going to slightly modify the method.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.790
Okay, So here.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.830
So instead of find nest,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.740
I'm going to provide find host. You can do anything.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.050
You can find a host, you can find the nist members,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.455
or you can check whether this particular host belongs to this particular niche.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:01.865
You can get anything.

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.430
Okay, So here, so as such,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.010
Well, let me print the name.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.610
Older copy these two lines.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.955
Okay. Copy here and paste it over here.

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.630
And hosted case.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.090
I was just okay, fine.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.685
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to find the host, right?

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:29.720
How to do that?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.695
The, how to limit that.

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:33.925
We tried nest numbers,

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:36.715
the next one and you are going to die next host.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.635
So what is my class name here?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:42.430
Lastname dot get, nest, host.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.335
Take a look at Nest Ghost,

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:46.465
which will return a class name.

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:49.030
So which means that class belongs to the nist.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.935
Okay, So and I don't know which,

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.960
what kind of class name I'm going to retrieve here.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.329
So I'm going to collect as a generic.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.745
Okay, so host class.

00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:07.490
Okay, so now I got the host class, right.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.500
So now what we're gonna let sprint that data.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.015
I mean that the host name,

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:15.440
so host name is I mean hosts class A's.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.045
So what is that?

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:18.500
Host class, right?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.755
Host clasp dot gets simple name,

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:26.075
which will give you that acquired information. Got it.

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:27.755
So let's save it.

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:30.305
And now I'm going to come on this one.

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:35.450
And I'm going to call the find host multi-cloud find host mother.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.000
And the class I'm going to pass is the same one class.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.475
So let's see what's going to happen.

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:45.810
Just run it one more time.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.900
You will find the host is Java 11 reflection.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.095
With that, you will find it something different here,

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.280
I pass the same glass,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.275
I'm getting the same method host because you passed your host name itself.

00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:04.360
Okay, So what'll happen if you pass this class be okay,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.145
let me pass this catalase.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:08.690
Now. Run this.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.500
See, now it is giving you Java 11 reflection metadata.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.625
Got it.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:19.405
So even if you try with the class a,

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:22.015
which will give you the same because

00:05:22.015 --> 00:05:26.215
this is a class name host for these two classes, right?

00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.450
So let's save it and then one more time.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.220
Okay, so now we should be able to see.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.230
So okay, so I pass them className,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.970
which is belongs to this particular nest.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.540
And I found out using the get ness to host my that.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.530
So now we know how to get the MSB numbers and how to get the host, right.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.410
So in the next month that we're going to validate them.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.790
So I'm going to give you a class name.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.590
You need to find out whether this particular class is instant of this particular host.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.600
Let's do that in the next video. Thank you.
