00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.205
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:03.090
Welcome back.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.280
So we discussed what is Oracle JDK,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.855
and what is OpenJDK.

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:13.920
Right now we need to know the importance of Zao and why it is important.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.180
Let's talk about that.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.160
The first thing, Java 11 is the LTS version lists like Java 8.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.470
Java 11 also the associate,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
so LDS miniature, nothing but it is a long-term support.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.415
And the another important thing,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.635
which I mentioned earlier,

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.335
Oracle JDK is no more free.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:40.985
Jdk tin is a last Oracle version which is free available in the market.

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:44.480
And one more other thing, Oracle JDK.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.215
They're not gonna provide long-term support for any single Java version after Java 10,

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:56.075
which means since Java 11 everything is going to be a commercial versions.

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.000
They own property, long-term support.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.675
Okay, So you need to get the commercial license for it.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.040
But if I want to use it free, What can I do?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.545
You can still download the OpenJDK,

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:16.955
updated an article or other platforms like Adopt Open JDK as Google and IBM and extra.

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:18.380
Right?

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.240
So if you're using Oracle JDK and someday Oracle team

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.400
came to your doors and they'll knock your door and they

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.145
last for money because they will simply say,

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.980
and it is for commercial purpose and you have to pay.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.465
Okay?

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:40.760
So the next thing, so how I install the JDK 11, okay,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.505
as I mentioned, go to Open JDK and download the package based on your operating system.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.700
And then once the package is download,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.470
extract the zip file and put it in any default location.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.930
It will be simple in Windows machine,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.620
but in a Mac machine it a kind of a different complicated,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.960
but I'm going to explain you that how to do that.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.040
And you can find multiple versions in your mark.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.234
So if you go to library and Java,

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.665
and under the Java virtual machine you might,

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.755
you will find multiple versions of Java.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.680
So when you have a multiple versions of Java,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.300
how to handle that?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.685
So we're gonna talk about that as well.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:26.915
But in the similar way,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:28.415
what would happen if it is a Windows,

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.440
you can find Program Files,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.795
Java and other Java folder.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:36.245
You should be able to find a different versions of JDK.

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:37.340
Cool, right?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.960
And you are running some programs unit is sit

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.985
appropriate version as a default Java

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:47.090
because when you install your yellow and it becomes the default version.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.410
So if you're running the code,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.945
everything run based on the JDK version.

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:53.510
But if you want to switch back to Java 8,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.640
you need to go back to the configuration file

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.830
and you need to make the modification saying like,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.835
so this is going to be my default ocean going forward.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:04.355
So does Article 11 will not work anymore,

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:06.320
it will switch back to Article 8.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.610
So basically you need different versions of Java in Challenger mission.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.370
And you have a common place where you can specify this is going to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.245
be my default Java, right?

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.390
So I'm going to show you some different ways to download that also.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.830
And once you've downloaded and the path has been set properly,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.405
you need to make sure that the code is working properly.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.525
Just create a simple Hello World program and executed.

00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:36.935
If the execution is done,

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.330
then we're good to go.
