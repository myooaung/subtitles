00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.350
In the last video we discussed about, uh,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
how to execute Agile or file without compiling them.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.370
And when you have multiple class files,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.040
how the file is going to be executed under which

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.745
main method will be executed when you have a multiple classes.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:19.440
So in this particular video,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.420
we're going to talk over the next new future.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.785
So what is the next future?

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.170
Okay, So there are a load of new method has been

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.230
introduced in Java 11 as part of a string API.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.240
So there are six models we're going to talk about as part of this session.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.450
So the first one is blank my thought.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.455
And the second one lines and the third one strip.

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:44.180
And the fourth one, strip leading and trailing.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.490
And the last one is repeat.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.045
Each one of them has having its own advantage.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.325
So where do we need to go freeze black Madonna,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.610
you have a string and you want to check is blank.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.475
You can go for the Islam mother, you might ask.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.040
So does this mean that already exist?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.240
No, it does not.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.785
So normally what you not what we use to do this,

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.789
we use string util packages,

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.785
so we'll use a string utils dot plank or not blank.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:20.750
So there are different models available in a different packages and those are extra null,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.120
that is what they used to so far.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.225
But here in default,

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.270
string class itself, we have the new met that.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.840
So when you want to check whether a string is a blank,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.695
you can check using these black mother and a second on his lines.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.050
Okay, let's go back and talk out on that one.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.679
So is blank, empty strings and whitespaces.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.240
So he's blind method will take care of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.900
the empty strings and the whitespaces we'll talk about in detail.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.730
And the second one is lines,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.485
so returns a stream of string.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.060
Just take an example.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.355
You have a string which contains a statement.

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:57.620
So when you use the lines Madonna,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.400
which will return you a string into a stream of string.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.005
For example, you have a file and you're converting your entire file into a string.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.270
And if you use the lines method,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.465
which will convert entire thing into a scream of a string.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:15.050
So once you have a stream, you can work with that and strip,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.940
remove the empty spaces in the both side,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.609
left and right. And the stipulating.

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.925
So remove the white spaces in the left side and trialing the other way to the right side.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:28.790
And repeat, this is going to be interesting on.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.490
So for a specific character or

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.880
a specific letter at a specific thing you want be repeated multiple times.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.410
You can use a repeat math or annual deposit integer as a parameter.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.100
How many times you want to repeat the particular numerical number or whatever.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.260
You want to repeat multiple times.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.055
Okay?

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.350
So, so what we're going to do right now,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.700
we are going for intelligence and we are going to create a simple class.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.835
Fail to explore each and every one automatic.

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.840
Thank you.
