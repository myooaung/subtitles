00:02.660 --> 00:04.950
We made a great progress so far

00:05.210 --> 00:10.830
but before we continue, let's bring some structure into our queries column.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.310
So at the moment, we have our four queries,

00:13.400 --> 00:16.270
we have the initial three queries and now appended

00:16.280 --> 00:18.530
the population combined query.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.230
Now as you can imagine, we are going to add some more data within the next videos to that column,

00:24.230 --> 00:30.710
now let's organize that and to do this, we can simply right-click into that column, right here for instance

00:31.430 --> 00:34.670
and then press new group like that.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.660
Now we can give that group a name,

00:36.740 --> 00:38.800
in our case we could name that group

00:38.870 --> 00:45.560
initial queries for instance. Let's do this and press OK

00:45.600 --> 00:49.330
and now we see that this new group was created up here.

00:49.680 --> 00:55.350
What we can do now, we can simply click and hold the left mouse button to drag and drop the first query

00:55.350 --> 00:59.370
into that group or we can select the next query right here,

00:59.430 --> 01:04.700
press and hold the shift key on the keyboard and then select the last query, like this.

01:04.690 --> 01:11.560
and now we can again drag and drop all of the queries into our new folder or into our new group actually.

01:11.610 --> 01:15.570
So let me just drag that to the top like this

01:15.570 --> 01:22.500
and now we organized our queries and as I said, we want to add some more data, some more queries to that

01:22.500 --> 01:23.580
column.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.730
How and why we do that, let's learn that in the next videos.
