00:03.050 --> 00:07.490
We want to learn more visualizations, in this video,

00:07.640 --> 00:09.850
we will use cards.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.580
So the first thing we have to do is we have to create a new page,

00:13.790 --> 00:14.640
let's do this

00:14.960 --> 00:21.300
and name that page cards and more and press enter.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.050
Now what is a card?

00:23.420 --> 00:28.930
Well as with the slicer, let's simply create one and see what that is then.

00:28.940 --> 00:35.340
So to find a card, you simply go to the visualizations and select that 123 symbol right here,

00:36.150 --> 00:39.220
now we have the card and we can write that right here.

00:40.270 --> 00:45.280
Now the interesting thing about the card is that you only have one field right there,

00:45.760 --> 00:50.860
so let's say you want to have the population in that field and let's see what happens.

00:50.890 --> 00:54.340
So I'm selecting the population and drag it right there,

00:55.240 --> 00:57.590
we now see the total population,

00:57.910 --> 01:03.620
so apparently this card only presents one single value

01:04.090 --> 01:05.770
and that's what you can do with that.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.920
So if you want to have a quick overview of a total revenue of a year or values like that, it might

01:11.920 --> 01:15.560
make sense to use a card as a visualization.

01:15.580 --> 01:20.350
Now we have the total population but this doesn't help a lot, right,

01:20.350 --> 01:23.700
what if you want to filter that for a specific year?

01:24.100 --> 01:26.210
So we have our report level filter here,

01:26.260 --> 01:27.100
we know that

01:27.430 --> 01:30.470
but what if we want to add a visual level filter?

01:30.970 --> 01:33.830
So we simply select year in the FACT-Population table,

01:34.210 --> 01:43.810
drag it right there and now change the advanced filtering, to that, to the basic filtering. If you now scroll down and

01:43.810 --> 01:47.700
select 2017 and minimize that

01:48.160 --> 01:54.700
and now we know that we have 7.5 billion people living on this planet in 2017.

01:55.360 --> 02:05.500
Let's add another filter maybe, a country filter in the DIM-Region table, select it and drag it right here

02:06.490 --> 02:09.600
and now let's say we only want to see, I'm scrolling down

02:09.600 --> 02:14.890
in the meanwhile, the United States, this is where I want to go to, right here.

02:15.210 --> 02:18.180
Let's press that and minimize it

02:18.420 --> 02:25.330
and now you see that we have the total population of the United States in 2017 in that card.

02:26.370 --> 02:34.360
So this is a normal card but there is also a multi-role card existing, let's create this also to see

02:34.360 --> 02:35.760
the difference.

02:35.810 --> 02:43.030
So the multi-role card can be found right here, if you click it, you can drag it also right there,

02:44.360 --> 02:50.420
well and now let's start the same way we did it with the normal card right here.

02:50.750 --> 03:00.020
So we go to the FACT-Population table and drag the population to the fields, like this. Now this doesn't look

03:00.020 --> 03:01.570
really correct right here

03:01.880 --> 03:03.910
but we know what the problem is, right?

03:03.980 --> 03:07.070
We have to change the default summarization again.

03:07.370 --> 03:11.460
So let's do that by going to the fields,

03:11.600 --> 03:19.570
click onto the arrow and say yes, we want to summarize it, like that. Now

03:19.610 --> 03:20.650
this looks better,

03:21.670 --> 03:25.870
however we still have the total population for all the years.

03:25.910 --> 03:29.710
So let's also add that year filter as we did it before,

03:31.800 --> 03:35.230
like this and like that,

03:35.470 --> 03:40.280
go to the basic filtering, I'm doing it a little bit faster now because it's the same thing we just did,

03:40.920 --> 03:43.690
click 2017 and close it.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.580
7.5 billion,

03:45.700 --> 03:47.430
we know that from the first card.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.640
So the last thing we have to do is we have to add the country.

03:50.970 --> 03:58.760
So back to the DIM-Region table, selecting the country, dragging it right here and scrolling down,

03:58.830 --> 04:05.190
maybe like this, scroll down to the United States and select it.

04:05.590 --> 04:09.110
Well this is the same value that we had before, right,

04:09.400 --> 04:11.850
so this doesn't add a lot of value right now

04:12.340 --> 04:19.570
but what if you want to change that from a basic filtering to another filter? The top end filter, this one,

04:20.050 --> 04:26.860
let's click that. Now we can again decide if we want to have a specific range of the countries to be

04:26.860 --> 04:32.320
displayed and let's select the top three countries by the population again

04:33.470 --> 04:35.950
and press apply filter.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.400
Now we only have the values still, right,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.640
so this still doesn't add a lot of value,

04:41.070 --> 04:44.770
let's minimize that and go back to the fields.

04:44.940 --> 04:53.510
Now we could only add one field to the normal card visualization but let's try to add the year also to that field.

04:53.730 --> 05:00.960
So I'm selecting the year, dragging it and as you can see right now, you can add more data to that field in the

05:00.990 --> 05:02.550
multi-role card,

05:04.060 --> 05:10.480
let's also add the country then. So I'm selecting the country and add it right here and now if I increase that a

05:10.480 --> 05:11.330
little bit maybe

05:11.530 --> 05:17.050
and now it gets interesting right because this multi-role card allows you to view much more detailed

05:17.050 --> 05:21.000
information when comparing it to the normal card.

05:21.010 --> 05:26.210
So this is the multi-role card and the card visualization, something that you might need

05:26.290 --> 05:29.550
quite often when you work with Power BI desktop.

05:29.620 --> 05:36.070
Now I won't show you all of the visualizations in that course but there are two more visualizations I want

05:36.070 --> 05:37.660
to show you,

05:37.750 --> 05:40.240
let me show you those in the next video.
