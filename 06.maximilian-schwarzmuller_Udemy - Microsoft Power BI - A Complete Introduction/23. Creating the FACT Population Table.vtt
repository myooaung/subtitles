00:02.680 --> 00:09.990
We are now in the last steps before we actually load our cleaned and shaped query into the data model.

00:10.030 --> 00:16.140
Now before we do that, let's finish the star schema by creating the FACT-Population table.

00:16.270 --> 00:21.120
Now to do this, we will start the same way we did it for the DIM tables,

00:21.130 --> 00:24.720
we will create a reference to the population combined query.

00:24.730 --> 00:26.500
Now let's right-click it,

00:26.590 --> 00:34.180
so the population combined query and click reference and we can already direct that to the data model group

00:34.840 --> 00:43.650
and rename it to FACT-Population and press enter. Now that we got that,

00:43.810 --> 00:50.650
let's think about what information and by that, what columns we actually need in that FACT-Population

00:50.650 --> 00:51.520
table.

00:51.970 --> 00:58.090
So the first column, that country ID and this is an important column because this column allows the FACT-Population

00:58.090 --> 01:01.020
table to communicate with the DIM-Region table,

01:01.090 --> 01:08.290
you remember in the DIM-Region table, we also have that country ID column. Now at the moment, they cannot communicate

01:08.610 --> 01:11.530
but we will change that soon in the next module,

01:11.530 --> 01:17.870
however the main information for the moment is that we need that country ID column, the country column,

01:17.920 --> 01:24.100
this is something that we don't need because as we know that the country ID column in the FACT-Population

01:24.100 --> 01:28.650
table allows us to communicate with the DIM-Region table in the next module,

01:28.660 --> 01:33.150
this also means that we have the country information already in the DIM-Region table,

01:33.190 --> 01:34.320
let's look and see that,

01:34.330 --> 01:39.010
so right here. This means we can now delete the country column

01:39.010 --> 01:40.680
in that FACT-Population table,

01:41.050 --> 01:48.520
let's do this by going to the home ribbon and press remove columns like this, the year this is an information

01:48.520 --> 01:53.890
that we only have in the FACT-Population table and this is why we have to keep it right there.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.940
The Age-Group,

01:55.030 --> 01:57.590
well this is something different,

01:57.730 --> 02:00.650
we created that DIM-AgeGroup table,

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
this means if we would now be able to get the AgeGroup-ID, let's see that,

02:08.030 --> 02:15.670
so this column into our FACT-Population table, then we would not need that Age-Group column anymore because

02:15.730 --> 02:22.060
as I said, in the next module, we will learn how these tables can communicate with each other just by

02:22.060 --> 02:24.030
those ID columns.

02:24.030 --> 02:30.550
Now let's import that AgeGroup-ID column into the FACT-Population table and you know how this works, right

02:30.640 --> 02:34.600
because what we want to do is we want to add a column basically

02:34.600 --> 02:41.710
and to add columns, we only have to merge queries. So we can go to the home ribbon where we already are, go

02:41.710 --> 02:47.570
to the merge queries option right here, click on the arrow and press merge queries,

02:47.620 --> 02:53.230
now we are in the FACT-Population table and can select the Age-Group right here.

02:53.230 --> 03:00.100
Now we will select the DIM-AgeGroup table right there and here we can select the Age-Group. The left outer

03:00.100 --> 03:02.140
join is fine for the moment, we learnt that

03:02.140 --> 03:09.520
so this is good and we can see that we could match all of the rows of course. As we got that, we can

03:09.520 --> 03:10.540
now press OK

03:11.670 --> 03:19.920
to add the column to our FACT-Population table and now we simply have to expand the column, unselect all

03:19.920 --> 03:26.280
of the columns as we only need the AgeGroup-ID and also unselect the use the original column name as

03:26.280 --> 03:27.240
prefix option,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.520
this is also something that we already learned.

03:29.520 --> 03:36.350
Now we can press OK and now we have the AgeGroup-ID in our FACT-Population table,

03:36.530 --> 03:39.460
let me direct that to the left maybe, right here

03:40.530 --> 03:47.940
and now that we have the AgeGroup-ID in this table, we can delete the Age-Group because the AgeGroup-ID allows

03:47.940 --> 03:52.350
us now to refer to the DIM-AgeGroup table. Although I might repeat myself,

03:52.410 --> 03:57.850
this is not working at the moment but we will learn how to create that in the next module. So we can delete

03:57.860 --> 04:04.580
the Age-Group column like this and we can see that now we have a really clean FACT-Population table.

04:04.680 --> 04:10.130
We have the country ID column which will allow us later to communicate with the DIM-Region table,

04:10.190 --> 04:16.160
we have the AgeGroup-ID column which will allow us later to communicate with the DIM-AgeGroup table and

04:16.170 --> 04:17.530
we have the information,

04:17.610 --> 04:25.280
the year, gender and population which is only existing in the FACT-Population table. This is really good

04:25.500 --> 04:31.290
but there is one thing that I don't like right here, in that population column right here.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.070
What that is and how we can change that,

04:34.080 --> 04:36.180
let me tell you that in the next video.
