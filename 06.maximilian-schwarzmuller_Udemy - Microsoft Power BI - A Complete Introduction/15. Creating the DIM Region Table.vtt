00:02.610 --> 00:09.970
Let's continue to build the base for our data model with some query references. So here we are back

00:10.060 --> 00:17.660
in our project and as we just learned, we want to create references to our population combined query. Now

00:18.310 --> 00:23.020
as we want to build something new and build the base for our data model,

00:23.050 --> 00:27.450
I think it makes sense if we first create a new group which is then called Data-Model.

00:27.580 --> 00:36.070
So let's do that first, I'm right-clicking right here, press new group and name that Data-Model, like

00:36.070 --> 00:37.060
this,

00:37.060 --> 00:39.640
so we have that new group right now.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.290
That was a first step

00:41.290 --> 00:45.530
but the main step is to create a reference to that population combined query.

00:45.850 --> 00:50.980
Now to do that, we simply select a query that we want to create the reference to, go to the home ribbon

00:51.250 --> 00:55.710
and go to manage and press reference.

00:55.720 --> 01:01.840
Now this takes a few seconds, we can already use the time and drag that query into our Data-Model group,

01:02.110 --> 01:03.240
like this

01:03.360 --> 01:04.850
and here we have it now.

01:05.110 --> 01:07.010
Now, just two things,

01:07.150 --> 01:12.120
as you can see this looks exactly the same as the population combined query

01:12.280 --> 01:19.480
but if you look into the formula bar or into the applied steps, you see that we only applied one change

01:19.510 --> 01:26.260
or one action at the moment and this is the connection to the population combined query, nothing else.

01:26.260 --> 01:32.110
If we would create a duplicate, then this duplicate would exactly look like this.

01:32.110 --> 01:38.440
So we have lots of steps as can be seen in the formula bar and we applied steps and we have that additional

01:38.440 --> 01:40.940
connection to the external data source.

01:40.990 --> 01:45.200
Now in our case, if we would want to delete the population combined query now

01:45.280 --> 01:49.480
and I can do that by right-clicking it and pressing delete,

01:49.840 --> 01:56.410
we can see that we cannot delete that query because the reference query refers to that query,

01:56.530 --> 01:59.800
so if we delete that, then the reference wouldn't work anymore

01:59.860 --> 02:02.860
and this is why this is not allowed at the moment.

02:02.860 --> 02:03.950
So this is good to know

02:04.030 --> 02:05.440
but now we can close

02:05.440 --> 02:07.920
our population combined query or leave that

02:07.950 --> 02:12.470
query actually and go back to our reference query. Now

02:12.580 --> 02:17.090
as I said, this is going to be the DIM, so the dimension region table,

02:17.380 --> 02:19.360
so let's rename that first.

02:19.360 --> 02:26.530
So I'm selecting the name right here and call it DIM-Region, like this and press enter,

02:26.610 --> 02:32.950
now the query is renamed and we can now think about how we want to build that dimension table.

02:33.410 --> 02:37.420
Now the first thing we see is that we have information in here that we don't need,

02:37.510 --> 02:39.660
that was the problem of the initial query, right?

02:39.700 --> 02:44.820
We have all this information combined in one query without any structure, as we want to change that,

02:44.830 --> 02:47.780
let's first delete all the columns that we don't need.

02:47.890 --> 02:53.230
So the country ID and the country might be a good idea to keep that in a region table

02:53.560 --> 02:56.440
but the year and the upcoming information,

02:56.590 --> 02:58.180
this is something we don't need right here

02:58.330 --> 02:59.370
so let's delete that.

02:59.380 --> 03:06.810
So I'm selecting year, press enter and hold shift and select the last column and press remove rows, remove columns

03:06.820 --> 03:07.490
by the way

03:07.540 --> 03:09.070
of course, not rows.

03:09.420 --> 03:10.680
So this is it,

03:10.720 --> 03:12.620
we now made a first step

03:13.060 --> 03:17.460
but if you look at that list now, you'll see that we have lots of duplicates and that's not what

03:17.460 --> 03:24.790
we want because this table should only contain one row for each country ID, for each country and for each

03:24.880 --> 03:28.180
region in the end. Actually that's not true,

03:28.190 --> 03:33.070
we of course have the regions multiple times but each country is only allocated to one region.

03:33.450 --> 03:38.660
So nevertheless, let's get rid of those duplicate values we have right here for the countries.

03:38.720 --> 03:44.960
So I'm selecting the country column, go to remove rows and press remove duplicates. Now this takes a

03:44.960 --> 03:52.400
few seconds and then we have a list of all the countries again without any duplicates, like this.

03:52.400 --> 04:00.400
Now what we don't have right here is a column with the regions or the continents and we don't have that

04:00.430 --> 04:02.290
in our query editor at the moment,

04:02.500 --> 04:06.580
so we need to import additional data, as we already know how this works,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.160
let's do this quickly.

04:08.310 --> 04:15.010
So I'm in the home ribbon, go to new source and text csv and now you'll find that codes-country-region

04:15.070 --> 04:16.390
textfile.

04:16.570 --> 04:17.780
This is the file we need,

04:17.950 --> 04:20.900
so let's select that and press open

04:21.310 --> 04:28.780
and now we see that something went wrong obviously because that's not a structure that we can import

04:28.810 --> 04:30.560
into our query editor

04:31.060 --> 04:35.880
but let's take a look at the delimiter up here and see if we can fix that. At the moment,

04:35.920 --> 04:37.640
this is set to a fixed width

04:37.900 --> 04:43.240
so this would assume that we can kind of draw a vertical line between each of the columns

04:43.240 --> 04:44.610
we have data for

04:44.800 --> 04:47.010
and if I would draw a vertical line right here,

04:47.110 --> 04:48.550
well this doesn't work

04:48.730 --> 04:52.420
and this is why the data we see right here look kind of messed up

04:52.720 --> 04:54.370
but let's change that.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.460
If we look at the data, we see that we have a tab between each of the data,

04:58.480 --> 05:04.080
so if we select tab up here, like this, then this looks better, right?

05:04.300 --> 05:09.150
So let's now press OK and bring that query into our query editor,

05:10.650 --> 05:17.370
like this. The first thing I see is that we have the problem that we always have because we unselected

05:17.370 --> 05:21.990
the automatic data detection, we have to turn the first row into headers.

05:22.260 --> 05:23.780
We know how to do that right,

05:23.790 --> 05:28.450
so let's go to the home ribbon and press use first row as headers.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.060
Now this looks good,

05:30.060 --> 05:34.320
now let's use the time to take a look at the columns and at the data we actually have

05:34.410 --> 05:36.710
and let's rename the column at the same time.

05:37.950 --> 05:40.830
So the first column is the region code,

05:40.890 --> 05:45.250
well we need that and we should call it like this, right.

05:46.570 --> 05:52.290
The second information is the country code, well we could need that information but actually we don't

05:52.510 --> 05:57.330
because in the DIM-Region table, we have the country ID and the country name

05:57.580 --> 06:03.160
and if you look into the fourth column, we also have the country ID right here, so we don't need that

06:03.300 --> 06:03.860
A2

06:03.880 --> 06:09.610
and also that A3 codes because we can identify the region and the country at the moment, so we can

06:09.610 --> 06:13.970
get rid of those two columns by selecting them and press remove columns.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.340
The same thing is true for the name right here,

06:16.420 --> 06:20.600
we have the name already in the DIM-Region table so no need to have it right here,

06:20.730 --> 06:22.170
well let's remove that.

06:22.420 --> 06:30.500
So now we should rename that column to country ID because that's important,

06:30.610 --> 06:37.180
we need to have the same name right here that we have in the DIM-Region table because later, we will kind

06:37.180 --> 06:41.920
of add that information and without wanting to tell you what we are going to plan in the next minutes,

06:42.310 --> 06:48.250
we should make sure that those two columns are named the same which is true in our case and we can also put

06:48.250 --> 06:49.460
that right here.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.800
So we have a country ID,

06:52.030 --> 06:56.180
we have a country name in the DIM-Region table and we have a region code,

06:56.320 --> 07:00.430
so this would help us to kind of add the data.

07:00.610 --> 07:05.330
The problem at the moment is that we don't have the full region names,

07:05.470 --> 07:11.630
I would prefer to have Asia and Europe here instead of AS and EU. To do this,

07:11.680 --> 07:14.200
we need to add data manually,

07:14.200 --> 07:18.120
so we won't import those from an external source. Although we could do that

07:18.220 --> 07:20.190
but I want to do it on my own.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.130
Let's see how this works in the next video.
