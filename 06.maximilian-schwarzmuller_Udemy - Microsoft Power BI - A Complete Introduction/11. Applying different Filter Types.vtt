00:02.610 --> 00:07.740
We want to learn how to apply filters on our new report page.

00:08.040 --> 00:15.600
So talking about filters, we have to differentiate between three filter types in Power BI desktop.

00:15.630 --> 00:22.400
We have the report level filter, the page level filter and the visual level filter.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.690
Now to understand what that is,

00:24.790 --> 00:31.490
I think the best way is if we simply apply each of those filters right now. The first filter that we want

00:31.490 --> 00:34.630
to try is the report level filter,

00:34.790 --> 00:37.540
you can find it on each page of the report

00:38.000 --> 00:43.860
and if you then look to the visualizations column in the filter area, you can see that report level filter

00:43.860 --> 00:44.650
right here

00:45.170 --> 00:50.360
and also the page level filter of course, the only thing you can't find right here is the visual level

00:50.370 --> 00:55.720
filter at the moment because we didn't select a visualization, so it cannot be displayed.

00:55.730 --> 00:58.150
Now back to the report level filter.

00:58.610 --> 01:06.290
What if I apply such a filter right now and let's say I want to apply a filter regarding the years, so

01:06.290 --> 01:13.400
I only want to select a specific range of years in our slicers and by that, only the specific range of

01:13.400 --> 01:20.890
years should be displayed in that report and I'm saying report because this should refer to the entire

01:20.900 --> 01:21.560
report,

01:21.680 --> 01:23.770
so all of the pages.

01:23.770 --> 01:32.190
Now let's try that by going to the fields column, FACT-Population table and selecting the year again and I'm

01:32.190 --> 01:39.830
dragging it to the report level filters area right here, like this. If I now scroll down, we can

01:39.830 --> 01:46.520
see that we can set a filter type. At the moment we selected the advanced filtering,

01:46.520 --> 01:48.610
this is the filter that we will need

01:49.040 --> 01:51.900
but I can show you the other filter type also,

01:51.950 --> 01:54.660
this is the basic filtering right here 

01:55.130 --> 02:02.450
and if you now scroll down, you can now decide on what years should be able to be displayed in that report

02:02.870 --> 02:04.530
but we won't use that right now,

02:04.730 --> 02:09.080
so let's go back to the advanced filtering right here.

02:09.140 --> 02:15.850
Now what I want to do is I want to say that if the year is less than or equal, so this was quite fast,

02:15.920 --> 02:19.690
so I clicked this right here, less than or equal

02:19.710 --> 02:23.120
2040 and the second condition,

02:23.200 --> 02:25.940
you can define if it's AND or OR of course

02:26.200 --> 02:37.650
and if it is greater than let's say 1980 and let's apply that filter now and minimize that

02:38.160 --> 02:45.670
and if we now go back to our slicer and click to the right, we can see that we limited it to 2040 right

02:45.670 --> 02:46.350
here

02:46.720 --> 02:53.260
and if we click to the left, you can also see that we limited it to 1980 and the great thing right now

02:53.260 --> 02:59.560
is that if we go to the overview right here, the same thing happened with that slicer, although we didn't

02:59.560 --> 03:00.830
work on that page.

03:01.090 --> 03:07.330
But as you can see, if we now click right here, it is also limited back to our regions and age groups

03:07.330 --> 03:08.100
page

03:08.350 --> 03:10.790
and this was the report level filter now.

03:10.980 --> 03:17.530
So the important takeaway is if you set a filter like that, it is set for the entire report.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.780
Now let's take a look at the page level filter,

03:19.780 --> 03:21.070
this one right here.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.780
What would be a good page level filter,

03:23.950 --> 03:30.640
so a filter that only is active for the page where you decide that you want to have that filter,

03:30.700 --> 03:33.520
so in our case, this page?

03:33.520 --> 03:39.700
Now if I look at the overview page right here and at the right visualization, I think that we might

03:39.700 --> 03:46.120
want to exclude Oceania from our detailed analysis because it has the smallest population.

03:46.540 --> 03:53.440
If you want to do something like that, you can go back to the regions and age groups page and now say you

03:53.440 --> 04:00.970
want to filter the page level by selecting the region right here in the DIM-Region table, dragging it right

04:00.970 --> 04:05.230
there and now apply that basic filtering.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.680
So you could again choose the advanced filtering but we don't need that right here. If you now select all

04:10.690 --> 04:20.190
countries and now unselect Oceania and minimize that, then you can see that Oceania can no longer be

04:20.190 --> 04:22.120
selected in that region

04:22.120 --> 04:23.930
name slicer right here.

04:24.360 --> 04:30.900
If I go back to the overview page of course, like this, then Oceania is still here because the filter

04:31.050 --> 04:32.860
only applies to the page

04:32.940 --> 04:37.520
where you set the filter. So we have the report level filter,

04:37.670 --> 04:39.530
we have the page level filter,

04:39.620 --> 04:45.870
now we have to take a look at the last filter type, the visual level filter and I selected the treemap

04:45.890 --> 04:51.620
right now because I would like to limit the amount of countries displayed here to the top 10 countries.

04:52.560 --> 05:00.260
To do that, we select the visualization, go to the visualization columns and now we can see that we have

05:00.260 --> 05:02.110
already some filters right here

05:02.300 --> 05:04.130
but both are selected to all,

05:04.130 --> 05:07.720
so basically we don't filter anything at the moment

05:07.940 --> 05:15.730
and if you click on to that arrow right here, like that and don't apply that basic filtering and also not an

05:15.730 --> 05:22.060
advanced filtering but a top end filtering, like this, then just scrolling down,

05:22.240 --> 05:25.880
you can define if you want to see the top or the bottom.

05:25.900 --> 05:33.610
Now ok is the top and let's say 10, like this. The only thing you have to say now is what you want to

05:33.610 --> 05:34.560
see,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.580
so you want to see the top 10 countries,

05:36.580 --> 05:38.380
we know that but by what?

05:38.650 --> 05:44.890
So we need a value and this value in our case is the population again, so we can scroll down,

05:44.900 --> 05:46.090
we don't need to scroll down,

05:46.180 --> 05:51.480
we can simply select population right here and drag it to the value fields, like this.

05:51.590 --> 05:56.900
Now nothing changed, right, because we have to press Apply Filter right here.

05:57.290 --> 06:05.660
If we do that, we can now see that our treemap changed and only shows the top 10 countries and we can

06:05.660 --> 06:07.010
click for the regions of course

06:07.070 --> 06:11.100
and this changes dynamically which is really nice

06:11.090 --> 06:14.260
I think, let's click here.

06:14.470 --> 06:23.200
So we now talk about filters and we also created a new report page with some more visualizations. In

06:23.200 --> 06:24.580
the next two videos,

06:24.610 --> 06:28.110
I want to show you some more interesting visualizations.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.970
Let's start in the next video with cards.
