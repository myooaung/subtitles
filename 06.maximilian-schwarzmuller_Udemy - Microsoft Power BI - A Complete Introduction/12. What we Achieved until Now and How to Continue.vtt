00:02.580 --> 00:04.910
We made a great progress so far.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.840
We connected Power BI desktop to three csv files,

00:08.910 --> 00:14.900
we then worked on those three queries and we created a combined query out of those three queries.

00:15.090 --> 00:21.430
We kept on our work on that combined query, we wrote on columns, we defined data formats and a lot more.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.060
Now we could load that query,

00:24.060 --> 00:27.300
so that combined query into our data model now

00:27.720 --> 00:33.970
but wouldn't it be better if we would keep our work and try to shape that query a little bit more?

00:34.500 --> 00:41.200
And by shaping, I mean couldn't we turn it into a kind of a data model schema?

00:42.110 --> 00:46.990
Now what that means and what that is, let's learn that in the next video.
