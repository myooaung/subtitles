00:02.520 --> 00:09.620
We imported our data from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service, time to look at the datasets menu

00:09.630 --> 00:16.460
now. So I am still in my workspace and in the empty dashboard,

00:16.460 --> 00:22.260
this yellow indication right here by the way shows you in which menu you actually are at the moment.

00:22.340 --> 00:26.220
However, I don't want to look at that dashboard now, well because it's empty,

00:26.420 --> 00:28.970
I want to start at the dataset right here.

00:29.240 --> 00:35.780
So if you click on the name of the dataset that you want to select, this one, then you can see that this

00:35.780 --> 00:40.320
looks kind of the way we know it from Power BI Desktop, right?

00:40.400 --> 00:46.010
There is one important thing from the beginning, in Power BI service, we have two views,

00:46.010 --> 00:48.990
we have the reading you and the edit view.

00:49.340 --> 00:55.470
Well as you can imagine, at the moment we are in the edit view, so we can work on things and create visualizations

00:55.520 --> 01:01.620
for instance. If we change that from the edit view to the reading view right here,

01:01.640 --> 01:08.330
let me click that, then the menu changes and we cannot create any new visualizations of course because that's

01:08.330 --> 01:10.500
only, well the reading view.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.830
So we will start in the report view,

01:12.920 --> 01:15.590
so let's go back to edit report, right here.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.730
Now what can we see right here?

01:18.910 --> 01:21.790
Let's talk about the menu up here first.

01:22.060 --> 01:27.060
So if we click onto file, we can see that we can save this report or save a copy,

01:27.490 --> 01:28.410
that's fine.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.070
We have the view option,

01:30.340 --> 01:35.910
we know that from the desktop application, this view button, we click that already, let me click right here.

01:36.190 --> 01:39.620
We have the explore option, let me click right there,

01:39.850 --> 01:44.580
you know that, right? When we talked about the visualizations in the report view module,

01:44.620 --> 01:49.330
then we had that with our drill down options and the hierarchies that we enabled,

01:49.420 --> 01:58.130
so we have something like this also in here. We have text boxes, shapes, visual interactions, let's click on that,

01:58.820 --> 01:59.460
doesn't work.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.570
So those are the interactions,

02:00.590 --> 02:05.310
you know it's the same thing that's called edit interactions in the Power BI desktop application.

02:05.610 --> 02:06.660
We have refresh,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.080
we will learn how this works

02:08.120 --> 02:11.450
in this module. We can duplicate this page,

02:11.450 --> 02:12.440
we can save it

02:12.740 --> 02:17.600
and here, we have the analyse in Excel option which we won't use right now.

02:17.990 --> 02:21.070
So this is the basic menu in the edit view.

02:21.390 --> 02:25.430
Well and as we are in the edit view, let's maybe try what we can do right here.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.550
Let's maybe create a pie chart, like

02:28.560 --> 02:33.760
this, so this seems to work the same way we are used to it from Power BI desktop.

02:34.130 --> 02:39.920
So we put the visualization right here, open the FACT-Population table for instance

02:40.120 --> 02:48.730
and again use the population as a value and maybe the region in the DIM-Region table, right there for the

02:48.730 --> 02:49.480
details,

02:51.010 --> 02:52.290
like this.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.600
So we now created one visualization,

02:55.060 --> 02:56.660
let's create a second one.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.350
So let's take a bar chart

02:58.380 --> 03:02.950
maybe, let me unselect that first. Let's take the bar chart, put it right here

03:03.940 --> 03:06.020
and also increased the size a little bit

03:06.290 --> 03:13.420
and again, take that population as our most favorite value right here and now take the age group by category

03:13.850 --> 03:16.400
as a legend, like this.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.640
Not our most beautiful visualization but I think it's fine like that.

03:20.830 --> 03:26.120
So what did we do right now? We now created new visualizations.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.060
Well let's now change to report view and see what we can do.

03:30.310 --> 03:36.720
So if I click right here now, then Power BI asks me if I want to save the changes to this report.

03:36.910 --> 03:48.020
Well let's click save then, see what happens and let's call that test report, like this and press save. OK

03:48.200 --> 03:51.470
and where can we find that report now? Right here.

03:51.980 --> 03:54.210
So this is interesting, right?

03:54.330 --> 03:58.420
Power BI imports the dataset and the report

03:58.490 --> 04:02.690
but you can also create new reports in the edit view

04:02.810 --> 04:04.840
in the dataset section right here

04:04.880 --> 04:06.550
and then you have two reports.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.460
One was created in Power BI,

04:08.780 --> 04:13.230
the other one was created in the Power BI service application.

04:13.260 --> 04:18.560
Let's go back to the dataset then and now this dataset is gone,

04:18.970 --> 04:26.440
so this means this menu simply allows us to create new reports. As soon as we save the report, this menu

04:26.470 --> 04:29.150
is empty again, so we can create new data

04:29.350 --> 04:34.720
and if we want to edit our existing reports, so the ones we created before for instance, then we have to

04:34.720 --> 04:37.760
go to the report section right here.

04:38.030 --> 04:39.680
So this is it.

04:39.770 --> 04:42.110
This is what we can do right here,

04:42.140 --> 04:47.180
so let's then talk about the report view and also about the reading view in the report

04:47.170 --> 04:49.400
view of course in the next video.
