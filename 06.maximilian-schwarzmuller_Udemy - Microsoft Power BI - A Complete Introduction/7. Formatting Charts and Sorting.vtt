00:02.810 --> 00:05.810
Our visualizations keep improving,

00:05.810 --> 00:10.510
now it's time to take a look at the formatting options that we have.

00:10.530 --> 00:15.630
So before we start that video, let me make one quick note,

00:15.870 --> 00:21.380
I will not guide you through all of the formatting options you have for each of the different visualizations

00:21.420 --> 00:23.780
available in Power BI desktop,

00:24.150 --> 00:29.970
I just want to give you a basic overview so that you are able to find the formatting section and that

00:29.970 --> 00:33.040
you get a basic understanding of what you can do right there

00:33.540 --> 00:40.640
and then of course it's up to you to decide how you want to format your visualizations. Now after saying

00:40.640 --> 00:44.740
that, let's first select the line chart for instance.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.330
Now we know that fields area right here, 

00:47.360 --> 00:49.050
so in the visualizations column

00:49.370 --> 00:55.960
and if you now click onto that symbol right here, this is the formatting area, right here.

00:55.960 --> 01:04.280
Now one important thing maybe, if we now select the right visualization right there, like this, then the formatting

01:04.280 --> 01:06.080
options change.

01:06.080 --> 01:13.940
So this is not equal for all of the visualizations types but as we will now take a basic look at all those

01:13.940 --> 01:14.650
options,

01:14.780 --> 01:19.350
you will find yourself pretty comfortable with the other visualizations,

01:19.370 --> 01:22.770
now let's change back to the line chart right here.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.930
In that line chart, we can now see that the first option we have is the legend

01:29.360 --> 01:36.620
and if you change that from on to off by clicking right here, then you can see that the legend up here
 
01:36.770 --> 01:39.710
disappeared. If you turned it on again,

01:39.710 --> 01:41.370
it's back.

01:41.390 --> 01:46.490
Now let's say you want to have that legend but that you're not happy with the way it looks and the way

01:46.490 --> 01:49.090
it is displayed, to change that,

01:49.160 --> 01:55.190
you simply can click onto that arrow right here and now the first thing we can do is we can change

01:55.190 --> 01:56.130
the position.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.090
So now it is on top,

01:58.160 --> 02:07.680
we can change it to bottom for instance, to the right and many other positions just as we prefer.

02:07.950 --> 02:09.740
So let's change it back to top,

02:09.750 --> 02:11.330
I think this looks quite good,

02:11.490 --> 02:16.320
this. The next option is to decide if you want to have a title,

02:16.540 --> 02:17.720
so we got one,

02:18.100 --> 02:22.500
if you turn it off, region name is gone and back again.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.850
You can also define a title of that legend,

02:25.900 --> 02:28.510
So we will keep it with region name.

02:28.570 --> 02:31.160
We can change the color right here in that menu,

02:32.240 --> 02:40.150
we can close it and we can change the font size of the legend from 8 to, I think to keep it at 8,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.080
this looks better.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.860
As soon as you are done right here, you can close that by simply clicking onto that arrow.

02:47.220 --> 02:52.460
Now the next two options are the axis options and those are pretty comparable,

02:52.560 --> 02:56.540
so I would just take a quick look at the x-axis right now.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.430
So we now turn the x-axis on,

02:59.790 --> 03:03.760
if we turn it off, we don't see the years anymore.

03:03.900 --> 03:04.850
This is not good,

03:04.890 --> 03:09.960
so we should keep the years and turn it back on again, like this.

03:09.960 --> 03:17.280
If we open the menu now, you can see that you have various options on how to work with the x-axis,

03:17.280 --> 03:19.370
let me just show you one thing quickly.

03:19.770 --> 03:28.240
If you go to that start area and click right here and now write 2000 for instance, like this, then the

03:28.260 --> 03:33.780
visualization changed because it is now displayed starting in 2000.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.310
Now we don't want that,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.700
so we can delete that

03:37.410 --> 03:42.080
and now we can see that the visualization change back to the starting point,

03:42.120 --> 03:43.280
1950.

03:43.650 --> 03:46.150
So here you can find the axis options,

03:46.320 --> 03:52.980
let's also close that. Let's now see what else could we take a look at, well the data colors,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.260
this is pretty easy actually,

03:55.280 --> 04:01.640
you can simply open it and now change the color types of the different lines and of the legend,

04:01.760 --> 04:10.430
so for instance if we change Africa from that color to yellow, you can see that Africa changed the color

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
right here

04:11.780 --> 04:15.520
and in the line chart right there. We don't want that,

04:15.590 --> 04:19.720
so let's change it back to the initial color, like this,

04:20.030 --> 04:23.150
so we can close that now. The data labels,

04:23.240 --> 04:25.250
yes I think we should take a quick look at that,

04:25.400 --> 04:28.950
so if we turn it on, then we have data labels

04:29.300 --> 04:35.930
and if you open the menu, like this, you can again change the color and how it is displayed

04:37.050 --> 04:39.740
and maybe let's take a quick look at the density.

04:40.110 --> 04:48.840
So this is now at 50%, if I decrease it we have less labels, if I increase it we have more labels.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.470
Well we should keep it at 50%,

04:51.480 --> 04:53.560
so let's type 50 right here

04:53.970 --> 04:55.800
or actually we can turn it off,

04:55.950 --> 04:58.140
so let's do this right there and

04:59.220 --> 05:04.970
close that menu. Another thing that might be interesting to you are the shapes,

05:05.120 --> 05:12.890
so if open that, you can see that you can define, well the size of the line or the width of the line actually.

05:12.890 --> 05:19.640
So if I increase that, you can see it gets bigger, if I decrease that, it gets smaller, again

05:19.790 --> 05:21.910
we should keep it the way it is right now,

05:22.130 --> 05:28.580
so let's close that. And the next option I want to take a look at, as I said, I will not go through all

05:28.580 --> 05:32.700
of the options that we have right here is maybe the title, right here.

05:33.170 --> 05:36.310
If we turn the title off, then it's gone,

05:36.620 --> 05:38.900
if we turn it on, then it's here of course

05:39.290 --> 05:45.530
and if you open that menu, then you can define certain things about the title. The title name because

05:45.530 --> 05:48.820
this is a text that is set automatically by Power BI

05:49.070 --> 05:53.110
and we won't change it for the moment and you have the font color right here,

05:53.330 --> 05:59.330
so we could change that to white for instance but now we cannot see a lot in our visualization,

05:59.480 --> 06:05.880
so we should also add some background color, maybe black and change the alignment,

06:05.990 --> 06:07.610
so now it is aligned to the left,

06:07.790 --> 06:15.130
we could change it to the center, like this and we can also change the size of the title,

06:15.270 --> 06:17.950
maybe like this.

06:17.990 --> 06:19.000
Now this looks good,

06:19.070 --> 06:23.450
so let's close that menu and what else can I show you?

06:23.570 --> 06:28.090
Well maybe the background, at the moment we don't have any background.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.880
If we turn that on, you don't see a difference,

06:32.060 --> 06:33.460
let's see why this is not visible.

06:33.620 --> 06:36.930
So we click right here, scroll down a little bit,

06:37.310 --> 06:42.560
well you can see that we have the color set to white and this is why we cannot see any background right

06:42.560 --> 06:43.220
now.

06:43.640 --> 06:49.340
If we changed that to this dark gray for instance, then we have a background color and here we can play

06:49.340 --> 06:51.300
around with the transparency.

06:51.650 --> 06:57.170
To be honest, I don't want to have a background color in our report so we can turn it off right here

06:57.620 --> 06:59.180
and close that.

06:59.390 --> 07:06.700
Now the last thing I want to show you is that border option down here. If we turn that on, you can see

07:06.800 --> 07:13.010
if we unselect that visualization quickly that we now have that little border around our visualization

07:13.270 --> 07:21.630
and if we click that again, go to the formatting menu, scroll down, open that menu, then we can define the color

07:21.630 --> 07:22.650
of that border,

07:22.860 --> 07:26.410
so we will keep it black because I think this looks good.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.810
So let's now close that also.

07:30.150 --> 07:37.060
So now we formatted our left visualization and we can click onto the report right here.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.170
Now that we did that,

07:39.210 --> 07:43.730
what if you want to have the same formatting style to that right visualization?

07:43.890 --> 07:44.550
You could of course

07:44.550 --> 07:45.290
click here,

07:46.220 --> 07:49.980
go to the format menu and also adjust the title and the border

07:49.980 --> 07:55.070
in our case. One option but not a really comfortable option I would say,

07:55.340 --> 08:03.140
so we won't do that but if we select our left visualization, so the formatted visualization and go to

08:03.140 --> 08:11.090
the home ribbon and now select the format painter right here, click that like this and now move that

08:11.090 --> 08:14.050
format painter to the other visualization

08:14.270 --> 08:16.870
and simply click right there,

08:17.180 --> 08:22.230
then you can see that the format was applied also to the second visualization

08:22.280 --> 08:28.280
and if you click right here, you can see that this also looks nice right now.

08:28.520 --> 08:33.760
The only thing that doesn't look nice right now is that sorting in the right visualization

08:34.010 --> 08:40.880
because I would prefer that we can see the different columns sorted by the size of the population and

08:40.880 --> 08:43.460
not alphabetically by the name of the region.

08:43.970 --> 08:50.150
Now to change that, you will select a visualization, something I just did and now in the right part, right

08:50.150 --> 08:50.700
here,

08:50.850 --> 08:58.420
if you click there, you have more options and the sort by population option can be found right there.

08:58.940 --> 09:06.350
If you click that, then you can see that our data are now sorted differently,

09:06.400 --> 09:08.890
so from large to small,

09:08.890 --> 09:09.810
that's nice,

09:09.880 --> 09:16.780
so we can click right here. Now that we have an overview of the formatting options in Power BI desktop,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.450
I think it's time to learn some new visualizations

09:21.640 --> 09:27.460
and we talked about the interactions before and about interactivity in general.

09:27.580 --> 09:34.000
Maybe there is one visualization type that helps us to make our reports even more interactive,

09:34.420 --> 09:37.190
let's learn what that is in the next video.
