WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:08.370
So we are now ready to load the data from our query editor into the data model

00:08.670 --> 00:11.330
but there is something that we have to understand,

00:11.550 --> 00:12.800
let's see what that is.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.770
So this is our current situation,

00:15.860 --> 00:22.070
we have our 10 queries in the left column and we have that data model queries, so in the data model

00:22.070 --> 00:22.890
group,

00:22.970 --> 00:27.270
so those are actually the queries that we only want to have in our data model,

00:27.270 --> 00:27.980
right.

00:28.340 --> 00:29.560
Let's keep that in mind

00:29.630 --> 00:35.810
but for the moment, we will simply load all of the queries into our data model. To do that,

00:35.810 --> 00:38.590
we simply press close and apply up here

00:38.900 --> 00:44.210
So we are in the actual data model now and you can see that easily because we have those three ribbons,

00:44.210 --> 00:51.800
so the report view, that data view and the relationship view. Now in the right column in that fields column,

00:52.070 --> 00:59.110
you can see that all the queries we had in our query editor were loaded as tables into our data model

00:59.630 --> 01:05.780
and I don't think this is really good to be honest because actually, we only need the two DIM tables and

01:05.780 --> 01:12.680
the FACT table as important tables or as the tables that we cleaned and shaped and the other tables are

01:12.700 --> 01:16.010
just supporting those three tables.

01:16.010 --> 01:21.710
The same thing is true if we go into the data view for instance, here we also have all the tables that we

01:21.710 --> 01:24.310
created in the query editor,

01:24.350 --> 01:31.730
so wouldn't it be great if we would have an options on how to kind of unhide or kind of make those

01:31.730 --> 01:38.270
tables invisible in the data view and in the report view or in the data model in general?

01:38.270 --> 01:42.160
The good thing is that we have two options on how we can do that

01:42.410 --> 01:48.920
but before we start taking a look at these options, let's first go to the file location of our project

01:49.220 --> 01:51.660
and take a look at the project size,

01:51.830 --> 01:53.430
let's do that.

01:53.450 --> 01:57.290
So here I am in the location of the Power BI file

01:57.290 --> 01:58.730
we are working at the moment,

01:58.730 --> 02:00.800
this is the last file right here

02:00.800 --> 02:04.890
and if you look at the file size, you can see that this is quite huge,

02:04.910 --> 02:06.970
it has 46 megabytes.

02:07.010 --> 02:09.510
Now keep that number in mind,

02:09.950 --> 02:11.510
let's go back to a project now.

02:12.820 --> 02:19.060
So the first thing we can do is we can right-click on to the table up here and press hide in report

02:19.150 --> 02:23.280
view and let's do the same thing for all of the other tables,

02:23.380 --> 02:29.500
so this means for all of the tables except for the DIM table and the FACT table, let's right-click here

02:29.890 --> 02:37.120
and there and there, this one, that one

02:37.470 --> 02:39.660
and the final one, like this.

02:39.990 --> 02:42.280
So we now selected that

02:42.300 --> 02:50.550
and if we now go back to the report view, we can see that only the tables that we didn't unhide are visible.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.900
So this is at least one step towards what we want

02:53.900 --> 02:55.020
actually, right?

02:55.070 --> 03:01.010
Because if somebody wants to work in the report view now, he can only see those three relevant tables.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.950
Now this is good but there are two disadvantages regarding that option,

03:05.990 --> 03:11.490
the first one, you already saw. If you go back to the data view, then we can see that

03:11.540 --> 03:12.300
well yes

03:12.320 --> 03:18.030
the other tables are in a different color but they are still visible and you can even click on them.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.500
So this is one disadvantage, right?

03:20.660 --> 03:24.200
The model is not really clean by using this option

03:24.560 --> 03:31.580
and the second disadvantage becomes evident if we save that first and now go back to the project location

03:32.120 --> 03:34.810
and right here you can see that the file size,

03:34.850 --> 03:36.830
well it didn't change right,

03:36.890 --> 03:41.600
so we still have that big file although we hid some tables.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.370
So maybe that's not the best option on how we can do that,

03:45.410 --> 03:51.010
let's go back to a project and unhide all of the tables. Back in the project

03:51.170 --> 03:58.040
and if we now simply right-click onto one of the hidden tables and press unhide all, then we can see,

03:58.040 --> 04:02.690
let me just close the table by the way, that all of the tables are back again

04:02.690 --> 04:06.310
and also in the report view. So hiding didn't work,

04:06.590 --> 04:10.910
let's go back to the query editor and see what other option we might have.

04:11.330 --> 04:17.240
So we click right here and now we are, well I would say back home, right

04:17.540 --> 04:24.920
and as we know that environment, we can now go to the queries column and right-click onto one of those

04:24.920 --> 04:30.810
queries, like this and here you can find that enable load option,

04:31.170 --> 04:33.970
let's see what that is.

04:33.980 --> 04:36.280
So we saw that enable load option

04:36.380 --> 04:40.990
and to understand that, we simply have to understand that illustration.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.600
So this is where we started,

04:42.710 --> 04:48.530
we have some source files, some csv files for instance in our case and what we did then is that

04:48.560 --> 04:55.790
we imported the data and by importing data, I don't mean loading the data from the query editor into the data

04:55.790 --> 04:58.430
model but simply creating that queries,

04:58.460 --> 05:02.030
so that connection from the query editor to the source file.

05:02.090 --> 05:09.500
So we have that queries and we are in the query editor to prepare that data and the current setting is that

05:09.860 --> 05:11.030
it's default,

05:11.030 --> 05:14.730
this means we enable the load for all queries

05:14.930 --> 05:22.040
and what this means is the following. As we enable the load for all queries, all of the queries

05:22.130 --> 05:29.080
and by that, all of the information is loaded into the data model and here you can see data view and report view,

05:29.240 --> 05:31.150
this is also true for the relationship

05:31.150 --> 05:35.120
view of course but we will talk about the relationship view in the next module,

05:35.120 --> 05:37.440
this is why you cannot see that right here.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.820
So this is one option and this was the option that we just saw

05:41.360 --> 05:46.840
but there is a second option and it has to do with that enable load button that we just saw,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.190
let's take a look.

05:48.560 --> 05:55.550
So again, we have Query 1 and Query 2 and we load the data from the source file to the query editor

05:55.880 --> 06:03.020
but now there is a difference because now we enable the load only for selected queries, for instance

06:03.020 --> 06:04.250
for Query 1

06:04.910 --> 06:11.780
and what is happening then is the following. We only load Query 1 into our data model,

06:11.840 --> 06:17.480
this means only the loaded queries are visible or these queries our tables in the data model actually,

06:17.870 --> 06:21.140
only these tables are then visible in the data model

06:21.260 --> 06:29.220
if they were selected as enable load. If you unable the enable load option, then you won't see the data,

06:29.340 --> 06:35.770
you won't see the information and by that, this won't consume any memory of your data model

06:36.060 --> 06:40.860
and this makes this approach easier to handle because you only have the information in the data model

06:41.070 --> 06:44.900
that you want to have and it consumes less memory.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.990
So this is what we could do right now

06:47.070 --> 06:50.910
and let's see how this works in our project.

06:50.910 --> 06:58.470
So we now have to unable the load option for all the queries that we don't need in the data model

06:58.470 --> 07:00.710
and this is true for all of the initial queries.

07:00.810 --> 07:07.920
So we simply right-click right here and press the enable load button and now we have that possible data loss

07:07.920 --> 07:08.840
warning,

07:08.850 --> 07:10.220
why is this appearing?

07:10.350 --> 07:17.490
Well if you would imagine that you would create a visualization that is based on information in that specific

07:17.490 --> 07:25.050
query and if you would then unable the load of that query and by that, unable the ability to load the information

07:25.050 --> 07:27.010
of the query into the data model,

07:27.060 --> 07:31.870
well then there wouldn't be anything to visualize for the chart

07:31.920 --> 07:33.640
and by that, it would be empty

07:33.810 --> 07:38.750
and this is why you get that warning. As we won't create any visuals based on that query,

07:38.820 --> 07:42.050
we can simply ignore that for the moment and press continue,

07:42.940 --> 07:51.300
select the second query and do the same thing, also for the third query, like this. I won't do it for the

07:51.300 --> 07:52.150
population combined

07:52.150 --> 07:55.380
query right now, just in a few seconds because I have to tell you why

07:55.380 --> 07:56.090
we can also

07:56.130 --> 07:57.870
unable the load for that query.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.500
So let's do it for that queries down here

08:02.300 --> 08:05.870
and right there and for the last one.

08:07.820 --> 08:13.570
Now let's go back to the population combined query, we can also unable the load right here

08:13.790 --> 08:15.100
and why is this possible?

08:15.290 --> 08:17.990
Well the reason is quite simple.

08:17.990 --> 08:25.130
We created a reference to that query for our data model queries and if we now unable the load for

08:25.160 --> 08:31.420
this query, what simply will happen is that if we would update the queries, this query would update

08:31.430 --> 08:32.590
of course

08:32.590 --> 08:41.150
and as our data queries refer to that updated query, our data model would also be updated but the

08:41.540 --> 08:42.670
data model queries,

08:42.710 --> 08:46.040
so those three right here are in the actual data model.

08:46.160 --> 08:51.860
So we have the connection to the data model because we have those three queries loaded and we made sure

08:52.040 --> 08:54.390
that we always have the latest version of our queries

08:54.500 --> 08:59.860
because of the population combined queries but in total, we can unselect a load right here.

08:59.870 --> 09:05.780
So let me right-click and press unable load, like this. This is it,

09:05.900 --> 09:12.450
we now make sure that we only load the relevant information into our data model. To do this,

09:12.500 --> 09:19.520
we can now press close and apply, wait a few seconds and now we see that we only have have the three tables

09:19.520 --> 09:26.150
that we want in our data model and the great thing is that the same thing is true for the data view,

09:26.330 --> 09:29.380
we only have those three tables.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.740
This is great

09:30.920 --> 09:39.170
and if we now save that by clicking the save button and go back to our folder, then we can see that the

09:39.170 --> 09:40.570
file size reduced

09:40.570 --> 09:47.720
from, I think it was about 46 megabytes to 10 megabytes and we don't have any disadvantage because as

09:47.720 --> 09:54.980
I explained, we still made sure that we have the most recent version of our queries in our population

09:54.980 --> 10:01.940
combined query and our data model data refer to that population combined query in the query editor.

10:01.970 --> 10:07.760
This means we have made sure that we have the latest version of the data but only the relevant data

10:07.880 --> 10:09.540
in our data model.

10:09.540 --> 10:15.290
Now let's go back to our project and actually we are done now. There are only two more things that we

10:15.290 --> 10:17.060
have to talk about,

10:17.150 --> 10:23.120
the first thing is that we have to summarize what we actually learned and let's summarize that in the

10:23.120 --> 10:23.990
next video.
