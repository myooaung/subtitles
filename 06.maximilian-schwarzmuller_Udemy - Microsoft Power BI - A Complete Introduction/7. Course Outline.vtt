Now that Manuel walked you through the basic building blocks of Power BI - how is this course structured,

1
00:07.130 --> 00:11.360
what does this course have to offer for you and which part will be done by Manuel

2
00:11.390 --> 00:13.470
and which parts will be done by me?

3
00:13.800 --> 00:19.340
Well right now, we're still in the welcome and first steps part, we're getting started but we're almost done.

4
00:19.840 --> 00:24.700
Thereafter, we'll have a look at Power BI Desktop in detail.

5
00:24.700 --> 00:25.880
So how does it work,

6
00:25.880 --> 00:27.480
what does this tool offer,

7
00:27.590 --> 00:34.070
before we then dive into the query editor - in Power BI Desktop still, how can we query data, how can we import

8
00:34.070 --> 00:40.550
data and how can we manipulate or structure the data when importing it? We'll then I will look at the

9
00:40.550 --> 00:46.330
data view, the data view allows us to still work with our data but not in the import step,

10
00:46.340 --> 00:53.240
but after we import it so that we structure the data or manipulate it, model it to our needs.

11
00:53.480 --> 00:59.510
Once we have the data in the structure, the format and the way we want to use it, we can move on and we

12
00:59.510 --> 01:06.920
can have a look at the report view and we will. This report view will then allow you to well, output reports

13
01:06.920 --> 01:12.950
with tables, with visuals, with measures as you will learn, so single values for example you can output

14
01:13.330 --> 01:18.860
and that is of course the thing which is most interesting to your executives or things like that where

15
01:18.860 --> 01:24.490
you present your data, where you create nice reports with the key results of your data.

16
01:24.980 --> 01:30.830
Thereafter we'll have a look at the other parts of the Power BI universe. As Manuel mentioned,

17
01:30.890 --> 01:35.710
it's not just part of the Power BI Desktop, it's Power BI Service and Mobile too.

18
01:35.780 --> 01:37.630
So how can you collaborate on your data,

19
01:37.640 --> 01:42.380
how can you share it with others and how can you access it from mobile devices?

20
01:42.530 --> 01:45.910
Now up to this point, everything will have been done by Manuel.

21
01:45.930 --> 01:52.490
Now I will create my first module or show my first module. In the other data sources module, I'll have

22
01:52.490 --> 01:58.550
a look at some other data sources than the data sources used so far in the course. Manuel will mainly

23
01:58.550 --> 02:01.760
work with a CSV files since it's a very common data source

24
02:01.910 --> 02:08.180
but I will then also show you how to work with .json, data from RESTful webservices and mySQL or in

25
02:08.300 --> 02:13.810
general, SQL databases. Thereafter, another module done by me,

26
02:14.030 --> 02:17.570
I'll have a look at how you can create your own custom visuals,

27
02:17.600 --> 02:24.660
so that is custom charts basically you could say for Power BI. Here we will learn how that works,

28
02:24.680 --> 02:30.590
you will need a bit of programming knowledge for that though so that is certainly required or at least

29
02:30.590 --> 02:31.960
the willingness to learn it

30
02:32.090 --> 02:38.100
but with that, you've got a powerful tool of really customizing Power BI to your needs and creating the exact

31
02:38.150 --> 02:44.990
chart or visual in general you need. Well and after we had a look at this, Manuel will take over again

32
02:44.990 --> 02:50.330
and do the round up of the course giving you a brief overview of what you learned and how you progressed

33
02:50.330 --> 02:51.660
through the course.

34
02:51.680 --> 02:59.480
So a lot of great content walking you from A to Z through Power BI and giving you a very complete introduction

35
02:59.540 --> 03:00.160
to it.
