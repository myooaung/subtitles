00:03.020 --> 00:06.020
We talked about the dataset menu,

00:06.050 --> 00:11.830
now it's time to take a closer look at what we can do with the report in Power BI service.

00:12.020 --> 00:18.640
So I am still in the dataset menu and I will now change to our tests report that we created,

00:18.860 --> 00:24.080
so I click right here and now this looks different,

00:24.080 --> 00:30.370
right? Now the interface is darker and this doesn't look the way it looked like in the dataset.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.910
Well the reason is simple, we simply are in the reading mode now,

00:35.210 --> 00:39.250
if we click right here onto edit report, then we are back

00:39.530 --> 00:49.870
and then we can change that report and make it smaller maybe, like this and add a third visualization.

00:49.910 --> 00:52.540
Let's maybe add a line chart then, like this,

00:55.980 --> 00:58.610
like this, right

00:58.780 --> 01:07.110
and again maybe this time at the female population as a value and for the different years as an axis,

01:07.650 --> 01:11.070
like this. We got that, so we can click right here.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.430
So this is what we can do right here,

01:13.710 --> 01:20.280
as we said we can use the dataset menu to create new reports and we can then work on these new reports

01:20.520 --> 01:24.190
just the way we're used to it in Power BI desktop.

01:24.210 --> 01:30.240
The important difference right here is that in Power BI Desktop, we were really able to create this initial

01:30.240 --> 01:31.100
dataset,

01:31.140 --> 01:37.140
so the base for this report and this is something, well you shouldn't do that in Power BI Service or you

01:37.140 --> 01:41.510
can't even do that to the amount you're able to do it in Power BI Desktop.

01:41.970 --> 01:48.870
So this is why you have to make sure that you create your datasets in Power BI Desktop, as soon as they

01:48.870 --> 01:54.780
are ready and as soon as you created your report also, you can simply import it to Power BI service and then

01:54.780 --> 01:58.680
work on your report. I'll create new reports,

01:58.680 --> 02:04.100
that's how this kind of work, so this connection between this dataset menu and this reports menu.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.650
However we are still in our report right here

02:08.220 --> 02:13.070
and I think the options here are clear for you because those are basically the same that we have in

02:13.080 --> 02:14.460
Power BI Desktop,

02:14.490 --> 02:21.320
the only thing that we didn't have a look at so far is the reading view. Now the reading view can be found right

02:21.320 --> 02:22.400
here.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.170
If we click here,

02:24.250 --> 02:29.050
yes we want to save the changes of course, then it changes to the reading view,

02:29.160 --> 02:32.050
you can close that. Now in the reading view,

02:32.080 --> 02:34.650
we have different options first up here.

02:35.140 --> 02:37.580
Let's take a look at those options.

02:37.630 --> 02:40.360
So the first option is the file option,

02:40.420 --> 02:47.590
again we can save it but we can also print the report or download the report and we can publish it to

02:47.590 --> 02:48.940
the web.

02:49.130 --> 02:53.790
Now we will have a look at some of those options in the sharing part of this module,

02:53.870 --> 02:58.630
for now we just have to know that we can do something with that in that menu,

02:58.970 --> 03:00.920
let's close that,

03:01.110 --> 03:02.240
whoops, sorry.

03:02.620 --> 03:03.530
Now we are here.

03:03.860 --> 03:09.530
So in the view section, let's click that, well we have that fit to page, fit to width, you know that

03:09.560 --> 03:13.990
so we don't have to use that, added report is clear, explore

03:14.030 --> 03:15.370
is the same logic we have,

03:15.410 --> 03:19.070
we don't have any hierarchies right here, so we cannot change anything right there.

03:20.390 --> 03:25.820
We have that refresh button, maybe let's click that, nothing works,

03:25.820 --> 03:30.410
if we go back to the edit report view maybe and click onto refresh right here, let's see what happens

03:30.410 --> 03:30.920
then,

03:32.210 --> 03:34.480
nothing, doesn't seem to work at the moment.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.440
We will talk about that later.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.190
So let's go back to the reading view

03:38.970 --> 03:42.990
and now we have that pin live page option,

03:43.350 --> 03:45.470
let's click that simply right and see what happens.

03:48.040 --> 03:53.480
Now we can decide if we want to create a dashboard with those visuals,

03:53.810 --> 03:55.340
that's interesting, right?

03:55.340 --> 04:08.230
So let's create a new dashboard and name it test-dashboard, like this and press pin live. Let's

04:08.260 --> 04:12.560
close that, we know that and now we can see the dashboard right here.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.090
So this is the next step.

04:15.220 --> 04:23.300
We used the dataset to create our new report and then we can pin that whole report to a new dashboard

04:23.340 --> 04:26.060
but what sense would that make,

04:26.170 --> 04:27.890
why do we need that report then?

04:28.270 --> 04:33.070
Well the reason is that you don't have to pin the anti-visualization,

04:33.070 --> 04:35.890
you can also pin single visualizations,

04:35.890 --> 04:41.890
so if you would have a report with multiple pages, then you can simply select only the visualizations

04:42.070 --> 04:44.040
that you want to have in your dashboard.

04:44.230 --> 04:49.450
So if you have three pages with 10 visualizations, you might only want to have three visualizations

04:49.660 --> 04:54.610
in your dashboard actually and that's why this pinning feature and by that, the creating dashboard

04:54.610 --> 04:56.640
feature is really great.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.600
Let's try that with our chart right here.

04:59.710 --> 05:05.350
If you look right here, you'll find this pin symbol and now you don't pin the live page, you pin the

05:05.410 --> 05:06.760
visualizations,

05:06.760 --> 05:10.980
so if you click right here, we are again asked where we want to pin that to

05:11.320 --> 05:14.660
and I will select a new dashboard again right here

05:14.740 --> 05:23.530
and now let's call this test-dashboard-visual, like this

05:23.530 --> 05:32.730
and if you press pin right now and close that, then we can see that we created a second dashboard, now only with

05:32.730 --> 05:35.130
that single visualization.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.790
We will of course look at that dashboard in a few minutes.

05:38.820 --> 05:44.210
So this is it. In the reading view, we can decide what pages we want to pin,

05:44.460 --> 05:47.120
we can also do that in the edit view of course.

05:47.610 --> 05:53.520
So this pin function allows us to decide what our dashboards should look like,

05:53.540 --> 05:55.380
now this is good.

05:55.410 --> 05:57.620
So this was the report we created,

05:57.630 --> 06:03.720
let's now take a quick look at our initial report that we created in Power BI Desktop, right here

06:03.910 --> 06:11.090
and of course you can click through the pages, like this, like that and like that and we could pin a visual.

06:11.300 --> 06:15.630
Let's maybe also pin one visual right here, for instance this one,

06:16.010 --> 06:23.050
so we simply click right here, press pin visual and now we pin it to an existing dashboard,

06:23.150 --> 06:29.450
so to our empty dashboard of the project that was automatically created when we use the getData function

06:29.570 --> 06:33.460
to import the data from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.750
Now let's press pin right here and see what happens,

06:37.660 --> 06:41.490
close it, nothing changed apparently

06:41.810 --> 06:48.490
but it should have changed because this treemap chart should now be in our dashboard of our report.

06:48.690 --> 06:52.920
Now this is the basic overview of the report section,

06:52.920 --> 06:54.870
now we talked about dashboards a lot,

06:55.140 --> 06:58.190
I think it's time to look at that dashboards finally.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.510
Let's do that in the next video.
