00:02.570 --> 00:06.360
We finished our first dimension table, the DIM-Region table,

00:06.650 --> 00:12.050
now before we continue, let's take a quick look at what else we have to do to finish our star scheme

00:12.050 --> 00:13.680
for the data model.

00:14.180 --> 00:20.230
So we finished the left table, the DIM table region, we have the country ID, we have the country and the region,

00:20.300 --> 00:22.800
so this is fine. In the next videos,

00:22.880 --> 00:30.050
we will talk about the right table, the DIM table age or the DIM table age groups as we want to call it. In this

00:30.050 --> 00:30.600
table

00:30.620 --> 00:36.830
we want to have theee things. We want to have the AgeGroup-ID, something we don't have at the moment, we want

00:36.830 --> 00:38.120
to have the Age-Group,

00:38.120 --> 00:42.730
so this is the information we have at the moment and we want to have a category

00:42.740 --> 00:45.060
and like I said in the beginning, that baby,

00:45.080 --> 00:51.710
adult and so on and the last step will be that FACT table in the middle which kind of combines information

00:51.740 --> 00:54.500
of the two DIM tables that we created.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.830
However in the next videos, let's focus on the DIM table age,

00:59.150 --> 01:01.930
let's start creating that table in the next video.
