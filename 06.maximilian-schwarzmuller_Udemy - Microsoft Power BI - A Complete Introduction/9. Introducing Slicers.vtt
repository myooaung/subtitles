00:02.850 --> 00:04.930
We want to add a slicer,

00:05.270 --> 00:06.190
let's do that.

00:07.440 --> 00:13.430
So we talked about interactivity and at the moment, we can click into our visualizations

00:13.560 --> 00:22.020
but I want to have more and to get more, I will simply add a slicer and instead of talking about the

00:22.020 --> 00:24.900
slicer, let's simply create one.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.120
Now you can find the slicer visualization in the visualizations column right here.

00:31.140 --> 00:36.330
If you click that, you'll find a slicer and you can position it right here,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.110
whoops, and right there,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.140
so I would like to have it like this,

00:41.160 --> 00:47.340
you can also position it vertically or as you prefer but I like that horizontal orientation in that case.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.720
So now we have that slicer

00:50.310 --> 00:57.740
and the interesting thing is that in the fields area right here, you can see that we only have one data

00:57.740 --> 01:00.410
field that we should drag right here.

01:00.410 --> 01:06.710
Now why don't we just use the years? Let's do that and open the FACT-Population table,

01:07.660 --> 01:11.850
go to year and drag the year right there.

01:11.910 --> 01:15.300
Now we cannot see a lot in that slicer at the moment,

01:15.570 --> 01:18.850
so we have to go to the formatting options quickly, right here,

01:19.820 --> 01:24.750
go to general and change the orientation, right there.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.580
So we change it from vertical to horizontal.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.170
Now we still cannot see a lot right,

01:32.320 --> 01:35.780
let's maybe increase the size a little bit.

01:36.070 --> 01:38.390
Now we can see what we have right there,

01:38.650 --> 01:43.900
let me just click onto that visualization, drag that down and onto that one,

01:44.030 --> 01:45.060
also drag that down

01:45.930 --> 01:48.330
and put that to the top.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.660
Now you can see what the slicer does, right?

01:51.800 --> 01:58.720
We now have an overview or a list actually of all the years we have data for in our dataset

01:58.860 --> 02:00.900
but what does this mean for us?

02:00.900 --> 02:08.060
So we can scroll through that right here and we could for instance select 2017, like this

02:08.380 --> 02:16.210
and now it gets interesting right, because now we are able to select the population data for a specific

02:16.210 --> 02:17.200
year

02:17.650 --> 02:22.450
and additionally the other visualizations react on what we did right here.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.410
We know that this is happening because of the interaction settings

02:25.480 --> 02:28.470
but nevertheless, this is really awesome, right?

02:28.810 --> 02:33.960
So what if I want to select 2018, then it selects 2018,

02:33.970 --> 02:34.820
this is nice

02:35.840 --> 02:39.340
and we can now click through all of the years just as we prefer.

02:39.890 --> 02:46.420
However there are two more options that we should take a look at regarding that slicer. The first thing

02:46.420 --> 02:54.200
is if we go to the formatting area right here and to selection controls, the select all option, this

02:54.200 --> 02:55.750
is off at the moment.

02:56.290 --> 02:59.190
If we turn that on like this,

02:59.560 --> 03:01.330
nothing changed, right?

03:01.330 --> 03:02.020
Not true.

03:02.110 --> 03:08.530
If we go to the beginning of that list by clicking on the arrow right here and maybe increasing the size

03:08.530 --> 03:09.120
again,

03:09.550 --> 03:13.180
then we can find that select all button.

03:13.220 --> 03:22.850
Now if we click that, we selected all of the data that we have, if we click it again, nothing changed, again,

03:23.450 --> 03:25.310
no, nothing changes.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.530
Now what's the difference?

03:26.840 --> 03:33.230
Well in that case, we selected all of the information and if we click onto one of the years like this,

03:34.340 --> 03:39.730
this year is not any more displayed in that sum of the data we have right here,

03:39.800 --> 03:43.880
so we now excluded those five years. The other way around

03:43.890 --> 03:47.310
if we click select all again, now we selected nothing,

03:47.310 --> 03:51.770
so this means at the moment we have all the data here in our visualization

03:51.900 --> 03:56.910
and if I select one year, we only see that single year and if I click right here,

03:56.940 --> 03:59.410
we only see this year, that year.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.830
So that's the difference that we have right now

04:01.920 --> 04:11.180
when we press onto that select all button. The second option is that single selection option, let's see

04:11.210 --> 04:12.290
what that is,

04:12.290 --> 04:13.920
so we turn it off right now

04:15.080 --> 04:17.980
and now we selected 1966.

04:17.990 --> 04:21.010
So if I now select 1967,

04:21.440 --> 04:27.440
now we can select multiple years in that slicer, so we now selected those five years.

04:27.470 --> 04:34.750
If I press select all again, we can now also unselect various years, just the way we had it before.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.180
There wasn't a difference, right?

04:37.200 --> 04:41.160
If I turn it on again, the same selection and now press right here,

04:41.460 --> 04:43.290
this is the same behavior

04:43.520 --> 04:50.670
but if I now go back to the select all button, like this, now select one year,

04:50.680 --> 04:52.480
we have the single selection back again

04:52.870 --> 04:56.770
and if I turn that off, then we can select multiple years.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.010
So that's the difference,

04:58.150 --> 05:02.570
it mainly has an impact in this kind of visualization,

05:02.590 --> 05:08.600
so if we selected none of the years and then we can decide how we can select the years.

05:08.650 --> 05:12.160
The last thing that we might want to change is that we might want to get rid of that year right

05:12.160 --> 05:16.370
here because it's a redundant information actually. To do this,

05:16.450 --> 05:20.410
we simply go to the format area, go to header and turn it off

05:20.680 --> 05:22.970
and now we have more space for our years.

05:23.020 --> 05:29.550
Let's maybe format that, like that, perfect and now we can select everything again if we want to

05:29.790 --> 05:32.750
or like this maybe, nice.

05:33.200 --> 05:39.440
So now we have that slicer and we know how this works and we see that it's really a great addition to

05:39.470 --> 05:42.690
our current visualizations.

05:42.780 --> 05:47.640
Now let's create some more visualization with the slicers and see what we can do with that

05:48.030 --> 05:50.230
and we will do that in the next video.
