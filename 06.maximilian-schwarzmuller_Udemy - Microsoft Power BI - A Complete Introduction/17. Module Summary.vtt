You finished this module, really great. We now have an understanding of why we need the data

00:09.270 --> 00:15.910
model and why it is different to the query editor, so to our data preparation module that we had before.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.880
We also learned what relationships are, why they are important and how we can use them in our data model.

00:23.370 --> 00:30.540
Additionally we talked about the DAX, the Data Analysis Expressions. We learned what these basically are,

00:30.930 --> 00:38.190
what calculated columns are and what measures are. Now that we are done with our data model, it's time

00:38.190 --> 00:40.340
to continue with the report

00:40.860 --> 00:44.160
and in that report, we want to create some nice visualizations now.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.710
Now before we do that in the next module, it's time for our second assignment.

00:49.980 --> 00:50.960
See you there.
