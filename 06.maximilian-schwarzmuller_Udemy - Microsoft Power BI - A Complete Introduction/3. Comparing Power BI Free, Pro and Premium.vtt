00:02.700 --> 00:05.170
So we have different Power BI versions,

00:05.340 --> 00:07.650
let's take a look at those.

00:07.700 --> 00:17.950
So we have some changes in 2017 and this changes look like that, until the 31st of May,

00:17.980 --> 00:22.280
the situation was like that. We had Power BI free,

00:22.540 --> 00:23.370
so this is the

00:23.360 --> 00:28.390
version you simply get when you login to the Power BI service or when you download the desktop application without

00:28.420 --> 00:29.080
paying,

00:29.080 --> 00:31.220
that's why it's called Power BI free of course

00:31.540 --> 00:37.550
and we have Power BI pro, a version with additional capabilities which you have to pay for.

00:37.600 --> 00:44.230
The main difference is that Power BI free is meant to be for personal users. If you want to collaborate

00:44.230 --> 00:48.550
with other people and have increased sharing capabilities,

00:48.550 --> 00:50.830
then you have to use Power BI pro.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.850
That's what it was until the 31st of May.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.460
Now we had some changes.

00:56.830 --> 01:01.630
The changes took place starting on the 1st of June 2017.

01:01.660 --> 01:10.150
These changes mainly affect Power BI free because Power BI free got more pro features, like access

01:10.150 --> 01:17.300
to all pro databases, so the connections, increased workspace storage and improved refresh rates.

01:17.350 --> 01:19.460
The goal of that was the following,

01:19.720 --> 01:26.940
the Power BI free and the pro obligation should be aligned in terms of the general functionalities

01:27.190 --> 01:28.840
but let me talk about the target group,

01:28.850 --> 01:30.320
they should stay the same,

01:30.390 --> 01:37.510
so Power BI free is still meant for personal users and Power BI pro has enhanced sharing features because

01:37.510 --> 01:40.220
it's meant for collaboration in organizations.

01:40.270 --> 01:41.630
So those are two versions

01:42.040 --> 01:48.210
but in June 2016, we have another new feature and this is Power BI premium.

01:48.610 --> 01:56.230
Now Power BI premium is meant to be for large scale BI deployments, so a topic we will not talk about in

01:56.230 --> 01:57.850
that course.

01:57.910 --> 02:05.080
This course focuses on Power BI pro, so whenever I will use a feature that requires Power BI pro,

02:05.280 --> 02:07.320
you will see that in that module.

02:07.450 --> 02:13.830
However if you don't have Power BI pro, you can get a 60 days free trial of it to make sure that

02:13.830 --> 02:17.980
you can apply the same steps that I will apply in that module now

02:18.990 --> 02:25.860
but generally, we can say that with the Power BI pro and with the content of this module, we get a really

02:25.980 --> 02:30.690
comprehensive overview of the sharing and collaborating features of Power BI.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.780
Now that we talked about the differences between the different versions,

02:35.860 --> 02:40.430
it's time to finally log into Power BI service the first time, right.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.680
Let's do this in the next video.
