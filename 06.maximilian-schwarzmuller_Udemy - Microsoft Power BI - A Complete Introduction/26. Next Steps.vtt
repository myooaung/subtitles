Over the last lectures in this module, we did a lot of work and we built our tiny but nice little

00:11.760 --> 00:17.580
own visual which uses our own data, which shows colors, where we can select items and where we can even

00:17.580 --> 00:19.310
change some option.

00:19.320 --> 00:27.210
Now I'll be honest, you can go much deeper than that and it's impossible to cover this here in this course

00:27.210 --> 00:32.160
which is mostly about Power BI and not about Power BI developer, so developing for it.

00:32.220 --> 00:38.910
I found it important to add this section though because being able to dive into the creation of custom

00:38.910 --> 00:45.240
charts or at least understanding a bit more what actually happens behind the scenes can really help

00:45.240 --> 00:48.510
you. Now if you are interested in diving deeper,

00:48.510 --> 00:51.880
you basically have to learn a lot with blog articles and so on,

00:51.900 --> 00:58.230
there isn't that much great official documentation, I do link some resources in the lecture after this

00:58.230 --> 01:01.470
one though and then it's all about trying out things,

01:01.470 --> 01:04.460
playing around with it, you can't break anything.

01:04.470 --> 01:11.070
Now before I leave this, however let's see how we can package our visual so that we can not only use

01:11.070 --> 01:18.480
it here in the Power BI service but also how we could distribute it or how we can use it in Power BI desktop.
