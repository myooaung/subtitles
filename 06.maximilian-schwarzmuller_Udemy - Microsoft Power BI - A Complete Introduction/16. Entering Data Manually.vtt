00:02.600 --> 00:08.170
So we want to add some data manually now, let's see how this works,

00:08.180 --> 00:13.550
so we want to add the full region names to our query right here.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.930
Now the first thing I want to do is I want to create another group because as you can see, we want to

00:17.930 --> 00:23.260
create additional queries so we should make sure to keep the structure in the left column, so I'm

00:23.260 --> 00:31.400
right-clicking right here, pressing the group and let's call that regions-countries, something like

00:31.400 --> 00:32.710
that.

00:32.750 --> 00:40.250
Now we can drag and drop that current query, so that codes-country-region query to that group.

00:40.250 --> 00:45.340
Now that we structured our left column, let's think about the data we need,

00:45.650 --> 00:51.350
we need to create a new table to enter that full region names. To do so,

00:51.410 --> 00:58.560
you can go to the home ribbon, go to enter data like this and create a table and

00:58.610 --> 01:02.170
the problem is we don't know what data we should copy in here, right?

01:02.690 --> 01:09.060
Let's take a look at that in a few seconds and let's only rename that table now, let's call it regions

01:11.220 --> 01:13.890
full names and press enter

01:14.430 --> 01:18.870
and now you see that we have created that new query but we don't have a lot of content in here

01:18.870 --> 01:20.140
at the moment.

01:20.190 --> 01:25.430
Let me drag and drop that query also to the regions-country group to make sure that we keep our structure

01:25.710 --> 01:31.090
and now let's think how we can get some data into that column. To do so,

01:31.200 --> 01:35.090
we have to go back to our codes-country-region query, right here.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.760
Now we have all other regions in that second column right,

01:38.760 --> 01:42.190
the only problem is that we have regions multiple times

01:42.750 --> 01:51.240
but if we simply remove the duplicates with the home ribbons, the remove rows and remove duplicates function,

01:52.050 --> 01:57.210
then we can see a list with all the regions we have. Now

01:57.270 --> 02:03.330
if we now select that column, press control z and import note, undo that removed

02:03.420 --> 02:06.390
duplicate step because that's not what this should look like,

02:06.390 --> 02:09.100
we want to have all the countries and all the regions in here,

02:09.240 --> 02:10.970
so we need to undo that step

02:11.430 --> 02:15.560
but still, we copied that list without duplicates now,

02:15.690 --> 02:23.430
so we can go back to our regions full names query and now select the column and press control v.

02:24.050 --> 02:26.760
Nothing is happening so we cannot change that,

02:26.760 --> 02:28.110
that's sad.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.390
Yes of course we can change that,

02:30.390 --> 02:35.340
the only thing you have to know is that if we create a new table the way we did it, then you can go

02:35.340 --> 02:39.820
to the applied steps column and click onto that little symbol right here.

02:40.050 --> 02:45.490
If you do that, then the table opens and then you're able to edit the table,

02:45.810 --> 02:50.240
so in our case, we simply click onto column one, press control v

02:50.610 --> 02:54.130
and now we pasted the region codes.

02:54.390 --> 02:59.790
If you now press the right arrow key on the keyboard, you can simply add another column and then, well

03:00.240 --> 03:07.110
edit that column by either copying into something else or by manually editing the values that you want

03:07.110 --> 03:08.190
to have in here,

03:08.220 --> 03:10.980
in our case we will add the names manually.

03:11.070 --> 03:18.820
So let's double click that first column and call it region-name and enter,

03:18.830 --> 03:21.030
so this is Asia, Europe,

03:21.230 --> 03:40.040
sorry little typo, Europe, Antartica, Africa, Oceania, North America, South America and other.

03:40.060 --> 03:42.490
Now that we defined that, we can simply press OK

03:43.120 --> 03:49.500
and we see that we created a beautiful new query with exactly the information that we want to have.

03:49.510 --> 03:52.040
Now we have the information in that query

03:52.270 --> 03:58.920
but the problem is that we want to have that region-names in that query actually.

03:58.930 --> 04:02.410
Let's take a look at how we can do that in the next video.
