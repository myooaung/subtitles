00:02.580 --> 00:04.150
Time to look at the dashboards

00:04.150 --> 00:04.950
now.

00:05.390 --> 00:10.230
So let's select first our project dashboard, right here.

00:10.260 --> 00:16.380
Now this is interesting right because now we have our visualization that we just pin in the last video

00:16.620 --> 00:17.860
in this dashboard

00:18.030 --> 00:19.450
and here we can click into it,

00:19.550 --> 00:20.140
oh

00:20.430 --> 00:22.080
and what happened then?

00:22.080 --> 00:27.990
So I clicked into the visualization and then I jumped directly into the report,

00:28.910 --> 00:30.090
this is interesting, right.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.070
So the dashboard and the report are connected.

00:33.290 --> 00:38.730
So let's go back and press right here and then we also jump back to our report,

00:39.050 --> 00:40.700
so that's the important thing.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.410
The dashboard is only extracted from the report of course

00:44.660 --> 00:48.550
and that's why those two files are connected in the end.

00:48.620 --> 00:52.270
So this is what we can see in our project population dashboard,

00:52.650 --> 00:57.500
let's now take a look at our other two dashboard that we created. The test dashboard,

00:57.500 --> 00:59.420
here we have the entire dashboard imported,

00:59.420 --> 01:01.480
that's why the pin the whole live page

01:02.030 --> 01:05.540
and here we only pinned our visual which we can see right here

01:05.930 --> 01:10.730
and if we click that, then we also jump back into our initial report

01:10.790 --> 01:17.570
but back to our project dashboard then. So what can we do in this menu then?

01:17.840 --> 01:24.430
Well the first thing I see right here is we can ask a question, let's do that and write population.

01:25.070 --> 01:27.980
See what that is, that's interesting.

01:28.090 --> 01:35.160
So we can ask questions to Power BI and Power BI tries to answer those based on those key words

01:35.230 --> 01:40.900
that we enter right here, so that's this Q&A function that's implemented in Power BI.

01:41.290 --> 01:42.180
Let's go back.

01:43.740 --> 01:49.350
Another interesting option that you might want to see is that view related right here, if we click that,

01:50.190 --> 01:52.870
then we can see that relationship we just talked about,

01:53.070 --> 01:57.460
so when we jumped from the dashboard to the report and here you can see why.

01:57.780 --> 02:01.830
Because this dashboard right here is related to the report and the report,

02:01.890 --> 02:06.170
well it's related to the initial dataset because that's where the information comes from.

02:06.270 --> 02:09.190
This is what we can see right here, let's close that

02:09.660 --> 02:14.600
and now we have that set as featured function, what does this mean?

02:14.970 --> 02:21.960
Well if you select that, then you will see this dashboard whenever you log into Power BI service.

02:21.960 --> 02:27.070
So let's set that as feature maybe, yes we want to do this and click right here.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.790
This is fine

02:29.960 --> 02:37.120
and we can also set it as our favorite dashboard. Let's click that and if we now go back to favorites

02:37.200 --> 02:44.000
up here, thanks to this, then we can see that this dashboard is appearing right there,

02:44.350 --> 02:46.540
so that's the favorite function.

02:46.540 --> 02:49.930
Let's go back to our dashboard, right there.

02:49.990 --> 02:52.360
Now we have that sharing options,

02:52.370 --> 02:56.400
we will not talk about those right now but we will cover that later

02:57.390 --> 02:59.360
and we have that displaying option.

02:59.370 --> 03:04.340
So if you want to display this in the web format or in the phone layout,

03:04.750 --> 03:05.990
yes, we want to do it.

03:06.550 --> 03:09.710
So this is what this would look like on our mobile phone

03:10.240 --> 03:15.050
and this is interesting because later, we will use the Power BI mobile apps

03:15.100 --> 03:18.970
and by that, now see what this might look like right there.

03:19.420 --> 03:23.360
So let's go back to the web view then, like this.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.970
So those are the main options that we have in this dashboards.

03:27.050 --> 03:32.830
So to summarize it, we have our dataset where we can create a new report if we want to

03:33.050 --> 03:38.530
and then we have that new report with multiple visualizations and then we can pin different

03:38.530 --> 03:43.380
visualizations or the entire report which will then appear in the dashboard.

03:43.430 --> 03:51.080
Now I want to show you one more thing, if we click onto my workspace right here, then you have also an

03:51.080 --> 03:55.350
overview of your dashboard, your reports, your workbooks and your datasets.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.370
Let me show you that menu quickly in the next video.
