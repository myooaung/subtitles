After learning the basics of the Data Analysis Expressions, it's now time to categorize our data,

00:09.650 --> 00:12.400
let's see what it is and why this might be important.

00:13.650 --> 00:20.500
So the data categorization is important in our case especially in our DIM-Region table.

00:20.730 --> 00:27.690
As you saw in the initial project in the first module, we are able to present our data for different

00:27.690 --> 00:29.330
regions in Power BI.

00:29.820 --> 00:35.780
Now to make sure that Power BI understands that certain values are countries or regions,

00:35.970 --> 00:41.800
you have to make sure to tell Power BI that. To do this, I am back in the data view

00:41.970 --> 00:48.540
and in the DIM-Region table and here I will now select the country column, right here. In the modeling

00:48.540 --> 00:49.200
ribbon,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.410
you can now find the data type which is a text.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.270
This is fine and

00:53.290 --> 00:54.620
this is not a problem.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.920
The same thing is true for the format,

00:56.940 --> 00:57.800
this is a text,

00:57.870 --> 01:01.540
this is also not a problem but at the moment, it's only text

01:01.620 --> 01:05.620
so how would Power BI know that this is a country?

01:06.180 --> 01:07.370
The answer is simple.

01:07.500 --> 01:15.780
If you go to the properties area right here and change the category from uncategorized to country

01:15.960 --> 01:24.550
in that case, then you make sure that Power BI understands that this column includes countries and

01:24.550 --> 01:30.670
you can do the same thing if you click onto the region name right here, go again to data category and define

01:30.670 --> 01:32.080
that as continent.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.530
So the same logic that we just had.

01:35.080 --> 01:41.680
So this is the important thing about the data categorization, of course you cannot only apply that to countries,

01:41.970 --> 01:48.040
if you look with that list, you have multiple options on what things you have to define to make sure

01:48.310 --> 01:51.350
that Power BI reads the data the right way.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.890
In our case, this is correct for a moment,

01:53.890 --> 02:00.510
so we are done with our data categorization and there are only two things again that we have to do.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.590
The first thing is the module summary

02:02.770 --> 02:05.950
and let's think about what we learned in the next video.
