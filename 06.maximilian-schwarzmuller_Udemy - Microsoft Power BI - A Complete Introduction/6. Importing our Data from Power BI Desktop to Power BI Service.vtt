00:02.810 --> 00:08.560
We want to publish our local Power BI desktop file to Power BI Service now.

00:09.130 --> 00:11.540
So at the moment, we have the following situation.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.270
We have our Power BI desktop file,

00:14.380 --> 00:20.320
this file includes the dataset that we created and the report with the visualizations and at the moment,

00:20.500 --> 00:24.980
this file is located on your computer or on my computer.

00:25.060 --> 00:27.170
So what can we do right now?

00:27.490 --> 00:32.130
Well we saw that get data option in the Power BI service interface

00:32.680 --> 00:38.890
and if we take a look at that, we can see that we connect to the file using that get data option and

00:38.890 --> 00:40.590
that we can publish the file,

00:40.750 --> 00:42.820
so we have two options basically.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.520
The difference is that the publishing option, this is just a button that is called like that in Power BI

00:48.520 --> 00:55.600
desktop and that we can connect a file from Power BI service to Power BI desktop using that get data

00:55.600 --> 00:57.700
function. In the end,

00:57.700 --> 01:00.520
both options will result in the following,

01:01.030 --> 01:07.400
we will have the data imported from Power BI Desktop into Power BI service.

01:07.620 --> 01:09.230
Now some theory here,

01:09.420 --> 01:10.830
let's see how this works

01:10.860 --> 01:13.440
and before we go back to Power BI service,

01:13.470 --> 01:20.880
let's open our Power BI desktop project one last time by the way to see how this publish function works.

01:21.330 --> 01:25.410
So here we are back in a project file in the report view

01:25.890 --> 01:31.380
and if you look at the home ribbon, then and then go to the right, to that share option,

01:31.680 --> 01:34.060
we have an option named publish.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.860
What if we just press that option?

01:38.400 --> 01:39.770
Publishing to Power BI,

01:40.080 --> 01:41.540
this sounds good, right?

01:42.000 --> 01:47.730
Let's wait a few seconds until it's finished and then go back to our Power BI service application.

01:49.220 --> 01:51.220
Now it's done and we got it,

01:51.260 --> 01:57.050
so we understood that and now let's go back to our Power BI service application.

01:57.050 --> 02:01.270
Here I am back in Power BI service and I don't have any dashboards,

02:01.280 --> 02:07.430
this is true but if you now look into that left column right here again, you can see that it changed in

02:07.430 --> 02:11.440
the reports area and in the datasets area,

02:11.660 --> 02:19.190
so we now seem to have imported our data into Power BI service. Now if we click onto the dataset for

02:19.190 --> 02:20.720
instance,

02:20.970 --> 02:28.590
you can see that we have our data in Power BI service. Now we will talk about that in more detail in

02:28.590 --> 02:29.940
the next video,

02:30.120 --> 02:36.150
right now I want to show you how to delete that dataset immediately and how to import the data now

02:36.270 --> 02:42.310
vice-versa because now we publish the data from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service

02:42.510 --> 02:46.870
and now we want to see how we can use that get data function that we saw before.

02:47.010 --> 02:51.760
So we want to use Power BI service to import the data from Power BI desktop,

02:51.780 --> 02:53.570
the result is the same of course.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.100
Those are just two ways on how you can do this.

02:56.340 --> 03:00.110
So let's first see how we can delete that dataset.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.130
So the first thing we could do is, we could click onto that report and then you can see that you have

03:05.130 --> 03:08.260
those dots right here, open menu.

03:08.640 --> 03:15.000
If you click that, you can then either open the report of course, rename it or you can remove it. If you

03:15.000 --> 03:17.450
do that, then you get a quick warning,

03:17.490 --> 03:21.830
yes you want to read it and now you can see that we don't have any reports in here.

03:21.930 --> 03:23.340
The dataset is still here,

03:23.400 --> 03:28.800
so we can also click onto that dots right here and now press remove, like this,

03:29.100 --> 03:33.960
yes we want to remove that. Now we have an empty workspace again,

03:34.240 --> 03:38.310
now let's try this get data function, so we clicked get data right here

03:39.390 --> 03:43.410
and now we have different options on where to retrieve the data from.

03:43.410 --> 03:50.280
In our case and at the moment, we want to import the data from a local source. So we can go to files right

03:50.280 --> 03:50.880
here,

03:51.710 --> 03:55.930
click onto get, select a local file right here

03:56.980 --> 04:02.140
and here I am in the folder where I located the finished Power BI Desktop file.

04:02.500 --> 04:11.130
If I click that and press open now right here, then it will import the information that we have in our local

04:11.130 --> 04:12.330
file,

04:12.330 --> 04:13.540
this takes a few seconds.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.710
Now it is done

04:16.870 --> 04:22.090
and if you look into that left column, we can see that everything looks the same as it did before in

04:22.100 --> 04:23.320
Power BI Desktop.

04:23.740 --> 04:24.250
OK,

04:24.340 --> 04:26.030
there is one little difference.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.230
If you click onto dashboard right now, which is already selected,

04:29.380 --> 04:31.940
we already have a dashboard right here

04:32.140 --> 04:35.270
but in this dashboard, there is no content at the moment

04:35.500 --> 04:37.870
and we could have created that dashboard quickly

04:38.050 --> 04:43.590
also when we use the publish function of Power BI desktop before and we will learn how this works.

04:43.960 --> 04:52.710
But basically, we now saw two ways on how to get the data from Power BI Desktop into the Power BI service.

04:52.720 --> 04:58.870
Now we still have those four options right here, dashboards, reports, workbook and datasets.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.850
As I said, workbooks relates to Excel files,

05:01.900 --> 05:07.270
so we will not talk about that right now but datasets, reports and dashboards,

05:07.270 --> 05:11.490
I think we should take a look at each of those things in more detail.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.310
Let's do this in the next video.
