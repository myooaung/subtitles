We now saw an example of the M language and of the DAX language in the last video and we actually also

00:08.850 --> 00:11.170
used the M language in the last module

00:11.280 --> 00:17.100
and the interesting thing that you saw in this last module and in the last video is that we didn't have

00:17.100 --> 00:18.930
to write any M code.

00:19.380 --> 00:25.300
Nevertheless we used a lot of functionalities that require the M code to be executed

00:25.410 --> 00:31.830
and this all happened in the background because the query editor has a lot of pre-defined functionalities that

00:31.860 --> 00:35.720
allow us to use that editor without writing any code.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.900
However for the DAX, this look different.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.940
If we wouldn't have known how to write that code, that concatenate formula for instance, then it would

00:44.940 --> 00:52.200
have been hard to really work in the data model and because of that, I think it makes sense that we should

00:52.200 --> 00:58.680
take a closer look at the DAX basics in the next videos to make sure that you understand both the calculated

00:58.710 --> 01:04.890
columns and what measures are because otherwise you may not be able to work in the data model the way

01:04.890 --> 01:08.010
you want to work in there. Now to avoid that,

01:08.010 --> 01:11.460
let's take a closer look at that DAX formulas in the next videos.
