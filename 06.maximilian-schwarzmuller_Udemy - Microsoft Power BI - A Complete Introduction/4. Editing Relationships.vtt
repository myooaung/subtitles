00:02.580 --> 00:07.890
After creating our first relationship, it's time to create another one.

00:07.890 --> 00:14.350
So we have established a connection between the DIM-AgeGroup table and the FACT-Population table.

00:14.490 --> 00:21.720
If we go back to report view now and say we don't want to see the population by the categories but by countries,

00:22.020 --> 00:23.520
we could simply change that.

00:23.850 --> 00:30.390
To do this, we simply unselect the category right here and now we have the initial chart that we already

00:30.390 --> 00:30.980
know

00:31.230 --> 00:37.060
and if you now click onto the arrow next for the DIM-Region table and now simply drag the let's say region

00:37.080 --> 00:42.930
name to the legend right here, then you get an error again

00:42.940 --> 00:48.000
but I think you know why we have that error right now, because we have to establish the relationship

00:48.000 --> 00:48.900
again.

00:48.940 --> 00:54.150
Now let's do this again by going back to relationship view and this time we will do it another way,

00:54.240 --> 00:58.220
we will use the manage relationships button up here in the home ribbon.

00:58.410 --> 00:59.470
Let's click that

01:00.210 --> 01:07.050
and you can see that you have an overview of the existing relationships and you have those four options.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.520
You can create a new relationship which is what we want to do,

01:10.710 --> 01:12.720
you can auto-detect relationships,

01:12.780 --> 01:19.050
you remember we unselected that auto-detection in the options in the beginning of this course, we can

01:19.050 --> 01:23.090
edit existing relationships and we can delete relationships. Now

01:23.100 --> 01:25.740
in our case, we want to create a new relationship.

01:25.830 --> 01:28.250
So let's do this by pressing new

01:28.660 --> 01:32.020
and now we have to select the tables that we want to connect,

01:32.130 --> 01:40.290
in our case this is the FACT-Population table and the DIM-Region table and what we want to connect?

01:40.310 --> 01:42.980
Well this is the country ID and the country ID,

01:43.020 --> 01:48.430
so it is already correct right here and as we already learned, we can select the columns that we want to

01:48.430 --> 01:50.700
relate by clicking them

01:50.910 --> 01:54.350
but of course you can only relate the columns that have the same IDs

01:54.480 --> 02:00.420
otherwise you might get wrong results as we had it before when we related the AgeGroup-ID with the

02:00.420 --> 02:01.300
country ID.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.680
However as we got this and as we will ignore that part for the moment, we can simply press OK right now

02:08.790 --> 02:14.820
and we can see that we established a second relationship between the FACT-Population table again and now

02:14.820 --> 02:16.410
the DIM-Region table.

02:16.440 --> 02:23.150
If we close that, we can again see that the relationship was established and if you now go back to our

02:23.190 --> 02:30.300
report view, you can see that we have a beautiful chart which shows us the development of the population

02:30.360 --> 02:36.090
for the different regions and for instance if you go right here, you can see that the biggest region is and

02:36.090 --> 02:36.950
will be Asia

02:37.150 --> 02:41.460
but for instance Africa is expected to grow a lot in the next years.

02:42.380 --> 02:49.040
Now with that information, we now created our first relationships and we have a basic understanding of

02:49.160 --> 02:51.140
how we can create those relationships

02:51.410 --> 02:58.010
but we saw some more things, that cardinality, that cross filter direction and that active properties.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.740
What that is and how we can work with it,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.860
let's learn that in the next video.
