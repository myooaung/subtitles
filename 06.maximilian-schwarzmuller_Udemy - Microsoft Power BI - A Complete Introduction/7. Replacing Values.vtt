00:02.360 --> 00:08.990
We cleaned the columns, we defined the column names but we have to go a little bit deeper to really clean

00:09.140 --> 00:10.110
all the data

00:10.130 --> 00:11.730
we have to clean.

00:12.110 --> 00:16.150
So in the Age-Group column, we see that we have that 9th of

00:16.190 --> 00:18.760
May and that 14th of October

00:19.100 --> 00:25.630
and if you look at the Age-Group logic, then this probably happened because the 5 was turned into May

00:25.640 --> 00:30.650
for the fifth month and the 10 was turned into October as the tenth month.

00:30.650 --> 00:37.400
Now before we work on that, we have to make sure that this is a problem that happened in the input

00:37.400 --> 00:40.910
data and not something that happened in Power BI desktop,

00:40.910 --> 00:45.780
so let's switch to the source files again and see what was stated there.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.910
So here I am in the initial source files folder and let's now open one of the csv files. I'll open the

00:52.910 --> 00:59.210
files with a text editor to make sure that it's not xl that caused kind of an error right here.

00:59.480 --> 01:06.590
So let's right-click it and open it with the notepad and we immediately see that the error is really

01:06.590 --> 01:08.690
caused by the source file,

01:08.690 --> 01:09.990
so this is good to know

01:10.040 --> 01:17.010
and this allows us now to change that data manually in Power BI desktop,

01:17.030 --> 01:20.430
so let's go back to our project and see how we can change that.

01:20.930 --> 01:27.260
So what we have to do right here is we have to replace something, right, because that's the easiest way

01:27.260 --> 01:28.080
to do that.

01:28.340 --> 01:33.500
So let's find the replace function in the home ribbon and in the transform area,

01:33.530 --> 01:35.950
we have that replace values button.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.290
Let's click that

01:37.940 --> 01:44.540
and we see that we can now define the value that we want to find and the value that we want to replace

01:44.540 --> 01:45.610
that value with,

01:45.860 --> 01:49.700
so in our case that would be 9th May

01:50.060 --> 01:52.970
and this should be replaced by 5 to 10,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.800
so we turned that May into five and turn it around to make the range correct.

01:57.800 --> 02:06.080
So we did that and can press OK now and we see that this change was applied to the entire column which

02:06.140 --> 02:10.910
is the great thing about working with data like that.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.770
So this was the first replacement, for the second replacement,

02:14.820 --> 02:21.020
we will do almost the same thing but with one little change that makes our lives a little bit easier.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.040
If you simply select the value that you want to change,

02:25.050 --> 02:32.630
so in that case, the 14th October and then go to replace value in the home ribbon, then you see that

02:32.640 --> 02:40.010
Power BI desktop automatically identified the value defined because you selected that value before.

02:40.110 --> 02:44.360
Now we can simply type 10 to 14 and press OK

02:44.920 --> 02:50.290
and now we see that we also corrected that wrong source data.

02:50.700 --> 02:59.310
So this looks good, right and now I think it's time to have a look at the actual data format because at the

02:59.310 --> 03:07.770
moment as we already said, all the data we see right here is formatted as text and I see some columns

03:08.070 --> 03:09.680
where this is not true.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.170
Now let's change that in the next video.
