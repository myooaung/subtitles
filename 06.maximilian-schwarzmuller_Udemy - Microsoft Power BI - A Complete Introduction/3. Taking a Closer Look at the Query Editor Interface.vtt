00:02.530 --> 00:09.960
We now know the interface of the data model, let's see what we can do in the query editor then.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.270
So this is where we stopped in a last video,

00:12.290 --> 00:13.450
we are in the report

00:13.460 --> 00:15.910
view of our GDP data model.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.760
Let's now open the query editor and see what the interface looks like there. To open the query editor,

00:22.930 --> 00:26.990
you simply go to the home ribbon and select edit queries.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.070
Now we can maximize that

00:29.210 --> 00:34.760
and the first thing we might note is that this looks kind of similar to the view we had before in the

00:34.760 --> 00:35.910
data model,

00:35.960 --> 00:39.150
however there are a lot of differences.

00:39.170 --> 00:46.340
The main difference is that ribbon area up here, we have more ribbons and a lot more functionalities.

00:46.460 --> 00:52.760
Now we will not talk about those functionalities right now because in the next module where we'll start

00:52.820 --> 00:54.630
our first real project,

00:54.800 --> 00:58.310
we will look at a lot of those functions in detail.

00:58.310 --> 01:04.250
So for now, the only thing you have to know, the ribbons provide a lot of functionalities to work

01:04.250 --> 01:07.060
with our queries but we'll see how this works.

01:07.490 --> 01:13.750
So let's go to the left column then, we had that view selection in the data model, here

01:13.740 --> 01:14.900
we don't have view.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.910
The only thing we can change right here is the selected query.

01:19.220 --> 01:25.040
Now in our case, we only connected one data to that Power BI desktop project

01:25.160 --> 01:29.590
but if you connect more data, then you could select all of your data connections,

01:29.780 --> 01:36.410
so by that all of your queries in that view. If you then go to the right column, you see that you have

01:36.410 --> 01:40.330
that query settings. Here you can do two things mainly,

01:40.650 --> 01:46.200
the first thing is you can change the name, so you could write Table 1 to press enter and you'll see

01:46.200 --> 01:47.300
that the name changed.

01:47.490 --> 01:48.890
So let's undo that,

01:48.900 --> 01:50.790
this is one functionality.

01:50.790 --> 01:55.580
The more important functionality is this applied steps table right here.

01:55.590 --> 02:02.160
This table shows you each step you applied to your query and you remember, we changed some things and

02:02.160 --> 02:04.950
we can see every change right here.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.370
Now you cannot only see what you've changed,

02:07.470 --> 02:11.990
you can also undo your changes by clicking that x right here.

02:12.060 --> 02:17.670
We'll see how this works and how great and helpful it actually is in the next module,

02:17.700 --> 02:21.250
so just keep in mind whatever we do is tracked right here.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.230
And by saying tracked right here, I also have to add something.

02:26.430 --> 02:32.880
If you look into the formula bar and this is something new, you might know that we didn't have that in

02:32.880 --> 02:35.900
the data view or in the data model actually.

02:36.240 --> 02:42.750
The reason for that is that the query editor and the actual data model worked with two different formula

02:42.750 --> 02:43.820
languages,

02:44.220 --> 02:50.520
this is the so-called M language whereas the data model works with the DAX.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.950
Now we'll talk about the DAX language in more detail later on,

02:54.380 --> 03:00.300
what you have to know for the moment regarding that M language in the query editor is that each of the steps

03:00.300 --> 03:05.180
you apply is also presented in a formula view,

03:05.220 --> 03:09.330
so you can see what happens from the code perspective actually.

03:09.350 --> 03:13.070
Now if you could learn that M language of course, no problem

03:13.070 --> 03:19.160
but the query editor is built in a way that you have a lot of implemented functions.

03:19.310 --> 03:27.260
So normally, you don't need to learn that M language to do the general tasks that are necessary to shape

03:27.260 --> 03:28.090
your data.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.300
Nevertheless you can see what happens with the code step-by-step by looking into that formula bar.

03:34.340 --> 03:40.430
So I'll come back to that from time to time throughout our data shaping and leaning in the next module.

03:40.430 --> 03:41.390
So that's it.

03:41.600 --> 03:48.590
We now saw the interface of the data model in the last video and we saw the interface of the query editor

03:48.680 --> 03:50.540
in that video.

03:50.540 --> 03:56.750
Now before we start with our first project and dive really deep into that query editor, let's take a look

03:56.750 --> 04:02.300
at the options and see if we have to adjust something to make sure that Power BI desktop works the way

04:02.360 --> 04:03.670
we want it to work.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.370
We'll do that in the next video.
