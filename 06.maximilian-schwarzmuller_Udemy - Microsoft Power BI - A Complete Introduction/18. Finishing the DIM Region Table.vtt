WEBVTT

00:02.590 --> 00:05.370
We now know how to merge queries,

00:05.590 --> 00:09.860
now we have to do the same thing for the DIM-Region query.

00:10.090 --> 00:12.750
So we have that codes-country-region query right here,

00:12.820 --> 00:13.790
this looks fine

00:13.930 --> 00:21.160
but now we have to add that region-name also to our DIM-Region query because that's the important

00:21.170 --> 00:23.310
query for our later data model.

00:23.680 --> 00:31.330
Now as we learn that and as we have that country ID column in that query and in this query, we can simply

00:31.330 --> 00:32.880
go to merge queries again,

00:32.920 --> 00:40.530
so home ribbon arrow and click that. Now select the country ID of the DIM-Region query, here

00:40.540 --> 00:45.780
we can select the codes-country-region query and also select the country ID.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.390
Now this should work easily because we know that this is fine

00:49.840 --> 00:51.050
and we see an error.

00:51.730 --> 00:53.300
Why do we see that error?

00:53.440 --> 00:55.130
Well it says it actually,

00:55.330 --> 01:03.070
we don't have the same format in both queries and that's a problem, because of that Power BI cannot

01:03.160 --> 01:04.830
merge that queries,

01:04.850 --> 01:11.170
now let's go back and change that. So we can go to the codes-country-region query and here, we have the

01:11.170 --> 01:11.980
problem,

01:12.100 --> 01:13.690
this is formatted as text

01:13.690 --> 01:19.780
at the moment and in the DIM-Region table, we formatted that as whole number.

01:19.780 --> 01:24.880
So let's apply the same format to the codes-country-region query and then see if the merge queries

01:24.880 --> 01:26.300
function works,

01:26.380 --> 01:29.270
so I'm clicking here and change the whole number.

01:29.980 --> 01:35.770
Going back to the DIM-Region query, home ribbon, merge queries like this,

01:35.770 --> 01:41.800
now we select the country ID again and go to that part and select the codes-country-region query

01:42.430 --> 01:50.650
and now let's try it again and we see that it works right now with one single comment. We see that the selection

01:50.650 --> 01:51.370
has merged

01:51.580 --> 01:53.260
not all of the rows,

01:53.350 --> 01:55.780
so two rows could not be matched.

01:55.780 --> 02:03.070
Now imagine if we would use an inner join, then we would only have 199 roles in the end, so we would lose

02:03.100 --> 02:04.100
two rows and

02:04.120 --> 02:09.220
that's not what we want and that's why it's important to use the left outer join because it will display

02:09.220 --> 02:15.570
the countries that it cannot find an ID in the codes-country-region query

02:15.730 --> 02:16.940
and then we can change that.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.370
So let's press OK

02:19.350 --> 02:20.730
and now it takes a few seconds

02:22.350 --> 02:26.790
and now we have to define how the column should be displayed again.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.110
Now we learned that already,

02:28.200 --> 02:34.680
so we can click onto that symbol right here and unselect our columns and only select a region name. We

02:34.680 --> 02:37.460
don't use the original column name as prefix, so this is fine,

02:37.470 --> 02:38.440
let's press OK

02:42.030 --> 02:46.080
and now we see that the region names are added.

02:46.250 --> 02:52.340
Now that we have that, I see a problem because if you look into that country list and even if you start

02:52.430 --> 02:59.420
up here, you see that for instance Azerbaijan was allocated to two regions and although this might make

02:59.420 --> 03:06.830
sense, for instance for Turkey which is in the EU and in Asia, this cannot be done right here in our project

03:07.460 --> 03:13.550
because we don't have information about the share of the population that's allocated to each region,

03:13.550 --> 03:18.470
we only have that information on country level and at that region level on our own,

03:18.830 --> 03:25.780
so we need to decide which country or which region each country is allocated to to a single region, not

03:25.830 --> 03:26.990
two regions

03:26.990 --> 03:34.160
So let's change that in the codes-country-region query then and here we have the problem again.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.840
So we see that country 51 for instance is located again to Europe and Asia,

03:39.050 --> 03:40.190
let's change that.

03:40.190 --> 03:47.540
So we have to go to the home ribbon and go to keep rows this time because keep rows allows us to see

03:47.750 --> 03:49.740
how many duplicates we actually have. 

03:49.970 --> 03:57.060
Let's see that by pressing keep duplicates and we see that we have some countries where we have that problem,

03:57.620 --> 04:03.340
so we should get rid of those and we will do that by undoing the last keep duplicates

04:03.530 --> 04:05.740
step and now we will remove the duplicates.

04:05.780 --> 04:09.790
I know, we could have a look at each country and decide what we have to do

04:10.010 --> 04:15.500
but I think for the purpose of the project, it's fine if we just delete the duplicates and by that

04:15.500 --> 04:18.970
make sure that each country is allocated to one region only.

04:19.370 --> 04:25.460
Now we are in the home ribbon again, go to remove rows and remove the duplicates, like this.

04:25.520 --> 04:32.090
Now we see that we only have unique values and if we go to the DIM-Region table again, we see that it reloads

04:32.150 --> 04:39.230
to represent the actual change we did also in that query, takes a few seconds and now we see that the

04:39.250 --> 04:41.350
duplicate values are gone,

04:41.870 --> 04:44.290
this brings us back to our initial problem.

04:44.360 --> 04:51.130
We saw that we could not match or merge all of the country IDs to regions,

04:51.170 --> 04:56.020
we had two regions with nulls in the region name because we could not find the region name for that

04:56.020 --> 04:57.110
country.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.230
Let's take a look at that

04:58.310 --> 05:02.280
by clicking onto the arrow next to region name and here we have the nulls.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.890
So if we unselect everything and simply select allow, press

05:05.900 --> 05:06.540
OK,

05:07.690 --> 05:08.440
press OK,

05:10.060 --> 05:16.250
we see that the two countries we have the problems with is the Sudan and the Channel Islands.

05:16.600 --> 05:23.470
Now we have to adjust it manually again and to do that, we have to decide which region we want to allocate

05:23.500 --> 05:30.430
those two countries to. I would suggest to allocate the Sudan to Africa and to allocate the Channel Islands

05:30.430 --> 05:32.240
to Europe for instance,

05:32.320 --> 05:34.460
that's just what we will do in the project.

05:35.650 --> 05:42.700
So let's select all of the columns right here and press control Z because we will copy that information

05:43.000 --> 05:47.830
into the new table again and then correct information the way we want it to be corrected.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.520
Now let's do that

05:49.670 --> 05:58.100
and unselect the filter, now we create a new table by pressing enter data, selecting the first column

05:58.220 --> 05:59.990
and pressing control V.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.090
Now let's rename the table first,

06:02.430 --> 06:08.540
let's call that region additional countries, like this,

06:08.660 --> 06:09.690
that's OK

06:10.050 --> 06:17.180
and let's drag that also into our regions-countries folder. So the thing now is that we have information

06:17.180 --> 06:18.420
in here that we don't need

06:18.700 --> 06:25.030
and because if you think back into the codes-country-region query, we see that we need the country

06:25.020 --> 06:28.110
ID, the region code and region name. At the moment

06:28.110 --> 06:31.830
we have country ID, country and region name,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.400
so we need to change that column.

06:33.450 --> 06:37.790
So let's press on to that little symbol right here again,

06:37.980 --> 06:42.980
change that to region code

06:43.290 --> 06:48.670
and we said that the Sudan should be Africa, so F and the Channel Islands should be Europe,

06:48.680 --> 06:56.250
so EU, like this and now we have to change the region name also to Africa and Europe,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.710
Europe like this.

06:58.050 --> 07:03.720
If we press OK right now, we see that the structure is the same that we had in the codes-country-region query.

07:03.760 --> 07:11.060
So we can use another function that is already known to add these countries to the actual database

07:11.790 --> 07:14.270
and we can do that with the append queries function,

07:14.430 --> 07:21.280
so we go to codes-country-region, press the home ribbon, go to append queries like this,

07:21.420 --> 07:22.970
we say we want to append to tables,

07:22.970 --> 07:28.310
that's correct and we want to append the region additional countries table, like this.

07:29.720 --> 07:37.890
And let's check if this worked by going to the filter, pressing 7-9, yes we want to see that

07:38.300 --> 07:42.460
and we see that we have Africa the way we want it to be right here,

07:42.770 --> 07:44.050
so this is good.

07:44.310 --> 07:53.050
You can unselect the filter and now we can go to our DIM-Region table and see if that worked. Takes a few

07:53.050 --> 07:53.760
seconds again,

07:55.740 --> 08:02.140
let's see what happened, let me go right here, press 7-9,

08:02.350 --> 08:06.100
wait a few seconds to load that

08:06.310 --> 08:10.440
and we see that the region name could not be identified.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.650
Why is this happening?

08:11.740 --> 08:14.940
Well let's go back, again

08:15.000 --> 08:21.180
this is a data format problem because if you go back to the codes-country-region, we see that we have that

08:21.180 --> 08:22.690
combined format right now,

08:22.860 --> 08:28.320
so we see that we have text and numbers and this is happening because we did not format the data right

08:28.320 --> 08:32.310
here because here we defined the country ID as a text.

08:32.370 --> 08:40.100
So if we changed it to whole number again, this updates, now this updates and you'll see that this text

08:40.190 --> 08:43.500
symbol is gone and if you go to DIM-Region again,

08:44.000 --> 08:45.150
wait a few seconds,

08:45.300 --> 08:46.640
you have a lot of data

08:47.090 --> 08:55.560
and to press on to the filter and press 7, type it to 9, like this, then we see that it now works

08:55.690 --> 08:56.800
and this is great.

08:56.800 --> 09:03.280
Let's do a final check by undoing that filter, going to region name and we see that we don't have any nulls

09:03.300 --> 09:04.320
in here anymore.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.700
So we can press OK

09:06.160 --> 09:10.080
and now we are actually done with our DIM-Region table.

09:10.540 --> 09:15.670
Nevertheless we need to work on the DIM AgeGroup table of course,

09:15.670 --> 09:18.790
let's see what we have to do right there in the next video.
