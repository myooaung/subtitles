00:02.100 --> 00:06.910
In the last lecture, we had a brief look at why this update counter is displayed and

00:06.920 --> 00:08.460
how this roughtly works.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.550
No worries, we're going to dive deeper into this

00:10.550 --> 00:14.180
ts file and work more with it in the next lectures

00:14.300 --> 00:17.540
but what about all the other files and folders we have here?

00:18.020 --> 00:21.740
Let's go from top to bottom, .api and .vscode,

00:21.740 --> 00:28.640
we may basically ignore them. .api holds some Power BI code we use here, so some code which does

00:28.640 --> 00:34.970
of course all the other things connected to our service or to the desktop and gives us certain features

00:34.970 --> 00:38.800
which we use implicitly so that we don't have to write everything in our code,

00:38.840 --> 00:41.800
we don't need to change anything there and we shouldn't.

00:41.810 --> 00:47.810
.vscode is simply created by our editor here, by our IDE and if you're using a different IDE, you won't

00:47.810 --> 00:49.400
have that folder.

00:49.420 --> 00:56.000
The assets folder holds any assets you might use in your visuals, you can since you're using HTML embed

00:56.060 --> 00:57.750
images or anything like that

00:57.800 --> 01:02.870
and you also need an icon for your visual which will later be displayed once you ship that to the

01:03.070 --> 01:04.840
visuals custom, visuals catalog

01:04.850 --> 01:12.260
and other people downloaded it and I will show you how to make this the icon later. The source folder will

01:12.260 --> 01:19.220
hold all your Typescript code, only one file at the beginning and the style folder holds a .less file.

01:19.220 --> 01:27.860
Now we use CSS to style our HTML code but actually, we can use less here which is a preprocessor

01:28.040 --> 01:34.750
which just like Typescript does for Javascript gives us more features and if you don't know less,

01:34.760 --> 01:40.580
the great thing is you can write normal CSS code in this .less file but if you do know less, do

01:40.580 --> 01:43.760
know which extra features it offers you, like here

01:43.760 --> 01:50.820
nesting CSS elements which is not possible otherwise, CSS selectors, this is something you can do here.

01:50.870 --> 01:56.300
So this is where we can style everything and that is actually where we gave our counter this yellow

01:56.300 --> 01:57.160
background,

01:57.200 --> 02:04.200
so if we switch this to red here and hit save, you'll see that once we reload it, it is red.

02:04.310 --> 02:09.600
So that is the styling. Now the other files are used for configuring our project.

02:09.710 --> 02:12.850
We may ignore the npmignore file, that's not important for us,

02:12.860 --> 02:16.580
more important is the capabilities.json file. Here

02:16.700 --> 02:20.990
we can later configure which options the user will see here on the right,

02:21.140 --> 02:27.620
so which values we can add to our visual or how we can change something about it, how we can configure

02:27.620 --> 02:33.100
it here in our Power BI Desktop or service interface.

02:33.350 --> 02:36.410
The other thing is the package.json file,

02:36.470 --> 02:41.720
it's pretty empty as of now but it will soon grow a little bit as we add more packages,

02:41.720 --> 02:46.890
specifically this d3 package, this data driven documents package. There

02:46.910 --> 02:52.700
it will store a reference to all dependencies we use, so that if we share our project with someone else,

02:52.940 --> 02:59.430
this someone else is quickly able to see which dependencies this project uses. The pbiviz.json file

02:59.460 --> 03:04.670
configures our custom visual, we define a name, an internal name and a display name

03:04.670 --> 03:09.630
here, some unique ID, we can add a description which is shown in this custom visual catalog,

03:09.830 --> 03:15.490
we can add a support URL and information about the offer and here, we also linked the

03:15.530 --> 03:22.000
icon we want to use for this visual. We also can link which style files we use,

03:22.010 --> 03:28.370
this is the visual.less file we're using here and we will use this externalJS array here which will allow

03:28.370 --> 03:34.760
us to connect our visual to external Javascript libraries which you might add and we will do so in the

03:34.760 --> 03:41.270
next lectures. The tsconfig.json file configures how Typescript gets compiled.

03:41.270 --> 03:45.980
The default settings, just like in the other files should be fine for you, from time to time

03:45.980 --> 03:50.750
we need to change something here though, especially once we add new Typescript files to the project, that

03:50.750 --> 03:52.910
we will need to add them to the files array

03:53.060 --> 03:55.490
and there is one other change we will do in a second

03:55.580 --> 04:03.380
once we added a new package. That is the files and folders we have, with that I'd say let's get started

04:03.440 --> 04:08.550
changing our visual so that we can step-by-step build a more impressive one.
