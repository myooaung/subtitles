00:02.560 --> 00:06.110
So we got the data, we transformed everything,

00:06.250 --> 00:08.190
let's now output it

00:08.320 --> 00:13.540
and that of course is a job for the update function. Here right at the start,

00:13.690 --> 00:17.320
I want to fetch my data and of course that is equal to,

00:17.440 --> 00:23.980
well my visual transform function call because this, keep in mind, this gives me my data in the end, it

00:24.130 --> 00:28.560
gives me an object which holds my data points and the maximum data.

00:28.870 --> 00:34.750
So visual transform, here I need to pass my options and I also need to pass the host.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
Now we're not using the host yet,

00:36.250 --> 00:38.050
we'll do so later,

00:38.110 --> 00:44.860
I can already extract a host though, I will store it in a property, private property host in my class

00:44.860 --> 00:46.410
here, it will be of type

00:46.450 --> 00:51.780
IVisualHost because that's the type we're expecting here as a second argument

00:51.970 --> 00:56.050
and in my constructor, this is where I can access it, here right at the start,

00:56.080 --> 00:59.890
I can set this host equal to options

00:59.890 --> 01:00.500
host.

01:00.610 --> 01:02.070
That's provided by Power BI and

01:02.130 --> 01:04.060
now I can pass it here,

01:04.090 --> 01:07.150
I can send this host as a second argument.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.430
Again we don't need it yet,

01:08.470 --> 01:10.810
we will need it soon though.

01:10.900 --> 01:16.850
Now that is my data, now with the data down there where we use the static data,

01:16.860 --> 01:22.930
I can now use data in our data points because that's the array of data, do the same down there of course

01:22.930 --> 01:30.760
where we bind it and here where I used data category, here of course

01:30.810 --> 01:37.560
and since I use data there to avoid naming conflicts, let's name it transformed data maybe.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.850
So let's replace that here,

01:39.850 --> 01:40.980
sorry about that

01:41.140 --> 01:49.750
and now with that being replaced, here where I defined the maximum, I can now use transform data data.max

01:49.750 --> 01:53.660
because now we're calculating this dynamically too.

01:53.980 --> 02:01.630
With that all in place, if we now hit save and go back to our service and reload this, we're not seeing

02:01.630 --> 02:03.170
anything which makes sense,

02:03.180 --> 02:07.190
if I now drop the sales into value and the region into region,

02:07.390 --> 02:13.260
now we see it with our own data and let's now confirm if this is correct by adding another bar chart,

02:13.330 --> 02:22.010
a built-in one. Let's drag sales to value and region to axis and I'd say if we leave out the color,

02:22.120 --> 02:23.950
this looks pretty much the same,

02:24.040 --> 02:25.540
pretty awesome, right?

02:25.540 --> 02:29.410
So that is our own chart, our own bar chart with our own data.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.670
We can improve our code a little bit though,

02:31.750 --> 02:33.040
so let's do this next.
