00:02.830 --> 00:10.810
In this video, we will learn how to combine different levels of detail in one single visualization.

00:10.840 --> 00:16.800
So we had the problem that I had to change between the regions and the countries

00:16.960 --> 00:19.110
and this wasn't really comfortable,

00:19.440 --> 00:26.440
let's select the right visualization first. What we want to do is we would like to be able to have the country

00:26.710 --> 00:31.200
and the region information in that chart without having to change the axis

00:31.210 --> 00:36.610
again and again. Now we can do this by adding a hierarchy,

00:36.970 --> 00:40.630
now let's simply add one to see what that is.

00:40.660 --> 00:48.130
So to do this, we simply go to the fields column right here and in that fields column, we now right-click

00:48.210 --> 00:56.020
on to the region name, like this. In that menu that opens now, we can click onto new hierarchy right

00:56.020 --> 00:56.400
here

00:58.480 --> 01:07.230
and now we can see that we created that new hierarchy below our initial column right here. In that hierarchy,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.820
we only have the region name at the moment

01:10.270 --> 01:17.830
but the good thing is if we now select the country right here and drag it into that hierarchy, it is

01:17.830 --> 01:18.840
added

01:18.850 --> 01:20.250
and this is the great thing,

01:20.320 --> 01:25.670
it doesn't change the initial columns, so we have the country and the region name but in that new

01:25.690 --> 01:28.150
hierarchy, we have the same two data.

01:28.570 --> 01:30.930
So what can we do with that now?

01:31.210 --> 01:37.720
Well let's first select the hierarchy like this and unselect the region name because you can see that

01:37.720 --> 01:41.320
the hierarchy right here is now in the axis area,

01:41.470 --> 01:48.870
so I will delete the region name. So far, our visualization looks the same way it did before,

01:48.980 --> 01:52.520
so if we click here, the other visualization changes,

01:52.640 --> 01:55.130
if I click again it changes back,

01:55.340 --> 01:59.960
so nothing new. Well that's not true right

02:00.080 --> 02:06.050
because if you look onto the top of the visualization, we have some more buttons or some new buttons

02:06.050 --> 02:07.410
actually.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.420
Now what are those buttons doing?

02:09.770 --> 02:15.070
Well let's press some of those buttons. So we can for instance press this button here,

02:15.230 --> 02:16.930
let's see what it says.

02:17.060 --> 02:20.330
It says go to the next level in the hierarchy,

02:20.600 --> 02:30.140
let's try out what that is, like that and now it gets interesting right because now we have a more detailed

02:30.150 --> 02:32.470
level of the information that we have.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.970
So we now have the population data for the different countries

02:36.210 --> 02:42.270
and if I scroll through right here, you can see that we have the information for all of the countries that

02:42.270 --> 02:45.110
we have in our dataset.

02:45.210 --> 02:49.620
Now this is nice but how can we get back to our region level then?

02:49.680 --> 02:57.170
Well this is also really simple because we only have to go up here and click onto that arrow, so we got

02:57.170 --> 02:58.050
that

02:58.460 --> 03:04.760
and another interesting information is that if we now go to that data drill ribbon, you remember I said

03:04.760 --> 03:06.710
that you should ignore that for the moment

03:06.710 --> 03:11.960
when we talked about it in the interface video, then you have the same options right here.

03:12.110 --> 03:15.070
You can go to the next level and drill up.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.570
Now we also got that drill down,

03:17.570 --> 03:21.080
let's click it, something changes

03:21.080 --> 03:23.560
in the visualization, let me click it again,

03:23.710 --> 03:25.320
so it's this button right here,

03:26.360 --> 03:28.270
click to turn on drill down.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.160
Well let's click that

03:30.440 --> 03:33.350
and see what happens or no before we do that,

03:33.560 --> 03:37.300
let's click on the button right here again, like this

03:37.790 --> 03:41.670
and as you can see, nothing changed so far, didn't have an impact.

03:41.990 --> 03:46.760
So maybe focus on to Australia and Austria now, just a quick tip.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.920
So let's go back to the previous hierarchy level

03:50.540 --> 03:52.960
but now we activated that drill down,

03:53.000 --> 04:00.310
so if I now press on to one single area in that chart, right here for instance, then this looks different

04:00.310 --> 04:01.080
right

04:01.240 --> 04:06.330
because if you now look to Austria, this is still here but Australia is gone

04:06.470 --> 04:07.700
and why is it gone.

04:07.900 --> 04:12.090
Well because we only see the countries that are in Europe now,

04:12.490 --> 04:13.740
isn't that interesting?

04:13.930 --> 04:20.830
With that drill down functionality, we can define that we can also go to a more detailed level in that

04:20.830 --> 04:24.410
chart for single elements of that chart,

04:24.550 --> 04:27.620
in that case, the region Europe.

04:27.670 --> 04:34.220
So if we go back right here and click on to Asia for instance, we have the same thing for Asia

04:34.780 --> 04:40.510
and that's the really great functionality of that hierarchies and of the drill down function of course.

04:40.510 --> 04:47.710
So we added an additional element to our visualization but what if you would like to limit the hierarchy

04:47.710 --> 04:48.560
levels?

04:48.820 --> 04:55.150
Well you can do that simply if you go to the fields column and you can see that we now enabled both

04:55.330 --> 04:56.590
hierarchy levels,

04:56.590 --> 05:03.100
so the region name and the country name. If you unselect the country now, then you cannot drill down

05:03.100 --> 05:04.380
to the country level.

05:04.780 --> 05:10.470
In our case, this doesn't make a lot of sense because we only have two hierarchy levels, so we can 

05:10.520 --> 05:11.360
re-select it

05:11.770 --> 05:16.630
but if you would have more levels, then you can limit the amount of levels that you want to be displayed

05:16.960 --> 05:18.100
right here.

05:18.670 --> 05:23.210
So we got that, let's enable the drill down and click right here.

05:23.740 --> 05:28.900
So we now have that visualizations and we added a lot of functionalities already,

05:28.930 --> 05:32.550
the only thing that I don't like right now is the formatting.

05:32.950 --> 05:38.400
So I think it's time to take a quick look at what formatting options we actually have in Power BI

05:38.410 --> 05:39.940
desktop.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.080
Let's do that in the next video.
