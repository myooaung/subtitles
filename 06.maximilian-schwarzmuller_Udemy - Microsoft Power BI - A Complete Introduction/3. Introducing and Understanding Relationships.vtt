00:02.500 --> 00:06.900
In this video, we will add relationships to our project file

00:07.450 --> 00:15.430
and this is why I am back again in our data model, so where we stopped in the last module actually. Now I am

00:15.430 --> 00:17.170
here in the report view

00:17.470 --> 00:23.620
and although this module is not related to the report view, we will cover that in detail in the next

00:23.620 --> 00:24.270
module,

00:24.520 --> 00:32.140
let me just create a small visualization to show you why relationships might be a good idea for our project.

00:32.200 --> 00:40.300
So to create a visualization, let's simply select that column chart right here and drag it right there and increase

00:40.300 --> 00:43.710
it so that you can see everything.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.960
Now we have the visualization and to bring it to life,

00:46.990 --> 00:52.750
we can now go to our fields column because we learn that those are the three tables that we imported

00:52.930 --> 00:54.490
from our query editor.

00:54.810 --> 01:00.250
Now if we click on that arrow right here and select the population,

01:00.260 --> 01:05.890
so I'm simply clicking and holding the left mouse button and drag that to the values action,

01:05.890 --> 01:07.470
then we see one column.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.180
Well, not a really good chart, right?

01:10.330 --> 01:12.490
So we should add some more things

01:12.940 --> 01:15.280
and one thing could be the year,

01:15.430 --> 01:22.760
So if I click and hold the left mouse button again and drag the year to axis, right there, then this looks

01:22.760 --> 01:24.350
better, right? Now

01:24.350 --> 01:32.300
we created a chart which shows us the total population in the world from 1950 to 2100.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.340
Now so far, so basic as I would say

01:35.630 --> 01:41.740
but what if we want to add some more information or what if we want to look at those data differently?

01:42.200 --> 01:48.250
Let's say you want to see the population but in different categories and categories,

01:48.330 --> 01:50.110
we did something like that, right?

01:50.110 --> 01:54.940
We created that Age-Group categories, so that baby, adult and so on,

01:55.310 --> 01:58.760
maybe we can add that categories to this chart,

01:59.090 --> 02:00.880
let's find out.

02:00.950 --> 02:07.040
So we go to the DIM-AgeGroup table right here, click onto that arrow and now simply select the category

02:07.310 --> 02:10.580
and drag it to the legend field, like this.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.670
Now this doesn't work

02:14.990 --> 02:16.820
and why is this not working?

02:16.820 --> 02:23.660
Because actually if you look at the tables again, we have the AgeGroup-ID right here and we have the

02:23.660 --> 02:26.220
AgeGroup-ID also in the FACT-Population table,

02:26.480 --> 02:31.440
so basically those two tables should be able to communicate.

02:31.550 --> 02:37.940
Of course they are not because we only prepared the tables because we have those columns but we have

02:37.940 --> 02:43.880
to tell Power BI that those two columns are related because how should it know that by the moment 

02:43.880 --> 02:49.440
and to do this, we finally have to go to the relationship view, let's do that.

02:49.790 --> 02:55.460
So the relationship view can be found right here and what you can see right there is that we have two

02:55.460 --> 02:56.300
boxes

02:56.690 --> 03:01.070
and actually there should be three boxes right because we have three tables

03:01.250 --> 03:06.910
but if you scroll to the right, right here, then you can find the DIM-Region table also.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.080
Now the good thing about those boxes is that you can simply click and hold the left mouse button to

03:12.080 --> 03:14.820
position them wherever you want them to be positioned,

03:14.930 --> 03:18.770
so right here for instance and you can arrange them as you want,

03:18.800 --> 03:22.110
you could for instance position the DIM-AgeGroup table right here,

03:22.130 --> 03:26.050
the FACT-Population table right there and the DIM-Region table right there

03:26.120 --> 03:32.330
and if you want to increase the height or the width, you can simply click right here or right there and do

03:32.330 --> 03:38.530
the same thing for the other tables, just as you prefer, like this for instance,

03:38.870 --> 03:39.780
like that and like that.

03:40.110 --> 03:47.530
Well and I said, you can position them as you prefer but I put the FACT-Population table into the middle.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.700
Why did I do that?

03:48.800 --> 03:56.300
Well as I said, this FACT-Population table basically is the connector between those two dimension tables,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.630
so it might make sense to position that in the middle.

03:59.630 --> 04:03.530
However we are talking about connection and communication

04:03.590 --> 04:09.540
and at the moment, we saw that our chart, well there isn't a lot of communication happening at the moment.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.170
Now how can we change that?

04:11.420 --> 04:16.920
Well if you look at those tables, you can see that in each table, we have the name of the table

04:17.090 --> 04:18.560
and here we have the column names,

04:18.590 --> 04:22.850
we know that names, right? AgeGroup-ID, Age-Group, AgeGroup-Max and category,

04:22.850 --> 04:25.010
so nothing new for us.

04:25.010 --> 04:32.590
The new thing is that if you now click and hold the left mouse button again and drag that column, this

04:32.790 --> 04:33.490
AgeGroup-ID column

04:33.500 --> 04:39.940
in this case to the FACT-Population column like this, then those two tables are connected

04:41.280 --> 04:43.620
and what I just did was wrong by the way

04:43.770 --> 04:46.360
but I just want to show you why this was wrong,

04:46.380 --> 04:47.690
that's why I did it.

04:47.690 --> 04:51.410
So let's go to the report view then and see what happened.

04:51.600 --> 04:58.740
Let's go back and you can see that the chart changed but not the way it should change, right?

04:58.740 --> 05:05.250
Because we have blanks, adult and young adult but we had more categories and there shouldn't be any

05:05.250 --> 05:09.320
blanks because we defined categories for all age groups.

05:09.810 --> 05:14.030
Let's go back to the relationship view and see what happened there.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.490
So the first thing we can see right here is that we establish that connection,

05:17.670 --> 05:20.810
so we have that relationship and we will talk about that one

05:20.820 --> 05:23.590
and that star in the next videos, no worries.

05:23.730 --> 05:27.880
However this relationship doesn't work as we want it to work.

05:28.110 --> 05:31.440
Now if you double-click onto that line right here,

05:31.440 --> 05:36.030
you can edit the relationship and here you can see what we connected.

05:36.300 --> 05:43.440
We connected the the FACT-Population tables with the country ID with the DIM-AgeGroup table and the

05:43.440 --> 05:44.000
AgeGroup-ID.

05:44.280 --> 05:49.920
Well and this is wrong right because we have to connect the AgeGroup-ID with the AgeGroup-ID

05:49.940 --> 05:54.590
of course. Now you could change that here, if you simply click right there,

05:54.720 --> 05:57.970
then the connection would be between those two AgeGroup-IDs.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.370
Now let's do that

05:59.370 --> 06:05.820
and down here you'll find some more options, you'll find cardinality, crossed with the direction and make

06:05.820 --> 06:07.370
this relationship active.

06:07.710 --> 06:10.860
We will talk about those things in the next videos,

06:10.890 --> 06:12.090
so just keep that in mind

06:12.120 --> 06:14.110
but you don't need it for the moment.

06:14.200 --> 06:22.860
Now if you press OK right now and go back to the report view, we can see that now this relationships

06:22.950 --> 06:28.680
works the way it should work and because of that, we can now see the development of the population by

06:28.680 --> 06:30.040
the different categories

06:30.210 --> 06:35.790
and one thing you might see for instance is that the senior population is expected to increase a lot

06:36.000 --> 06:37.380
in the next years.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.650
So this is our first relationship that we created,

06:42.030 --> 06:47.400
let's go back to relationship view and you might wonder why it didn't work in the beginning when I

06:47.400 --> 06:49.030
connected those two tables.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.930
Let's first delete the relationship then, we can click right here

06:53.130 --> 06:57.510
and if you now press delete and enter, you don't have that relationship anymore.

06:57.990 --> 07:00.180
Now you want to recreate that relationship

07:00.450 --> 07:02.960
and we do it the same way we did it before,

07:02.970 --> 07:05.410
so I click and hold the left mouse button right here

07:05.760 --> 07:12.150
but now I position that part of the mouse exactly on the Age-Group column.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.620
Let's do it like this,

07:13.650 --> 07:19.380
so we see the relationship is established again and if we now go back to report view, we can see that

07:19.380 --> 07:20.790
this works.

07:20.790 --> 07:22.490
So this is the important thing,

07:22.560 --> 07:28.050
you can simply create those relationships by selecting one column in the first table and dragging it

07:28.050 --> 07:30.080
to the other column in the next table,

07:30.330 --> 07:34.080
the important thing is that you really select the right columns.

07:34.080 --> 07:40.380
However if we go back to relationship view, we have another relationship that we want to create and we

07:40.370 --> 07:44.690
have that manage relationships button up here and we didn't use that so far.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.730
Let's take a look at that in the next video.
