00:02.880 --> 00:05.310
We learned how to use the slicer,

00:05.610 --> 00:07.460
let's play around with that.

00:07.950 --> 00:14.100
So back on our report page and the first thing I want to do is I want to add a new page, so we press

00:14.130 --> 00:20.120
plus right here, double-click it and call it regions and age groups

00:21.430 --> 00:22.600
and press enter.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.490
So what do I want to do right here?

00:25.870 --> 00:30.520
Well the first thing is, I want to select the slicer again, right here

00:31.590 --> 00:39.300
and no, I don't want that actually, right because I want to create a slicer with the years and didn't

00:39.420 --> 00:45.340
we create such a slicer in the last video? We did, so we can delete that visualization,

00:45.600 --> 00:47.560
go back to the overview,

00:47.730 --> 00:51.270
select the slicer and simply copy it.

00:51.300 --> 00:56.820
So we press control Z and paste it right here and now we have the slicer

00:56.940 --> 00:59.850
that is now referring to that page right here,

01:00.180 --> 01:01.890
so we got that.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.610
Now let's create another slicer,

01:03.830 --> 01:05.370
so I'm unselecting this one

01:05.850 --> 01:12.080
and pressing right here and let's position that slicer right there.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.810
Now what information do I want to have in that slicer?

01:15.230 --> 01:18.340
Well I will like to have the regions in here again,

01:18.380 --> 01:26.450
so let's open the DIM-Region table right there, take the region and position it either right here or directly

01:26.540 --> 01:35.380
in the slicer and we can make this smaller maybe, like this. And now I want to add a third slicer,

01:35.600 --> 01:38.410
so I'm again selecting it, positioning it right here

01:39.430 --> 01:45.460
and in this third slicer, I would like to have the categories, so our age group categories.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.380
So let's open that right here,

01:48.590 --> 01:55.900
let's go to category and drag it into the slicer also, make it smaller maybe and drag it down.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.570
So as I said, I'm not focusing on the formatting in that module.

02:01.160 --> 02:07.250
So now we have three slicers and we know that we can click those slicers like this and like that or like this

02:07.250 --> 02:11.600
and like that but well, we cannot display anything at the moment,

02:11.600 --> 02:12.320
right,

02:12.710 --> 02:15.740
so we need to add a visualization

02:15.740 --> 02:19.720
and this time I don't want to add a line or a column chart,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.380
I want to add a treemap.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.920
Let's see what it is.

02:24.380 --> 02:26.920
So we can find the treemap right here,

02:27.230 --> 02:31.780
this one, I select it and now I made a mistake right

02:31.850 --> 02:34.430
because I kept the slicer selected,

02:34.550 --> 02:37.820
so I have to change back to the slicer now and unselect it.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.050
Now this works

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
and now we can select the treemap right here,

02:42.830 --> 02:49.840
click onto it and position it maybe right here, right there, like this.

02:49.850 --> 02:52.140
Now what I want to see in that treemap?

02:52.490 --> 02:57.390
Well we have the years, we have regions, we have age groups,

02:57.770 --> 03:00.420
I would like to have the countries in here. To do this,

03:00.500 --> 03:04.210
we first have to select the population as a value,

03:04.280 --> 03:09.610
so I'm scrolling down here and select the population to drag it right there.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.310
Now this doesn't really look good,

03:11.390 --> 03:13.630
so we need to add the country data, 

03:13.670 --> 03:20.550
so we go to the DIM-Region table, click right here and drag it to the details field

03:21.020 --> 03:22.640
and now this looks good, right?

03:22.670 --> 03:26.610
Let me increase that a little bit by the way, so like that,

03:26.630 --> 03:33.950
now we have an overview of the population by country and by size and if I now click onto Europe for

03:33.950 --> 03:39.300
instance, you can see that we now only have the European countries in here.

03:39.770 --> 03:45.520
This is really nice but what happens if I click onto the third slicer down here and select adult

03:45.530 --> 03:50.030
for instance? Then this also changes

03:50.640 --> 03:56.620
and I don't want that, I don't want to have that slicer to have an impact on that treemap.

03:56.730 --> 04:06.640
So we have to select that slicer, go to the format menu up here and now click edit interactions 

04:06.860 --> 04:12.880
and now I want to make sure that this slicer doesn't have an impact onto that treemap, so we can simply

04:12.880 --> 04:15.130
press none right here.

04:15.150 --> 04:21.060
Now we got that, let's unselect the edit interactions menu and now see what happens if I click right

04:21.060 --> 04:21.790
here, 

04:22.080 --> 04:23.260
nothing,

04:23.370 --> 04:25.410
this is really great.

04:25.410 --> 04:28.950
The only problem right now is that this category slicer,

04:29.040 --> 04:35.760
well we cannot display anything right here. So maybe we have to add another visualization to that page

04:36.660 --> 04:39.120
and maybe it makes sense to

04:39.120 --> 04:47.200
now add a table because sometimes, it's bad to see the numbers as numbers and not visualized in a chart.

04:47.700 --> 04:54.830
Now to insert a table, we first unselect the slicer, then we go to the visualizations area right here

04:55.580 --> 04:57.790
and select the table, right there.

04:58.750 --> 05:03.430
If we click that and position it right here

05:03.540 --> 05:12.000
or right there maybe and like this and then we have to add some information to that table.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.650
So the first thing we have to do right here,

05:13.840 --> 05:21.190
we have to go to the DIM-Region table, go to country and drag it as a value, like this

05:21.380 --> 05:27.890
and now we see a list of all the countries in Europe of course and this category, well doesn't have an

05:27.890 --> 05:29.100
impact of course.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.700
Let's select the table again.

05:31.820 --> 05:36.710
The second information I would like to have is the category because I want to see what we selected

05:36.950 --> 05:39.400
also in the table, to do that,

05:39.470 --> 05:44.900
we simply go to the DIM-AgeGroup and add the category right here, like this.

05:45.100 --> 05:51.690
Now we have the country, the category, I might want to add one last thing, the population, right?

05:51.730 --> 05:57.280
So let's go down to the FACT-Population table and select the population right here.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.370
So we drag it into that values area, like this

06:01.600 --> 06:06.160
and now we have the country, the category and the population.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.230
This is really good,

06:07.270 --> 06:11.720
the only thing that's not good is that we cannot see that really well.

06:11.920 --> 06:19.740
So if you now go onto that space between those two columns and increase that, maybe like this and maybe

06:19.750 --> 06:27.520
like that and make the visualization a little smaller, maybe increase it a little bit, you can also increase this one

06:29.610 --> 06:30.420
like that,

06:30.840 --> 06:36.680
so we have that list of the countries, the categories and the corresponding population.

06:36.750 --> 06:40.070
So let's now play around with that and see what we created

06:40.070 --> 06:40.580
now.

06:40.860 --> 06:46.410
So the first thing you could do is we could select 2017 maybe, like this.

06:46.500 --> 06:51.030
Now we selected Europe and now let's select Germany because this is where I'm from,

06:51.030 --> 06:52.790
so let's click that

06:53.130 --> 06:58.320
and we now have the category baby with two different values,

06:58.320 --> 06:59.420
that's strange.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.920
Let's select the adults maybe and select Germany again,

07:05.600 --> 07:07.910
we actually only should have one

07:07.930 --> 07:09.320
value now, right.

07:09.430 --> 07:15.070
We should have the total population of the adults in Germany in 2017,

07:15.070 --> 07:22.960
the problem here is that if you think back about our data model, we have different age groups in the

07:22.960 --> 07:24.270
category adult,

07:24.550 --> 07:25.720
so we have the age groups

07:25.720 --> 07:30.500
I don't remember, I think the total was 29 to 64 I think

07:30.790 --> 07:37.650
and in this range, we have various age groups and each of these age groups is allocated to a category.

07:37.810 --> 07:45.580
So basically we see each age group that is part of the adult category separately and additionally, we

07:45.580 --> 07:48.100
differentiated between male and female

07:48.280 --> 07:55.620
and this is why this list even more increases, so we have to change one little thing. To do this,

07:55.690 --> 08:04.480
we select the table like that, go to population because this is the wrong calculation at the moment and

08:04.480 --> 08:12.160
change the default summarization behavior. At the moment, we say don't summarize, if we change that to

08:12.160 --> 08:16.740
sum, like this, then it summarizes all the values,

08:16.810 --> 08:24.210
so all the values in Germany belonging to the category adult and this 40 million, I think this is quite OK.

08:24.460 --> 08:33.020
So if you now select different countries, we can see that our list or our table changes dynamically, this

08:33.020 --> 08:33.890
is great, right?

08:35.600 --> 08:41.720
The only thing that I don't like right here is the amount of information we have right now,

08:42.140 --> 08:44.870
so I would like to add some filters.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.470
Let's learn how we can do that in the next video.
