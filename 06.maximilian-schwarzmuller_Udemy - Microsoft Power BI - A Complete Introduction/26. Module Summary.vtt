We now finished the query editor module. We connected our query editor to different files.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.950
We worked on these queries,

00:10.950 --> 00:13.160
we deleted rows, we added columns,

00:13.200 --> 00:18.630
we combined queries and in the end, we even learned how to improve the performance

00:18.750 --> 00:26.040
when we load the query information into the data model. Now in the next module, we will talk about the actual

00:26.040 --> 00:29.670
data model then, what that is and what we can do in there

00:30.060 --> 00:36.300
but before we can do that, it's time to practice what we learned in that module and we will do that in

00:36.300 --> 00:39.000
our first assignment in the next video.

00:39.000 --> 00:39.930
See you there.
