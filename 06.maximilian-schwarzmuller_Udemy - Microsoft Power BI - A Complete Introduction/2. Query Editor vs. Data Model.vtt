00:02.560 --> 00:06.840
Query editor, data model, why do we have those two things?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.890
Let's find that out.

00:08.920 --> 00:13.300
So we want to understand why we have a query editor and our data model,

00:13.330 --> 00:15.650
so where we want to work right now.

00:16.030 --> 00:19.550
Let's think back about what we did in the last module.

00:19.870 --> 00:26.020
So we connected Power BI to source files and we did that in the query editor of course.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.240
After that, we cleaned our data,

00:28.300 --> 00:30.190
so this means we deleted rows,

00:30.190 --> 00:32.870
we deleted columns, we replaced values

00:32.920 --> 00:34.310
and we did a lot more.

00:34.690 --> 00:41.970
Additionally we shaped our data and by shaping, I mean we created that population combined query and

00:41.970 --> 00:44.760
we even created our base for that star schema,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.130
so that dimension tables and the FACT table.

00:48.130 --> 00:53.260
So to summarize what we did there, we structured and prepared the data actually,

00:53.320 --> 00:54.690
right?

00:54.700 --> 00:57.870
So this was the query editor in the last module,

00:58.180 --> 01:03.180
now we loaded the data into our data model and we are in this module now

01:03.460 --> 01:09.550
and what we will do right here is we will add relationships and we'll of course learn what relationships

01:09.550 --> 01:13.350
are, how we can build them and why we need them actually,

01:13.600 --> 01:18.810
we will additionally learn how to create calculated columns and measures.

01:18.850 --> 01:22.290
Now we will of course learn what the last two things are

01:22.420 --> 01:24.540
and just one quick hint,

01:24.700 --> 01:32.300
both things are related to DAX, Data Analysis Expressions, so this formula language of the data model.

01:32.650 --> 01:37.480
Now to summarize what we want to do right here is we want to analyze the data that we want to have

01:38.350 --> 01:43.720
and that's the important difference that you have to keep in mind. In the query editor, you structure and

01:43.720 --> 01:47.810
prepare your data, in the data model you analyze your data,

01:47.950 --> 01:51.250
so this means those two things are not equal and

01:51.250 --> 01:55.990
those are two different things actually. Now that we know that,

01:55.990 --> 02:00.780
I think it's time to dive deeper into the data model. To do that,

02:00.880 --> 02:07.000
we have to go back to our workflow right here and now think about the data modeling section

02:07.420 --> 02:10.000
and as you can see, we have two views.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.100
We have the data view

02:11.330 --> 02:16.950
and the relationship view and both views are connected as you can see by that symbol in the middle.

02:17.020 --> 02:21.840
However, I think it makes sense if we start with the relationship view first.

02:22.180 --> 02:25.510
Now what that is and why we need it for our data,

02:25.720 --> 02:28.040
let's find that out in the next video.
