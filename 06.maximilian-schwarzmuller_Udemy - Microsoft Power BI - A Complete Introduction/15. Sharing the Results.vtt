00:02.810 --> 00:08.960
We finished our work in the app workspace and now we don't want to collaborate anymore but we want

00:08.960 --> 00:11.960
to share the results with other colleagues,

00:12.110 --> 00:13.530
how can we do this?

00:14.060 --> 00:16.170
Well this is our starting point.

00:16.340 --> 00:18.060
So we are in Power BI service,

00:18.080 --> 00:23.750
we have our dashboard with the visualization and we have the report and the dataset.

00:23.780 --> 00:29.840
Now we want to share this and this can be done by publishing our app,

00:29.930 --> 00:31.520
we will see how this works.

00:31.880 --> 00:36.920
Additionally I want to show you something else, we talked about that when we had a look at the report,

00:37.460 --> 00:40.170
I talked about that publish to web feature.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.430
I also will show you this so that you can publish your report visualizations immediately with a direct

00:46.430 --> 00:49.560
link that is accessible in the browser.

00:50.090 --> 00:53.600
Now having said that, let's start in the next video.
