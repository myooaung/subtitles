00:02.430 --> 00:05.790
So our query keeps getting better and better

00:05.880 --> 00:10.290
but now we have to think about the columns we actually want to have in that query.

00:11.430 --> 00:16.310
So let's select one of the columns first by clicking onto the column name

00:16.560 --> 00:22.150
and now we can navigate through the columns by using the left and right keys on the keyboard,

00:22.470 --> 00:23.840
so this is quite comfortable.

00:24.090 --> 00:27.920
So which columns do we need and which columns could be deleted?

00:28.140 --> 00:31.940
So the first three, location ID, location and time are fine,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.240
age group seems to be good but age groups start and age groups span,

00:37.260 --> 00:43.610
I don't think we need those columns right because the age group already defines the criteria right here,

00:43.650 --> 00:48.190
so we don't need that additional information. Now to delete that column,

00:48.210 --> 00:50.690
you again have multiple options of course,

00:50.730 --> 00:52.420
let me show you some of them.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.530
So the most intuitive thing you might do is you might go to the home ribbon and then simply go to the

00:58.530 --> 01:02.300
managed columns area and then press remove columns

01:02.580 --> 01:06.950
and if you press that in the lower area again, you'll see that a menu opens,

01:07.140 --> 01:12.660
so you can remove the columns which would probably remove that column you selected and remove other

01:12.660 --> 01:13.570
columns.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.750
Now what is that remove other columns?

01:15.830 --> 01:17.740
Let's simply click that and see what happens.

01:18.890 --> 01:23.930
As you can see the only column that remains is the column that we selected,

01:24.110 --> 01:28.100
so other simply means remove unselected columns.

01:28.100 --> 01:33.380
Now we don't need the functionality right here but this might be a big help if you have lots of columns

01:33.680 --> 01:39.230
and if you want to keep some of them only. Now that we know that, we have to undo it right because we

01:39.230 --> 01:42.510
want to get rid of that column and we don't and keep that column.

01:42.530 --> 01:45.990
So again let's go to applied steps, press the x

01:46.130 --> 01:47.420
and here we are

01:47.840 --> 01:52.720
but we are not selecting the column that we actually want to delete, right? Now

01:52.720 --> 01:54.890
I know, the code simply selected right here,

01:54.890 --> 01:55.690
that's easy

01:55.880 --> 02:01.610
but again imagine that you have more data and more columns and that you want to select a column that's

02:02.150 --> 02:04.100
far to the left at the moment,

02:04.100 --> 02:09.460
then there is a really comfortable way on how you can define which column you want to select.

02:09.470 --> 02:11.640
So I'm again in the home ribbon

02:11.900 --> 02:18.080
and if we go to manage columns and now to choose columns and select that again in the lower area of the

02:18.080 --> 02:21.510
button, we see that we have two options, choose columns

02:21.520 --> 02:25.860
again, we'll come back to that in a few seconds and go to column.

02:26.100 --> 02:33.250
Now let's go to column and we see that we can now select the column that we want to select.

02:33.270 --> 02:34.640
Now this is a great function

02:34.730 --> 02:39.800
and as we wanted to delete age group start, let's simply press that and press OK

02:40.120 --> 02:46.970
and now we see that Power BI desktop automatically jumps to the column we selected. Now that we selected

02:46.970 --> 02:47.970
the right column,

02:48.140 --> 02:52.630
let's go to remove columns in the home ribbon, press that

02:52.790 --> 02:54.850
and now we don't press remove other,

02:54.890 --> 02:56.570
we want to remove that column.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.630
Let's do this

02:58.130 --> 03:00.480
and you see the column is gone.

03:00.950 --> 03:05.720
If you deleted the wrong column, just remember applied step and undo that step,

03:05.780 --> 03:07.350
always possible.

03:07.370 --> 03:10.380
Now we also want to delete that age group span

03:10.820 --> 03:13.190
and yes, we could simply remove it now

03:13.340 --> 03:17.390
but there is also another option if you might want to delete more columns.

03:17.780 --> 03:24.440
So we are still in the home ribbon and press now choose columns and now press choose columns a second time.

03:25.710 --> 03:26.690
In this view

03:26.700 --> 03:31.460
now, you can see all of the columns you have in that selected query

03:31.710 --> 03:38.430
and if you unselect the columns that you don't want that keep, then those columns will be automatically

03:38.430 --> 03:39.410
deleted

03:39.640 --> 03:41.240
and this is exactly what we want.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.720
So let's press OK

03:43.780 --> 03:50.410
and you see that the selected column or the unselected column in that case is deleted.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.450
So we now cleaned our columns

03:53.680 --> 03:58.420
but what I still don't like is the column name of most of the columns,

03:58.810 --> 04:02.300
let's also change that as we are already working on the columns, right.

04:02.650 --> 04:11.190
So let's go to the first column and now you can either right-click and press rename or you can double-

04:11.190 --> 04:13.670
click it and now change the name.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.550
So let's call that country ID

04:17.410 --> 04:18.870
because it's a location

04:18.880 --> 04:22.410
but I think country is more precise and press enter,

04:22.810 --> 04:29.140
let's also change location to country, time is not the right column, right,

04:29.140 --> 04:36.550
this should be something like year, age group maybe let's make it age group,

04:36.570 --> 04:42.390
so the real name, pop male, I would say let's call it population male,

04:42.440 --> 04:42.820
right,

04:42.840 --> 04:48.850
to be more precise again again. Same thing is true for the female population,

04:50.510 --> 04:51.450
like this

04:51.860 --> 05:00.460
and now we navigate to the last column and change that to population total, like this.

05:00.990 --> 05:02.010
So we got that,

05:02.130 --> 05:08.850
we are now basically done with our first general cleaning of the columns and the definition of the column

05:08.850 --> 05:09.760
names

05:10.380 --> 05:15.520
but if I look into that age group column, I see things that I don't like.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.980
Let's see what we can do about that in the next video.
