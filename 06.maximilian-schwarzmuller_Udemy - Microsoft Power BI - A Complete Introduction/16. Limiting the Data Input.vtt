Now I mentioned in the last lecture that I expect to only get one category dataset and one value dataset

00:09.670 --> 00:15.050
and that is something I'll have to configure though. For that, I'll go to my capabilities.json file

00:15.050 --> 00:20.400
and in dataViewMappings, here in this object,

00:20.450 --> 00:23.440
I'll add another node on the same level as categorical,

00:23.450 --> 00:31.820
it's called conditions and that is actually something the Power BI schema sets up, that I can define conditions.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.110
Here I can define conditions for all my data roles and the conditions

00:37.130 --> 00:40.700
I want to define here are the following.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.640
I want to define a condition for my category,

00:44.690 --> 00:46.620
that's one of my data roles,

00:46.850 --> 00:48.070
so that has to fit

00:48.080 --> 00:56.630
this name up there and the rule or the condition I want to set up here is that I want to have at maximum,

00:56.960 --> 01:02.240
one dataset entered into there. By default, you could enter more.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.810
The other condition is that for, whoops, for measure,

01:06.830 --> 01:08.640
that's the name we use there,

01:08.930 --> 01:16.640
I also only want to have at maximum one dataset and this is how I make sure that the user is not able

01:16.640 --> 01:19.420
to pass more data that I'm able to handle.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.500
Of course you could write more flexible code,

01:22.520 --> 01:24.800
don't forget to save this file by the way

01:25.010 --> 01:30.870
but here for this basic starter example, we'll keep it simple. With that, this is prepared,

01:30.890 --> 01:33.330
we can now work on extracting that data.
