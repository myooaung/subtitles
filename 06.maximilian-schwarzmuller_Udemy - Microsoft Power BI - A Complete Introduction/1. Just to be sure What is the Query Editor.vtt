We now have a basic understanding of the Power BI universe,

00:06.360 --> 00:12.740
so it's time to dive a little deeper now and we will start that deep dive with the query editor.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.970
What that is and how this works,

00:15.090 --> 00:16.130
let's find that out.

00:17.350 --> 00:21.850
So this is the workflow of Power BI desktop that you already know.

00:21.850 --> 00:28.090
Now in this module, we will focus on the left part, on the data preparation and to be more precise, on the

00:28.090 --> 00:29.550
query editor,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.720
now what is a query?

00:31.720 --> 00:39.000
A query is simply the connection you establish between the Power BI desktop file and the source files

00:39.250 --> 00:44.140
and the good thing about that connection is that you can kind of extract the data out of the source

00:44.140 --> 00:46.210
file and work with that data

00:46.210 --> 00:50.320
and by working, I mean cleaning and shaping. This means you can delete rows,

00:50.320 --> 00:54.310
delete columns, add columns or even combine queries.

00:54.310 --> 00:59.770
Now of course you don't change just source files, you only work in the query editor which has that connection

00:59.770 --> 01:01.910
to the source file and reads out the data

01:02.110 --> 01:07.840
but you won't delete the rows in your initial source files of course. Now the important thing is that after you

01:07.840 --> 01:14.220
finish that cleaning and shaping, so the data preparation, then you load the data into the data model,

01:14.230 --> 01:15.830
this is the second step.

01:15.850 --> 01:21.760
So whenever I'm talking about importing or loading in this module, I'm always referring to the connection

01:21.760 --> 01:29.150
between the query editor and the source files, I'm not talking about the actual data model right now

01:29.290 --> 01:34.000
and that's an important difference that you have to keep in mind. There is query editor with the data

01:34.030 --> 01:41.170
preparation and there is the data model which takes place after you loaded the data from the query editor

01:41.440 --> 01:42.810
in this data model.

01:43.180 --> 01:49.450
Now enough of this theory, let's see how this works by going back to the project file that we created in

01:49.450 --> 01:50.560
the last video,

01:50.560 --> 01:51.410
let's do this.

01:52.420 --> 01:58.630
So here we are in that empty file with no data in it so far of course and we are in the data model,

01:58.630 --> 02:03.710
that was the thing I was just talking about and you can see that because we have those three views, so

02:03.790 --> 02:08.980
the report view, the data view and the relationship view, we'll come back to that in the other modules

02:09.070 --> 02:14.600
but now we want to work with the query editor, and how can we access the query editor?

02:14.830 --> 02:17.350
Well we basically have two options,

02:17.440 --> 02:24.010
we can go to get data right here and click that and then we can connect the Power BI desktop file

02:24.040 --> 02:27.390
to the sources and then this navigator appears,

02:27.580 --> 02:33.100
you might remember that navigator from the first module when we did our first little GDP project. In

02:33.150 --> 02:38.930
this navigator, we had two options. We could either load the data we connected Power BI desktop to,

02:39.070 --> 02:45.190
this means we established that query, so that connection automatically and load the query without any

02:45.190 --> 02:47.480
changes into the data model

02:47.740 --> 02:53.500
or we could press edit and this meant nothing more than opening the query editor after establishing

02:53.500 --> 02:54.840
that connection.

02:54.850 --> 02:59.340
Now we don't want to do that right now because we want to work directly in the query editor,

02:59.710 --> 03:04.360
so to open the query editor, you simply can press onto that button right here

03:05.380 --> 03:07.200
and this is the query editor now

03:07.510 --> 03:12.610
and what we want to do is we want to import data, right? Now let's take a look at the data we want to

03:12.610 --> 03:16.010
import and how we can import them in the next video.
