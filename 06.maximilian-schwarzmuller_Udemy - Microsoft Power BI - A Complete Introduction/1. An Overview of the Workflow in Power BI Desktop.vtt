00:02.330 --> 00:09.000
So we've finished the introduction right now and have a basic overview of the Power BI universe.

00:09.020 --> 00:14.860
Now it's time to dive a little deeper and we will start our deep dive with the first tool, with Power

00:14.880 --> 00:16.170
BI desktop.

00:16.170 --> 00:19.290
Let's first take a quick look at the workflow of that tool.

00:19.640 --> 00:26.230
So generally, we can divide probably a desktop or the workflow in that tool into three steps.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.730
The first step is the data preparation,

00:28.730 --> 00:35.300
so the connection to the source files and the cleaning of the data we imported. After we are happy with

00:35.300 --> 00:40.340
that basic data, we can then import the data into our data model,

00:40.340 --> 00:41.400
this is the second step,

00:41.420 --> 00:48.380
the data modeling. Here we can continue our work on the data and as soon we finished our real data model,

00:48.470 --> 00:55.970
we can go to the third step, the data visualization. Now for all of those steps, Power BI desktop has certain

00:56.090 --> 00:57.750
tools or views.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.040
Let's see what that is.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.750
So for the data preparation,

01:00.770 --> 01:02.750
we have the query editor.

01:02.750 --> 01:09.150
This is kind of an integrated separate tool which allows us to, well prepare the data right and to clean

01:09.170 --> 01:09.980
and shape the data

01:09.980 --> 01:16.340
we want to have in our later model. We'll have a look at that query editor in detail in the next module.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.430
As soon as we finished the preparation,

01:19.490 --> 01:26.360
we need two things for the data modeling, we need the relationship view and the data view. Both views are

01:26.360 --> 01:32.660
connected because you can create relations between the different tables and columns you have in the

01:32.660 --> 01:35.130
data view, you have the relationship view.

01:35.450 --> 01:39.270
So that's why you have two views in your actual data modeling part.

01:39.350 --> 01:43.790
Now for the last step, the data visualization, you have the report view,

01:44.000 --> 01:49.550
this is the view where we can create our visualizations, charts, tables and so on.

01:49.550 --> 01:55.130
Now we could continue talking about this in theory but I think it's better if we just switch to our

01:55.160 --> 02:02.510
initial GDP project from the first module and see where we can find those workflow steps and those tools

02:02.510 --> 02:06.080
and views in the actual Power BI desktop interface.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.420
Let's find that out.

02:08.570 --> 02:12.360
So this is the last thing we saw in our GDP project,

02:12.440 --> 02:16.710
the only difference is the little box in the upper right part of that screen

02:17.090 --> 02:19.660
and as you can see, we are now in the last step,

02:19.730 --> 02:25.920
so we are in the data model but in the data visualization step and the report view.

02:26.150 --> 02:32.460
Now how does this interface work and how does this fit to the workflow we see up there?

02:32.750 --> 02:34.980
Let's find that out in the next video.
