00:01.830 --> 00:05.420
So this is it, you now finish that course.

00:05.430 --> 00:06.570
Congratulations,

00:06.660 --> 00:08.500
well done

00:08.590 --> 00:15.100
and now you know what Power BI is, right? You know how to use the desktop application, how to work

00:15.100 --> 00:22.810
with queries, how to delete rows, how to work on columns, how to append and merge queries and a lot more.

00:22.810 --> 00:29.960
You also know how to create your data model, what relationships are and you know what the DAX language is.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.740
Additionally, you know how to create visualizations and how those visualizations interact with each

00:35.740 --> 00:36.300
other.

00:37.370 --> 00:43.400
You also know the Power BI service application, you know how to share your data, how to collaborate

00:43.430 --> 00:49.750
in your projects and you also know how to access your data from mobile devices using the Power BI

00:50.000 --> 00:51.830
mobile app.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.800
You also know how to connect Power BI to the different data sources,

00:55.860 --> 01:02.610
csv files and databases for instance and if the visualizations Power BI has are not sufficient

01:02.610 --> 01:07.080
for you, you know how to create your own with the Power BI developer tools.

01:08.290 --> 01:15.130
Now I can only encourage you to keep building up on that knowledge, build your own data models, create

01:15.130 --> 01:20.850
your own visualizations, work in Power BI service and become a real Power BI expert.

01:22.140 --> 01:27.650
The only thing I can do right now is to say thank you, thank you for being my student,

01:27.650 --> 01:29.770
it was a pleasure to be your instructor.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.800
I hope you learned a lot in that course and I also hope you enjoyed the course.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.290
So hope to see you in other courses,

01:37.320 --> 01:39.820
thanks a lot again and bye-bye.
