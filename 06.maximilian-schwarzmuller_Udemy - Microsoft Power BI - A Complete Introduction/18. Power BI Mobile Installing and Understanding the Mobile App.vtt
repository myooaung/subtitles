WEBVTT

00:02.910 --> 00:09.720
This video and the next video looks slightly different from the previous videos because now we are on

00:09.720 --> 00:15.050
the mobile phone because we want to try the Power BI mobile app.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.820
Now the first thing we want to do right here is, we want to install the Power BI mobile app and connect it

00:20.850 --> 00:22.500
to Power BI service,

00:22.500 --> 00:24.960
let's see how this works then.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.040
So here I am

00:26.070 --> 00:27.780
in the Google Play Store,

00:27.780 --> 00:32.610
you can of course also find the app in the Window store or on Apple's App Store.

00:32.610 --> 00:38.230
Now let's first install the app and then start the app together for the first time.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.710
So after I installed the app, I opened the app the first time and this is the first thing I can see,

00:45.060 --> 00:53.730
let's first press skip in the right upper part, right here and now we see some Power BI samples. You could

00:53.730 --> 01:00.960
use that if you don't have any data in your Power BI service account to see what the app can do and

01:01.050 --> 01:03.150
how it can display the visuals.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.870
Now in our case, we have some data in some visualizations,

01:06.900 --> 01:13.050
so the first thing we should do is we should click in the upper left part, right here and then we can

01:13.050 --> 01:15.840
see that we have that connect to account option,

01:16.260 --> 01:17.480
let's do that now.

01:17.940 --> 01:20.400
So I click connect account,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.760
now I want to connect to Power BI of course,

01:22.770 --> 01:28.120
so the first option. Now I have to sign in using my email address, so the

01:28.220 --> 01:31.800
same email address we had in the Power BI service application

01:33.350 --> 01:38.690
and after entering my account data, I am finally in the Power BI app,

01:38.690 --> 01:41.880
I hope the same thing is true for you. Now that

01:41.910 --> 01:42.860
we're good to go,

01:42.860 --> 01:45.270
let's press onto start exploring now

01:47.820 --> 01:52.930
and what we can see in the upper left part is a button. Let's click that button

01:54.660 --> 02:00.630
and now we have an overview of the options that we have in the Power BI app.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.990
The first thing we can see are the notifications,

02:03.060 --> 02:06.620
we won't have a lot at the moment so we don't need that.

02:06.710 --> 02:13.040
We have the favorites and we could click that right because we created a favorite in Power BI service,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.030
so we should have a dashboard there,

02:15.230 --> 02:16.510
let's see how this works

02:17.620 --> 02:24.280
and indeed, we can find our favorite dashboard in here or our favorite dashboards if you would have more

02:24.280 --> 02:25.240
favorites.

02:25.570 --> 02:32.010
We could open that now but I don't want to do that because I first want to show you something else.

02:32.140 --> 02:39.730
So let's click on to the left upper button, the menu button again and now focus on two things, not the

02:39.730 --> 02:42.180
two highlighted things to be honest, only

02:42.310 --> 02:48.040
the apps which is highlighted and the workspaces which we can see below share it with me.

02:48.070 --> 02:50.780
So I first want to show you the apps menu,

02:51.070 --> 02:53.770
let's now click on apps

02:54.140 --> 03:01.550
and here we can find our test-collab app, so the app that we created in our app workspace and then published

03:01.640 --> 03:08.960
to Maximillian and my personal account. If we now click onto the app, we can see two things,

03:09.230 --> 03:15.680
we can see this empty dashboard which was automatically created when we connected Power BI service to

03:15.710 --> 03:21.730
Power BI Desktop with the getData function and we have our dashboard that we created,

03:21.730 --> 03:25.390
so our population dashboard. Now what can we do right now?

03:25.820 --> 03:31.040
Well why don't we simply touch the dashboard now. Let's do this

03:31.040 --> 03:38.640
and as you can see, we now get a single view of our visualizations but if we click onto it now, nothing

03:38.640 --> 03:39.250
changes.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.670
You can try that, so you can click where you want,

03:41.670 --> 03:47.920
you won't see any change. But we have two options in the upper right part of the screen,

03:48.230 --> 03:56.870
let's first hit that pen, now we have a new menu and this menu is called annotate.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.710
Now what you can do right here with that annotate function is that if you look into the lower part of

04:01.710 --> 04:07.410
the screen, that you can select different things that you might want to add to your visualization. At the moment,

04:07.440 --> 04:11.320
we can for example simply, well paint into it like this

04:12.700 --> 04:14.930
or like that.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.250
So as you can see, I'm really creative,

04:17.250 --> 04:24.110
so maybe we should stop that, the important thing is that you can click right here to add text.

04:24.210 --> 04:27.030
Here we have that beautiful painting option that we just saw,

04:27.210 --> 04:30.450
here we can add some smileys, right like this

04:30.990 --> 04:34.300
and here we can erase what we just did.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.850
So this right button undoes the last step,

04:36.870 --> 04:45.240
so our smiley and if we click on the button next to it, then you can clear all annotations, like this. In

04:45.240 --> 04:49.300
case you want to share this beautiful annotations with other people,

04:49.350 --> 04:53.000
you can click the share button in the upper right part of that screen

04:53.190 --> 04:59.360
but the important thing is that sharing here does not mean sharing it in Power BI but sharing it

04:59.400 --> 05:01.230
and this specific visualization by the way,

05:01.380 --> 05:06.980
so without the data, just the visualization to other people, for instance using WhatsApp

05:07.020 --> 05:09.510
but I have to add one important thing.

05:09.510 --> 05:16.110
If you send this picture or if you share this in WhatsApp for instance, then the recipient of course

05:16.110 --> 05:18.640
sees this picture and doesn't see the data

05:18.870 --> 05:22.380
but you also send a link with that picture

05:22.380 --> 05:28.680
and if he accesses this link and has access to the Power BI service, then of course this person has

05:28.800 --> 05:31.840
full access to the dashboard and the underlying report,

05:32.160 --> 05:38.620
so keep that in mind. Now we won't do that right now, so we won't use this annotate function

05:38.670 --> 05:43.950
but we have to keep that in mind, that sharing here does not refer to that classical sharing that we

05:43.950 --> 05:45.690
learned in Power BI.

05:46.350 --> 05:51.260
Now let's go back and yes, we want to leave that, this is fine.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.210
But we have another option in the upper right part,

05:55.210 --> 05:56.490
we have that columns,

05:56.830 --> 05:58.270
well let's click on to them.

05:59.490 --> 06:05.860
So the first thing we can see here is that we now have a horizontal view and the second and more important

06:05.860 --> 06:08.130
thing is that we are now in our report.

06:08.500 --> 06:13.870
So this means we can click into a visualization here if we want to or hit a visualization to be more precise

06:14.140 --> 06:17.700
like this and hit it again to unselect it

06:18.400 --> 06:26.740
and we can of course scroll down and scroll up and we can also see that we have that menu in the lower

06:26.740 --> 06:29.030
part. And we know that pen

06:29.020 --> 06:34.290
already, this is the annotations menu that would open so we could paint into a visualization

06:34.600 --> 06:41.350
and the more important thing here is that symbol right to the annotations because if we hit that, then we

06:41.350 --> 06:42.850
can change the pages.

06:43.120 --> 06:50.810
So if we for instance go to overview, then we have our overview visualization right here and we can also hit

06:50.810 --> 06:53.790
the slicer of course and select the different data that we have.

06:54.920 --> 07:01.570
So this is really interactive and has actually the same functionalities that we had in the service application.

07:01.610 --> 07:08.060
So this is what we can do in our app, so we can access the dashboards and we can also access the reports

07:08.450 --> 07:11.140
and we can share these annotations.

07:11.270 --> 07:12.260
This is nice,

07:12.260 --> 07:15.950
let's now see what else we can do in the Power BI mobile app.

07:15.950 --> 07:20.580
So let's scroll up and go back, go back again,

07:21.680 --> 07:26.300
now I will turn the screen again for you so that you can see it in a vertical perspective, like this

07:27.080 --> 07:29.130
and go back once more

07:29.540 --> 07:34.130
and now again open the menu and now that we understand how the apps work,

07:34.290 --> 07:40.910
it might maybe make sense to also take a look at the workspaces and we can see that we have our both

07:41.010 --> 07:45.940
workspaces, so our personal workspace and the app workspace.

07:46.220 --> 07:52.190
Now we kind of know about the app workspace looks like, so we could now take a look at our workspace.

07:52.460 --> 07:53.370
Let's hit that

07:53.780 --> 07:59.630
and this looks different right because now we can immediately change between the dashboards and the

07:59.630 --> 08:01.550
corresponding reports.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.610
So here we can see our four dashboards,

08:03.620 --> 08:08.190
so our project population dashboard, the content pack that we added to our dashboard,

08:08.210 --> 08:12.840
so this being Power BI search term and the tool test dashboards.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.320
And if we go to reports then, then we can see the underlying reports that we have.

08:17.750 --> 08:21.410
Well let's start with the dashboards and go to the left

08:21.520 --> 08:24.490
and here we can again select our project population dashboard, like

08:24.580 --> 08:32.390
this and we see that we again have our empty visualization that was automatically created and we have our population

08:32.390 --> 08:33.370
visualization,

08:33.620 --> 08:36.980
so this treemap. But one thing changed,

08:37.100 --> 08:42.240
if you look at the upper part, you can find that new symbol with that person and that plus.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.640
So if we click that, then we can share this information

08:47.970 --> 08:53.380
but sharing this time is not sharing it in WhatsApp for instance but sharing it in Power BI.

08:53.670 --> 08:57.810
So if you click onto an email address, then you can see what you can do.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.740
You can add an email address, you can add a description,

09:01.950 --> 09:07.410
you can define if the recipients are allowed to additionally share this dashboard with other people

09:08.010 --> 09:13.500
and you see this warning down here, that the recipients will have access to the same data and reports

09:13.560 --> 09:15.710
as you have in this dashboard.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.040
However, we don't want to do this right now,

09:18.090 --> 09:27.450
so we can go back by clicking onto the x and clicking that again and now we could again select our treemap

09:27.930 --> 09:28.520
there

09:29.650 --> 09:32.350
and now we see that we have the same options that we had in the app

09:32.350 --> 09:39.280
actually. We can add annotations again and if we click into the upper right part, then we see our

09:39.280 --> 09:40.920
report.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.320
So this is what we know already,

09:42.380 --> 09:45.950
so I will now go back and go back again

09:46.990 --> 09:51.400
and one last time and now take a look at the reports up here.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.870
Let's also see how this works,

09:52.870 --> 10:01.180
so if I click onto reports and open our project population report, then this is the same thing.

10:01.490 --> 10:02.750
So this is what you have to know,

10:02.900 --> 10:08.250
you can either directly access the report by selecting a report or you can start with the dashboard

10:08.360 --> 10:11.550
and also share that dashboard with other users.

10:12.490 --> 10:16.510
So let's go back and once again,

10:16.510 --> 10:17.810
so this is it.

10:17.810 --> 10:22.870
We now took a look at the Power BI mobile app and what did we learn?

10:22.870 --> 10:30.910
We can connect the Power BI mobile app to Power BI service and access our workspaces and apps.

10:30.910 --> 10:36.790
Additionally we saw a feature named annotate where we could add comments to our visualizations and

10:36.790 --> 10:40.810
also share these visualizations with other people not using Power BI

10:41.140 --> 10:45.330
but we kept in mind that with the sharing of this visualization as an image,

10:45.340 --> 10:48.300
we also sent a link to Power BI service

10:48.460 --> 10:54.190
meaning that if this person has access to Power BI service and our data, then it can also see the underlying

10:54.190 --> 10:56.130
data of that visualization,

10:56.260 --> 10:58.500
so the whole dashboard or the report.

10:58.930 --> 11:04.660
Additionally, we saw that we have our classical workspaces, so we could use our personal workspace or

11:04.660 --> 11:08.610
the app workspace and have a look at the dashboards and the reports.

11:09.040 --> 11:14.840
Additionally we could use the classical Power BI sharing features in that area,

11:14.880 --> 11:22.300
so in that workspaces section. And with that, it's now finally time to summarize what we learned in that

11:22.300 --> 11:23.640
module,

11:23.710 --> 11:26.140
let's do this in the next video.
