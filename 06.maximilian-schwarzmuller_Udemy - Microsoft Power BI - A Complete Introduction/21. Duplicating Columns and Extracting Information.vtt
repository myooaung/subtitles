00:02.430 --> 00:09.090
We created the DIM-AgeGroup table, now we want to be able to define different categories for the

00:09.090 --> 00:10.400
age groups that we have.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.470
So to do this, we have to work with the information that we have in the age group table,

00:16.510 --> 00:18.910
now what do I want to do actually?

00:19.320 --> 00:24.450
If you look at the different age groups, you can see that we have a minimum and maximum value as this

00:24.450 --> 00:26.010
is always a range

00:26.010 --> 00:31.460
and I want to create a condition which always refers to that maximum value of each row.

00:31.520 --> 00:38.710
Now for example, I want to be able to define that for each age that is equal or below four,

00:38.760 --> 00:44.940
this should be named a baby, so this should be a new column that includes that baby name then and then

00:44.940 --> 00:48.070
I want to do the same thing for the age from 10 to 14, 

00:48.120 --> 00:55.650
so for the 14, meaning that for each age that is below or equal to 14, this should be a child for instance

00:56.310 --> 00:57.520
and the first condition,

00:57.710 --> 01:02.040
so that equal or below four is a baby is still true of course.

01:02.070 --> 01:08.340
Now this is what I want to create and to do this, we have to apply some steps because the first thing

01:08.340 --> 01:15.230
we can see right here is that we have a range and this range is from a text so power BI cannot

01:15.240 --> 01:21.660
identify that as a number and as it cannot be identified as a number, well it's hard to extract the maximum

01:21.660 --> 01:24.200
value or to work with the maximum values.

01:24.220 --> 01:29.090
Now I don't want to change that age group column, so I want to keep it the way it is,

01:29.100 --> 01:35.550
so the first thing we want to do is we want to create a duplicate of that column. To do this,

01:35.670 --> 01:42.090
we can stay in the add column ribbon where we are already and we can now go to that duplicate column button right

01:42.090 --> 01:42.650
here.

01:43.050 --> 01:49.110
If you click that, then you can see that we created an exact copy of the first column,

01:49.200 --> 01:54.390
if you click onto those two columns and look at the applied steps for instance, you can see that everything

01:54.390 --> 01:55.720
is exactly the same,

01:55.860 --> 01:57.700
well except for the name of course

01:57.880 --> 02:00.210
but I think we can keep the name age group copy

02:00.210 --> 02:02.560
in that case, this is fine.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.540
So we now have that new column

02:04.770 --> 02:09.480
and the first thing I see is that there are some symbols that I don't want to have in here,

02:09.660 --> 02:12.320
those plus symbols for instance down here.

02:12.360 --> 02:17.040
So the first thing we should do is we should replace that plus symbols with nothing because we just

02:17.040 --> 02:18.240
want to delete them.

02:18.510 --> 02:22.680
To do this, we simply select the whole column like this,

02:22.680 --> 02:27.630
go back to the home ribbon right there and now go to replace values.

02:27.660 --> 02:28.520
We learned that already,

02:28.520 --> 02:28.850
right,

02:28.890 --> 02:30.230
so you know how to do this.

02:30.530 --> 02:36.420
If we click right here and now type plus and replace it with nothing and press OK

02:37.620 --> 02:41.130
and now you see that the plus symbols are gone.

02:41.130 --> 02:48.330
Now this is good but you remember, we want to extract the maximum values of each row right here and we don't

02:48.330 --> 02:49.500
have that at the moment

02:49.860 --> 02:56.880
but if you look at the last two characters in each row, you can see that for the majority of the rows,

02:57.210 --> 03:03.930
if we could extract those last two characters, this would be a big step to our idea of having a list

03:03.940 --> 03:06.460
with the maximum values of each row.

03:06.660 --> 03:14.820
The only rows where this wouldn't work is the first row right here, the 10th row and row 18,

03:14.820 --> 03:20.800
now before we take care of that, let's first extract the last two characters of each row.

03:21.300 --> 03:30.360
To do this, we go back to the transform ribbon and now we find in the text column area, this extract function,

03:30.600 --> 03:35.580
if we click onto that arrow, then you can define what exactly you want to extract from that column that

03:35.580 --> 03:36.550
you just selected.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.190
So you could extract a length,

03:38.220 --> 03:42.370
so a defined length, the first characters, the last correctors or a range,

03:42.630 --> 03:47.060
in our case we want to extract the last two characters as we already said.

03:47.220 --> 03:54.750
So let's press that and now define how many characters counting from the back of each row in that column

03:54.870 --> 03:56.010
we want to extract,

03:56.040 --> 03:58.810
in our case, we want to have the last two characters.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.140
So let's write that and press OK

04:02.220 --> 04:07.670
and now we can see that we extracted the last two characters and that this is displayed in that column

04:07.670 --> 04:14.940
right now. Now the first thing we can do is we can now rename that column to age group max

04:15.020 --> 04:19.290
right, because now we really have the maximum values in here and press enter.

04:19.610 --> 04:20.600
So this is it,

04:20.720 --> 04:27.820
the only thing that I don't like at the moment is the 1st, the 10th and the 18th column as we already

04:27.830 --> 04:28.910
said.

04:28.910 --> 04:35.630
Now let's first change column 1 and column 10 because we don't want to have that minor symbol in front

04:35.630 --> 04:43.130
of the maximum values. So we can simply again select a whole column, go to home, go to replace values and

04:43.130 --> 04:46.930
replace the minus with nothing and press OK,

04:48.060 --> 04:49.510
like this.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.740
Now the last thing we have to change is column 18 because 00, that's not really good

04:54.820 --> 04:58.150
so we have to replace 00 with 100.

04:58.270 --> 05:02.380
So let's press on 00, go to replace values

05:02.650 --> 05:04.920
and as you can see 00 is already selected

05:04.990 --> 05:09.860
so we can simply now define that it should be replaced with 100 and press OK

05:11.440 --> 05:16.930
and now we got our column with the maximum values of each age group.

05:16.930 --> 05:22.530
The only thing we should do right now is we should also format that column as a whole number

05:22.780 --> 05:24.390
and we also know how this works,

05:24.430 --> 05:30.460
so we can simply press onto that symbol right here and format it as whole number, like this.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.130
Now this is really good right,

05:32.140 --> 05:35.330
so the only thing that's missing now is that condition,

05:35.380 --> 05:35.880
right

05:35.920 --> 05:39.230
because you want to define, well you have different maximum values

05:39.430 --> 05:43.860
but what should be displayed in the new column, that category column?

05:44.350 --> 05:47.350
Let's find out how we can do this in the next video.
