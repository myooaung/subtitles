WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:06.670
We want to learn more about the DAX formulas, to be more precise,

00:06.700 --> 00:09.890
we want to learn more about the calculated columns.

00:09.910 --> 00:15.790
Now you may not know what that is exactly at the moment but you will learn that in this and in the next

00:15.790 --> 00:16.380
video,

00:16.540 --> 00:17.630
so let's start

00:18.250 --> 00:24.910
and as you can see, we are not in our course project, we are again in the new small project just to show

00:24.910 --> 00:27.730
you that calculated columns topic.

00:27.730 --> 00:32.450
Now you can find that project file of course attached to that video.

00:32.470 --> 00:35.150
Now what can we see in that project file?

00:35.440 --> 00:38.320
I am in the data view so I am in the data model of course

00:38.590 --> 00:40.480
and we have two tables.

00:40.570 --> 00:44.860
The first table is called Calculated-Columns-Revenue and what you can see right there is that we

00:44.860 --> 00:51.820
have the Date, Revenue A and Revenue B, so for two different products for instance and the total cost

00:51.820 --> 00:57.630
that occurred for that two products. In the second table, the Calculated-Columns-Units table,

00:57.760 --> 01:03.110
you can also find the date, the units sold for Product A and the units sold for Product B,

01:03.370 --> 01:05.270
so that's what we have at the moment.

01:05.380 --> 01:11.770
Now let's go back to the first table and create some calculated columns using some DAX formulas.

01:12.040 --> 01:17.560
Now the first thing you might want to know in here is the total revenue, to calculate that, you can simply

01:17.560 --> 01:28.630
go to new column, name it total revenue, like this maybe and now simply refer to the

01:28.630 --> 01:36.790
first column, Revenue A and write plus Revenue B and press enter

01:36.790 --> 01:42.220
and as you can see, we simply calculated the total revenue of product A and product B.

01:42.220 --> 01:47.740
Now let's maybe also have a look at the margin, so that we can see what is actually our profitability

01:47.800 --> 01:50.850
of those two products that we sell. To do that,

01:50.920 --> 01:59.160
we again have to create a new column right here, call that margin like that

01:59.580 --> 02:06.260
and now we can write a formula, we can use the divide formula for instance like this. If you are press

02:06.270 --> 02:07.120
tab,

02:07.530 --> 02:12.690
then we have to define the numerator which would be the total cost in our case,

02:12.810 --> 02:21.890
so like this, the denominator which would be the total revenue that we have to define an alternate result and

02:21.900 --> 02:23.250
this should be zero in our case.

02:23.460 --> 02:30.120
If we press OK right now or enter, then you can see that we calculated something but this is not the margin

02:30.270 --> 02:33.000
right because this is cost divided by total revenue,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.860
so we have to add something.

02:34.890 --> 02:42.810
Let's go back to our formula and simply write 1 - the result of this thing and close the bracket,

02:43.050 --> 02:44.070
like this

02:44.400 --> 02:47.010
and now we have the total margin.

02:47.010 --> 02:49.520
The only problem that we have is that the formatting,

02:49.530 --> 02:53.420
well this is not really good, right? Now to format that column,

02:53.430 --> 02:55.470
we can do the same thing that we did with the date,

02:55.560 --> 03:02.810
we can go to the modeling ribbon, go to format and now say this is a percentage for instance, like this

03:03.270 --> 03:06.920
and now we created a DAX formula and we formatted that already.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.290
This is quite easy right, now

03:09.360 --> 03:12.300
let's add some more functionalities,

03:12.750 --> 03:17.730
let's say we want to make a difference for each day depending on the margin.

03:18.030 --> 03:22.580
So let's say if the margin was above 65%, this was a good day,

03:22.740 --> 03:25.410
if it is below that, it was a bad day.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.370
How could we do something like this in a DAX formula?

03:28.530 --> 03:30.240
Well let's see.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.550
So we can again go to the new column ribbon right here

03:34.610 --> 03:44.040
and define that as margin check maybe, like this and what you can do now is you can simply write if,

03:44.790 --> 03:47.020
you can find it right here and press tab

03:48.040 --> 03:53.700
and then we want to have the margin, right, so we can select that column again and press tab.

03:54.130 --> 04:03.910
If that margin is larger than 0.65, so 65%, then this should result in

04:03.960 --> 04:05.790
and we could write that in quotation marks

04:05.830 --> 04:07.890
good day like this

04:07.890 --> 04:10.810
maybe, if this is not the case,

04:10.860 --> 04:18.310
so if the margin is equal or below 65, then this should result in bad day like this

04:18.410 --> 04:23.330
and if you now press enter, you can see that we have exactly what we wanted to have.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.050
So we now created an if formula in our DAX world,

04:27.090 --> 04:28.690
this was also easy, right?

04:29.070 --> 04:32.050
Now what if you want to add some more data to the table?

04:32.130 --> 04:35.490
For instance the units sold and we have that in another table,

04:35.490 --> 04:41.350
I know that but how can you refer to that table and get the data into your table right here?

04:41.370 --> 04:42.660
Let's see how this works.

04:42.900 --> 04:49.540
So we again create another column right here and we could call it units A

04:50.070 --> 04:56.160
and now you could write the square brackets, then you can only refer to the columns that you have in

04:56.160 --> 04:57.080
this table and

04:57.090 --> 04:58.290
this is not what we want,

04:58.320 --> 04:59.820
so we can delete that.

04:59.970 --> 05:05.960
Maybe if you write the name of the other table, calculate it, this looks good,

05:06.030 --> 05:10.830
calculated columns, revenue, no, now we also cannot find it right here,

05:10.830 --> 05:12.570
so this also doesn't work.

05:12.900 --> 05:18.420
We need another function and this function is called related, like this,

05:18.570 --> 05:21.280
returns a related value from another table.

05:21.510 --> 05:22.650
Let's try that out.

05:22.890 --> 05:30.840
So I press tab right now and if we now write the square brackets, nothing is happening right now,

05:31.140 --> 05:32.490
why is this not working?

05:32.640 --> 05:37.940
Well the problem is simply that we don't have any relationship to the other table

05:38.430 --> 05:40.880
but we know how to create relationships, right?

05:40.890 --> 05:46.740
So let's keep that formula the way it is right now and simply press enter and go quickly to our relationships

05:46.740 --> 05:54.150
menu right here and now create a one-to-one relationship between those two tables, like this

05:54.180 --> 05:57.640
and as you can see, we established that relationship already.

05:58.110 --> 06:06.400
Now if we now go back to our data view and go back to our formula, we can now see that we don't have to write those

06:06.400 --> 06:12.830
square brackets but that we can simply select the related column out of that related table,

06:12.850 --> 06:21.010
in our case, this should be the unit sold, A like this. If we now press tab and enter, then we can see that

06:21.010 --> 06:25.250
we exactly retrieve the data from the other table with that formula.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.490
So this is the related function and how you can basically use it,

06:29.560 --> 06:32.390
so we now have the units sold of Product A

06:32.680 --> 06:35.080
but we have the total revenue now calculated,

06:35.080 --> 06:36.560
we have the total cost,

06:36.580 --> 06:41.210
so maybe we'd want to have total units sold and we can do that quite easily.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.570
If we just click onto that column again with our related formula,

06:44.770 --> 06:53.200
select the whole related formula, press control Z and now write plus and paste the formula and simply

06:53.200 --> 07:00.820
exchange unit sold A with units sold B as you can see right here and maybe name that units sold now

07:01.210 --> 07:02.280
and press enter

07:02.710 --> 07:06.710
and now you see that you got the total units sold already in that column.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.130
So this is also great,

07:08.420 --> 07:12.000
let's now maybe change that formula one last time.

07:12.130 --> 07:16.240
What if we want to have the average sales per unit in that column?

07:16.450 --> 07:20.600
We could also do that easily because we calculated the total revenue already,

07:20.710 --> 07:26.410
so the only thing we have to do is we have to click into the formula right here, write a square bracket,

07:26.680 --> 07:27.130
write

07:27.160 --> 07:28.470
total revenue

07:28.540 --> 07:37.310
and here it comes and select it and now divide that and setting the brackets correctly, like this and renaming

07:37.310 --> 07:43.220
that formula to sales per unit and press enter

07:43.590 --> 07:48.450
and now we also calculated the sales per unit in this column.

07:48.450 --> 07:50.460
So this was quite nice, right

07:50.580 --> 07:56.010
and this is of course only a basic overview of what you can do with such DAX formulas in relation to

07:56.010 --> 08:02.120
the calculated columns. Now I'm always mentioning that calculated columns,

08:02.220 --> 08:03.790
why am I saying that?

08:03.960 --> 08:10.860
Well if you look at the operations that we did so far, you can see that those always refer to all rows

08:10.950 --> 08:12.560
of one specific column,

08:12.720 --> 08:18.870
we didn't calculate something like a total of a column. Each value refers to each of the single row in

08:18.870 --> 08:20.760
the corresponding column

08:21.060 --> 08:26.310
but there is something else and if you want to create something like the average of the sales per unit

08:26.340 --> 08:31.420
of the column or the sum of the sales per unit, you cannot use a calculated column,

08:31.620 --> 08:33.470
you have to use something else

08:33.900 --> 08:39.870
and what is something else is and what the difference is to that calculated columns, let's learn that in

08:39.870 --> 08:40.910
the next video.
