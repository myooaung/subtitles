Welcome to this module, the report view module and by the way, a module I was really looking forward to

00:10.230 --> 00:11.490
and why is this the case?

00:11.640 --> 00:15.880
Well, it's finally the time to bring some life into our data

00:16.200 --> 00:22.440
and what better way could we have to bring some life to that data than using one of the powerful and actually

00:22.440 --> 00:23.750
beautiful visualizations

00:23.820 --> 00:25.770
Power BI desktop has?

00:25.830 --> 00:32.160
Now before we do that, let's second take a quick look at our workflow in Power BI desktop to see where we are

00:32.160 --> 00:34.470
at the moment.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.550
So this is the workflow that you already know,

00:37.800 --> 00:41.190
so we finished the data preparation, in the last module,

00:41.220 --> 00:45.770
we also finished the data modeling with the data view and the relationship view,

00:45.990 --> 00:51.260
so we are now in the last step in Power BI desktop, the report view

00:51.510 --> 00:56.020
and now you probably want to know what can we exactly do in that report view.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.030
Well you will learn that in the next videos.
