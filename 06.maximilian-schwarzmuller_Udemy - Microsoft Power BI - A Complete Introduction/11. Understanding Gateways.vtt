00:02.530 --> 00:09.910
We want to install a gateway and at the moment, we are not really sure what that actually is and why

00:09.910 --> 00:11.240
we would need that

00:11.350 --> 00:15.070
and additionally, we have to decide between two gateway types.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.300
Let's think about that.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.970
So this is the current situation that we have,

00:20.290 --> 00:26.810
we have our Power BI desktop file on our local computer and we use the publish function and then the

00:26.820 --> 00:34.120
connect to file function and we saw that both functions basically imported our data into Power BI service.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.530
Now the important thing is when we try to press refresh,

00:38.650 --> 00:43.610
so to update the data from Power BI service, let's assume we change the data in Power BI service,

00:43.630 --> 00:46.680
a visualization for instance or something in a dataset,

00:46.840 --> 00:48.750
then this didn't work.

00:48.760 --> 00:55.450
The reason for that is that with that first option right now, we only imported the data, we didn't establish

00:55.510 --> 00:59.550
a real connection between Power BI service and Power BI desktop.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.130
So this is not a really good solution

01:02.230 --> 01:08.530
if you want to refresh your data, daily for instance or once a week and this is why you need a gateway

01:09.130 --> 01:15.370
because the gateway allows you to create that connection and to refresh the data whenever you want or

01:15.370 --> 01:21.230
even to schedule a refresh, so that you can decide that you want to refresh your data once a day

01:21.340 --> 01:26.040
at the same time. Now we have two gateway types,

01:26.300 --> 01:29.770
the first gateway type is the personal gateway right here

01:30.230 --> 01:32.010
and it does exactly what it should do,

01:32.030 --> 01:38.210
it establishes that connection between your computer and Power BI service, really great.

01:38.210 --> 01:41.100
There is one disadvantage maybe with that personal gateway,

01:41.420 --> 01:43.340
it's a pro feature.

01:43.380 --> 01:46.680
Now you can use the basic functions of the gateway

01:46.790 --> 01:52.670
also in the free Power BI version but to really be able to use the full functionalities, for instance to

01:52.670 --> 01:57.640
schedule the refresh to where you prefer it, you have to use the pro function

01:57.770 --> 02:03.860
but the important thing is that you should use the personal gateway if your file is located on a computer,

02:03.890 --> 02:07.130
so on a local computer, on your computer for instance.

02:07.610 --> 02:14.290
But then we have a second option, this Power BI Desktop file might be located on a server, right here

02:14.300 --> 02:21.800
for instance. If this is the case, then you don't use the personal gateway but you use the on premises

02:21.800 --> 02:22.500
gateway,

02:22.730 --> 02:24.060
so the second option.

02:24.500 --> 02:29.990
The result is the same, in the end you established a connection between the information in Power BI

02:29.990 --> 02:32.610
desktop and Power BI service

02:32.690 --> 02:39.170
and one important information maybe, the on premise a gateway is also a pro feature, just to make sure

02:39.230 --> 02:41.270
that you know that.

02:41.350 --> 02:43.420
So we don't have a server solution

02:43.450 --> 02:48.080
right now, we only have our file locally saved on our computer

02:48.670 --> 02:51.700
and with that, we answered both questions, right.

02:51.730 --> 02:55.610
We now know what a gateway is and why we need it

02:55.900 --> 03:03.660
and additionally we also know that we should use the personal gateway in our case. Now that we know that,

03:03.730 --> 03:08.620
let's continue with our installation and start the gateway in the next video.
