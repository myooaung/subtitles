00:02.820 --> 00:05.130
We want to create visualizations,

00:05.490 --> 00:07.250
let's do that right now.

00:08.140 --> 00:15.240
So I am back in the project file and on the page that we created in the last video,

00:15.640 --> 00:20.590
now the first thing we should do is we should delete that page right because we don't need it actually.

00:21.170 --> 00:21.910
To do this,

00:21.910 --> 00:30.150
we simply go down here and press onto that x right here, like this and press delete.

00:30.160 --> 00:36.640
Now we are back on our measures page and as we want to create some new visualizations, we should create

00:36.730 --> 00:38.950
a new page, right here,

00:39.710 --> 00:44.780
double-click it and call it overview and press enter.

00:45.270 --> 00:48.260
So what could we create in that overview page?

00:48.480 --> 00:55.680
Well I think we should start with a basic line chart maybe, to do this, we go to the visualization column

00:55.770 --> 01:00.670
right here and select the line chart.

01:00.680 --> 01:08.030
Now we got our chart on the report page and if I click right here and hold the left mouse button, I can

01:08.030 --> 01:09.880
move the chart around,

01:10.500 --> 01:12.980
so as you can see this page,

01:12.980 --> 01:19.140
so this white background limits the area where I can position the visualization.

01:19.520 --> 01:27.070
So let's put it right here maybe and make it a little bit bigger, like that.

01:27.100 --> 01:34.900
So we now have that visualization, our line chart and we want to add some data to that, we know how this

01:34.900 --> 01:35.260
works

01:35.260 --> 01:40.990
from the last video, we can go to the fields column right here and in this fields column,

01:40.990 --> 01:46.280
we then click on to that arrow next to FACT-Population for instance. Well

01:46.390 --> 01:54.830
and now the first starting point could be the population data and we could use this one then and drag

01:54.830 --> 01:58.870
it, well maybe into the chart.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.090
This worked,

02:00.090 --> 02:03.300
this doesn't look really good at the moment of course but it worked

02:03.420 --> 02:10.720
and you can see that because the population was automatically defined as a value which is correct.

02:10.740 --> 02:17.370
Now another option to do that would be to take it again and drag it directly to the values area right

02:17.370 --> 02:18.150
here

02:18.870 --> 02:20.810
and then we have the population twice,

02:20.980 --> 02:29.930
so to delete one of those items, you simply click onto that x right here, like this. A third option would

02:29.930 --> 02:35.540
be to simply create the visualization and select it directly in that box right here,

02:36.830 --> 02:41.620
so let's first unselect it and now the visualization is gone,

02:41.730 --> 02:44.410
so you have to be careful about that.

02:44.430 --> 02:52.790
However if you click it now again, then you can see that that Power BI automatically creates a new visualization,

02:52.830 --> 02:57.390
the problem is that this is a column chart and we want to have a line chart

02:57.750 --> 03:01.490
and additionally, it's not formatted the way we want it to be.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.600
Let's quickly change that by increasing the size again, drag it right here

03:07.750 --> 03:11.710
and go to the visualizations column and select the line chart.

03:12.340 --> 03:18.250
So now we have our initial situation back and now we can add some more data to that chart because at

03:18.250 --> 03:20.060
the moment, it doesn't look good.

03:20.530 --> 03:24.960
So another information that we might want to add is the year,

03:25.000 --> 03:32.500
so our access right there. To do this, we can stay in the FACT-Population table and select a year down here

03:33.270 --> 03:40.950
and drag it to the axis area, like this. Now it looks better right, now we have the development of the population

03:41.130 --> 03:43.920
from 1950 to 2100

03:44.700 --> 03:47.380
but we might want to add some more information,

03:47.490 --> 03:50.860
for instance information for specific countries

03:51.180 --> 03:54.770
and as we have our nice data model, we can easily do that.

03:55.290 --> 04:02.670
So we can go to the DIM-Region table, click right here and now select the country,

04:02.740 --> 04:03.610
let me do that

04:05.030 --> 04:07.930
and if I now drag it to the legend area right here,

04:09.920 --> 04:13.180
then you can see, well you can see a mess right

04:13.490 --> 04:17.870
because we have too many countries in our dataset at the moment.

04:18.140 --> 04:24.920
So it might make more sense if we don't select the countries but simply select the regions as a legend

04:24.920 --> 04:30.360
for our visualization. To do that, we simply unselect a country right here,

04:31.860 --> 04:34.420
take the region name and drag it right there.

04:35.710 --> 04:42.370
Now this looks better right, now we created our first line chart for different countries, different periods,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.570
for the population of the total world

04:45.220 --> 04:48.320
and we did that with just a few clicks.

04:48.580 --> 04:56.740
Let's create a second visualization, maybe a column chart this time, maybe this one, the clustered column

04:56.740 --> 04:59.180
chart. Let's do that,

04:59.270 --> 05:02.780
so and now I changed our visualization,

05:02.980 --> 05:04.140
why did that happen?

05:04.240 --> 05:09.380
Well I selected our line chart and then I changed the visualization.

05:09.490 --> 05:13.180
So this doesn't only work if you don't have any data in your visualization,

05:13.180 --> 05:17.130
this also works if the visualization already displays some data,

05:17.380 --> 05:23.800
so this is a nice feature if you want to try out the different chart types, like this, like that or back

05:23.800 --> 05:27.790
to our line chart but we don't want to change that chart,

05:27.850 --> 05:29.170
we want to create a new one.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.380
So we simply click on the report page,

05:31.420 --> 05:38.200
so on to an empty space, right that for instance to unselect our initial visualization and now we

05:38.200 --> 05:43.720
go to the visualizations column again and click right here.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.880
Now we have that new visualization

05:46.260 --> 05:50.930
and we can drag it around like this, yes

05:51.010 --> 05:52.150
I think this looks fine

05:52.520 --> 05:56.300
and now we want to add some data also to this visualization

05:56.420 --> 05:56.850
and let me

05:56.850 --> 05:57.880
select it by the way.

05:58.890 --> 06:01.930
So let's start again with the total population,

06:01.950 --> 06:11.280
so we go to the fields column, population and use it as value like this, doesn't really look impressive

06:11.280 --> 06:12.270
at the moment.

06:12.600 --> 06:17.170
Let's maybe add some axis data but this time we don't take the year

06:17.340 --> 06:23.200
but the region name maybe, so we click right here and drag it to the axis field.

06:23.250 --> 06:30.540
Now it looks better right, now we have our visualization which shows us the total population for the entire period

06:30.750 --> 06:33.690
in our dataset for different regions

06:35.140 --> 06:39.650
and with that, we now created our first two visualizations

06:40.120 --> 06:42.740
but let me select the visualizations once again.

06:43.120 --> 06:50.870
So if I select the left visualization, we can see that we have the year, the region name and the population

06:51.890 --> 06:53.980
but what about those tooltips?

06:54.350 --> 07:00.840
Well we will talk about that and also about interactions in the next video.
