00:02.890 --> 00:08.190
Time to take a look at some other sources that we can connect Power BI service to.

00:08.690 --> 00:13.620
So I am back in the workspace and in the app workspace to be more precise

00:13.670 --> 00:21.790
but first I want to change back to my personal workspace. To do this, I simply go right here and click my workspace.

00:22.080 --> 00:30.420
Now we are back in our personal workspace again and if we go to getData down here, like this, then we can

00:30.420 --> 00:36.010
see that we talked about some of those data connection possibilities.

00:36.570 --> 00:40.540
We talked about the file connection, our local Power BI desktop file,

00:40.890 --> 00:47.160
we didn't talk about the connection to databases but this you can see later when Maximilian will explain

00:47.160 --> 00:48.780
to you how this works

00:49.200 --> 00:53.260
and what about this content pack libraries over here?

00:54.410 --> 01:02.510
I think we did have a look at one of these, didn't we? So we have my organization and services.

01:02.510 --> 01:07.460
Let's click onto the get symbol in my organization first and see what we got there.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.700
So let's click here

01:10.450 --> 01:18.850
and as you can see, we can find our test-collab app, so the app that we created from our app workspace

01:19.330 --> 01:22.960
in this content pack library of our organization.

01:23.350 --> 01:30.600
So if we click onto get it now right here, like this, then we're back in our app folder and if we click

01:30.600 --> 01:33.980
the app again of course, then we can open the app.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.600
We try that before so we know how this works.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.880
However let's go back to get data then, like this.

01:41.950 --> 01:48.890
So we have that content pack library for our organization where we saw our app that we just created

01:49.240 --> 01:54.400
but what about the content pack library in the services area right here?

01:54.970 --> 02:00.010
So it says that we can choose content packs from online services that you use,

02:00.340 --> 02:04.540
well let's press again and see what this is.

02:04.970 --> 02:12.000
Now as you can see, we are basically in the same menu but not in the my organization segment right, here

02:12.070 --> 02:16.120
we can find the app but in the app segment right there

02:16.700 --> 02:24.550
and in the segment, you can find various pre-defined datasets with some pre-defined visualizations.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.650
So you basically can connect Power BI service to different other services

02:30.050 --> 02:31.820
and those are quite a lot.

02:31.820 --> 02:37.850
Let's maybe scroll through it just to make sure that you get an overview of the amount of services of

02:37.850 --> 02:42.880
this pre-defined services that you can connect Power BI service to.

02:43.280 --> 02:50.510
So if you scroll through that page, you can see that you have a huge amount of pre-defined services that

02:50.510 --> 02:52.180
you can select right here

02:52.640 --> 02:56.680
and we cannot cover all of the services of course now in this course.

02:57.050 --> 03:03.020
So I would like to show you one specific service that we can easily install right now and take a look

03:03.080 --> 03:05.440
at the visualization that it comes with.

03:05.690 --> 03:10.610
So let me first finish that scrolling, so just for you to make sure that you saw everything, so it's

03:10.700 --> 03:13.810
the end and we can go to the next page and we have even more,

03:13.910 --> 03:16.210
so if I scroll up again.

03:16.610 --> 03:21.140
So as you can see various various pre-defined sources,

03:21.140 --> 03:26.510
now let's go back to the first page and select one specific service.

03:26.620 --> 03:30.610
As I said, I would like to show you one service as part of this video.

03:30.760 --> 03:36.550
So the service I'm referring to is Bing and at the moment, I'm not finding it, here it is.

03:36.910 --> 03:41.870
So here we can see that we have some on-demand analytics of Internet search activity,

03:42.080 --> 03:47.890
well if we click that, then you can already see what this will look like.

03:47.950 --> 03:51.650
So basically, well let me just show you what you get.

03:51.730 --> 03:59.560
So if I click onto get it now right here, like this, then we can see that we can now track specific

03:59.560 --> 04:04.340
search terms and see how many times they were requested in Bing.

04:04.690 --> 04:12.730
So if I enter for instance Power BI right here because this might be interesting also to you to see

04:12.910 --> 04:20.290
how interesting the Power BI tools universe actually is and click onto add right now,

04:20.290 --> 04:26.610
right there, then you can see that we have an additional dashboard now, right here

04:26.860 --> 04:32.810
and if I open the workspace right there, then you can see that we also have the dashboard here of course,

04:33.260 --> 04:35.400
you know how this menu works in the meanwhile.

04:35.750 --> 04:40.770
But if we scroll down, then you can see that we don't have the actual dataset in here,

04:41.030 --> 04:46.760
so what we get is a connection to the data of course so that the visuals can be displayed but we don't

04:46.760 --> 04:50.000
see the actual data behind that dashboard.

04:50.360 --> 04:55.790
So we only have the dashboard with the pre-defined visualizations but we don't have the report or the

04:55.790 --> 04:57.280
dataset,

04:57.350 --> 05:02.100
however we can access that dashboard right now by simply clicking right here

05:03.470 --> 05:10.220
and now we can see the search activity of the term Power BI in the last week

05:10.520 --> 05:13.760
and you can see the total volume of that search term right there

05:14.050 --> 05:21.050
and if we scroll down, you can see the top locations where the search requests were made from

05:21.050 --> 05:24.350
and if you scroll to the right right here, like this,

05:24.560 --> 05:28.260
well then you can see some topics about Power BI premium.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.390
We talked about that in the first two videos of this module

05:31.820 --> 05:36.500
and if we scroll up, we can additionally see the top languages and the volume change,

05:36.590 --> 05:39.700
so an increased demand obviously as we can see right there.

05:40.040 --> 05:46.190
So this is also something that we can do, we can connect Power BI service to those pre-defined content

05:46.190 --> 05:47.640
packs.

05:47.660 --> 05:50.900
So this was the last source type that I wanted to show you,

05:51.080 --> 05:57.750
as I said we will talk about databases later but for the moment, this is actually the overview of Power BI

05:57.770 --> 05:59.880
service.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.420
Now we always talked about Power BI service,

06:02.450 --> 06:06.970
so a solution that you can only access using a computer.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.630
What if you want to access your data with the mobile phone?

06:11.630 --> 06:19.170
You can of course also do that and we will see how this works with Power BI Mobile in the next video.
