00:02.620 --> 00:06.850
Let me show you what else you can find in your workspace.

00:07.120 --> 00:12.540
So I simply clicked onto my workspace at the moment and we can also close that if we want to

00:12.850 --> 00:18.640
and as you can see right here, we have the same general topics - dashboards, reports, workbooks and data

00:18.640 --> 00:19.650
sets.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.720
Now this is organized slightly different

00:22.720 --> 00:27.320
and the good thing is that we can now better see this actions area right here

00:27.700 --> 00:31.390
and I want to show you some actions that you can do right here.

00:31.810 --> 00:36.400
So if you look at the first option right here and you can always drag the mouse cursor above it to see what

00:36.400 --> 00:37.390
you can do,

00:37.390 --> 00:38.600
this is sharing.

00:38.770 --> 00:43.480
Sharing is really important of course but we will talk about that in a few minutes.

00:43.810 --> 00:48.130
The next options are the related reports or datasets,

00:48.160 --> 00:49.530
we talked about that already

00:49.690 --> 00:51.210
so you know what that is.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.470
Then we have the settings,

00:52.540 --> 00:54.500
we don't have to take a look at that right now

00:54.610 --> 00:57.340
and we can delete the dashboard of course.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.600
Let's click onto report now, right here.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.310
In the report, you can analyze your data in Excel and we won't do that right now

01:05.710 --> 01:10.430
and we have that, get insights, sounds interesting,

01:10.540 --> 01:13.510
let's click that. Now

01:13.520 --> 01:17.050
Power BI is searching for insights, sounds interesting, right?

01:17.060 --> 01:18.570
So let's wait a few seconds

01:19.090 --> 01:20.990
and now insights are ready.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.420
Now let's click onto a few insights right here

01:24.710 --> 01:27.330
and now we can see what happened.

01:27.350 --> 01:31.700
Power BI automatically analyzed our dataset.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.230
Now as we don't have a really big dataset,

01:34.280 --> 01:37.180
the results are probably not really impressive.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.470
Now let's go down,

01:38.720 --> 01:45.220
well this population share, I don't know if that's an interesting fact but as you can see, the total population

01:45.370 --> 01:48.050
is trending upwards for North America for instance.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.210
So this is what we get right here.

01:50.530 --> 01:56.800
This may not replace a total report created by you and that's why we will not focus on that right now

01:57.070 --> 02:02.260
but the good thing is if you want to get those quick insights and quickly have some charts and some

02:02.470 --> 02:04.870
description, some generic description to it,

02:05.020 --> 02:08.180
this is a good feature. Now that we saw that,

02:08.230 --> 02:11.040
let's go back to the workspace, right here

02:11.710 --> 02:14.350
and we were in the report section right there.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.350
So those were the quick insights,

02:17.350 --> 02:20.630
here we have the related option again, the settings

02:20.800 --> 02:21.980
and we can delete it,

02:22.300 --> 02:26.470
so we know that. I will not take a look at the workbooks right now

02:26.470 --> 02:29.730
as I said because this is more related to Excel.

02:29.860 --> 02:31.860
So let's go to datasets

02:32.620 --> 02:35.010
and here we have some new symbols, right?

02:35.320 --> 02:37.670
Let's take a look at that, create report,

02:37.780 --> 02:39.620
well we know how this works already right,

02:39.670 --> 02:44.450
so we don't have to do it and we have that refresh now option.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.250
We saw it in the report right

02:46.320 --> 02:47.820
and it didn't work at all.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.500
Now let's see what we can do right here.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.560
We couldn't refresh because your data gateway is offline,

02:55.830 --> 02:56.610
OK,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.830
so we need a gateway obviously.

02:59.890 --> 03:00.910
Let's see.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.560
Let me close that first.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.760
So we will talk about that menu later,

03:04.870 --> 03:11.590
so for now we can go back to the workspace, click dataset section and here we have another symbol, schedule

03:11.590 --> 03:12.690
refresh,

03:12.820 --> 03:15.080
let's press that,

03:15.100 --> 03:16.920
now we are back in the menu.

03:17.290 --> 03:22.690
Now the main thing we can see right here is that our personal gateway is offline, of course because we

03:22.690 --> 03:28.020
didn't install any kind of a gateway but we saw that gateway option, right?

03:28.030 --> 03:34.400
You remember, up here in that menu here, we can download that data gateway.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.960
Well why don't we just try it right now?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.130
So let me click it right here,

03:40.560 --> 03:41.920
a new page opens.

03:42.320 --> 03:42.850
OK,

03:42.900 --> 03:45.370
keep your dashboard and reports up-to-date,

03:45.420 --> 03:46.110
this sounds good.

03:46.170 --> 03:51.870
So let's press onto download gateway, now it's downloaded and we downloaded a file right here.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.500
Now let's simply double-click that file and see what we can do.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.940
So after double-clicking this gateway file, we are in the on premises data gateway installer.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.780
Well this sounds interesting,

04:03.780 --> 04:10.470
so let's press next right here and now we have to choose the type of gateway that we need.

04:10.470 --> 04:12.270
Now it gets more complicated,

04:12.480 --> 04:17.910
so before we select one of those options, I think we should take a closer look at what we're actually

04:17.910 --> 04:22.480
doing right here and what the differences between those two gateways actually are.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.360
Let's do that in the next video.
