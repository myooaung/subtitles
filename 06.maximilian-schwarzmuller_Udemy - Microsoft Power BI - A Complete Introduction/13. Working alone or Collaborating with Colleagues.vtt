We want to collaborate right now,

00:04.740 --> 00:06.700
let's see how this works.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.910
So for collaboration, we will assume the following - 

00:10.080 --> 00:16.400
we are in Power BI service and we have a dataset in there and we want to work on that dataset to create

00:16.400 --> 00:20.400
a dashboard for instance. We could do that on our own

00:20.430 --> 00:24.030
we saw that already but now things change.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.790
Now we want to work together with other people,

00:26.790 --> 00:34.980
our IT friend for instance again on this dashboard. To do this, we have to create the following, an app

00:34.980 --> 00:37.780
workspace. In this app workspace,

00:37.830 --> 00:45.360
we can then connect our Power BI service file to the dataset of the Power BI desktop tool and then work

00:45.360 --> 00:48.850
together on that data and create the dashboards together

00:48.870 --> 00:53.140
for instance. Let's see how this works in the next video.
