00:02.970 --> 00:05.200
So this was our initial question.

00:05.550 --> 00:07.620
We finished our work locally,

00:07.770 --> 00:09.110
what now

00:09.430 --> 00:12.860
and I think we now know what we can do, right?

00:12.960 --> 00:15.960
We talked about the different options that we have,

00:15.960 --> 00:22.760
so are we a single user who just wants to keep the data for himself or are we part of an organization

00:22.910 --> 00:28.120
that we have to work together on the data and share the data to other people in the end?

00:28.140 --> 00:33.750
We talked about Power BI service in general and we saw how we can connect the Power BI Desktop results

00:34.020 --> 00:35.850
to that Power BI service,

00:35.940 --> 00:44.070
we did that with importing the data and also by installing a gateway. Additionally, we created our app

00:44.070 --> 00:48.270
workspace to collaborate with other colleagues on the work we want to do.

00:49.210 --> 00:55.050
After we finished that app workspace, we took a look at how we can share the results with other people

00:56.140 --> 01:00.600
and we didn't only share the results with other people in Power BI service,

01:00.640 --> 01:07.690
we additionally took a look at the Power BI mobile apps to understand what we can do with these apps and

01:07.690 --> 01:12.350
how we can access our results from any mobile device as we prefer.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.150
So this was it.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.110
We now talked about the basic tools of the Power BI universe,

01:20.350 --> 01:30.220
Power BI Desktop, Power BI service and Power BI mobile. And we could stop right here but we won't,

01:30.240 --> 01:35.910
now it's time to dive a little bit deeper and to talk about some more specific topics regarding data

01:35.910 --> 01:38.730
connections or custom visualizations

01:40.280 --> 01:44.760
and this will be introduced to you by Maximillian in the next module.
