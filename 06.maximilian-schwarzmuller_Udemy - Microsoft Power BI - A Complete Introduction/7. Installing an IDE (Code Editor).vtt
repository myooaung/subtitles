In the last lecture, we got started with our custom visual, we set up our development environment

00:06.880 --> 00:08.860
and we can see our own visual

00:08.860 --> 00:13.760
here in Power BI service which is again where we will stay for development.

00:14.050 --> 00:20.000
But now it would be nice to see the code which was created and for that, we need a code editor.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.470
Now if you already have your preferred editor, feel free to skip ahead,

00:23.470 --> 00:27.760
I can strongly recommend the Visual Studio Code editor by Microsoft,

00:27.790 --> 00:32.830
it's great for working with Typescript which is exactly what we'll be doing and it is free.

00:32.860 --> 00:38.330
Now you can simply visit code.visualstudio.com and then download the version for Windows.

00:38.350 --> 00:42.420
Now I already do have it on my machine so I won't walk through the installer,

00:42.460 --> 00:43.770
it's super simple though.

00:43.780 --> 00:49.240
So let's open that tool now and it should look something like this once you opened it. You can then click

00:49.270 --> 00:56.660
open folder or file open folder to open a new project and then select that bar chart folder you created.

00:56.860 --> 01:03.430
Now once you did this, you will see all the files and folder in this project folder here on the left.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.300
For us the most important file is in the source subfolder, the visual.ts file, .ts for Typescript.

01:10.330 --> 01:17.110
This file contains all the Typescript code, the code which is responsible for displaying our visual

01:17.200 --> 01:19.130
and that it looks like it looks like,

01:19.150 --> 01:24.550
right. Now I'd say a great next step is to understand what this code actually does,

01:24.580 --> 01:31.330
so how it does lead to this visual we have before we dive into all the other files and folders and understand

01:31.330 --> 01:32.710
what else we do we have here.
