00:02.020 --> 00:07.260
Now that we know how we connect our user input to the code, we need to extract the data that the user

00:07.260 --> 00:08.310
entered

00:08.310 --> 00:12.980
and for this, I will create a new function instead of my static data,

00:13.110 --> 00:19.830
I will name this function visual transform since I will transform the data we get in. Here

00:19.860 --> 00:23.970
I expect to get some options which will be visual update options,

00:24.120 --> 00:29.130
so the same options I get here in the update method and the reason for this is that I will call this

00:29.130 --> 00:35.580
method in this public update method and I'm just outsourcing it into its own function to keep the code

00:35.580 --> 00:37.090
here leaner.

00:37.620 --> 00:44.550
I also expect to get a second argument, the host of my chart, of my visual,

00:44.580 --> 00:53.670
so that is of type IVisual host, an interface provided by the Power BI visual tools here which is needed

00:53.910 --> 00:57.160
to call the right methods internally.

00:57.270 --> 01:04.170
So on this method here, I plan on returning the transformed data which will have the same structure we

01:04.170 --> 01:05.410
had before

01:05.580 --> 01:11.520
when I use static data, so the array of objects with value and category so that I don't have to change

01:11.550 --> 01:18.690
all the code down there, I just have to change the ways or the places where I call my static data.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.590
So in here, in visual transform,

01:22.650 --> 01:32.400
I want to get my data. So I can store this in a data views variable, the name is up to you but I do access some

01:32.520 --> 01:37.390
options data views and that simply gives you access to the data the user entered,

01:37.410 --> 01:39.620
it's called data views.

01:39.750 --> 01:48.020
Next I want to create an object which should hold the relevant information about my data.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.640
So here I will name this data info

01:52.650 --> 01:56.460
maybe, it is of type Javascript object and in there,

01:56.460 --> 02:02.940
I want to have my data points which should be an empty array, my maximum value,

02:02.940 --> 02:06.450
this is important for scaling it correctly,

02:06.540 --> 02:10.790
we hardcoded the maximum here, 11 but that's not true anymore,

02:10.800 --> 02:17.090
we don't know the maximum value of the data the user will enter so we will need to calculate it and

02:17.100 --> 02:19.730
that's all for the data info for now.

02:19.740 --> 02:26.220
Next I want to check if we did actually receive some valid data, so I will check the opposite to be precise,

02:26.220 --> 02:28.750
I will check if data views is not set.

02:28.750 --> 02:33.840
So if it is not set, then something went wrong, then I don't want to render anything.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.620
I will also check another condition,

02:36.660 --> 02:48.520
that is if in the data views, the first element is not set and why the first element? Because in the capabilities.json

02:48.520 --> 02:49.800
file,

02:50.020 --> 02:57.940
I will soon add some configuration to restrict the user to only enter one legend dataset and one value

02:57.940 --> 02:58.830
dataset,

02:58.990 --> 03:04.080
so that is something I will do and therefore, the first element is exactly that.

03:04.120 --> 03:12.770
Now it could be that we have this dataset but on this dataset here, we don't actually have the categorical

03:13.950 --> 03:14.730
property.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.070
Remember, that is what we're trying to map it to,

03:17.080 --> 03:21.370
so if that fails, whoops, I also want to quit.

03:21.940 --> 03:30.490
I also want to check that we maybe have the data views and we have the categorical data

03:30.790 --> 03:37.750
but what if we have no categories because that is invalid or the user entered some data where no

03:37.750 --> 03:41.480
categories are there. Or what if

03:41.500 --> 03:50.410
we have a data view and we have the categorical property and we even have categories but there, we don't

03:50.410 --> 03:55.270
have the source property which should be available and that is something Power BI will provide to us,

03:55.270 --> 03:58.520
it will hold some metadata about our data source.

03:58.840 --> 04:05.940
Or what if we have the data views and there, we have categorical but we don't have any values?

04:05.950 --> 04:07.630
So we have the categories and everything

04:07.660 --> 04:11.460
but we don't have values. In all these cases,

04:11.500 --> 04:15.490
so these are quite a lot of checks, in all these cases,

04:15.490 --> 04:25.540
I want to return my data info with these default inputs of a maximum value of 0 and no data points. So

04:25.540 --> 04:30.520
that will then practically render no chart at all, render nothing since we return,

04:30.520 --> 04:36.190
we quit this function but it will also make sure that we don't render anything incorrectly and

04:36.190 --> 04:42.840
that of course here should be data views though. So this is a check you can basically use in your set ups

04:42.860 --> 04:47.740
to check if the data really is there, if you got the data you want to work with.

04:47.800 --> 04:53.650
If you make it through this check, you know you have categories, you have values, you're good to go.
