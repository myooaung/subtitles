Welcome to this course! In this course, you will learn how to use one of the most popular business intelligence tools,

1
00:09.310 --> 00:18.010
Power BI. Power BI is not a single application, Power BI consists of multiple, connected tools

2
00:18.520 --> 00:24.500
and you will get a complete introduction into the entire Power BI universe.

3
00:24.520 --> 00:31.840
We will start with Power BI Desktop, a local application which is only available on Windows computers.

4
00:31.890 --> 00:36.860
However we will learn how to connect Power BI to different data sources,

5
00:37.010 --> 00:44.620
how to work on that data and how to create visualizations - charts for example. And you will get an overview of

6
00:44.620 --> 00:50.680
the core features of Power BI Desktop step-by-step in one big course project.

7
00:50.680 --> 00:57.910
So we could stop after finishing our work locally in Power BI Desktop but we won't. We will continue

8
00:57.910 --> 00:59.730
with Power BI Service,

9
00:59.860 --> 01:06.100
a cloud application which allows you to share your projects and also to collaborate in your projects

10
01:06.190 --> 01:07.580
with your colleagues.

11
01:08.060 --> 01:14.380
Moreover, we will take a look at Power BI Mobile, a mobile application which allows you to access your data

12
01:14.380 --> 01:16.990
from mobile devices.

13
01:17.350 --> 01:19.130
So we could stop right here

14
01:19.570 --> 01:24.620
but again we won't, we want to show you more and to show you more,

15
01:24.720 --> 01:32.390
I'm really happy to welcome Maximilian, an instructor of multiple Five-Star rated courses here on Udemy.

16
01:32.800 --> 01:34.260
Welcome Maximilian!

17
01:35.020 --> 01:35.550
Hi,

18
01:35.590 --> 01:37.190
great to be a part of this course.

19
01:37.270 --> 01:42.130
If you have a look at the other courses I have here on Udemy, you will see that all these courses are

20
01:42.190 --> 01:44.950
programming or a web development orientated,

21
01:44.950 --> 01:47.150
so what's my role in this course?

22
01:47.440 --> 01:53.320
Whilst you will see me towards the end of this module when I will walk you through the course outline, my major

23
01:53.320 --> 01:58.050
task in this course is to do two modules: In the first module,

24
01:58.240 --> 02:04.180
I'll have a look at some advanced data sources or specifically, data sources we can work with in Power BI

25
02:04.210 --> 02:06.810
which are web related.

26
02:06.820 --> 02:12.130
For example importing data from a RESTful API. In the other module,

27
02:12.130 --> 02:17.710
I will show you how to get started building your own custom visuals, so custom charts you could say.

28
02:18.250 --> 02:23.410
Manuel will of course walk you through the basics of Power BI and how to use the built-in charts and

29
02:23.410 --> 02:23.960
so on

30
02:23.980 --> 02:27.510
but if you ever hit the point where these do not suffice,

31
02:27.640 --> 02:33.520
this module might be interesting to you and since we use web development technologies there, that's why

32
02:33.520 --> 02:34.480
I'm doing that.

33
02:34.570 --> 02:38.470
So I hope you'll enjoy these modules and I'll hand it back to Manuel.
