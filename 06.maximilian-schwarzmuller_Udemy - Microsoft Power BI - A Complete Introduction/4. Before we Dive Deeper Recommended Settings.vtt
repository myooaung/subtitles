Before we start our first course project, let's take a look at the options.

00:07.670 --> 00:13.720
So this is still the query editor and we have to close that to access the options menu,

00:13.790 --> 00:17.000
so we go to the home ribbon and press close and apply.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.820
Now we're back in the data model

00:20.060 --> 00:22.560
and before we change the options,

00:22.620 --> 00:30.320
one important note again. In the options, we have two option types available, Global Options and Current

00:30.320 --> 00:38.200
File options. The global options are set for all Power BI projects, the current file options as the name

00:38.200 --> 00:41.950
says actually are only true for the current file where 

00:42.000 --> 00:43.730
you set those options.

00:44.030 --> 00:50.120
So this means we have to open a new Power BI project which we will then use for our course project

00:50.360 --> 00:53.430
to make sure that the options are set correctly.

00:53.450 --> 00:54.730
Now let's do this.

00:54.830 --> 01:02.660
So we go to the file ribbon, press new, now it takes a few seconds to load that Power BI desktop

01:02.870 --> 01:05.310
instance, here it is.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.120
We can close that for a moment because we don't import any data right now

01:10.560 --> 01:15.500
and we can now go to file again, go to options and settings,

01:15.790 --> 01:20.330
here we see that we have data source settings which we will not take a look at right now

01:20.500 --> 01:26.980
and we have options which we will select and in the options, you see that global and current file options.

01:27.730 --> 01:33.520
We don't have to change that global options, so we can directly go to current file and the data load

01:33.520 --> 01:35.250
section, here

01:35.290 --> 01:37.460
I want to adjust three things.

01:37.540 --> 01:43.870
The first thing I want to adjust is I want to unselect the automatic data detection.

01:43.930 --> 01:47.560
This is not happening because I think this is a bad option,

01:47.560 --> 01:52.300
this is a great option actually but I don't want the data to be detected automatically,

01:52.480 --> 01:57.880
I want to do that on our own so that you'll see how this works and that you really get an understanding

01:58.090 --> 02:01.480
on how Power BI desktop understands the data,

02:01.600 --> 02:08.860
this is why we unselect this one. The same logic is true for the relationships, Power BI automatically

02:08.860 --> 02:13.330
detects the relationships that might exist between the tables in your data model.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.730
Nevertheless, although this works good,

02:16.030 --> 02:22.000
we will unselect that to define that relationships on our own and to understand the relationships better,

02:22.150 --> 02:28.360
so let's unselect that. And the last thing is the background data loading option,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.480
this has simple performance reasons,

02:30.520 --> 02:34.240
so the query editor is faster if you unselect that,

02:34.390 --> 02:37.050
so let's do that. Now

02:37.060 --> 02:37.830
we are fine,

02:37.930 --> 02:44.410
we can now press OK to save the options and now we also have to save that project which will be our course

02:44.410 --> 02:49.440
project because as we said, we have that option set for the current file only.

02:49.660 --> 02:54.550
So if we start our project in a new file, then the options won't be set the way we did it right now.

02:54.790 --> 03:04.510
So let's save that by clicking onto file and save as and I will call that 01 population because that's

03:04.510 --> 03:06.290
what the data are going to be about

03:06.730 --> 03:13.840
and you can now select a folder where you want to save that project and in the next video, we will start working

03:13.840 --> 03:14.730
on the project.
