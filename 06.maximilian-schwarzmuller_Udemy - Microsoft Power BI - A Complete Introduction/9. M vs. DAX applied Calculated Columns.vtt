00:02.530 --> 00:10.100
M language, DAX, let's create a quick example to better understand the differences of those two languages.

00:10.110 --> 00:16.520
So here I am back in our course project and we want work on that beautiful visualization for the moment

00:16.770 --> 00:23.400
but we will go to the query editor, our good old friend back again. So we can click onto edit queries right

00:23.400 --> 00:23.910
here

00:25.570 --> 00:30.830
and here we could select the Age-Group table, the DIM-AgeGroup table, right there.

00:32.420 --> 00:38.720
So here we are in our DIM-AgeGroup table, you know the table of course and you also know the applied steps

00:38.720 --> 00:40.340
column to the right,

00:40.520 --> 00:46.930
now another thing you know is that you can see the last step in M language in that formula bar,

00:47.060 --> 00:53.320
so basically what happened with that change type from a code perspective in M language.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.550
Now if you might want to see more about the M language, so maybe what happened with all of those steps

00:58.550 --> 01:05.060
you can see in this language, you can simply do that by going to the home ribbon and then open the advanced

01:05.060 --> 01:07.310
editor, like this.

01:07.310 --> 01:13.640
If I drag that to the left a little bit and then you can see that each of the applied steps

01:13.910 --> 01:18.720
was performed by the M language the way we can see right here, step-by-step.

01:18.890 --> 01:24.890
So you can find the remove other columns, the removed duplicates or the duplicated column, everything in the

01:24.910 --> 01:25.910
applied steps

01:25.970 --> 01:31.320
also in the advanced editor. This is what the M language basically looks like

01:31.430 --> 01:37.370
and the important thing for the moment is that you wrote a lot of M code without writing code because

01:37.370 --> 01:43.940
you only applied the predefined functionalities the query editor has. Now that we know that,

01:44.120 --> 01:51.060
let's press on to done and now create a new column using the M language. Now to do this,

01:51.110 --> 01:56.730
we simply go to add column and now create a custom column like this

01:57.050 --> 02:01.550
and let's name that column M-Test like this

02:02.000 --> 02:04.940
and now we want to combine two things,

02:04.940 --> 02:06.180
let me drag that down.

02:06.470 --> 02:13.310
So I want to combine the Age-Group with the category, I know this doesn't make a lot of sense but I just want

02:13.310 --> 02:18.970
to show you how you could write formulas or really basic formulas of course in M language,

02:18.980 --> 02:26.860
so let's click on to the Age-Group right here and onto the category and to combine those two items,

02:26.900 --> 02:28.570
you can simply write

02:28.640 --> 02:32.840
an AND between those two columns, like this.

02:32.840 --> 02:40.080
So if you now press OK, you can see that we have a new column but that's not named the way I want it to be,

02:40.200 --> 02:48.960
so let me quickly edit that column by clicking right here and now add a second AND, two quotation marks

02:49.580 --> 02:55.710
and a space just to have a little bit more distance between those two column names and press OK again

02:57.420 --> 02:58.570
and now this is fine.

02:58.630 --> 03:01.590
Let's format it as text like this

03:03.130 --> 03:04.280
and now we got that

03:04.480 --> 03:07.170
and now there is one thing that you might note.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.330
We of course have that added custom and that change types step right here

03:11.620 --> 03:17.300
and we also have the formula bar but the formula bar doesn't look like what we did in the custom column

03:17.300 --> 03:17.760
menu,

03:17.770 --> 03:18.200
right?

03:18.250 --> 03:20.290
So you remember, let's go back to that menu,

03:20.580 --> 03:25.070
you can see that we simply selected the columns and then this new column was created

03:25.150 --> 03:31.000
and again, this is due to the fact that the M code, the code you can see right here was created automatically

03:31.090 --> 03:33.600
based on that help window that we have.

03:33.940 --> 03:36.530
So again this is what we did,

03:36.580 --> 03:40.680
we used M code without really writing M code. Now that

03:40.690 --> 03:41.470
we know that,

03:41.620 --> 03:47.710
let's go back to our data model and do the same thing in DAX language,

03:47.770 --> 03:49.320
let's see how this works.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.010
So we have to go to home and press close and apply, right here,

03:54.180 --> 04:00.600
now it takes a few seconds to load the queries and here we are in the data model again.

04:00.610 --> 04:02.430
Now let's go to data view

04:02.890 --> 04:06.400
and here we have that M-Test column that we just created,

04:06.400 --> 04:12.430
now we want to create the same column actually using DAX formulas. To do this,

04:12.520 --> 04:19.070
we can simply go to the modeling ribbon up here and now create a new column, let's click it 

04:19.690 --> 04:23.110
and now you don't see any menu that opens,

04:23.110 --> 04:27.450
you only see a formula bar up here and in this formula bar,

04:27.490 --> 04:34.070
you can for instance select the name and rename it to DAX-Test for instance.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.370
This is the name, if I now press enter,

04:36.670 --> 04:40.000
well nothing happens because the formula is not valid,

04:40.240 --> 04:41.650
so let's change that.

04:41.650 --> 04:47.470
So what we want to do is we want to combine the Age-Group column with the category column again.

04:47.720 --> 04:53.460
Now what we could do is we could simply click that column, like this. This didn't work, right

04:53.690 --> 04:58.690
so we have to select our formula or our column right here again to change that.

04:58.750 --> 05:05.480
Now to combine those two columns, we have two options or two formulas that we can use. One formula is

05:05.900 --> 05:11.980
really similar to the one that we just applied in the query editor, let's start with that formula first.

05:11.990 --> 05:17.600
Now the first thing you have to do is we have to refer to another column, to the Age-Group column. To do this,

05:17.660 --> 05:23.960
we have to write a square bracket first and now we can see that we can select all the columns that we

05:23.960 --> 05:26.540
have in that table that we selected,

05:26.780 --> 05:31.760
in our case we can select the Age-Group column and you can navigate through the columns with the up and down arrow

05:31.760 --> 05:33.360
keys on the keyboard.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.660
If you found the column that you want to select, so the Age-Group column in our case, you can simply press

05:38.660 --> 05:40.490
tab like this

05:40.490 --> 05:43.270
and now you selected the first column.

05:43.310 --> 05:48.950
Now you want to combine this column with another one and you can apply the same thing that we did in

05:48.950 --> 05:50.030
the query editor,

05:50.090 --> 05:58.320
so we can simply write AND, quotation mark, space, quotation marks and that. Now you see in this case, the

05:58.440 --> 06:05.700
DAX language looks like the same that we had in the query editor but remember, in the query editor, we wrote that in

06:05.700 --> 06:07.690
that additional window

06:07.800 --> 06:11.220
but when we looked at the actual code, this looked a lot different than that,

06:11.280 --> 06:12.690
so keep that in mind.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.160
So we want to refer to the second column right now,

06:15.240 --> 06:20.300
so we are again write the square bracket and now select the category and press tab again.

06:20.550 --> 06:27.880
If we now press enter like this, then we have the same result that we had in the query editor

06:28.050 --> 06:29.420
but with the pure formula,

06:29.670 --> 06:34.360
in this case the formula stays the same, it doesn't change the way we did it in the query editor,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.840
so the formula remains exactly the same as we wrote it.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.760
Now we got the result that we want to have,

06:39.900 --> 06:44.770
so we calculated that column both in the query editor and in the data model.

06:44.770 --> 06:51.900
However I told you that the DAX language is a little bit comparable to Excel and Excel is about formulas

06:51.900 --> 06:53.310
with specific functions

06:53.310 --> 06:56.980
and at the moment, I don't see real formulas right here.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.100
Now let's create another column which will retrieve the same result that we can see right here

07:02.280 --> 07:05.580
but with a real formula, let's do this.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.340
So we will click on new column again

07:08.190 --> 07:11.650
and call that DAX-Test, whoops,

07:12.900 --> 07:13.960
two maybe

07:14.410 --> 07:21.030
and now we write the first formula in DAX and this formula is called concatenate, like this

07:21.030 --> 07:26.980
and as you can see, this formula joins two text strings into one single string, into one text string.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.120
So this is what we want,

07:28.240 --> 07:35.320
so if you press tab and now select the first text string and how can you do this, by writing the square

07:35.320 --> 07:37.280
brackets again, like this,

07:38.440 --> 07:41.030
select Age-Group and press tab

07:41.650 --> 07:48.940
and now add the second string like this and now select the category and press tab and press enter, then

07:48.940 --> 07:53.980
you can see that we added another column with almost the same result

07:54.070 --> 07:59.010
but there is the space missing between those two text strings right.

07:59.470 --> 08:03.070
Now let's change that by nesting the formula,

08:03.080 --> 08:07.750
this is also something that you will find in the DAX language, you will kind of combine the formulas or

08:07.750 --> 08:09.550
create bigger formulas.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.410
Let's see how this works.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.630
So nesting simply means in that case that I use the first concatenate,

08:15.640 --> 08:22.800
so I say this is the first part, now I add a second concatenate right here and press tab

08:22.850 --> 08:25.620
and now the first text is this one,

08:25.660 --> 08:31.010
so a space and the second text remains the category one. If we now press enter,

08:32.130 --> 08:39.300
then we can see that we now have that space in our DAX formula or in the column calculated with the DAX

08:39.300 --> 08:40.170
formula.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.600
This is nice,

08:41.610 --> 08:47.070
so now we saw how we can create those two columns with the two languages we have

08:47.200 --> 08:50.100
but what does this mean for our course right now?

08:50.550 --> 08:53.170
Let's think about that in the next video.
