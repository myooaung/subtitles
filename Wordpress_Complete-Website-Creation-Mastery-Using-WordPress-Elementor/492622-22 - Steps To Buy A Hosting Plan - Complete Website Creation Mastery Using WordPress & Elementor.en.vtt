00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Choosing the right hosting plan takes up a bit of study and the search.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.530
It is verde to spend time looking for

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.300
the most reliable hosting plan for your website. And why not?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.310
Because a website is your asset,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.705
HER valuable asset that is going to stay for years to come.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:23.460
So it is very important to build this asset on a ground that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.630
is free from obstructions and dangers of issues like crashing,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
hacking, unreachable, and slow servers.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.330
I would like to ask you,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.980
how did you feel when you try to open some website AND gate gives

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.950
you an edit saying that the website is not reachable do to annex reason.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.275
It annoys you obviously,

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.425
and it forms a very bad impression in your mind.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:53.074
You may even created distrust for that website.

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:54.440
Is it right or not?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.760
Tell me honestly.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.300
Now the same thing happens with every internet user.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.990
So in the process to create a beautiful website,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.800
it is very important to select a trusted, reliable,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.510
and solid hosting plan to place your website on the web.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.535
Since selecting the right Hosting Plan is an extremely crucial step,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:20.630
I will strongly recommend you to research totally before buying the plan.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.520
And if you want my opinion,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.515
based on my experience,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.440
I will recommend you to invest in A20 string if you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.470
going with shared hosting plan and Cloud ways,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.930
if you want to go with cloud hosting,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.140
the services offered by these two companies are very

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.200
good and they provide very good value for money.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.700
Now let me show you the process to purchase a hosting plan for the website.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.620
First, let's go to A2 hosting by making a Google search.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.495
Here, select the plan you wish to purchase and click on Proceed.

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:58.450
You will be asked to enter your domain name if you have one,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.014
or you can use a sub-domain.

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:04.225
Here in the A2 hosting setup,

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:06.685
I will recommend you to use a sub-domain,

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.920
because if you're going with some domain name,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.900
then you will be required to renew it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.520
compulsorily because that will be the root domain for the setup.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.440
So either you use

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.060
some primary domain name that you are going to use for a long period of time while

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.475
setting up the hosting account or else

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:28.975
the best way is to use the sub-domain provided by A2 hosting here.

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:31.540
Also keep in mind that you select

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.270
the most appropriate server location based

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.425
on the nearest location of your target audience.

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.675
Rest of the process is as easy as making an online purchase.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:45.230
You can happily skip the ad on some level for up-selling,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.200
you will be asked to create an account.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.820
Go ahead with the same,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.205
make the payment, and that's it.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:57.290
You have successfully purchased a hosting plan for your website.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.135
Congratulations.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:02.060
Next is Cloud ways.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.310
Let us make a Google search for it.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.285
Here.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.700
Start with greening and account as usual,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.300
and I will try to share some coupon code with you so that you can get

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.565
$30 predict that is almost three months free on Cloud ways.

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:19.775
Do check the section below this video.

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.950
Once the account is created,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.019
after all the verification process,

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.900
you need to select the server and configuration.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.125
Here you have choices to select from digital ocean,

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:33.170
Leinhardt, vulture, Google, and Amazon.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.630
All these servers are excellent and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.869
performance and you can select one based on the pricing,

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.330
server location and your requirement.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.790
If you are just getting started,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.130
I even recommend using digital ocean over

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.535
line art and culture cancer during the luteal phase.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.725
After selecting the server,

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.335
you need to simply install the application,

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.645
that is WordPress. In our case.

00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:58.280
That's it.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.855
There are some outstanding features of labor law on Cloud ways.

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:04.505
Feel free to explore them.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:06.470
It is a very powerful hosting.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.605
In fact, a very powerful cloud hosting.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:14.974
Referring Cloud ways over any other host is important because of the ease of management,

00:04:14.974 --> 00:04:17.840
support, cloud performance, and scalability

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.515
options like you can upgrade the server in just a few clicks.

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:25.250
Also, the support is awesome at Cloud ways.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.085
Plus, you get a flexible pricing plan where you pay for resources as you use.

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:34.535
If you want to make a comparison between the prizing,

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:37.430
make sure you consider the renewal price in A2

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.225
hosting and compare it with Cloud ways to come at a better decision.

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:43.505
Because usually in different host,

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.555
you get a very heavy discount in the initial first purchase,

00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:51.170
but the renin prices are on the higher side.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.770
So we need to consider the renewal price because

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.475
changing the host is not at all an easy task.

00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:02.870
All right, Lastly, if you wish to get a very

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.685
economical hosting for smaller projects or for your practice website,

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.190
then you can even prefer hosting that.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.190
The performance act hosting that is distinct and you

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.385
will find the pricing to be extremely economical.

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:18.920
The process of creating the account is almost the

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.185
same and you will find that regular options,

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.075
like the other web host,

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:27.635
you will be able to easily install WordPress and SSL with just a few clicks.

00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:31.340
So if you want to save a lot of money and hosting by

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.435
compromising with some of the features, refer hosting there.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:40.475
But keep in mind that the economic and products always come with limitations.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:43.880
Like if you compare a2 or staying with hosting,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.400
you will find that there is no clarity in

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.525
the configuration and usage restrictions on hosting it.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:55.400
Lake, for example, you get free SSL and this hosting plan.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.580
But on how many websites that is not mentioned.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.985
So chances are that you may get free SSL,

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:03.770
but only for one website,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.550
and you might have to pay extra for getting more SSL.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.265
It is the same with other economical hosting plans like GoDaddy and named cheap.

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:16.145
You will get the plants at a super economical price,

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:19.535
but there may be restrictions and lack of clarity.

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:23.450
Also, the uptime reduces with the economical ones.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.170
So I will recommend you to make a list of such questions and clear with

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.340
the customer support or the sales team before making the purchase.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.960
And one more thing,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.970
most of the hosting providers provide

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.494
money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the services.

00:06:38.494 --> 00:06:40.085
Ec2 hosting in fact,

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:44.345
offers a lifetime money-back guarantee that is quite unique in itself,

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:48.575
but most other companies have at least 30 days to claim refund.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.235
So if you're not satisfied with the hosting plan,

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:54.020
immediately claimed that a fine,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.730
and move on to the better host.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.800
Because of the need to build up our asset.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.120
We need to build a website on the strong ground only.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.785
Or else we may end up losing the business and customers.

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:08.450
That's it in this lesson,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.050
and we will continue with the free hosting options in the next video.
