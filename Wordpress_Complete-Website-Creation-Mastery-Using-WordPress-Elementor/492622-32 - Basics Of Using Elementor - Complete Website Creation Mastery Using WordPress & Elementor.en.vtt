00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
The editing panel of Elementor is very easy to use.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:10.545
It contains a list of widgets that are categorized into the basic and genital visits.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.345
If you're using Elementor Pro,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:17.035
you've engaged additional categories like the Pro and site widgets.

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:22.475
We will learn about the usage of all the deserts in the upcoming lessons.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:28.085
But for now, let me tell you how to use the blank canvas in this lesson.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:33.170
First of all, the top row that is the header of the website

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.880
and the last row that is the full brunt of the website bought.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.335
The header and footer cannot be edited or created from this editing Canvas.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:50.090
The settings of Header and Footer can be accessed from

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.770
the customizer if you're using the team settings on from the element,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.070
our team builder, if you're using Elementor blue.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.430
So forget about the header and footer while you are on the page. Editing mode.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.115
Here only focus on the main content area of the webpage.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:14.210
You can insert a section by clicking on this plus icon and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.395
selecting the structure with different number of columns.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:25.310
By default, a section is always inserted with a single column.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850
You can start with a simple structure as it can be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.345
customized later on as per your requirement.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:37.910
Here, the blue border line represents a section boundary or a section border,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.625
whereas the gray dotted line represents a column.

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:45.100
You can add more sections above the section by

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.865
clicking on the plus icon here or at the bottom.

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:51.280
If you want to delete the section,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.245
click on there, cancel, I get here.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:56.740
Now to edit the settings of this section,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.855
you need to right-click on the dots here and click on Edit section.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.520
The editing options for this section will open in the left panel.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.415
If you have a look at the top tab,

00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:11.979
you will find the three types of settings.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.020
Number runners layout. Number two,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.275
his style, and number three is advanced.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:19.990
All the settings for sections,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.895
columns, and in fact,

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:29.105
all the visits will have the three types of settings or the three setting tabs,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.970
late, Leon style and advanced.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.785
Always keep this in mind.

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.290
Next, if you have to come back to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.290
the home screen of the editing panel, click on this grid.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.490
Eigen.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.945
Know my dad how deep you are into some setting.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:46.625
If you click on this grid eigen,

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:51.275
you will come back to the home screen of D editing panel like this.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.695
Let us now see what other options I have labeled by,

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.305
right-clicking on the dots here.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:00.815
Well, you can create a duplicate of this section.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:06.335
Next, you can copy this section and paste it in some other location,

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:09.110
up or down anywhere on the page.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.890
Next, you can use the paste style option.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.500
It is like if you want to copy the settings of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.874
one section and apply it to some other section,

00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:21.815
you can copy and paste the state.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:24.200
It is very handy at times.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.310
And if you want to reset a section setting to default,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.530
click on Default state.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.350
Now, the next option is very important.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.799
You can save the section as a template.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.935
And we know that we can reuse that templates

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:43.625
across different pages and different websites.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:46.070
So simply click on Save template,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.935
Give it a name, and click on Save.

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:53.525
By the way, this is the element or template library.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:57.950
Here you will find a huge collection of predesigned blocks,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.020
pages, and a list of alerts that you might have saved.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.800
If you wish to insert a template on this location,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.795
you can simply click on Insert,

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:10.280
and here it is.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.395
The template is inserted.

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:13.745
Very easy.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.450
If you want to use Elementor blocks and templates,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.755
you need to register on element odd ones and create a free account.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:24.440
Then you will be able to insert the free templates.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.080
And if you have the Elementor Pro subscription,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.635
then you can insert the Pro templates as well.

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:34.085
Now, if you wish to export our template,

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:37.895
you can click on the three dots and click on Export.

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:42.710
That template will be exploited in JSON format and you can upload it

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.810
on a website by clicking on this Import option and uploading the file.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.315
If you want to access that templates,

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:52.805
you can click on this folder icon here.

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:58.265
Next, again, right-click on the dots and see what else remains here.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.100
Okay, The next one is Navigator.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.400
And here you can manage the order of sections and columns,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.450
just like we manage lyrics and the graphic designing tool.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.019
It is also useful in changing the order of sections

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:15.740
and you can also rename it by simply double-clicking.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.380
Now, the last thing we have to learn about

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.890
the element or editing panel is this bottom bar.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.525
Here, you will find the page setting option and you can change the title,

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:29.870
status, and featured image for the blog post.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.250
These are the same settings that we did while creating the page.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.635
If you click on the stain option here,

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:41.720
you will find that you can change the background type for this specific page.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.815
It has the same options like is solid colored or an image,

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:47.465
or a gradient color.

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:50.735
If you wish to assign some peach color,

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:53.720
you can select one by going to style and selecting

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.295
the background type as classical ingredient and select the color.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:04.805
Please note that this peach color is only applicable to this specific page.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:09.110
Next, you can enable the navigator from here as well.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.230
Then next is the history option.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.470
Here you will find a log of activities and you can

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.474
easily revert back using the actions and revisions.

00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:22.459
The actions option will have a list of activities

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.550
in the current session before the last update.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.420
And the revisions option will have autosave copies of

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.830
some of the older versions as well before updating.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.020
Next option is to optimize the website for different devices.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.190
It is very important because we definitely want to create

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.535
a responsive website that works very well on all the devices like computers,

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:52.145
mobile phones, and tablets.

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:54.875
You can easily select the desktop preview,

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:57.260
tablet preview and the mobile preview from here,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.275
and optimized their website accordingly.

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:04.910
Next, the IA gun is used to see the preview of

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.745
the page and the update button is used to save and publish the web page.

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:14.525
All the changes that you make on the website.

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:20.315
It is published immediately once you click on this Update button.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:26.885
Also, I will suggest you to make a habit to save your work every five minutes.

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.805
Near the update button,

00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.970
you will find an arrow with some more options.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.750
Instead of publishing the page did globally,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.670
you can save it as a draft and update once the design is completed.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:46.205
And also you get an option to save the page as a template.

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:50.315
Now, if you save a template from this option,

00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:56.900
you will be able to save the entire page Act runs in a single template.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.020
So if you want to save a single section,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.395
you can save from the section settings like we saw earlier.

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:06.140
And if you wish to save a complete page,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.225
you can do it from here near the update option.

00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:15.710
Both will be accessible in the template like lady.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.430
Now remember that you are in the editing mode here.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.455
And to see the preview,

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:25.940
you can either hide the panel or click on the View Page option.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.190
Since vn using WordPress,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.980
you will always find the black bar at the top of

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.430
the page there you had logged in to the WordPress.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.680
You can hydrate as well,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.560
but this is very helpful as you can go back to

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.850
the dashboard by hovering over the title and clicking on dashboard.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.480
Or you can go to the customizer settings.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.750
From customize, you can see the pending updates,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.790
comments, add a new page,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.205
a new post, edit the page settings,

00:08:55.205 --> 00:08:58.145
or edit the page design with Elementor,

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:04.100
you can also redirect to edit the custom layouts like header and footer from here itself.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.030
And if you wish to logout of the website editing mode,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.569
hover over the username and click on logout.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:16.039
This black bar is the shortcut to many settings and options.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.700
If you wish to exit through the dashboard of the admin area,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.935
click on the exit dashboard option.

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:23.090

See you there.
