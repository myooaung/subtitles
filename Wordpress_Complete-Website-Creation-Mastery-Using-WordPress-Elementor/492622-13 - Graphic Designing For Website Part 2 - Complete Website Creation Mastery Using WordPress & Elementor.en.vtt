00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Once you are done with the fundamentals,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.840
it's time to get started with the application of concepts.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.660
Let us start with the images.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.835
In a website project,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:14.415
you will have to use a lot of images.

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:18.915
But the question is that how can you get those images?

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:23.700
From which website you are going to download the images?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.550
Are you thinking of making a Google image search and use those images in the website?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.945
No.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.105
We should not do it.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:37.935
As the images may not have permission to be used for a commercial project,

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.695
and it may raise some legal issues for you.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:45.920
Let me tell you some very good website there you will get

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.980
stock free and high-quality images to use on the website for free.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.240
Yes, you can download these images for free from

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.980
portals like Pixabay, excels, and Unsplash.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.710
Although there are so many other websites as well to download stock free images,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.965
but these three are extremely good.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.595
Apart from this, I have one more option.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.565
You can download the images from free pic,

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:19.415
but it is a freemium site.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:25.040
A freemium side is one on which some of the resources are available for free,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.080
while others are paid.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.470
The images with the ground Akan are the paid ones.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.660
And to get access to those images,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.659
you will have to buy the free pick subscription.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.230
Now, you must be wondering why to pay for

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.855
a free pick subscription when VR getting the images for free from other websites?

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.320
Well, it depends on the collection of images

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.995
and it happens quite often that you need a specific image,

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.625
but that does not belong to any free website.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.625
When we are working on website projects.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.189
And there is a need for some specific images.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.545
The even prefer buying the images from platforms like Shutterstock and Adobe stock.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.160
Here, we have to pay a very good amount of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.225
money for the subscription to get those specific images.

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:19.340
But it is worked because we had at least getting what we wanted.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.615
Just make sure you download the images in that required resolution.

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:25.910
And if the image resolution is large,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.560
you can resize the image to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.460
the required resolution using the technique we discussed in the previous video.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.515
And compress the file size by using tiny PNG or any similar image compression like phone.

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:43.400
Many dinners and tutorials suggest using the WordPress

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.915
plugins to compress images like E triple W image Optimizer.

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:53.785
But I prefer to reduce the file size before uploading the image to the website.

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:56.390
Helps in reducing the need of using

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.085
an extra plug-in and keep our WordPress light and clean.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:07.129
After the images, you will need some vector illustrations to use in the website graphics.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.230
Now, what is a vector?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.110
How it is different from an image?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.115
A vector is an artwork built from Vector Graphics,

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:20.870
which add images created with mathematical formulas. Cone to read.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.920
Don't worry, we're not going to discuss mathematical formulas here.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.960
It simply means you can enlarge a vector art to any size

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.440
without affecting its appearance on making it look blurry in comparison to the images.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.140
So the images, also called lass raster artwork,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.665
will look blurry when we enlarge them or Zoom them.

00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:51.710
But a vector artwork will not blur on zooming in or enlarging even for a,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.365
a holding size billboard.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:59.510
I hope you are clear with the difference between a raster image and a vector image.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.200
Now where to get vectors and how do I get a vector?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.205
Which tool?

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:05.884
Which software?

00:04:05.884 --> 00:04:11.495
Let me first tell you that you will get the free vector graphics from free pick.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.810
In fact, some will be free and others will be paid,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.154
and you can access them if you have a free pick subscription.

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.585
You can also find vector graphics on

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:23.555
other platforms and you can simply make a Google search for it.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.960
But I suggest you to start with free pick only.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.390
The vector graphic file is usually available in the format dot AI or EPS or dot SVG.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.960
These are all vector file formats.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.800
You can edit a vector using Adobe Illustrator.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.655
And it is the recommended tool to create vector graphics.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:50.900
But the Adobe subscription is a bit on the costly side.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.280
So you can make use of an open-source tool like Inkscape,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.060
or at least use a very economical tool that has gravity.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.300
Designer. Gavin designer is

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.700
a decently powerful tool and it comes with a generous two weeks free trial as well.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.400
You can access it on the web or you can download and install it on the computer.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.395
Let me quickly give you a working overview of tools like Canvas,

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:21.515
graphic designer and Adobe Illustrator.

00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:24.380
Let us go to Canvas first.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.280
This is also a freemium tool which has a free version

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.450
and you can subscribe to the pro version for advanced features.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.895
Here you can sign up for a free account,

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:38.465
and this is how the Canvas dashboard looks like.

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:45.050
The Home section consists of quick design menu to select and start creating the design.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.820
Below the act, they'll be the list of designs that you created using Canva.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.835
These designs are saved on Canvas cloud and you can quickly access them anytime.

00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:58.430
Below that are templates or

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.885
pre-designed graphics that you can import with just a single click.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:06.499
If you want to create a custom dimension design,

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.805
then click on Create a design option and select Custom Size.

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:14.644
Here you can enter the width and height in pixels.

00:06:14.644 --> 00:06:17.990
You can also observe that you can find the dimensions of

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.085
popular graphic types by hovering over the title.

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:25.970
The template library of Canva is very good and you

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.765
can use it to save time while creating a graphic.

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:35.240
You will also find a huge collection of photos and icons to use in your design on Canvas.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.865
If you have Canva pro subscription,

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:43.460
then you can even download them and use on any other graphic editing tool.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.210
Let me create a hero section background for the website by selecting Create a design,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.309
clicking on Custom Size,

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:53.780
entering the values 1,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.745
1, 4, 0 by 600.

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:59.975
Is in pixels, and here we have the blank canvas.

00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:04.820
Now, if we follow the steps as we discussed in the previous video,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.575
we are done with the dimensions.

00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:09.230
Now, it's time to select the background.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.645
You can choose a solid color,

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:13.850
a gradient audit external,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.280
odd an image for the background.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.980
Simply click once on the blank canvas and asked the blue selection is highlighted.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.650
You can choose the color from this option.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.635
You can choose a color from the default colors or

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:30.605
click on New Color option to explore mode.

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:33.875
If you have the hex code for some specific alert,

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.405
you can enter that here.

00:07:35.405 --> 00:07:37.835
If you want to insert a gradient,

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:41.840
select the elements option from the left menu and then scroll down a bit to

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.760
find gradients or else you can simply make a search for the gradients.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.970
Here are the different shapes with gradients and you can

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.690
insert them into the canvas with just a single click.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.230
You will have options to insert a two-color gradient,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.770
auditory color gradient in so many different shapes.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.220
If we want the background to be a two-color gradient,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.880
select this rectangular one and inserted by clicking.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.410
Now adjusted dimensions by simply scaling across the corners.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.440
Don't worry if it is overflowing as the shift will be

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.295
masked automatically to the dimensions of the canvas.

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.460
Now, if you want to insert textures,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.935
then select background from the left menu.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.169
And if you want to use images in the background,

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:30.275
click on photos and search for the desired image.

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:34.355
Just make sure you do not insert a photo with the chronic and

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:38.420
as it is available only to the Pro subscribers orders,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.125
your graphic will contain watermarks when you will export.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:46.595
Actually free photos are a bit difficult to find on Canvas.

00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:51.095
All right, I have got one and let me insert.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:55.355
Another thing to notice here is that you are inserting

00:08:55.355 --> 00:09:00.904
different elements and photos and all these are getting arranged in a hierarchy.

00:09:00.904 --> 00:09:04.715
This is the concept of Lear's in graphic designing.

00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:06.785
All the elements make up

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:10.805
a unique layer and you can arrange them in different orders easily.

00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:12.860
This is really very helpful.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.890
Playing with the elements front and back again,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.980
front, again, back like this.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.600
Now, the next step is to use a background overlay.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.445
For that. Let us insert a shape and give a solid color. Do it.

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:34.145
Now makes sure the shape is selected and then click on this transparency option.

00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:37.430
Here you can adjust the opacity by manually schooling

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.790
the wheel and coming up with the ideal overlay effect.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.215
This is cool.

00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:43.710
Right?

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.315
Now, you can insert text,

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:49.630
images and shapes as per your requirement.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.345
Let us add some text to the graphic.

00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:56.485
You will find the text option in the left menu and click on it.

00:09:56.485 --> 00:10:01.870
You will get a library of commonly used form combinations and styles.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.620
You can select one here or else simply select the headings,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.915
subheading or body text.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:14.125
Here you can type the text and adjuster position by simply dragging it with the mouse.

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.915
You can make changes to the styling of the text.

00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:21.430
Experiment with the Ford family font-size form colored bold,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.115
italics, alignment, bullet list, letter spacing, line-height.

00:10:26.115 --> 00:10:29.720
You can also give effects like shadow and curve.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.300
To the text. You will find some additional options by clicking on these three dots.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.640
You can make the text underline or uppercase, adjust the transparency,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.515
enter a hyperlink to the text,

00:10:42.515 --> 00:10:47.135
lock the layer, and create a duplicate of this text layer.

00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:51.155
You can also use Control Z to undo the action

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:55.700
and use control C and control V to copy and paste.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.505
When you click on the text layer,

00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:01.190
you can also rotate the layer like this.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.109
Now, let me create a duplicate of this layer and change the phones.

00:11:06.109 --> 00:11:12.710
If you want to copy the styling of this text layer and apply on the other text layer.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.505
Simply select the copy style option and apply it.

00:11:16.505 --> 00:11:19.115
Using the position option,

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:22.925
you can adjust the order of the layers like front and back.

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:26.330
You can also adjust the alignment of the layered like top,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.705
middle, bottom, left, center, and right.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:31.880
You can also make a selection of

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.510
the two layers by holding the Shift key and clicking on them.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.000
Here, you can group these two layers

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.810
together and adjust the position to make it look uniform.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.885
If you have a look at the menu options on the left,

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:47.840
you will find the option to select elements.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.765
The elements include shapes like lines,

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:54.425
frames, grates, gradients and icons.

00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:58.715
Make smart use of lines and shapes in the design.

00:11:58.715 --> 00:12:04.010
You can make use of frames and grids to Moscow layer inside a shape like this.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.220
If you want to upload custom images to your design,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.644
you can select the Upload option to upload media to your Canva library.

00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:16.130
It is saved in the Cloud and you can easily access it anytime, anywhere.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.080
And Canada has a mobile app as well,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.230
so that you can access your designs on the mobile phone.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.995
Simply click on the image and it will be inserted.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:29.090
You can insert as many artboards or pages in the design

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.095
by clicking on the plus icon or on Add a page.

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:36.379
You can also preview the design and full-screen.

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:38.675
You can change the file name over here.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.505
And once you are done with the design,

00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:44.885
you can click on Download to export it in multiple formats.

00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:48.320
You can check the different file type options have labeled here.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.935
And if you are exporting the designed for use on website,

00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:57.290
you can prefer the JPEG option as it gives the smallest file size.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.875
But if you're getting some major quality issue,

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:04.370
then you can download the PNG one and then use tiny PNG

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.345
to reduce the file size before uploading to the website.

00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:11.600
In fact, I recommend using tiny PNG to

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.495
compress all the images that you upload on website,

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.430
no matter it as a JPEG or PNG,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.040
because even at 10 percent saving in file size

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.490
is helpful for us to reduce the page load time.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.260
This is how you can use Canvas to create graphics from scratch.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.160
Now you can experiment with importing the templates and you will

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.960
see how much time can be saved by using a good template for the design.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.715
And when I close Canvas,

00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:41.810
the design such saved here in the library on the Canvas loud.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.660
Come on, please do some practice on Canvas.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.015
It will help you a lot.

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:50.825
Now, we cannot exit vectors on Canva.

00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:53.090
To edit the vector artwork,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:59.360
you can use Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator or else grab a designer.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.140
Let me tell you the working of gravity designer.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.615
Vector editing is more or less a professional task,

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:12.410
but let us give it a try to at least learn the basic editing.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.310
So let us sign up for a free account.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.900
All right, the account has been created.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:27.170
You need to verify the email and start working on the Garver. Design it.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:33.170
All right, Now here you need to start by entering the dimensions.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:38.240
And you can also start the free trial by clicking on this button.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.695
Okay?

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:43.805
So this is the blank canvas, just like Canva.

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:48.590
On the left, you will find the list of pages and layers.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:54.095
On the top, you have the options menu and on the right you have the styling options.

00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:57.185
You can start by selecting the page background color.

00:14:57.185 --> 00:14:58.850
By clicking on this option,

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.405
you can select a solid color or the gradient.

00:15:02.405 --> 00:15:05.840
You will get some advanced options as well.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.530
Feel free to explore them and test every option if you want to dive

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.130
deep in graphic designing to insert the text,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.225
shapes and elements, you have the options here at the top.

00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:22.835
You can insert a text layer by clicking this and drawing a text-box on the canvas,

00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:28.190
painted desired text, and adjust the styling by using the options on the right.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.050
You can experiment with the fields, borders, and effects.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.530
When you move an element by picking with the mouse,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.355
you will find snapping lines to guide you with the alignment.

00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:44.285
You can also use the pen tool by pressing edge

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:48.080
or selecting from here and move around the document.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.140
You can zoom in and zoom out by pressing

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.395
the Control key and scrolling using the mouse wheel.

00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:58.925
You can switch on and switch off the snapping rulers and grids.

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:02.480
From this option, you can insert shapes and you

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.440
can even use keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.800
And you can place an image by using this option.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.720
In order to scale the image,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.020
you must press the Shift key advice that issue will change in

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.220
resizing and images will look a bit odd.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.615
You can drag the elements with the mouse by holding the click.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.280
And the best part of using

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.835
a vector getting software is that you can customize the shapes,

00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:34.805
size images, dropping everything very easily as per the design requirement.

00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:36.455
For selecting a shape,

00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.805
you have two options.

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:41.840
One is pointed and the other is sub select point,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.820
that is the regular selection mode.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.110
But with the sub select,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.500
you can play with the corners and crop an element.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.080
The pen tool is a powerful tool and it takes some time to master it.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.500
But you can design illustrations and create

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.890
freehand designs which are unique and creative.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.420
There are several options to manage the corners and create a custom design.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.620
It can be an open-ended shape or a closed one.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.010
We won't be going into the depth of the pen tool,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.230
the basic ON tool and freehand tool,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.885
but you feel free to be explored more about it.

00:17:17.885 --> 00:17:21.424
Another very important concept is off masking.

00:17:21.424 --> 00:17:26.885
When you have an image and a shape and you wish to insert the image inside the shape,

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:29.765
just like we used grids in Canva.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:32.540
You can do so by dragging the image layer

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.390
into the shape layer on the left-hand layers panel.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.085
If you want to bring it out,

00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:39.575
simply drag it outside the layer.

00:17:39.575 --> 00:17:42.890
You can also make a selection using the mouse and use

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.415
the layer ordering to bring elements forward and backward.

00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:49.310
If you wanted to bring an element at the top of the layer,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.105
right-click, select, arrange, and select bring to front.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:57.380
These are the general settings and graphic designers.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.750
You can also explore the settings for Adobe illustrated on yourself.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.105
And it works almost in the same manner,

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:10.865
but we'll have way more set of options and features to make advanced graphics.

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:16.565
Now, let us see how you can create a logo in Canva or GAVI designer.

00:18:16.565 --> 00:18:20.240
Go to Canvas and make a search for logo.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.065
You will get more than 100 templates to choose from.

00:18:24.065 --> 00:18:27.335
If you find a suitable one as per your requirement,

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.425
you can simply click on it and it will load in the Canvas.

00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:33.875
Now simply added the brand name and change the colors if you want.

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:37.490
But I always recommend to start with a simple black and white logo

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.600
and fill up the colors after you have selected the color scheme for the website.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.900
Export the logo design in PNG format.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.745
But there is a challenge here.

00:18:46.745 --> 00:18:49.880
Since you are using the free version of Canva,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.745
you wouldn't be able to get the transparent one here.

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:55.735
So no problem.

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:58.434
You can still download it with a white background.

00:18:58.434 --> 00:19:00.940
And now let us see how you can remove

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.349
the background and make it transparent for simple graphics.

00:19:05.349 --> 00:19:09.055
First option is to go to remove Dark BG.

00:19:09.055 --> 00:19:11.500
Here you can upload the file and the tool

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.410
will automatically remove the background for you.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.210
If you are satisfied,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.590
you can download it.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.495
However, you will be able to download only one file in full resolution.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.205
And for the next files,

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.665
you can only download the preview version.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:30.445
The image quality is not sharp enough and the previous version.

00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:33.490
So for that, let me show you another way.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.435
You can go to photo p.com.

00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:39.290
Here, open the file from computer,

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.925
and then click on Select option and click on magic kit.

00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:46.580
Here, you will have to make a few adjustments,

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.550
but you can get a wonderful transparent background for

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.495
the logo in the sharpened high-resolution PNG image.

00:19:53.495 --> 00:19:58.295
Once done, click on OK and then click on File option,

00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:01.220
click on Export As, and select PNG.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.075
Good logo is ready to be used on the website.

00:20:05.075 --> 00:20:07.745
Making a logo using Canvas is good,

00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:09.455
but it has limitations.

00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:12.560
If you have to change the colors are made changes to shape.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.885
You don't have that much flexibility.

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:18.500
So to create professional logos, you must use.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.135
Vector Graphics and a vector editing tool, preferably Adobe Illustrator.

00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:26.720
But we're using graphic designer for the scope of this course.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.250
And let us open Graphic Designer again and create a blank Canvas.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.230
The first step in creating the logo should be to experiment wet form styles.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.769
If you're getting a satisfactory one by using this technique,

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:44.450
then it gets a lot easier because you won't have to create much shapes.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.340
So play around with the phones,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.070
styling like italics, all caps,

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.140
and try to come up with a collection.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.080
After analyzing the different options,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.220
you will form a better idea of the id logo for the website.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.155
Shortlist a few of them and then filter out more to come up with the final been.

00:21:03.155 --> 00:21:06.395
Now, you can add custom shapes to the logo.

00:21:06.395 --> 00:21:08.165
To come up with ideas.

00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:10.850
You can make a Google search and try to analyze

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.035
the logo of brands and companies working in the same industry.

00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:20.435
If you find some common element like leaves are used to represent green companies,

00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:23.870
studentships and educational institute logo and so on.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.110
Once you have some ideas and options in mind,

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.620
head over to free pig and make a search with some keywords.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.950
For example, if you wish to create a logo for real estate,

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.825
you can make a search for buildings or simply make a search for real estate local.

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:41.600
Three pig has a huge collection of

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.965
vector graphics and you will find thousands of low options to choose from.

00:21:45.965 --> 00:21:48.275
If you find some suitable one,

00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:52.190
simply downloaded and open it using graphic designer.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:58.385
Now, the best part of a vector graphic is that it is completely customizable.

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.560
You can select the Shape layers,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.770
and place in your logo art board.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.220
Here you can play around with the size, position,

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.195
and alignment, and come up with the idea logo for the website.

00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:14.285
Always create some versions for the logo like full,

00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:16.790
short and minimal ones to use aspart,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.995
that requirement of the project.

00:22:18.995 --> 00:22:22.070
Once done, click on File option,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.444
click on Export, then click on advanced Export,

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.064
select the canvas option,

00:22:27.064 --> 00:22:29.300
choose the format as PNG,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.120
and change the background to Transparent.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.470
Click on export.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.785
Your logo is ready to use.

00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:38.255
Another thing.

00:22:38.255 --> 00:22:41.450
If you have to export only the selection of layers,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.420
make sure you group the layers before exporting.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.400
You can also export the logo in PDF and SVG format so that you can

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.845
use this file on other vector editing tools like Adobe Illustrator or coral draw.

00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:57.665
This is how you can create a logo.

00:22:57.665 --> 00:23:01.745
Next is to create an illustration image for the website.

00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:06.440
Here also we will make use of gravity designer and free pick,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.990
search for the required graphic with keywords on free pig and download the file open

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.700
Graphic Designer and create

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.885
a new artboard with the specific dimensions as per the requirement.

00:23:17.885 --> 00:23:24.920
You can measure the dimensions on a website using page ruler Redux.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.955
Like.

00:23:25.955 --> 00:23:31.265
If you want to place an illustration in fun off the columns in a two-volume structure,

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:35.495
you can measure the width and height and create a design with the same dimensions.

00:23:35.495 --> 00:23:40.700
All right, so we have got the dimension and we have got the blank canvas,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.719
open the downloaded free pig file and ungroup the layers.

00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:49.655
Now make a selection of the required layer and bring it to the illustration art board.

00:23:49.655 --> 00:23:53.405
Here you can adjust the size, position, alignment,

00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:55.235
and colors, and finally,

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:58.505
export the graphic to use on the website.

00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:04.775
Select the PNG and JPEG format as per the background to climate that Sage.

00:24:04.775 --> 00:24:08.310
Next is to design the icons.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:15.265
Icons are a simple and effective way to draw users into the content of your website.

00:24:15.265 --> 00:24:22.015
Icons are also used to draw user attention and direct them to some specific content.

00:24:22.015 --> 00:24:24.715
So to create custom icons,

00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:29.605
we will have to use Gavin designer yes.

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:36.490
To access a huge library of predesigned icons you can visit flat icon.com.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.709
Here is simply make a search for the required Eigen and download it and SVG format.

00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:45.520
Now there is a reason to download it in SVG and not PNG.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.795
First, you can scale the ICANN without causing it to appear blood.

00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:52.790
Second, you can change the color of the eye again,

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.205
directly from the website editor itself.

00:24:55.205 --> 00:24:57.605
It works well for the line items.

00:24:57.605 --> 00:25:02.345
So always upload DI comes in SVG format and not PNG.

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:06.845
If you want to create a customer again using the one downloaded from flight Eigen,

00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:10.985
simply open the Eigen and graphic designer and make the desired changes.

00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:16.010
Here you can make use of the pen and basic onto create custom shapes as well.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:21.080
You can also change the color fill to a solid color or a gradient color.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.865
Once you are done with the editing,

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:27.094
simply export the file in SVG and uploaded on the website.

00:25:27.094 --> 00:25:31.400
The final thing we have to learn is editing the images.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.335
The most recommended tool to edit images is Adobe Photoshop.

00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:39.800
But you can make use of the free tools like GIMP,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.840
ang photo B as well.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.380
The most important it just mean you have to do in

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.000
an image is modifying the dimensions as per the need of the website.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.005
This can be done by creating a new document in the required size,

00:25:54.005 --> 00:25:58.055
placing the image, and simply exporting it in JPEG format.

00:25:58.055 --> 00:25:59.960
You can also do this in grabber,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.870
design it by a masking the image in that rectangle.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.880
If you want to improve the colors,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.425
then you will have to use either Photoshop or the free tools like GIMP and photocopy.

00:26:09.425 --> 00:26:15.110
Also, you can make a selection to cut-out a specific part or remove the background.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.100
Feel free to explore them as per your convenience.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.830
I will also be coming up with a dedicated course on

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.940
content creation that will include in-depth tutorials to write content,

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.600
graphic designing using dedicated tools and even video editing.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.260
But I believe that you have got a decent amount of knowledge about

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.329
graphic designing that is required in the creating of a website.

00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:41.330
That's it to learn in this lesson,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.430
and we will continue in the next video.
