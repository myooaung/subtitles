00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
The webpage you're trying to open as loading.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.885
Please wait, it is still loading.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.270
Oops, sorry for the delay,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.655
but it is still loading.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.825
Please wait. It has almost loaded.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:20.790
Just a few seconds or minutes or hours.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.185
And finally, Haidt is the page loaded completely.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.215
Whoever hate to ask quite fast,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.450
only half a minute to load.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.310
What do you think? I'm serious on this?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.810
No, absolutely not.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.675
An ideal website should load under three seconds to provide a good user experience.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:47.420
And search engines also take up the page load speed very seriously as a ranking factor.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.740
So it is very important for us to optimize the website for

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.260
loading time so that the web page is loaded preferably under three seconds,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.190
or ADHD are most under five seconds.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.060
It is important to speed up the website loading to ensure a better user experience.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.205
Reducing the page load time,

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:15.590
reduces the likelihood of users getting frustrated and raising the bounce rate.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.380
Although we are using Elementor to design

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.655
the webpages and the codes are automatically generated in the back-end.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:26.360
This is something out of our control to optimize the courts.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.815
And we have to depend on the element or architecture for clean quotes.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.120
And let me tell you,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.670
Elementor has done decent enough to deliver a good page load speed.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.615
But there are a few things that we can control

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:45.920
and optimize to improve the loading time for a web page.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.054
By the way, how to test the page load speed for a webpage, any idea?

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:54.710
Well, you can use many tools,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.470
but the popular ones are GD metrics pinned on and Google PageSpeed Insights.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.089
So come on, go ahead and check the speed of the most famous websites using these tools.

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:13.174
And these tools also provide you suggestions to improve the page load speed.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:19.700
Let us learn some concepts that you can apply to come up with a decent page load speed.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.285
The first factor is the location of the server.

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.925
If you're using some shared hosting plan,

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:30.350
then try to choose the server location closest to the target audience.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.955
It improves the delivery of data from the server to the browser.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.240
Next is to use a CDN.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.465
A CDN stands for content delivery network,

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.930
and it refers to a geographically distributed group of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.985
servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:53.720
Keep in mind that a CDN does not store the content of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.545
the website and it is not a replacement of the web server.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:04.355
It only stores the cashier virgins and deliver it fast to improve the page load speed.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:08.735
Next is to update the PHP version on the server.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:11.300
Always manually upgrade to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.670
the latest stable version of PHP for improved speed and performance.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.740
Next is to use a lightweight team on the website like Astra.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.670
Also remove all the unwanted plug-ins from the website

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.960
or remove the plug-ins that are causing the website to load slow.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.920
Next is to scale the images for appropriate dimensions and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.405
resolution as having the extra large image is of no use to us,

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:40.940
and it will only slow down the website.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.055
You can also compress the image using tiny PNG or else use the plugin like

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:52.640
optimal or a tuple W optimizer to compress the images you upload to Wordpress.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.090
Remember, reducing the image file size is

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.080
a very important factor in improving the page load speed.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.560
Next factor is to use some caching plugin.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.220
Page caching works by creating a static HTML version of your page to serve the visitors,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.370
rather than forcing your server to generate the page from

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.280
the database and PHP files for every single visit.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.515
A caching plugin usually provides minification,

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:23.005
browser cache, and G zip compression,

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:29.215
as well as some good caching plug-ins are light-speed cache and WPA rocket.

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:31.855
Here, light-speed is a free one,

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.585
but WP rocket is a premium plugin,

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:40.630
but it delivers outstanding results as compared to the other cache plugins.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.590
However, stay cautious on using these cache plug-ins as they sometimes break the website.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.630
And we often need to clear the cache at

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.589
regular intervals to maintain the design of the pages.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.740
Well, if all these factors are not able to bring

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.790
up significant improvement in page load speed.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.395
Consider upgrading to a good host or a higher plan,

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:07.760
or simply go for the managed WordPress hosting on Cloud.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.020
That will definitely help in improving the page speed and keep checking

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.165
the PageSpeed data using GET metrics being norm or Google PageSpeed Insights.

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:23.435
And don't stop optimizing your aim the speed under five seconds.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:29.340
That's it to learn in this lesson and we will continue in the next video.
