branding and designing process, WordPress AG Elementor.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.780
If I asked you to create a custom website from scratch,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.030
will you be able to do it?

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
If I ask you to create a website and just Verna,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.880
will you be able to do it?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.125
And if I ask you to create a single-page website,

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.315
will you be able to do it?

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.740

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.535
the project and you will be able to complete the website project very easily.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:12.575
Led me to refresh your learning and recall some of the steps

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:17.690
that we had learned in order to create a custom website from scratch.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.349
Or they start with the research and understand the business.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.260
Take a good brief from the client and analyze

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.245
the competitors to build a reference library.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:31.685
Then developed a branding guide and take feedback from the client.

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.714
After this design, the complete website,

00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:38.810
starting with wireframe and then with visuals like logo images

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.015
and content on Figma or any website designing tool that you prefer.

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:47.240
Make sure you keep taking feedback from

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.375
the client at all the different stages of designing.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.445
Once the design is ready,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.790
you have to just make the WordPress setup and use element or

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.855
visits to apply the design and develop all the webpages.

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:04.130
Integrate the website with all the important platforms and tools and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.660
make sure you optimize the website for responsiveness and speed.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.680
That's it.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.505
That's the process of creating a website from scratch.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.190
This process could also include designing

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.595
the landing pages or setting up a blogging website.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:22.505
And you are ready to handle both.

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:27.785
Next, if there is a client with a very low budget or less time,

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:31.355
you can even create a website for him and just one arm.

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:35.405
For this, you will have to use templates.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.964
You can make use of starter templates by brainstorm force,

00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:42.785
that is for Astra Theme or else

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:49.295
the Elementor template library both have awesome design templates.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:54.725
You can also use the templates available at Envato elements.

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:58.220
All these website templates are well structured and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.969
organized so you can import a complete website template,

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.790
make changes in the content in terms of text and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.540
images and the website is ready for the client.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.195
Just one our next,

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:14.195
if you wish to create a single-page website,

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:18.290
which is although not recommended from SEO point of view.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.050
But still, if you happen to create it,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.390
the process is simple.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.455
Follow the same steps to create a custom website,

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.960
but with just a single page,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.355
that is the homepage.

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:32.900
And for the menu,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.775
you can use custom links that scroll down to specific options.

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:41.570
For this, you need to assign the SSS ID to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.105
every section that you want to scroll by going to the Advanced option.

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:50.615
Do not add any space between the id.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:55.835
Now in the Custom Link assigned the menu label, and in the URL,

00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:00.005
enter the homepage URL followed with the CSS id slug,

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.835
starting with a hashtag,

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:04.325
complete the menu, save it.

00:04:04.325 --> 00:04:08.060
And here is the single page website.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.850
When you click on the menu options,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.325
you will scroll to the sections down on the homepage itself.

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:20.780
All right, so I believe that you are now

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.750
ready with the website creation process and we will continue in the next video.
