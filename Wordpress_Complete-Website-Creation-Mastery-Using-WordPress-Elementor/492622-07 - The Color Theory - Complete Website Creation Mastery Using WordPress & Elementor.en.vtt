00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Welcome to the void of colors.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:08.850
Colors are the first thing people notice when they visit the website and

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.085
the color scheme can make a huge impact on both style and consistency.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.750
So what is a color scheme?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.700
A color scheme is the collection of colors that we need to choose for the website design.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.850
It is also called as a color palette.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.040
It can include as many colors as we want to use in the website.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.440
Each color can be used for a variety of elements throughout the website.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.845
You can divide your color palette into the primary colors,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:45.110
secondary color and accent color based on the application and usage.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.135
The primary color is generally the more dominant color in the website,

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:54.245
and a secondary color is used to give a contrast effect.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:58.175
These colors are used in the section and column backgrounds,

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.875
logo, navigation, and menu.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:04.730
The accent color is used to highlight the standard element,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.025
like a call-to-action button.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:11.195
If we choose the right colors in right combinations,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:16.055
we can engage visitors to spend time on the website and take actions.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:20.539
Colors also help in creating an emotional connection.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.515
But the challenge is that there are over 16 million colors to choose from.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:32.675
And randomly picking a color may not work well in a website design.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.510
So in order to choose the ideal colors for

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.525
the website and make the right color combinations,

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:43.130
let us use some signs and apply the color theory.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.775
Color theory is the science and art of using colors.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.670
It explains how we humans perceive

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.810
different colors and the message that every color communicates.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.155
Let us start by understanding the color wheel.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:02.915
It is a powerful tool that can help you visualize relationships between colors.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.985
According to the color theory,

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:07.295
there are three primary colors,

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:09.680
red, yellow, and blue.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.494
These three colors form the basis of all the other colors.

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:16.955
When we mix the primary colors,

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:21.440
we get three secondary colors that are orange, green, and purple.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.180
And when we combine the three primary and three secondary colors,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.820
we get six tertiary colors.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.150
Now, whenever we start working on a website project,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.880
we need to experiment with multiple alerts

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.090
and select the most appropriate color combinations.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.025
We can also use the concept of

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:44.105
color schemes to come up with the right selection of colors.

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.705
Let us now see the four main types of colors schemes.

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.930
The first one, monochrome color scheme.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.555
It consists of various tints,

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:56.645
shades, and saturation of the same color.

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.465
Next is complementary color scheme.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:04.085
It is based on two colors from the opposite sides of the color wheel.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:07.055
Next is analogues color scheme.

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:12.335
It consists of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.620
And the last one is triadic color scheme.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.650
It consists of three colors that are at

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.085
the points of a triangle drawn within the color wheel.

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.500
Usually, you can give preference to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.410
the complimentary and analagous colors schemes as they are

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.260
effective and easy to apply that the good visible contrasts.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.680
But feel free to use any of these color schemes in your design.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.615
Moving further, we can also divide the colors on the color wheel into two categories.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.730
That is, warm and cool.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.370
Hues that contain higher amounts of yellow and red are considered warm colors.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.440
They evoke a sense of passion,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.845
happiness, energy, brightness, and action.

00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:55.420
On the other hand,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.035
Google Alerts contain higher amounts of blue and purple.

00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:01.930
They are considered more soothing and relaxing than

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.160
warm colors and represent calm, peace and serenity.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.490
There are also neutral colors, like white, black,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.825
and gray, to balance out the color scheme and add contrast to design.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.585
Next, we need to understand

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:21.129
the color systems because there are millions of colors and tanks to signs,

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.540
we can assign a specific color code to represent every color.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.380
The three standard color systems that are used in designing tools and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.194
softwares are RGB, CMYK, and hex.

00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:38.694
The RGB color system is perfect for designs that are seen on screens.

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:42.310
And the color-code is formed by entering a value for red,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.985
green, and blue between 0 to 255.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:50.620
The CMYK color system is ideal for printing design and it is

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.285
also called as the forgone or system comprising of values for cyan,

00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:59.780
magenta, yellow, and black between 0 to 100.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.925
The last one, that is the hex color system is what willing to focus on.

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:10.010
It is a six digit code which is formed by converting the RGB values.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.075
We will be using this system to select alerts for the website.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:19.850
Suppose if you know the RGB values of a color and you want to convert it into hex.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.730
Then simply make a Google search like convert RGB to

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.240
hex and you will get lots of free tools to do it.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.920
Moving further, I would not like to take you in the depth of tints,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.670
shades, hue, saturation, and brightness in this course.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.820
But let me explain you the concept of contrast.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.375
Contrast is a crucial element of any website,

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:46.190
especially when it comes to background color, and text.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.330
To provide a good reading experience on the website,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.755
it is the best to use a white background and dark text color.

00:05:54.755 --> 00:06:00.275
You can also experiment with a dark background and light colored text for some sections.

00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:04.025
This is how actually the light and dark themes work.

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:10.385
Now, let us try to make the color selections and apply an effective color scheme.

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:13.340
For your knowledge, some colors fight with

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.235
each other and some colors become close friends.

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:18.785
Colors that work well together,

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:23.435
create a harmony, contribute to a pleasant user experience.

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:25.145
So far our website project,

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:27.920
you need to select the primary and secondary colors for

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.195
the section and column background, logo, graphics overlays.

00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:38.825
The zinc alert for call-to-action and x scholars for headings and paragraphs.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:41.810
In order to shortlist colors for selection.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.025
We can also use the concept of color psychology.

00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:51.155
It tells about the influence of colors on people's behaviors and moods.

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:53.345
To create a successful design,

00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:57.560
you need to be aware of the color meanings and understand how a color choices can

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.060
influence your users by generating a specific emotional response.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.540
Yes, colored skin evoke emotions.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.505
Let us see some examples.

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:10.625
Red is a strong, energetic gullet.

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:16.070
It can be a bold statement color if you want to draw user's immediate attention.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.145
In fact, many food and beverage companies use red to evoke feelings of hunger. Undesired.

00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:25.760
Orange is a bomb and happy colored that remains

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.510
many users of friendliness and doozy ASM and motivation.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.360
Using oranges that primary color can result in

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.835
a highly memorable site that leaves visitors with a positive impression.

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:43.715
Yellow is another one colored that symbolizes joy, happiness, and sunlight.

00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:46.685
When used strategically on your website,

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:51.050
you can easily inject confidence and inspiration in your design,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.805
but do much yellow can die RDAs and even create NSAID.

00:07:55.805 --> 00:07:58.730
So it is preferred to keep it as an accent color.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.295
Green is a positive and gum colored,

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.200
widely associated with Nature,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.005
Ecology and renewing energy.

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:09.650
Blue is onboarded present intelligence,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.115
trust, Calmness, efficiency, and duty.

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:17.300
It is a smart color and one of the most used colors on the web.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.370
But some of the world's biggest digital brands using it as the primary color.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.500
But bowl has long been associated with royalty, luxury and wilt,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.080
but it is also a mysterious and magical golden combining the energy of red and blue,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.480
it can be an excellent option if you want to

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.215
convey a message of power and trustworthiness.

00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:42.800
Think is great for feminine products or sites with

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.030
content specifically geared towards women and young girls.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.185
Black creates a sense of glass, glamour, power,

00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:53.750
dignity, and it looks velvet,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.000
almost all the other colors.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.210
It is excellent for website backgrounds as it sets up

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.750
a sharp contrast with lighter, a biography.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.880
White is a popular choice for

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.040
modern minimalist websites as it increases readability and bears velvet an eagle,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.590
and the use of whitespace creates a feeling of ugliness and late.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.605
So as seen in our examples,

00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:23.690
colors can have many meanings that resonate differently with each user.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.930
Therefore, it is crucial to have your target audience in

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.500
mind when choosing the color palettes for website design.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.995
Let me also give you some pro tips here.

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:39.305
Start with selecting a primary colors using the color psychologic concept,

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:44.150
or your product or service are the industry you are working in.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.750
You need to think about the target audience and

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.695
good emotional reaction on watching the color of the website.

00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:56.045
You can also research for some popular color combinations and shortlist.

00:09:56.045 --> 00:10:01.430
The choices make a leap Daddy of shortlisted colors in tools like Canva,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.470
Sigma, Illustrator, XD, or any graphic editing tool you prefer.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.830
Next, gum off with a secondary color and accent

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.415
color by applying the concepts of color schemes like monochrome,

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:16.280
analogous complimentary are triadic.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.465
You can make use of tools like Adobe color wheel,

00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:24.140
drank alerts, color homed,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.850
colored space, angularjs, and find some of

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.845
the most trending color palettes and color combinations for inspiration.

00:10:33.845 --> 00:10:36.679
If you are not getting it right by yourself,

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:41.105
you can make a Google search for the most popular and trending color combinations.

00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:46.190
You will get lot many ideas to take inspiration and select colors.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.180
You must also explored the design communities like Dribble,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.909
Behance and get some fresh ideas.

00:10:52.909 --> 00:10:53.945
Okay?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:59.510
So if you like some colored on any website and you want to use the same color,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.150
how do find the colorCode?

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.135
You can use some Google Chrome plugin,

00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:08.090
like I'm using color pick eyedropper and I can

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.525
easily find the color-code and use it in my project.

00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:16.055
It may take some time for you to come up with the right color combinations,

00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:21.890
but it is very crucial as the entire branding of the website depends on colors.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.080
Once you're done with the selection,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.570
update the palettes in your graphic editing tool,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.865
and start the designing process.

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:32.495
Let me summarize the learning of this lesson.

00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:38.030
Galleries play a vital role in the website design and they can evoke emotions.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.880
You can rely on the color theory to come up with

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.705
harmonious ballads and find the right color combinations.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:51.185
Hello, psychology is a powerful technique that can convey a variety of messages to users.

00:11:51.185 --> 00:11:54.035
Lastly, you should always research

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.920
your target audience and test their gullet differences.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.750
Understanding the target audience is a very important step in the website design process.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.650
And that's why I'm repeating it again and again.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.770
Please make sure you understand the visitor.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.660
The more you understand them,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.345
the better you will create the website.

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:19.290
Let us end this lesson here and we will continue in the next video.
