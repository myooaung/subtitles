00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
When you subscribe to Elementor Pro,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:07.394
you get access to the premium features like the team builder,

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.664
pop-up bender forms and integration,

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.830
mouse and scroll animation, global budgets,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.149
dynamic tags, and some 30 advanced widgets to

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:23.430
create interactive web designs quickly and easily.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.900
So let us now learn about the widgets of labor in the Pro version of element of.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.249
Firstly, I would like to tell you what is a global budget?

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:40.214
An element or a global budget is used to control the settings

00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:45.934
of a specific widget is displayed in multiple places on the website.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.369
It means if you want to use a widget across

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:54.290
the different pages and edit all of them together advance.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.914
You can use a global reject.

00:00:56.914 --> 00:01:00.170
For example, if you want to use

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.500
the same testimonial budget at the homepage products page and contact us page.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.230
Then give life to save the section as a template and inserted on all the three pages.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.549
But if you wish to make changes to this testimonial widget,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.475
you will have to edit all the three pages and it will consume unnecessary time.

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.990
Here, you can make use of the global budget because you are using

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.294
the same settings for the testimonial widget on all the different pages.

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:37.774
So save that testimonial as a global budget and inserted on all the three pages.

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:40.670
Now, if you wish to make changes,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.119
adjective visit at one page and the rest will

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.079
be updated automatically because they are linked.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.844
Keep in mind that if you delete the global wizard,

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:55.805
it will be removed from all the pages where it was inserted.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:02:01.295
And global wizard works for widget, not four sections.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:04.654
Some pros, some cons.

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:08.300
All right. Let me tell you the process,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.070
how to create it.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.024
Create any global budget by simply right-click and save as global,

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.544
enter a name, save.

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:22.789
It will be added to this global budgets list near the elements.

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:27.319
It has a yellow border instead of blue.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.219
Now, to insert this global wizard to any other place,

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.034
simply drag and drop.

00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:36.169
But from this global widget list,

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.299
if you want to edit the Global widget,

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.159
click on the pencil icon and it will show that the visit is locked.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.509
You can click on edit and start editing the project.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:51.590
It will be updated at all the places automatically.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.735
And if you wish to edit only the visit on this page and not the others,

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:58.550
you can click on unlink.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.790
It will become a regular budget and now made

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.364
the changes only to this widget here on this page.

00:03:06.364 --> 00:03:10.654
So that is the concept of global reject.

00:03:10.654 --> 00:03:15.155
Now let us discuss the Elementor Pro Widgets.

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:19.009
The first wizard is post.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:24.874
It is used to insert the post archive to the section of any page.

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:29.765
In fact, you can show the archive of pages, products portfolio,

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:36.304
or manually select what sections you want to display in an archive manner on a web page.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:43.475
It is it powerful and commonly used to display block poster archive on the homepage?

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:46.384
If we see the settings for this project,

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:48.514
then under the content tab,

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:54.694
you can change the visuals by selecting the skin from classic guards and full content.

00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:57.559
Change the number of columns and post.

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:03.634
But page you can choose to show the feature dimension and enable the masonry effect.

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:08.194
By the way, masonry is a grid layout that uses

00:04:08.194 --> 00:04:14.074
all the space by reducing any unnecessary gaps between the images.

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:17.390
You can change the image size.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.064
Sure hate the title and the excerpt.

00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:26.525
Metadata, lead modelling, badge, and Avatar settings.

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.520
If you change the skin,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.184
a few options are changed,

00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:34.024
but they are just common ones and easy to understand.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.989
Next, in the query settings have advanced levels,

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:42.800
customization options like choosing the source of content and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.750
including or excluding certain content categories or author.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.740
You can select the boast to show for a specific period of

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.819
time and also manage the ordering sequence of the post.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.089
In addition, you have the options to customize

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:03.034
the pagination elements like numbers and previous.

00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:06.334
Next, under the style tab,

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:10.459
you will be able to adjust the visuals, layout, space,

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.969
alerts, and typography for the image content,

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.349
ANC, pagination, and the advanced settings are again the same.

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.115
You can use them as per your requirement.

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.234
Next is the portfolio widget.

00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:28.834
It is used to display the post pages and

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:33.605
custom post types in an attractive think that able grid.

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:37.490
It works almost the same way as the post budget.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.660
Just, you can add a filter bar so that the visitor can click on

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.030
the filters to see the relevant post and custom layouts in an organized manner.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.960
The settings are all the same with just an additional option to

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.354
enable and disable older filter bar under the style tab,

00:05:57.354 --> 00:05:59.815
again, you get the same set of options with Justin,

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:03.385
additional setting for the filter, but nothing significant.

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:07.540
And the advanced settings are also the same.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.014
Let us now see the next video,

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:12.654
but it does the image gallery.

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:18.864
It helps in adding the complex and beautiful image galleries on the web page.

00:06:18.864 --> 00:06:24.534
This is an advanced version of the basic GAL80 that we learned before.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:30.419
You can add a single gallery or multiple galleries with filter taps.

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.720
You can choose the layout from grid, justified and masonry.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.015
You can manage the number of columns,

00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:42.064
spacing, link, and aspect ratio.

00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:47.735
You can make changes to the filter bar for labels, pointers, and animation.

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:53.555
Also, you can customize the background overlay, title, and description.

00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:55.415
Under the style tab,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.684
you get settings for image overlay,

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.785
content and filtered about,

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:03.619
which are simple as we have learned,

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:05.539
fought the widgets before,

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.665
Advanced that banks are also the same.

00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:16.835
Next visit in Elementor Pro is a special one and it is to add forms.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.990
Using this, you can set up a contact form on

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.584
the website to allow the visitors a simple way to get in touch with you.

00:07:26.584 --> 00:07:30.364
By the way, this is the most important budget,

00:07:30.364 --> 00:07:33.170
especially for landing pages.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.014
Under the content tab,

00:07:35.014 --> 00:07:37.460
you get settings for form fields,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.994
submit button action after submit,

00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:46.654
and some additional options give to form a name and add the fields that you want to show.

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:53.180
The field type contains all the standard and commonly used fields in the form like text,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.200
email, telephone number, text area, radio buttons,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.774
checkbox, date, time, recapture, and mode.

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:04.969
You can use as many fields as you want.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.989
Just make sure that the form filling process should be very smooth and

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:13.925
easy for the visitor and should consume the least possible time.

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:20.375
You can show or hide the label or required mark by enabling or disabling this option.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:24.544
Next, you can manage the settings for button like size,

00:08:24.544 --> 00:08:28.880
weight and alignment steps and Submit button.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.770
Now assign the action after form submission like sending an e-mail,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.319
redirecting the user to a thank you page,

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:41.105
or adding the user to the e-mail marketing tool audience list.

00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:46.654
Here, the first email option is to deceive the submission deserts on your email ID.

00:08:46.654 --> 00:08:51.079
And email too is used to saying an automated e-mail on

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:56.750
the successful submission of the form like an auto responder using Elementor.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.280
You can choose as many actions as you want here.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.200
Next, you can make the settings for the multi-step forms.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.229
By the way, to create a multi-step form,

00:09:09.229 --> 00:09:12.814
select steps from the list field type,

00:09:12.814 --> 00:09:16.849
and this acts as a divider for the step fun.

00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:21.530
You can add more fees and Dave will be displayed in step 2.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.585
Instead of submit button,

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:28.325
you will find the next button in step one and the previous beta1,

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:31.084
along with Submit and step 2.

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:35.794
Multi-step forms are useful when you have more number of fields

00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:40.355
and you want to divide the form filling process into a more logical.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:43.985
And finally, under the additional options,

00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:46.894
you can edit the custom messages that are shown

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:50.015
after submitting a form like the success message.

00:09:50.015 --> 00:09:52.070
Or the error message,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.045
field acquired message or invalid entry message.

00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:57.935
Under the style tab,

00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:01.054
you can manage the settings for fees, content,

00:10:01.054 --> 00:10:02.855
ang button for spacing,

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:06.005
color, biography, and visuals.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:12.094
Pay attention to the steps styling as you will get options to stylize the inactive,

00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:14.825
active and completed step.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:19.924
Leaving the Advanced Options tab for you to try.

00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:23.404
Next widget is the login form.

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.295
It makes it easy to create

00:10:25.295 --> 00:10:30.499
a custom login page instead of the default WordPress login page.

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.210
Under the content tab,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.195
there are options to edit the form fields, button,

00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:39.874
and additional options for directing the visitor after login,

00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:46.219
logout login message and options to edit the label and place holder.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:52.205
Style and advanced options contain the same common settings.

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:54.844
Next is the slides widget.

00:10:54.844 --> 00:11:00.125
It helps in creating simple slides that work perfectly fine.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:03.710
You can create sections slides with custom background,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.500
title, description, and button.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.235
Simply drag-and-drop them to change their position,

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:13.595
duplicate, delete, or add a slide.

00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:15.964
When you click on a single slide,

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:18.665
its options open up for background,

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:21.665
content and style settings.

00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:26.090
You can create n number of slides, adjust the height,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.635
and in the slider options you can adjust the navigation, autoplay,

00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:35.300
boson hover, boards or interaction autoplay speed loop,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.469
and select a wonderful transition from slide or fade.

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:45.274
Also, there is an option to assign content animation from different directions.

00:11:45.274 --> 00:11:46.865
Under the style tab,

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:49.924
you can manage the visuals, space, color,

00:11:49.924 --> 00:11:52.129
and topography of slides,

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:56.179
title, description, button, and navigation.

00:11:56.179 --> 00:12:00.995
The Advanced tab has the same set of settings.

00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:05.360
Now the next visit is Nav Menu.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.109
It helps him using the menus that you have created

00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:12.844
in WordPress and design them in whatever way you want.

00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:18.199
It means you can insert a navigation menu at any part of the webpage.

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:19.970
Under the content tab,

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.449
you can adjust the layout settings like horizontal menu,

00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:26.869
vertical menu, or a dropdown menu.

00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:29.720
Based on the layout you select,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.094
you will get options to edit the alignment pointer,

00:12:33.094 --> 00:12:38.629
animation sub-menu indicator, Anki settings for the mobile drop-down menu.

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:40.475
Under the style tab,

00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:45.934
you can adjust the settings for the main menu drop-down and toggle button.

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:51.454
Make sure you edit the settings for normal hover and active mode.

00:12:51.454 --> 00:12:55.745
The advanced settings are also the same.

00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:59.585
The next widget is the animated headline.

00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:03.920
It is used to create attention-grabbing headlines

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.900
that either rotate or include the highlighted animation.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.820
You can create exciting headlines with eye-catching effects.

Since the styling follows standard Facebook alerts.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.925
So you don't get the option to edit the style.

00:25:04.925 --> 00:25:10.184

00:25:53.634 --> 00:25:58.525
Simply pasted here in the URL field.

00:25:58.525 --> 00:26:05.859
You can enable to show the full text of the post or adjust the settings for the video.

00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:10.494
Next wizard is to add the Facebook page on the website.

00:26:10.494 --> 00:26:15.850
Yes, you can add the Facebook page feed on the website itself.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.484
Simply enter the URL of the Facebook page here in the link field.

00:26:20.484 --> 00:26:23.200
And you can choose the layout options to show on

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.250
the feed like timeline, events and messages.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.715
Enable disable the header, cover photo,

00:26:30.715 --> 00:26:34.270
profile photos, and adjust the height of the visit.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.839
The advanced settings are the same.

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:42.079
The next budget is to insert a custom global template into the page.

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:45.155
This template is usually saved and sync

00:26:45.155 --> 00:26:48.394
with the elementor library for the license account,

00:26:48.394 --> 00:26:52.610
you can make a search for the template name act simply inserted.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.439
If you wish to edit this template from the page itself, publish the page,

00:26:57.439 --> 00:27:03.590
and then you will get an option to edit the template as simple as it is.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.660
The final budget and Elementor Pro is Lottie.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:15.050
Latae. Widgets are small and limited elements which are rendered from JSON files.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:22.685
Simply upload or reference and external JSON file and adjust as desired.

00:27:22.685 --> 00:27:28.114
This widget enhances the interaction by showing animated content on the page.

00:27:28.114 --> 00:27:30.394
You can either create a Lottie using

00:27:30.394 --> 00:27:35.764
Adobe After Effects or use some pre-designed latae animations.

00:27:35.764 --> 00:27:38.345
Simply make a Google search,

00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:41.165
downloaded it to upload a media library,

00:27:41.165 --> 00:27:45.320
or else enter the URL for the external file and Elementor.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.539
We'll fetch it directly from there.

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:50.030
Choose the alignment caption,

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.129
anchor, link on click.

00:27:52.129 --> 00:27:55.879
Under the settings, you can adjust the trigger for animation,

00:27:55.879 --> 00:27:58.835
loop playback speed, start point,

00:27:58.835 --> 00:28:01.085
end point, and reverse.

00:28:01.085 --> 00:28:03.664
Later renderer be SVG.

00:28:03.664 --> 00:28:06.365
For crisp and clear visuals,

00:28:06.365 --> 00:28:10.039
you have some style options to manage the spacing and

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:14.210
visuals and the advanced settings are the same.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:20.150
So these all where the probe visits that you get with Elementor Pro.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:25.625
Along with this, you also get some site visits with the element or team builder.

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:29.539
Let us also see them here.

00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:32.929
The first one is site logo reject.

00:28:32.929 --> 00:28:38.945
It is a dynamic verdict that is used to insert the website logo.

00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:43.460
You wouldn't be able to change or replace the logo from here,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.469
but you can customize the visuals and design aspects up to a certain extinct.

00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:51.335
Next is site title widget.

00:28:51.335 --> 00:28:53.840
It is also a dynamic wizard that displays

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.519
the site title that is assigned in the WordPress customizer.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.839
And here as well,

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:03.140
you can adjust the design and visuals of the title.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.155
Next wizard is page title.

00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:11.390
It displays the page title that is assigned in the WordPress page editor.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.955
Next is Nav Menu.

00:29:13.955 --> 00:29:18.559
It is the same as the left menu that we discussed before in the probe digits.

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.275
Next is search form widget.

00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:26.225
It helps in adding a search bar anywhere on the website.

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:28.190
Next is the sitemap,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.874
which it, it creates a structured,

00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:35.119
organized and accessible SML sitemap of the website,

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:37.819
which provides visitors and search engines and

00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:42.860
easy one-click access to the list of pages on the website.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.600
Next, you will get a widget for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.229
Here you can insert the breadcrumbs to the web page.

00:29:51.229 --> 00:29:54.065
By the way, what is a breadcrumb?

00:29:54.065 --> 00:29:57.739
It is a type of secondary navigation scheme that

00:29:57.739 --> 00:30:01.775
reveals the user's location on a website.

00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:06.169
You must have seen this on an e-commerce store like this.

00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:11.630
Yes, this is a breadcrumb and you can add it by using Yoast SEO plugin,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:16.969
which is very useful for the on-page SEO settings of the web page.

00:30:16.969 --> 00:30:21.050
All right, so we are done with the application of deserts.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.920
And I believe that all these elements are basic,

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.700
general and prove budgets are sufficient to develop

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:35.899
the interactive webpage that engages the visitor and delivers a good user experience.

00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:40.804
I want you to spend a good time practicing all these budgets

00:30:40.804 --> 00:30:46.819
one-by-one for all the setting options that are available for every widget.

00:30:46.819 --> 00:30:52.084
Come on, take some time out and keep practicing.

00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:55.310
And still, if you need some more widgets to

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.149
enhance the design capabilities of Elementor than there

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:02.720
are lot many third party plugins that offered

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.249
you more widgets to add the element of your choice.

00:31:07.249 --> 00:31:09.620
If you wish to explore,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.685
I recommend using the plugin set by Grochow blocks.

00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:17.765
That is a very good one to enhance the power of Elementor.

00:31:17.765 --> 00:31:23.179
But I won't recommend using more plug-ins on the website as it may slow down

00:31:23.179 --> 00:31:26.195
the loading speed and some of the free element or

00:31:26.195 --> 00:31:30.605
add-ons often give bucks leading to errors on the webpage.

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:37.205
So be a bit careful in choosing the right set of add-on elements for Elementor.

00:31:37.205 --> 00:31:42.215
And most importantly, these visits are of no use until and unless you

00:31:42.215 --> 00:31:47.915
apply them to develop the design of the webpages that is ready in the designing tool,

00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:52.280
you have to use these basic general and prove widgets to develop

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.654
all the web pages that you have already designed in Figma or Adobe XD.

00:31:58.654 --> 00:32:03.364
Simply knowing about the working of these widgets will not help.

00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:06.559
You have to apply the knowledge.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:11.285
So go ahead, use all these sections, columns,

00:32:11.285 --> 00:32:16.204
and visits to complete the development of all of the pages

00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:21.365
of the website as per the design that you have created in the designing.

00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:22.219
Good.

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:29.940
All right, that's it to learn in this lesson and we will continue in the next video.
