00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
As I had told you that we will be developing the webpage without any coding,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.520
simply using the drag and drop technique.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.035
And we have reached the stage where we will be learning it.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.570
Now in this blank canvas,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.955
after inserting a section and column,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.480
we need to drag the widgets into the column and use

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.760
the different types of widgets, design the webpage.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.440
It is a very simple,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.120
yet effective way to develop modern-day web pages without the need of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.255
any coding from your end because Elementor is generating coats for you in the backend.

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:45.695
So you just make use of the widgets of label to you and start building the web page.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.070
Now, let us discuss the different visits have labored

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.625
to us in the free element or one by one,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:58.175
the widgets available and free Elementor are categorized into basic, ancient.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:01.400
And if you have the subscription of Elementor Pro,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.855
then you will get the probe deserts and site visits as well.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:10.700
Let us start learning the application of basic widgets in this lesson.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.165
The method to insert a widget is very simple.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:16.055
Simply click on the budget,

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:17.645
hold the mouse key,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.820
drag, drag, drag and drop.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.110
Inside the column, you will see a flag blue rectangular

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.314
shape that highlights the position where the widget is getting inserted.

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:31.369
After placing the visit,

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.055
you can click on the pencil icon and the editing options will open in the left panel.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:41.540
The first visit and the list is in their section.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.830
It is used to create nested columns within a section.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.360
So this widget is actually a new set of section with columns

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.610
and you can use it to create complex layouts like this.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.000
Let us have a look at the video settings options of label for the inner section widget.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.020
Now there is a section and there are columns.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.150
So you're going to edit the settings for section like this and for a column like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.790
this As all the same as

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.230
the section and column editing options that we discussed in the previous video.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.630
The same three main tabs, layout,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.455
style and advanced and the editing options are also the same.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.035
So we need not discuss it again here.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:32.885
But always make a smart use of intersection wherever required.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:36.740
I mean to say that if you want to insert a new column,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.950
you can simply insert it using the Add Column option.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.315
So do not use in their sections unnecessarily as

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:49.130
they add up to the markup codes that we can easily avoid.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.415
Use intersections only to create complex nested layouts.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:56.870
All right.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.565
The next visit of labor and free Elementor is the heading.

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:05.885
It allows you to create stylish title headings.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.270
Use this widget to add titles.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.230
Ask what the design and style that you created in the designing tool.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.190
Simply drag the widget to the section, tag the content.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.375
I just a style settings and adjust the position to master design.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.520
It is very easy.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.090
If we see the settings for this lizard, again,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.414
it has the same three main tabs,

00:03:28.414 --> 00:03:31.025
Content style and advanced.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.450
In the content tab,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.160
you will have to type the title.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.870
You can also type the content directly by clicking on the Heading box on the webpage.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.200
But I personally recommend typing the heading content in

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.865
that title box under this Content tab in the editing panel,

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:52.429
you will find the option called as dynamic tags here in the title.

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:58.130
And you can use it only if you have the Elementor Pro subscription.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.755
But since it is very important.

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:04.655
So let me show you an example how to use it.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.330
Dynamic tags are used to fetch content

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.920
directly from the website or from the current page or post.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.130
And the best part is that it changes automatically as the base content is changed.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.030
For example, if you enter page or post title as a dynamic tag in heading,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.800
it will be fast automatically from the title of the page or post.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.560
And in case you make changes to the title of

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.730
the page that will be updated here automatically.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.575
Let us see another example.

00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:44.375
If you entered current date and time as the dynamic tag.

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.770
The date and time,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.770
we'll keep updating automatically here.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.185
That is very wonderful thing.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:56.075
This is the main advantage of using dynamic tax,

00:04:56.075 --> 00:05:00.335
and you have some extra settings for the dynamic tags.

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:01.820
Click on the wrench icon.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.220
You can change the settings and assign the

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.805
before and after text under the advanced option.

00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:12.860
You also get the option to assign fallback content here.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.745
Fallback option is used to display the default text

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:20.720
in case the dynamic tag is not triggered due to some reasons,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.285
or if the title is empty.

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:29.840
And the action options in dynamic tags vary for different settings,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.135
which means you may find more options in their dynamic tags for some other budget

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:40.985
or other setting option like to show a pop-up on the click of a link.

00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:43.790
Keep in mind that you will get access to

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.755
this dynamic tax option only when you subscribe to Elementor Pro.

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:50.869
Now, below the title,

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.355
you can insert a link,

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:55.055
which means if a user clicks on the heading,

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:57.275
he will be redirected to the URL.

00:05:57.275 --> 00:05:58.805
You will mention here,

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:02.000
this link could be an internal link leading to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.660
a web page on your website or some external link.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.904
Also, there is a small gear icon to open the link options.

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:13.100
It contains options to make the link open in

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.420
a new tab and add nofollow attribute from the SEO point of view,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.095
you can leave the customer attributes here as it is.

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.675
You can leave the size option here,

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:27.365
assign the HTML tag as per the SEO plan,

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:29.315
and adjust the alignment.

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:34.010
These are the basic settings and understood by default.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.235
Just pay attention to one more thing here.

00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:41.615
You will find this small computer device icon near some options,

00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:43.475
and it represents vD.

00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:48.680
It represents that the alignment settings we're doing here is for computers.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.460
If you wish to change the alignment for the other devices.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.850
Simply click on the screen icon and the list will

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.485
open the switch the device out of mobile and tablet.

00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:05.945
So you can make alignment settings different for the different device types.

00:07:05.945 --> 00:07:09.230
It is highly recommended to optimize your website design,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.605
to feel well on all the three types of devices.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:15.410
And you can make the optimization settings

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.295
either at the section level or the web page level.

00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:23.270
Let me tell you one thing here very quickly.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.270
Let us suppose you're designing a webpage and as soon

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.375
as your one section has designed completely,

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.790
you can optimize it for mobile and tablet by

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.745
changing the view from the bottom bar over here.

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:38.345
This will be called as section level optimization.

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:39.665
On the other hand,

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:43.550
you can design the complete webpage and then change the view to

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.890
mobile and then to tablet to make the optimization settings.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.640
This will be called as pH level optimization.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.385
Both the techniques are equally good and you can make a choice as per your convenience.

00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:02.885
But please keep in mind that you have to make your website

00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:08.330
completely optimized for all the three types of devices.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.600
Next, let us see the style tab.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.825
First option is to select the color of the herding.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:18.875
You can easily pick it from the global palette that we have sect.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:21.095
If you want to select some other color,

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:22.760
you can use the color picker.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.595
Next, we have the topography settings and we know how to make changes to the topography.

00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:32.450
You can easily select using the global phones to save time.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.750
Next, you can adjust the shadows happenings for

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.845
your heading and play around with the different blending modes.

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:44.000
Next is the Advanced Settings tab.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.590
And it has almost the same set of options,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.125
but for the heading widget,

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:54.590
like you can adjust the margin and padding,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.375
assigning the scrolling effects,

00:08:56.375 --> 00:09:01.370
mouseover efforts make it sticky or add entrance animation.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.555
You can adjust the background of the heading and the border of the headache.

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:07.595
But there is one additional setting here,

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.220
that is the position setting.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.860
First, you're going to adjust the width of the heading bogs by choosing between default,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.085
filbert in line, Ang, custom late.

00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:21.980
Here, the default is usually the full-width.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.085
And it means that when you insert the heading widget,

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:28.865
it will cover the full width of the columns from left to right.

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:32.885
And if you select the inland verdict option,

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:38.030
the heading wizard will have read only can the content is available and

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.700
there will be an empty space to add some other widget on the right.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.750
Yes.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.475
You will have to assign the inland vert to the other rigid as well.

00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:54.695
Then only it will be pleased here on the empty space of the column.

00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:56.120
This in lane.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.595
Or more precisely, by using the custom worked in percentage,

00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:08.165
you will be able to create nested and complex layouts easily in Elementor.

00:10:08.165 --> 00:10:11.795
You can make a very good use of desorption,

00:10:11.795 --> 00:10:15.020
especially on mobile phones.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.500
Next, you have the option of position here,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.445
and it includes default, absolute, fixed.

00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:24.380
If I choose absolute,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.500
I can place the elements freely on the page,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.775
but I wanted to make it clear that you must use this option only in

00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:37.940
rare designed cases where it is not possible to implement the design without this.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.085
Because this method is not considered good for the responsive website.

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:45.800
And you may need to come up with lot many

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.460
adjustments for devices that will consume a lot of time.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:55.340
The fixed position is used to fix the element to a specific position of the page.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.460
And no matter how much a visitor scrolls,

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.995
this element will stay here only.

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:06.050
Please use these two options very carefully and very smartly.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.040
Rest of the settings like responsiveness are the same.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.384
And you can hide this widget or different devices.

00:11:13.384 --> 00:11:16.835
And you can leave the attributes, certain CSS options.

00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:19.520
It's time to save the word guide,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.695
update the website, please,

00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:24.980
updated at least in every five minutes.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.940
Let us now learn the usage of the other widgets.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.585
Next one is to insert the image.

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:35.930
So click on it, hold it,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.500
drag it, and drop inside the column.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.625
Here you can add an image by hovering over the place holder.

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.350
Click on Choose image.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.380
You can upload an image from computed or insert

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.590
an image that is already uploaded to the media library.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:58.205
Enter the alt text for the image from the SEO point of view and click on Insert media.

00:11:58.205 --> 00:12:03.905
Vow, the image is now inserted to the web page using this image widget.

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:05.045
Very easy.

00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:07.700
Now let us edit the settings.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.340
Either click on the image or click on

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.730
the pencil icon to open the Settings panel on the left.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.365
Let us discuss the editing options and the left mandible seemed three tabs,

00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:23.525
Content, style and advanced image we have already uploaded.

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:28.145
You can use the dynamic tags to automatically insert the featured image,

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:30.125
logo, or auto animate.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.920
Next, you can adjust the size of the image and alignment.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.230
Also, you can add captions,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.770
that is the text line to show below this image.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.610
The captions could be added either at the image in the media,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.425
ADD ODD else using the custom caption option here.

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:51.244
If you select media file here,

00:12:51.244 --> 00:12:55.655
you will get an option to open it in the Lightbox Mode like this,

00:12:55.655 --> 00:13:00.995
or else you can under some URL to redirect the visitor to the link you mentioned,

00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:04.505
and either in the same tab or a new window.

00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.250
By adjusting the settings for the link.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.110
Under the style tab,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.185
you can adjust the image width and height.

00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:17.165
Also, you can adjust the opacity and some CSS filter settings,

00:13:17.165 --> 00:13:19.850
both in normal view and the whole overview.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.185
It can be used to create beautiful effects like these.

00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:28.220
Below that is the border setting to manage the border around

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.735
the image and the very cool box shadow settings.

00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:35.285
You can also adjust the alignment,

00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:40.040
color typography and spacing settings for the caption text.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.220
The last tab is Advanced Settings,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.890
and it contains the same set of settings.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.975
But for the image widget,

00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:50.750
we need not discuss it again and again.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.930
Next wizard is the text editor.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.995
It is used to insert paragraphs to the web page.

00:13:57.995 --> 00:14:00.770
Again, same three tabs here,

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.260
Content, style and advanced.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.045
In the content tab,

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.460
add that text that you wish to type.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.970
You can add it by clicking here as well.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.010
Let me tell you that this is

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.910
a powerful editor and you will get so many formatting options.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:22.730
You can add media to the paragraph from here and adjust that wrapping position like this.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.010
You can adjust the formatting of text,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.910
like making the text bold, italic, or underline.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.405
Also, you can insert bullets, numbered list,

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:34.145
insert the link in the text,

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:37.565
and even make it a full screen editor.

00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:41.855
You can toggle for more options by clicking on this button.

00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:45.590
Here you will get options to make the text strikethrough,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:51.425
insert horizontal line, change the color of specific words or phrases to highlight.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.610
Use blockquote.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.845
I can arrange the alignment,

00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:59.150
use special characters and increase or decrease the indent.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.415
You can assign dropped gap,

00:15:01.415 --> 00:15:06.635
the first alphabet of the paragraph and divide the content into columns.

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:12.545
I must see it is a decent enough editor to insert paragraphs on the web page.

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:14.750
Now under the style tab,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.155
you have the same set of texts, styling settings.

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:24.950
And the Advanced tab also has the same set of settings for this text editor widget.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.300
Now, the next widget we have is the video widget,

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.030
and it is used to embed videos.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.650
Do the web page.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.430
Let us see the settings under the content that you will

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.314
find settings for radio and image awkwardly.

00:15:41.314 --> 00:15:44.495
Let us see the video settings first.

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:47.765
Start that selecting the source.

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:53.450
You can use a video hosted on YouTube, Vimeo, daily motion,

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.180
or uploaded in your media like daily,

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.050
or in fact, whichever place you have coasted.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.710
If you want to start that video from a specific clip,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.965
adjust the start time, the end time.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:10.760
Then there are a few other video options.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.385
You can adjust the autoplay settings,

00:16:13.385 --> 00:16:15.020
mute the video, loop,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.530
the playback to show or hide the player controls.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.725
If you are linking to a YouTube video,

00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:24.680
you can adjust the modest branding settings.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.605
And if you are using a Vimeo video,

00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:31.160
you will be able to adjust the player color as well.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.310
You can even adjust the statistic videos to show

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.630
videos from the current channel or any random video.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.499
Next setting is related to image overlay.

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:46.745
This will help you customize the thumbnail for the video.

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:50.405
You can upload an image from the device and adjust

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:55.220
the image size if you wish to display the Play button that you can make it.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.365
So if you wish to make the video play in the Lightbox Mode by popping up,

00:17:00.365 --> 00:17:02.765
you can select that as well.

00:17:02.765 --> 00:17:05.450
Next, under the style tab,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.335
you can adjust the aspect ratio to desire choice,

00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:13.445
along with some CSS filters to adjust the looks.

00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:19.250
And then you can customize the play icon with color and size.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.739
The advanced settings are the same for the video verdict.

00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:28.790
All right, the next widget is a button.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.785
It is used to add clickable buttons to the web page.

00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:38.900
Please pay special attention to the button widget settings

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.225
because a button is the superstar of the website.

00:17:44.225 --> 00:17:47.780
Via it is a superstar because a button instance C,

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.435
D, E, call to action.

00:17:50.435 --> 00:17:55.050
All right, let us see the settings for the button Vijay.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.850
The content tab has settings related to the button.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.480
The first one is the button type and adjusting register

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.095
default colors based on the butter type, insignificant.

00:18:06.095 --> 00:18:09.815
Then you can insert the button text provided but the link,

00:18:09.815 --> 00:18:13.415
and it is the most important purpose of having a button on the website.

00:18:13.415 --> 00:18:17.810
Visitors should be redirected to some URL on the click of the button,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.650
or a pop-up must appear farther visitor to complete

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.810
the action or to download some file like a PDF.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:33.650
Redirecting is easy by simply entering the URL and adjusting the settings.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:39.530
Opening a pop-up is possible by using that dynamic tags and could download a file.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.100
You can upload land in the media library like a PDF,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.715
copy the link, and paste it here in the URL.

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:50.480
On that click, the file will open in a new tab,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.360
and from there the visitor can download it.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.920
If you wish to download the file directly without opening it in a new tab,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.055
then you will have to assign a custom attribute like download pipe sign.

00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:10.040
Finally, this will download the file without opening in the new dapp,

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.545
then adjust the alignment.

00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:15.410
You can skip the potencies year for carbon.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.135
I can do the button.

00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:21.080
You can select an icon either from the eigentlich, very odd,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.719
you can insert a custom icon by uploading the design in SVG format.

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:31.460
We have discussed the benefits of using an SVG instead of

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.220
a PNG or JPEG for the icons because the SVG files do not blurred at all.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.000
So you can either use some pre-designed of liberal in

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.400
the eigentlich Diddy or else upload

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.975
the one you have designed using the Upload option here,

00:19:46.975 --> 00:19:51.170
adjust the icon spacing and you can provide a button ID to

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.220
track the clicks in Google Analytics or Facebook pixel,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.685
that is the Advanced Analytics portion.

00:19:58.685 --> 00:20:03.290
Next, we have the style settings for the button widget.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.550
You can start by adjusting the topography and then you will get the option

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.095
to adjust the colors for both normal view and the hover view.

00:20:12.095 --> 00:20:15.560
The colors for a button are very important and provide

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.000
the accent color to highlight it from the rest of the content.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.659
Also, you can choose from a variety of Harvard animations

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:27.875
for the button and also adjust the border settings.

00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:32.705
Next, you have to adjust the space inside the button.

00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:37.295
And for that, we have the padding settings here. Pay attention.

00:20:37.295 --> 00:20:38.839
It is important.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:42.109
Use it to make the button bigger,

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:45.739
smaller, dollar, or violated.

00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:49.610
And the Advanced Settings tab for

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:54.050
the button wizard also has the same set of settings letters.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.400
Skip it.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:02.480
Keep in mind that the button is diversity and v know how important it is due,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.065
make very good use of this visit.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:08.854
Next visit is divided.

00:21:08.854 --> 00:21:14.735
It is used to add horizontal line and differentiates to divide the content.

00:21:14.735 --> 00:21:18.590
And that the Content tab you can select from the different styles.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:23.015
After divided, adjust the width and percentage or pixels,

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:29.780
adjust the alignment of the divider and add some element in the form of EXT or icon or

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:37.400
a custom icon by uploading SVG and place it before the divided or after or in-between.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.035
Under the style tab,

00:21:39.035 --> 00:21:41.915
you can make adjustments for color and size,

00:21:41.915 --> 00:21:44.945
often divided as well as the gapping.

00:21:44.945 --> 00:21:50.210
The Advanced tab again has the same set of settings for that divided visit.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.715
Next is the spacer widget.

00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:57.050
It creates a block of space anywhere on the web page,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.850
you can fill this block of space with some color or an image.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.605
But this is not the only use of a spacer widget.

00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:12.320
You can use this widget to create custom shapes and use it on the website.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.450
When I'm sharing a link of the video below to help you learn how to make

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:23.615
custom shapes using this space and reject all liked so forth settings.

00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:25.519
It has only two tabs.

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:29.975
You can create an empty box with the spacer and adjust the height.

00:22:29.975 --> 00:22:31.685
The advanced settings are the same.

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:35.075
Then you can adjust the margin by adding background border color,

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:37.655
positioning, and the same settings.

00:22:37.655 --> 00:22:41.420
So apply your creativity while using the space of

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.450
budget and do watch the video by clicking on the link below.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.735
Next widget is to add Google Maps to the other page.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:54.639
It is an easy way to embed Google Maps in your website.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:57.670
This is very useful for conduct pages so that

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:02.155
your visitors can know where you are located on the map.

00:23:02.155 --> 00:23:08.290
Simply tied to location you want to show on the map and adjust the zoom into the area.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.840
You can also adjust the height of the map.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.810
The style tab has some CSS mentors,

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.665
whereas the Advanced tab has the same settings.

00:23:17.665 --> 00:23:20.485
Next wizard is to insert an iBeacon.

00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:22.870
Keep in mind that icon's play

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.470
a very important role in maintaining the balance of the website design.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.144
So make good use of the icons on the website.

00:23:31.144 --> 00:23:37.880
Simply select an item from the icon liability or upload the custom icon in SVG format.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.530
As I had told you earlier,

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.209
that we prefer the icons in SVG and not PNG or JPEG.

00:23:44.209 --> 00:23:48.740
You can adjust the view for default, stacked and framed.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.760
Also, you can provide a link like we discussed before for

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.380
the button and adjust the alignment under the style.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.235
You can adjust the color for normal view and the hover view.

00:24:01.235 --> 00:24:05.405
You can also make adjustments for size and rotation.

00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:10.670
The Advanced tab, again has the same set of settings for the icon vision.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:18.065
So these all are the basic widgets provided in the Elementor page builder.

00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:21.065
And you can use them to develop the sections,

00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:24.784
columns, and the entire design of the webpage.

00:24:24.784 --> 00:24:26.810
It is very easy to use,

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:33.335
simple drag-and-drop and yet very powerful way to build modern day websites.

00:24:33.335 --> 00:24:37.490
I am sure you will be able to use all of them in developing

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.575
the webpage as per the design that you have created in their designing tool.

00:24:42.575 --> 00:24:46.370
I know it will require a good amount of practice

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.895
to become aware of all the vineyards and setting options.
