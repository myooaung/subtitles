00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
After understanding the business,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.035
you need to come up with a list of pages required on the website.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.010
This will depend on the purpose of the website, customer journey,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.035
total number of products, services,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.065
and the funnel you wish to follow for the business.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.560
And the answers of the questions that we discussed in

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.370
the previous video will help you a lot in planning the website.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.519
You can start by creating a sitemap structured like this and populate the list of pages.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.455
Create a sub-menu category or redirection pages under the main ones.

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:38.444
The most important page in our website is the homepage.

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.020
It is usually the default page.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.345
Visitor sees the first when he visits the website.

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:47.900
In general, the content of the homepage

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.530
could be structured in the way we discussed in the copywriting lesson.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.904
But if we are going to make a single-page website,

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.220
then the homepage is the only page that you will need.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.680
Although I never recommend creating

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.125
a single-page website as it is not at all good from the search engines point of view.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.305
Because if you have pages do not rank on Google,

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.935
you will miss out on the whole lot of important traffic.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:18.650
In general, the basic pages to have on a website are the About page,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.150
the product page, or they'll still Services page, Contact page,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.220
the legal pages like privacy policy,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.480
terms and conditions and an error for 0 for page that is displayed

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.430
when a user requests some pays that is unavailable or does not exist on the website,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.780
feel free to come up with the required list of pages for the website.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.970
And you can also search the industry and check

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.420
modern pages are available on the competitor website.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.520
Next is to take a references and build a template library.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.080
You can take an offenses for the website by visiting the other websites,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.570
you can check what pages they're using,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.894
what color schemes they're using.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:03.124
How would they have arranged the sections and a whole lot inspiration.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.580
It is not like that.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.300
You can take inspiration only from the competitors in the same industry.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.995
You can take inspiration,

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.985
design and content ideas from any website on the web.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.150
You can take inspiration for a single line,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.025
single section, single webpage,

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.950
or for the complete website.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.000
Taking inspiration is not at all a bad thing

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.850
because the more you observe different designs,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.460
the better will be your design output.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.280
I am asking to take inspirations,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.465
not copying the complete design or content into your website.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:44.030
If you wish to use completely ready design than there are

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.130
so many pre-designed webpages and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.955
website designs available to download and use on a website.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:52.475
These are godless templates.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.265
Templates I've labeled for entire website,

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:59.135
a single webpage, and even for individual sections.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.760
Since we are using Elementor,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.260
we get access to a huge collection of templates in Elementor itself,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.675
although some of them are free,

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:10.670
while others are paid.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.835
By the way, Elementor is the Page Builder

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:16.880
we're going to use in our website creation process.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.090
And it is a very popular WordPress plugin to design awesome websites without any coding,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.045
you can import the templates to use on the web page.

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.995
Majestic click of the button.

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:31.880
And since we will be using Astra Theme vivid,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.010
get some more website templates in the Astra starter templates plugin.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.810
This is also a wonderful collection of predesigned websites and the Betas.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.345
If you wish to explore more resources,

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:49.010
I will recommend you to visit Envato Elements and with a small subscription fee,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.980
you will get access to a huge library of Elementor

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.700
templates to download and use on the website.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.995
These templates are helpful in creating a website in a very short period of time,

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:04.610
because you have to just edit the content and replace the images.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.525
That's it.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:06.635
The layout is fine,

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:08.180
we're different and optimized.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.620
We use this technique to create a website and just were not for the client.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.940
There are so many other websites that provide free Elementor templates like

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.340
tyler.com and feel free to explore mode by making some Google search.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.700
Another thing building a template library

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.655
is not just downloading and importing the template.

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:33.245
It is about creating a collection of sections and pages.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:37.220
Let us say if you like the hero section of any website,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.955
you can take a screenshot of it and save in the library.

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:46.580
Don't forget to organize it or else you will end up creating a mess.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.485
If you'd like the About Us page of a website or some call to action section,

00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:56.120
or the layout of a contact form or just anything that is beautifully designed.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.800
Take a screenshot and save it to use as a reference for some future project.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.980
You can even take the screenshot of the mobile and tablet version of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.840
a website by going to the Developer Tools and selecting the device like this.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.765
Now, how to take a screenshot?

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:16.505
I am using a very simple Google Chrome extension called as fire shot,

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:19.610
and it is very easy to capture a screenshot.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.455
And you can spend time exploring the latest website designs on Behance,

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:28.475
Dribble, or of arts to get fresh ideas for the project.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:31.130
You will find lot many collections across

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.534
a variety of websites to get design inspiration.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:38.090
You can create an inspiration board on Figma or any

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.675
website designing tool to create a library of designs.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:45.860
It is totally up to you how you create and manage your liability.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.135
But take my verts,

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:48.830
it will help you a lot.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.530
So we're done with step number 1.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.060
That is the discovery.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.100
We're not aware about the market,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.205
competitors and our customer preferences.

00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:04.295
We have taken references and build a library and it's now time to finalize the content,

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.890
typography, color scheme, layout,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.465
and the website design in the next step that is designing.

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:14.220
See you in the next video.
