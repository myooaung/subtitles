00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
There are 4.7 billion people in the world who are using the Internet today.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.450
They are spending time on getting information, buying products, services,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.245
watching videos, engaging in conversation with people on social media,

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:17.080
instant messaging, and large, small.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.810
So it is an opportunity for you to create

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.980
a website and reach millions of people via Internet.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.770
Website, in the most general sense,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.605
is a form of web presence.

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.790
You can share the content in the form of text, graphics,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.755
and videos on your website and connect with people around the world.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.915
Consider Internet as a market and a website is your shop.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:48.635
Customers can come in to get information and it is open 24 by 7.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:51.890
The best part is that a website gives you worldwide

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.860
axis and you have no limitations to execute your ideas.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.285
Let us now understand that technically concept of a website.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:06.665
According to Wikipedia, a website is a collection of web pages

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:11.435
that is identified by a common domain name and published on a web server.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:15.170
A web page is a unique page that contains information and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.264
content in the form of text, graphics, and videos.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:20.930
So if a company like in this time,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.175
Unilever wants to provide information about its products on the website.

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:28.910
Is it possible to have all the information on a single page?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.795
No.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:35.510
That's phi a website contains n number of web pages that are categorized into

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.720
menu item sub menu to provide meaningful information to the user in an organized manner.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.195
Next is domain name.

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.700
If a user wants to reach your website,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.505
he has to enter some Weber dress in the browser.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.250
It is similar to someone who wants to reach your house.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.005
You should know you at how surges.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:58.265
So a domain name is a unique name that forms your Weber does.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.940
It is always unique and leads to specific websites.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.400
Just like if someone dies in mobile number,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.565
he's connected to you and not anyone else.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:11.735
Just make sure that your domain name should be relevant to your offering.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.010
And at the same time,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
it must be easy to remember and attention grabbing.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.585
The third and last element is a web server.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.210
A web server is a computer where the data,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.285
information, and content of a website are stored.

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:31.370
It responds to user requests 24 by 7 on the World Wide Web.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.830
Whenever the server goes down,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.445
a user will not be able to access the website.

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:40.535
Let us also understand the concept of hyperlink.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.535
Since there are a number of wages and a website,

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:48.245
it is important to link all these pieces together and form a navigation menu.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:52.460
Or user can switch between multiple pages with the click of links.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.225
Usually, the first page of a website is called the homepage.

00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:01.835
And it is the most important web page in your website apart from the homepage.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:05.900
The other, basically just in a website are the about page, services,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.255
page, products, page, contact page,

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.895
privacy policy page, et cetera.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:14.105
Each webpage has some specific information,

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:18.125
and these web pages can be easily accessed by user from a laptop,

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.100
desktop, tablet, or smartphone using a web browser.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.880
When a website is optimized for all these different devices,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.029
it is called as a responsive website.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.465
Let us now discuss the different types of websites.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:38.000
A website that we create can have different goals and purpose based on your idea.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.590
For example, the main purpose of a business website is to provide information

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.555
about the business company or any individual who is doing a financial activity.

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:51.560
By now, every business out there should definitely have a website.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.780
It is a widespread expectation.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.440
Every potential customers in the market will assume that if

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.950
they make a Google search for any x business looking for more information,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.585
they will find your website.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.040
Next.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.265
E-commerce website is where users can shop and make purchases.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.680
It must have the essential features like in

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.890
window display product browsing, filtering by categories,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.800
highlighting special sales, shopping card,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.445
wishlist, and payment gateway to make online transactions.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:27.305
The main purpose of an eagle must website is to make sales.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.180
Blogging website.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.820
They provide information by publishing content

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.865
that is displayed in reverse chronological order,

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:39.035
which means that the latest posts will appear first at the top.

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.620
Similarly, you're going to also create a personal website,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.245
a portfolio website, entertainment website,

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:48.275
news website, business directory website,

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.390
forum website, social media of ABS,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.355
a digital download website,

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:58.505
e-learning website and lots more based on your purpose and IDM.

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:02.855
Since we are discussing the purpose of a website,

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:05.210
I want to ask you one thing here.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.980
Please tell me what is a landing page?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.165

Go ahead and try to answer. Keep thinking.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.475
Keep thinking.

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:21.364
I'm still waiting for the answer. Okay?

00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:23.435
So you are not connected to me live,

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.175
so you will not answer.

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:26.975
Is it?

00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:30.860
No, please don't take up this course like this.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.835
Please feel like you're connected to me live and try to answer.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.520
I'm telling you it will help you a lot and learning

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.700
when a landing page is a dedicated web page with a very specific purpose.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.380
Unlike typical web pages,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.920
which I have many navigation options and encourage further exploration,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.340
landing pages are designed with a specific call to action.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.795
On a landing page,

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:59.405
we want our users to take the desired action that we can consider as a conversion for us.

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:03.575
For example, the Shopify landing page wants you to start free trial,

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:06.485
and it is the only action of label on this webpage.

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:10.670
Seems that by US, they want you to start a free trial and nothing else.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.225
You can even build a lead magnet in this way

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:17.930
and provide some freebie in exchange of their email information.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.830
In this way, you can guide your website visitors to take specific action and

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.970
fulfill a specific purpose as a part of your marketing or sales funnel.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.215
Personally, creating a landing page is my favorite task.

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:34.980
