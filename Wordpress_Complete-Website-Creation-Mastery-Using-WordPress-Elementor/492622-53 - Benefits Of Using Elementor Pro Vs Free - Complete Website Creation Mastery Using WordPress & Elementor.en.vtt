00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.925
Elementor is no doubt the best Page Builder plugin of label for WordPress.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.815
Elementor. It's free version,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.370
offers limitless design possibilities.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.740
Elementor Pro, however, empower skew with more professional tools

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.560
that speed up your workflow and allow you to get more conversions and sales.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.875
So should you bake out your wallet and pay for Elementor Pro,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:33.820
or will you be just fine using the free version of elemental?

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.795
Let us try to understand the benefits of using Elementor Pro.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:44.180
Elementor Pro is technically an add on for the free Elementor plug-in.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.300
That is, if you purchase Elementor through,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.270
you will have both the free element of plug-in

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.500
and the element or Pro plugin active on your website.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.675
First benefit of Elementor Pro is it adds around 13 more visits to build the webpage.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.100
These widgets help you in making the webpage design more functional

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.365
and eliminating the need to use many third party plugins.

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:17.420
For example, the form widget lets you build customized forms,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.150
right from the Elementor interface.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.220
The slider widget lets you include performance optimized sliders.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.120
And the postvisit lets you display your latest post in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.845
a grid without the need of any third party plugin.

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:38.900
I would like to pay special emphasis on the forms visit here.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.825
Contact forms are an essential part of

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:47.105
every website since they are the engines for conversion and lead.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:50.225
Elementor pros forms wizard is

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:54.530
revolutionary because the entire process of managing them is visual.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.050
Design your forms on the front end,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.380
then connect them to any automation marketing platform or

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.085
CRM of your choice for just a few clicks.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.800
Also from the design point of view,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.160
you can add animations and scroll effects to the website

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.555
designed for a stronger impact with Elementor Pro.

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:19.640
Next, if you are running a WooCommerce based e-commerce store,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.785
you will love the addition of a variety of WooCommerce specific widgets.

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:31.250
The next benefit with Elementor Pro is that you get access to the full template library.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.080
We all know that Elementor comes with a very large template library,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.390
but most of the templates are locked in the free version and element or pro analogs.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.415
Then with element or row,

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:48.665
you can use every single page template and block that is labeled in the library.

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:52.475
This will speed up the website creation process.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:56.360
Next, you get the team builder with Elementor Pro,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.650
and it adds powerful new functionality to the website.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.320
With the Elementor theme builder,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.285
you can use the same drag-and-drop interface to build your, the entire team,

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.245
including the header, footer and post templates,

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:16.775
which otherwise is very difficult to customize with the theme settings.

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:20.645
Also, you get the pop-up builder with Elementor Pro,

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:23.120
which is important to capture leads.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.660
It will help in increasing sales and conversions.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.900
You can design the pop-up using drag-and-drop technique,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.655
assign conditions and triggers along with advanced integrations.

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:39.425
And if you are a partial coder, I know CSS.

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.755
You can add custom CSS that free Elementor,

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:49.265
but Elementor Pro lets you directly add CSS ties to individual widgets or sections.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:52.175
If you like to use your own custom CSS,

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:55.535
then this is a very big productivity boost.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.210
Next is global visit in Elementor Pro,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.330
global budgets will save you a lot of time if you're

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.590
planning to reuse the same visit on multiple pages.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.660
So to conclude, you can be happy with three element or if you want to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.045
design a basic website with good content using a flexible team like Astra,

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.895
you will be able to access the pre-designed templates

00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:23.315
using the starter templates plugin by brainstorm force.

00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:27.110
You can plan to upgrade to Elementor Pro when you want

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.965
to create complex designs and landing pages,

00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:34.969
are using WooCommerce to set up an e-commerce store.

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.275
Or if you want team builder and Papa builder and access to

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:45.530
all the premium element or templates along with global visit and dynamic tags.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.420
So the best part with Elementor is that you can start with free and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.564
upgrade step-by-step whenever you feel like upgrading.

00:04:55.564 --> 00:05:01.590
All right, so that's it in this lesson and we will continue in the next video.
