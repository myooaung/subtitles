00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
Pricing, the website development service is a bit tricky.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.010
There is always a decile going on in mind that whether I'm

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.375
charging less or will decline paid this much for my work.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:17.250
Well, there are no strict rules in terms of setting up the pricing for a project,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.525
but we can learn some general methods to make this task easy.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:24.780
First of all, keep in mind that the overall budget

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.140
of the project influences the final product.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.550
It facilitates how many features and functionalities you will be able to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.680
provide and how much time you will be able to spend on the UI and UX of the project.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.750
So the more the budget,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.440
the more the features and time for UI and UX,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.225
it is a simple rule.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:52.055
It is important to come up with right pricing because if you charge low,

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.095
you will not be able to make profit.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.655
And if you charge more,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.699
you could lose the client to some competitor.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.660
We also know that the minimum required cost to build

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.160
a website includes the cost for domain name and hosting plan.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.260
Whereas the additional features like themes and plugins are optional.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.310
Now, if we consider some factors to decide on the pricing,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.705
the first factor would be your skill level or experience.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:25.520
How much value you can deliver to the client in the project.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.870
If you have been working on website development for quite a good time and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.904
you have a very solid portfolio to showcase your work to the clients.

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:37.910
It gets easier for the client to judge the quality and level of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.860
your work and accordingly justify the amount you are charging for the project.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.905
And if you are just getting started,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.810
then I'd recommend you to build

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.180
at least a few sample websites to showcase as a portfolio of your work.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.630
Trust me, you will be able to get a decent price for

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.085
the website if you have a portfolio to show.

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:04.715
The next factor is the project time.

00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:06.995
Based on your work experience,

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:11.990
you will be able to figure out how many are subproject will require to complete and you

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.090
can get more clarity on how much to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.480
charge based on the time you will spend on the project.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.315
Next factor is the type of website.

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:24.275
That is whether it is an information website or static website,

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:28.730
or is it a landing page with conversion optimization and automation?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.200
Or is it an e-commerce store with payment is to be collected?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.645
Pricing depends on the criticality of functions on the website.

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:42.545
Next factor is the niche you are working in.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:47.225
You are into making websites for doctors and medical professionals,

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.480
then you may get a good value for the websites you burn.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.814
But if you are creating basic informational websites for some local vendors,

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:58.385
you may find it difficult to charge high fund the project.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:02.060
Next factor is the scoping size of the project.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.385
Suppose if you are creating a website right from scratch with branding and research,

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:10.235
the pricing will be higher as compared to updating

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:14.405
a previously made website with some minor content changes.

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:19.235
You also need to consider how many revisions you will allow before launching the website

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:24.185
and what will be the yearly maintenance charges for frequent updation, incontinent.

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:29.810
All these factors matter while finalizing the price for a website project.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.210
And if the client needs those extra airline features and functionalities and you

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.995
have to take subscription of some dedicated plug-ins for that specific project,

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.830
then feel free to charge high.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.150
Another important point to consider is the competition.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.120
Check how the freelancers and agencies are

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.345
charging for the website development in your region

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:59.330
or your niche and come up with the ideal pricing based on your skill level and features,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.870
functionalities that you are offering to the client.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.630
Keep in mind that the pricing varies as for the country and location you are working.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.420
At some places you might get a low price,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.009
and at some places you might get a good price even for a small project,

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.400
it is based on the economic condition of that reason.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.015
So try to come up with the regional prices and finalize your one accordingly.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:33.275
And the last factor to consider is the value of the work to the client's business.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.240
Let me make it clear.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.275
It means to charge according to the value you will deliver to the business of the client.

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:47.930
If the website, you can create valine great value to the business of declined,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.435
you can consider charging a higher price.

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.600
And if the ROI for client is not significant,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.180
then you cannot get the premium price.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.675
You will just charge a decent price.

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:02.885
So once you are done with the pricing,

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:07.100
complete the proposal, and send it to the client.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.270
Don't forget to mention the yearly recurring charges for

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.950
maintenance and hosting that the client has to pay every year.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.369
And then you are good at work.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:21.065
You are providing value.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.395
There will be no denial from the client side.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:28.040
So keep delivering value to the clients and

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.310
your business will keep growing all the very best.
