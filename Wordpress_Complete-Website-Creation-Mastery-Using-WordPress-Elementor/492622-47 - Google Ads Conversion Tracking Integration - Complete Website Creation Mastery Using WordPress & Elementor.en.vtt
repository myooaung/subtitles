00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
So I came to know that you are running Google ads and you want to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
drag the date of convergence and run remarketing campaigns.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.100
Is that right?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.105
All right, so what are conversions?

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.630
All the valuable actions that a visitor takes on

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.700
the website and that is valuable for your business are called us convergence.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.339
It conversion can be, for example,

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.255
subscribing to a newsletter,

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:31.070
downloading an app, or buying a product.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.590
Conversion tracking helps to measure

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.000
that defined conversions and assign them to specific sources.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.625
In this way, you can find out whether

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.060
a conversion resulted from digital advertising campaign,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.815
a social media post,

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:48.275
or some direct visits to the website.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.725
But tracking the source is very important.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.945
In order to drag the reserves,

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.320
you need to set up the Google Ads conversion tracking tag

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.560
on the website using the Google Tag Manager.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.465
Let us see how to do it.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:04.415
