00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
There are thousands of people who launched new companies every year,

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.865
but they don't know how to build websites for themselves.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.345
And there are so many running businesses and professionals

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.975
who do not have proper branding and updated websites.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:21.000
Some of them might have website and some of them may not even have websites.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.300
So new guidelines all declines.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.270
So many, so many and so many lines are looking for a website solution.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.500
Every day.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.730
You can help them and come up with a full-time or part-time income.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.590
But if you want to succeed than usual,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.350

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:06.095
you are responsible for making sure that everything runs as it needs to.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.425
You have to make sure you come up with profit.

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:11.300
You have to become really good at

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.050
managing client relations and perhaps employee relationships.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.685
Do. You also have to balance that design work,

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:23.330
that sales and marketing task, batching glides,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.485
sending proposals, gourds, finishing the project on time.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:31.550
And it is really an exciting task to work on new projects

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.855
and with new guidelines to see them getting reserves from the marketing efforts.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:37.730
And yet that say.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.095
So.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.950
Let us see how you can set up the website development business.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.470
The first step is to pick a niche.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.090
You can obviously start by serving all the industries ANC blind apes.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.980
But we know that a jack of all trades can be a master of none.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.555
Tried to bury speciality is over time with specific type of blinds.

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:04.175
Specific industries are specific website types.

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:10.055
It is a fact that if you introduce yourself as a specialist of some industry,

00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:13.535
you will get a bigger response and a beggar pay for the project

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:17.420
instead of presenting yourself as a general web developer.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.020
After all, your speciality will help that lines get

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.730
better and faster reserves by the proven process that you will follow.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.509
So great to come up with a niche selection.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:34.730
Always make sure that the niche you are selecting should have a good score and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.205
good number of active nines and they can

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.955
afford to pay for the kind of websites that you obeyed.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.220
Next, decide what all services you've been offered to the glans.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.330
Weather gear will be providing only website development or

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.850

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.490
Make a list of Wharton solutions you will provide to the guidelines.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.910
Keep in mind that you must deliver value in whatever solution you provide.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.295
So Jews, the services you can provide efficiently or Basin tires to provide

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:22.550
a one-stop solution to clients because glands usually

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.180
preferred to assign a project completely to one agency,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.330
as it is easy for them to follow.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.719
Next is to set your goals.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.154
What is the vision and mission of the agency,

00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:38.000
or as an individual?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.905
What are the financial goals?

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:41.765
What are the repetition goals?

00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:44.645
How many clients you want to serve in a month?

00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:48.904
What do you want to achieve in the coming one year or five years?

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:55.190
Where do you want to see yourself have a plan for all of these right at the start.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.075
Next is to set the rate same charges.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.190
This is a bit tricky,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.825
but to come up with this,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:06.395
check the competitors and find out how much they are charging.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:11.975
Also, have a look at the expenses like your branding expense, marketing, ghost,

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.195
software fees, hosting charges,

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:17.435
themes and plug-ins, office round, employee salary.

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:22.595
If you have some and taxpayer learns through beside the optimum cost of your service,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:28.010
then charging for the website may vary for project to project.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.485
But if you want your business to be successful

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:33.455
and you want to feel good about the work you do.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:39.350
You have to make a profit no matter how big or how small the project is,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.570
then choose a name for the business that is easy to remember delivering and catchy,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.995
setup the legal requirements like getting licenses as body are operating region,

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:51.905
and start creating your digital branding.

00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:53.930
At the very least,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.850
you must create a logo,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.235
font combinations, the lead ballot,

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:01.205

following all the best practices that you have learned.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.720

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:21.635
like Trello or Asana,

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:25.190
that helps in managing the project and boosting productivity.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.130

contract agreements for the services you offer two planes.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:35.540
By the way, what is a website proposal?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.370
Well, it is a document that contains a description of the solutions that you

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.975
will provide to the client along with the cost of the service and time duration.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:49.955
It is a very powerful and important step in solving website development lines because

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.580

solution is committed at certain cost and inserting Dame.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.375
So if I tell you what all do include in the proposal document,

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:08.090
start with the overview of problems and then mentioned that proposed solution,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.490
