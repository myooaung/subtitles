00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
We have learned how to develop the webpages using Elementor,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:10.665
and it's now time to learn how to edit the header and footer of the website.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:17.070
Keep in mind that the header and the footer remains the same for the entire website.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.790
So in order to edit the header and footer,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.675
you can make use of the team settings or as

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:30.950
creative custom header using the team builder feature available in Elementor Pro.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:39.050
Let us learn the team options first as data available for free via using the Astra team.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.260
And it provides us some excellent features and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.115
flexibility to design the header and footer.

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:51.140
Simply hovered over the Appearance option and click on Customize.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.035
This is the place where you can manage

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:58.385
the team settings for different options like global values,

00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:02.075
header, breadcrumb, sidebar, and footer.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:07.965
Our desktop, you will find the name of the active team that we are using.

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:13.150
The first option available to us is the global setting for typography,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.404
colors, spacing, and buttons.

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:19.705
We do not need to use this because we have

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:23.185
already done that required settings in Elementor.

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:26.215
But if we want to use the team settings,

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:28.855
you can assign the values here.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:34.240
Let us go back and the next option is the header builder.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.290
This is what we need to focus on in the Theme Customizer.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.835
It has the same functionality like Elementor,

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:50.310
and you can easily assign the vertex to the primary header above and below header.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.135
Let us see them one by one.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:58.130
The first and the most important one is the primary header.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.855
You can adjust the height of the header and under the Design tab,

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.800
you can manage the Bottom Border weight and color.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.219
Next, you can change the background color as per the design scheme of the website.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:19.700
And then you can manage the spacing via padding and margin settings.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.315
Then it is fully customizable.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.585
To see the list of available widgets.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.820
Click on the plus icon and v gate,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.795
a decent number of elementary widgets like account,

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:36.140
then HTML, logo, primary menu,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.390
secondary menu, search bar,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780
social icons, and custom widgets.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650
You can easily develop the header by using these video.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.080
As for the design declared meant,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.385
let us place a logo at the left of the primary header.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:56.870
You can manage those settings of the logo from the left editing panel.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.520
These are the same settings like choosing the image for the logo,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.170
changing the site title,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.710
I'm choosing the site Eigen or fav icon.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.380
Next, under the Design tab,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.485
you can manage the typography for Site Title,

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:14.735
Act, manage the spacing.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:20.015
Next, let us insert the primary menu on the right side.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:24.920
Click on it and the settings will open in the left panel.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.995
You can even manage the menu settings from here that we learned in the previous lesson.

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:33.845
Create a menu, edit the menu,

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.140
or change them in new locations.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.940
You can manage it very easily.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.540
Now, below this, you can manage the sub-menu worked and container animation,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.795
along with an option to enable item divided.

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:49.655
Under the Design tab,

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.670
you can choose the menu Harvard style hand.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.175
These are really good ones to use.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.540
You will find some more settings and alluded to the sub-menu container,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.060
the color settings for the menu links under normal hover and active mode,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.560
hydrography settings, menu spacing and margin.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.960
Everything can be customized as per the design requirement.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.035
Next, you can add a button and design it using the editing options.

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.635
I'm sure you can now manage these general colors,

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.145
typography, and spacing settings to develop the element.

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:30.485
As per the design department.

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:35.780
Usually we keep only these widgets in the primary header.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.140
You made it placed the button with social icons and you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.740
can even make use of the above header section.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.860
Let us place the social icons here at the right.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.945
In the carbohydrate section.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:53.435
You can manage the genital and design settings to customize the visuals.

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:56.795
By the way, you can manage the height,

00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:01.235
colors, and spacing for the above header as well.

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:07.310
Feel free to add the required widgets here or in the below header section.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.855
Well, one more feature that we get in the free Astra team is that transparent header.

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:18.425
Yes, it is a very good one.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.120
In their transmitter antenna.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.150
The hero section starts right from the top of

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.990
the beach and the header is placed above the hero section,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.815
which gives a modern look to the website.

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:36.530
Click on Enable on Complete side and the options will open up.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.310
You can disable the transparent header on certain post AMP pages if required.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.215
You can also choose to enable the transparent header on both desktop and mobile,

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.485
or desktop and only mobile.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:56.420
You can even use a different logo for the transparent her dead if required.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.205
Under the Design tab,

00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:00.470
you can adjust the bottom border,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.220
background overlay colored, and the color settings for the menu and other header options.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.715
But be very careful with the color settings by using

00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:15.335
a transparent header because the hero section will act as the background.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:18.800
And so you need to choose the color scheme with

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.305
the right contrast to maintain proper visibility of the links.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:29.660
Click on Publish here at the top to save vt,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.745
it's not over yet.

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:35.015
When you change the device state to mobile,

00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:38.360
you get some more widgets like the toggle button,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.550
Andy off Canvas section.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.285
You can customize the toggle button for glucagon field.

00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:46.880
And in the off Canvas settings,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.744
you can choose from the different Canvas appearance styles, position, and alignment.

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:56.930
You can adjust the colors under the Design tab.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.055
If you wish to add more widgets in the off Canvas section,

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:05.704
click on the plus icon and select the required widgets.

00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:07.910
So in this way,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.175
you can customize the header design using the Astra Theme Settings.

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:18.140
And I must see that these settings are quite powerful.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.760
Once done, click on Publish and lexico back.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.945
Now, the next option in the customizer is to enable the breadcrumbs if required.

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:36.815
Next, we have Settings and alluded to the blog and vivid learners in the upcoming videos.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:38.525
So let's skip it here.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.184
Next option is to manage the site BOD,

00:07:42.184 --> 00:07:46.790
and it is more of glass managed on the page level itself.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.860
So let's leave a kid.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.190
Next one is the footer builder.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.050
This is important.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.975
Just like Ve created the header,

00:07:56.975 --> 00:08:01.190
we can now easily develop the footer as well.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:08.135
Here also, you get the primary footer and above footer and a below footer section.

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:12.935
Click on the primary footer settings and you can manage the number of columns,

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.370
layout, width, and alignment.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.725
And under the Design tab,

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:21.950
you can manage the colors and spacing.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.125
Same for the above and the below footer section as well.

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:31.655
Now click on the plus icon to add the widgets to the footer.

00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:36.875
And I believe it is now an easy task to develop it.

00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:43.415
Then you have some empty widgets and let us see what all you can do that then.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:45.575
Let's start with number 1.

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:47.390
Here on the left.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:54.635
In the settings, you can assign a visit to this visit section from a list of options.

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:58.625
You can choose from archive, audio player,

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:02.225
calendar categories, customers, DML,

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:04.535
liability of safe sections,

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:09.154
gallery emerge, modelings, navigation menu, list of pages,

00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:12.440
recent comments post RSS feeds,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.810
a search form, back load,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.955
ext, or a video.

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:21.110
Well, some of these visit options are outdated,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.750
but still you can use the text and image and design the custom widget.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.305
Rest all important widgets like the social likens,

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:35.405
the footer menu and copyright tag is already available to use.

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:38.840
You can relax as the copyright tag contains

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.260
the short code to automatically update the year.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:49.565
So you can design the filter with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:54.555
And don't forget to optimize the folder for mobile and tablet as well.

00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:59.920
Also keep in mind that the header and footer will remain the same for the entire website.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.095
So design it accordingly.

00:10:02.095 --> 00:10:09.400
And these all are the Astra Theme Settings for the header and the footer.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.790
Now, let me tell you another simple way to

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.880

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.274
Give this layout our title.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:46.670
Now from the type of template, select folder.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.630

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.205
