00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.405
If we talk about the basic structure of a webpage,

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:07.395
we can easily divide a web page into three main sections.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.585
Numbered one is the header,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.255
number 2 is the main content area,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.430
and number three is the folder.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.750
Now, herder is the topmost section of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.730
a webpage and it is usually consistent for all the web pages in the website.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.030
It means that you have to design a head at once and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.065
the same adder will be visible on all the pages of the website.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:31.850
In the header section,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.295
you will find the logo and it is usually placed at the left are centered position.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:40.880
Make sure you link the homepage, do the logo.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.505
It means if a user clicks on the logo,

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:46.595
he is redirected to the homepage of the website.

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:50.825
Next, you will find a navigation menu in the header section.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.050
It is usually the primary menu of the website and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.800
helps the user in switching between the multiple web pages.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
The menu options can also have sub-menu to

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.880
categorize the pages and provide a more logical navigation.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.095
Already trending navigation menu design is the mega menu.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:12.530
If you have a large website with multiple categories and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.080
subcategories than mega menu gun show the entire navigation into a single menu.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.320
It also enhances the visual display of the menu,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.734
thereby making it more attractive.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:27.710
You can also find a button at the corner of the navigation menu,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.635
and it acts like a call to action for the visited.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:34.010
By the way, let me ask you a question.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.090
What does it call to action?

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.040
Come on, give it a try.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.009
Okay. So a call to action,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.564
or CTA is the desired action that we want our visitors to take on the website.

00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:55.990
It is usually highlighted to stand out from the other content and it

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.625
guides the visitor with what to do next on the website.

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:04.000
You can also find social media links in the header section to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.435
encourage visitors connect with the brown on the social media.

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:11.230
Now to add more space to the header section

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.550
and above hydrodissection and a below header section is pleased.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.725
They are also quite useful if there is more information to show At the top of the page.

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:24.345
Lake, you can show the special deals with an urgency element,

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.515
an important notices in the above header section.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:32.195
You can also plays the contact info and social media links in the section.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:36.110
The other one that is below a dissection that can be used to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.115
show the secondary menu or any additional information.

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:47.015
It is your choice to display these sections on the entire website or some specific betas.

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:51.245
Now let me tell you about some friending header designs.

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.990
The first one is sticky header.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.380
It sticks the primary header at the top of the screen.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.380
Whenever a visitor schools down the webpage,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.990
it tells him providing a quick access to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.665
the navigation menu without having to scroll again to the top.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.890
Next Header design is set transparent headed.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.360
It looks very cool and give some modern field to the website design.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.535
I personally like this a lot.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:21.049
So this was about the first section of the webpage.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.075
Now let us discuss the next one.

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.265
That is the main content area.

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:29.090
It is also called as the body of the webpage.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.570
It is the most flexible section of the website and you have

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.055
full freedom to design it aspart the purpose of the website.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.450
On a web page,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.755
you always want to show specific information related to the title of the page,

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.110
like and about the space will have information about

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.680
the profile and the Contact Us page will have contact details.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.120
But you can design it freely by using text, images,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.040
graphics, and videos to convey the information in the most effective manner.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.665
This main content area is designed by placing sections and columns.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:08.090
All the content like text, images, videos,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.455
and other elements are placed inside the sections and columns.

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:16.775
Sections control the vertical area that is from top to bottom,

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:21.710
and columns control the horizontal area that is from left to right.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.000
The first section of a webpage is called as the hero section,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.310
and it contains the hero image.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.125
It is the first content that a visitor sees on the website.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:39.170
We all very well understand that the first impression is the biggest impression.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.790
So all the websites must ensure that the hero section design should have

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.430
a triggering impact and it should generate a sense

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.490
of trust and credibility in the mind of the visitor.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.480
The hero section must degenerate and excitement to motivate

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.775
the visitor to explore more content on the website and eventually take an action.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:01.055
After the hero section,

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:05.870
you can insert various other sections aspart the content demands of the webpage.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.500
Like we usually find a short summary of the about page products,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.870
services, features, pricing, Media Gallery,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.495
and testimonials on the homepage.

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.509
If you ask me about the length of a webpage,

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.855
I would say that a web page can be as long as you want,

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:25.400
but always tried to provide information in the shortest possible length because

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.215
the visitors are always busy and VKC cannot afford to waste their time at all.

00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:33.830
Be as creative as possible so that it remains

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.265
the easiest for the visitor to understand what you want to say.

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:39.095
But in the least time,

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:43.430
the last section on the web page is called as foolproof.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.030
The purpose of a website footer is to help visitors by adding

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.005
information and navigation options at the bottom of the webpage.

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:53.420
As visitors have a general tendency to

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.495
quickly scroll the webpage and reached the bottom median.

00:05:56.495 --> 00:06:01.070
It is the ideal place to put the current year and the copyright symbol.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.975
However, you can also place the social Huygens secondary navigation menus,

00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:09.875
links to the privacy policy and other legal pages, disclaimer,

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:12.800
contact details, email sign-up forms,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.155
and even a final call-to-action.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:20.150
So let me summarize of learning in this video.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.130
While creating a website,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.565
you have to focus on the three main sections in a webpage,

00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:29.545
the header, main content area, and the food.

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:33.560
I recommend you to start with designing the header and footer

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.835
first because they remain the same for all the pages of the website.

00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:43.145
And then start designing the main content area as it will be different for every webpage.

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:48.930
We will learn more about the designing concepts in the upcoming videos.
