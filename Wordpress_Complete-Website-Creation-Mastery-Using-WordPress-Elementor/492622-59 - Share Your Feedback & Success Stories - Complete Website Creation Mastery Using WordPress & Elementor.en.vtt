00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.415
All right, so I am now done speaking and now it's your turn.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:09.375
I want you to tell me how was the course experience.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.390
I request you to take some time and provide me

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.035
feedback about the content and quality of discourse.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:21.090
If possible, please provide a detailed feedback so that I can understand what

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.950
all things are working for you and

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.760
bottle aspects need to be improved in the scores from my site.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.279
And if this course delivered value to you and transformed good careers,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
please share your story in the form of a short video

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.715
explaining our journey before the course and after the course.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.625
I will really appreciate your feedback and support.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:49.010
Once again, I thank you and wish you all the very best for the work ahead.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.155
And I will be here always because you have lifetime access to this course.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.810
So wherever you feel like revising a topic,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.770
simply play the videos again and again and again,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.570
as much as you want.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.070
All the very best.
