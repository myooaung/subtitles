00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
All right, So we are completed with the foundations

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.590
and let us now take the first step to create the website.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.645
What is the first step?

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:13.290
The first step we have to take is to discover.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.285
Here, we have to understand the business,

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:18.590
understand the product or service,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.395
understand the market, competitors,

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.235
and most importantly, understand the customers.

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:30.080
If we develop the right understanding of the business and customers,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.390
then only we will be able to create a website that converts.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.030
I have been telling you to think about the purpose of creating the website.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.120
And now I want you to dive deep and come up with an outline for the website.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.180
You can divide the plan into four sections.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.655
The first is the business.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.375
It can be either an individual or a company.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.745
Second is the market.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.775
Third is the audience hall customers,

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:04.040
and fourth is the website.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.135
You have to come up with answers to some of the questions.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.310
Let us start with the first one.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.155
That is the business.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.235
What does the product or service the businesses providing?

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:20.959
It can be a physical one or a digital version, a professional service,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.940
or just an informational platform with useful content is available to read.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.420
Try to deeply understand the product and service.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.435
That is the first question you have to answer.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.725
Also, you need to go through the details like history of the business.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:38.945
Your speciality is your USP.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.775
That is unique selling proposition.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.950
This is a very important gland,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.800
figured out how the solution you are providing is going to benefit the customers.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.295
Finally, great to come up with the company values,

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:57.635
the core messaging and the voice of the company to set up a tone for the content.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:01.460
How do you want to talk to the customers?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
Come up with an answer to all these questions.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.175
Next is to understand the market.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.815
Tried to come up with the target market,

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.860
geography's and competitor websites,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.470
VOT funnel the competitors are using.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
Is it a direct sales approach or an e-mail nurturing process?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.515
What is the current industry trend?

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:23.630
What is the design drained for this,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.020
the content tone, what is the sales funnel?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.160
Next?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.370
And most important thing is to understand the audience and target customers, right?

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.515
To come up with the audience habitat,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:38.690
their challenges and pain points.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
Plan out the complete customer journey on the website,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.625
how many pages he will have to browse before reaching the action.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:54.125
The last step is to plan the website based on the answers of the previous questions.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:59.479
The characteristics of an ideal visited who was going to visit the website,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:06.319
figure it out for do they expect to find or what action they want to take on the website?

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.720
What is the primary goal of the website?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.770
Is it information or sales or just leads?

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.904
If you are grading the website for yourself,

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:20.270
then you can spend time thinking about the answers for all these questions.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.715
And if you are dating the website for the client,

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:26.825
send him that template and ask for the complete brief.

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.540
It is a very important step in the process of

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.425
website creation and it is followed to build brands.

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:34.445
Yes.

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:40.760
I want you to take up this task like you had building a brand and not just a website.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.210
After all, we create websites to grow the business.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.045
But if we do not follow the best practices,

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.505
we may not get the desired results.

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.100
If you are just starting up the business.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.560
Competitive research or websites that offer

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.910
similar services will help you a lot in getting this brief.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.520
The more you learn about the business,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.339
the better you will be able to design the website and generate returns on investment.

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.354
So once you are done with these questions,

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:12.095
you are ready to proceed.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:15.330
We will continue in the next video.
