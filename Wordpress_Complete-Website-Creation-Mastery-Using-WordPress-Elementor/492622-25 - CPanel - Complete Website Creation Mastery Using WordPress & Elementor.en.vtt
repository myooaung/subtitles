00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
When you login to the hosting plan,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.100
you have to access the control panel in order to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.625
manage the website files and other important settings.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.460
There are different control panels, have labeling,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.530
different hosting plans, but the most commonly used control panel is the C panel.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.275
So what is a cPanel?

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:25.880
Then? A C panel is a popular control panel dashboard that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.035
helps you manage the web hosting server using a graphical and human friendly interface.

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:39.500
Using cPanel means you don't need that technical knowledge to manage the web server.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.665
Let us now see how a cPanel works.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:47.420
Well, this is the C terminal inside the E2 hosting account.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.880
It provides you so many options,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.620
but we have to focus only on marriage domains, managed subdomains,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.040
install WordPress, manage the website files,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.040
manage backups, managed PS3 versions,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.095
and manage email accounts.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:06.720
Feel free to explore the remaining options as well.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.395
Now, on the right,

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:11.770
you will find the usage data and statistics as we

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.340
are provided with the limited resource on any hosting plan.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.520
So I will always recommend you to keep an eye on

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.650
the usage statistics to stay aware of your consumption of the sources.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.515
Let us start with domain management.

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:31.120
You might have already provided a domain name when setting up the hosting plan.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.240
But if you used the sub-domain here,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.345
you can add that domain names from this option.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:41.110
When you have to add more websites to the hosting account,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.920
you have to list the domain under add-on domains.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.570
Simply click on Create a new add-on domain and type in the domain name here.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.980
Click on Save.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.050
It may take a few hours to install SSL on this add-on domain automatically.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.565
And you will have to wait for around two to four hours till the process is complete.

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:07.190
Then only you will be able to install WordPress on this add-on domain within SSL.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.110
Next, if you wish to add subdomains to your existing add-on domain,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.865
you can click on subdomains and click on Create a new sub-domain,

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.700
select the primary domain name and provide

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.794
a sub-domain details that you wish to have and click Create.

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:28.130
It will also take a few hours to install SSL and one stern,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.380
you can proceed to install WordPress.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.380
You will have to make the WordPress installation from the C panel itself by

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.610
using the software Oculus App Installer, it is very easy.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.690
We will see the complete process to install WordPress in the next lesson.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.720
Next, after installing WordPress,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.770
if you have to access the root directory and files of the website,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.075
you can access it by using the File Manager option in cPanel.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:03:00.610
Just keep in mind that never experiment with the File Manager option.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.960
Because if you mistakenly delete some of the important files,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.900
then your website may crash or you may lose the Access to login to the website.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.230
Please be very careful in using this option.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.780
Next, you can take backup of the website using the back-office OUT option here.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.800
Next, you can also manage the PHP version of the server.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.790
You can update it to the latest stable version and it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.720
is used to improve the speed and functioning of the website.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.165
Make sure you always updated to the most stable and latest version.

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.240
Next is to manage the e-mail accounts.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.480
You have the option to create and manage email accounts for

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.795
the domain name that is also called as a webmail.

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:51.430
It is like your business e-mail ID and it is a must to have nowadays,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.514
based on the hosting gland features,

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:58.400
you will be able to create n number of webmail accounts to create a new VM mail,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.565
use this e-mail accounts option here in cPanel.

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:05.555
Choose the domain and create a username and password.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:08.900
It is available to use instantly after creation.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.920
You can access this web mail directly from here or by using

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.105
some email client app like Microsoft Mail or Apple Mail,

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.400
or some third party app like blue mail,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.725
on both computer and mobile phone.

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:25.580
There are so many other features and options of label with cPanel,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.880
but we have learned the ones that are useful for us.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.390
Let us now proceed to install WordPress in the next video.
