00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
All right, so finally, we are here.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.370
We have learned all the basics and fundamental concepts.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.000
And we have also learned the first two steps that is discovered and design.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.250
Now it's time to start.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.370
The final step, that is development.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.380
And the first thing we're going to see is the domain name fundamentals.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.625
Then you are now familiar with voters a domain name,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.335
let me repeat it.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.845
A domain name is the unique web address for a website on the Internet,

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:38.405
like google.com is the address of google,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.465
and Facebook.com is the address of Facebook.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.120
These web addresses are unique.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
It means if one's a web address is taken,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.610
you will not get it.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.600
Keep in mind, once a domain name is registered,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.060
you will not be able to get it unless it is being offered by a reseller.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.485
Yes, domain name reselling has also gained popularity,

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.580
wherein people by popular domain names in advance and then sell

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.020
them at a higher price based on the premium newness of the domain name.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.855
So if you don't want to end up paying a huge amount of money for a domain name.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:22.580
I will recommend you to register a domain name at the very earliest.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.735
That is the first fundamental concept of a domain name.

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.840
That is, act very fast.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.230
Next, we have to discuss some depths to select

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.610
the right domain name for the website. Let us start with it.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.995
Names have power.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:44.285
This is as true for a website as for anything else.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:48.965
It is important to choose a domain name that works for the business.

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:52.610
It often creates an impression for the website.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.030
You can also include some keyword or

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.085
just a niche word used in your industry to show relevance to the visitors.

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:05.585
And most importantly, a domain name represents your brand.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:09.065
So if you already have a brand or creating one,

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.185
choosing the right domain name is very essential.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.610
You can always start the process of selection by brainstorming.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.070
Because who else apart from you knows, urine, Frank, better?

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.055
Think it from the customer point of view.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:29.030
Next, you can get some ideas and inspiration from

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.350
business and domain name generators like brand bucket or domain.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.285
We'll come up with a raw list and answer the following questions.

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:40.805
Do you feel good about the name?

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:45.020
Do you like it? Are you confident when you say It?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.640
Does it feel good when you write it down or when you read it?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.200
Is it brand double?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.009
Is it unique, easy to remember and meaningful?

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.235
Is it easy to read and spell?

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:00.860
Does it pass the Google Fest?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.850
Go on Google.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.675
The name.

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:07.340
Ideally, there should not be any other organization to pop up.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420
If there are, you at least want to make sure they're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.830
not in the same industry or even in a closely related industry.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.815
We never want to get into the legal issues.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.895
Next, you're going to experiment with the new TLEs.

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:26.270
Tld stands for top-level domain.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.610
It is basically the extension in the domain names like.com dot n dot,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.164
dot IO, dot store dot online.

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:40.775
If required, you can go for country-specific TLD is like dot us,

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:45.590
dot ibm dot FR to target a certain geographic area.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.160
Earlier, people used to prefer.com as it

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.474
is the easiest to remember and relate to a website.

00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:56.705
But now it is common to find other TLEs in the domain name.

00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:01.490
It is up to you and definitely you can give the first tried to.com only.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.605
But if it is unavailable,

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:05.750
you can think about the other options.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
And sometimes using a DLD makes the domain name more relevant to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.805
the business like I have used dot Academy for my website.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:17.600
It clearly represents that I am providing some sort of training on

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.350
my website while making the selection of domain name.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.440
Make sure it is relevant to the business and brand.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.860
Make sure it is short and clear, creative,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.345
and easy to remember,

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:31.864
easy to read and pronounce.

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:34.880
Also make sure it is easy to type.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.005
Your visitors should be able to type your domain name without a problem.

00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:43.055
If you have to explain the spelling more than once to a visitor,

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:45.875
it should be understood that it is complicated

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:49.070
and you should not take any complicated domain name.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.920
It may lead to potential visitors to mistake

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.025
your domain and end up on a different website.

00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:58.235
Also, avoid hyphens and numbers.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:01.040
Once you have finalized with the domain name,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.670
do not delay even as single second and registering it.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.805
Come on, heck, very fast.

00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:11.945
One more concept to understand is that of a sub-domain.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.925
So what is a sub-domain?

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:17.180
A sub-domain is a part of the domain name that comes

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.795
before the main domain name and domain extension.

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:24.725
To understand this, let us understand the structure of a URL.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:30.560
A URL contains two parts that are protocol and the domain name.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.005
A protocol is a set of guidelines that a browser follows to send a request to the server,

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:42.260
like HTTPS or HTTPS colon slash slash www, like this.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.115
Whereas a domain name consists of two parts.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:51.605
The TLD, that is top-level domain like.com gotten angry acidity.

00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:54.605
That is second-level domain like Facebook,

00:05:54.605 --> 00:06:01.100
Google or Rahula Rohde is sub-domain contains a second name before the SLD.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.220
For example, if Facebook launches a course,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.480
it can have a sub-domain,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.775
lake cores dot facebook.com,

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:10.565
and this will be a sub-domain.

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:15.740
A sub-domain is commonly used to logically separate website into sections,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.775
and every section is a separate website identity.

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.895
You can use a sub-domain to launch a career site.

00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:26.405
If forum site for customer support,

00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:30.725
you may use subdomains to create blocks of different teams to

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:36.155
all these sub-domain websites are unique and indexed separately on Google.

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:39.110
And you have to install WordPress separately because

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.740
these subdomains are unique identity.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.255
And in this way,

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.540
you can use a single primary domain to create n number

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.275
of subdomains to create different websites.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:54.650
So that's it to learn in this lesson,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.100
and we will learn how to register a domain name in the next video.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.820
See you there.
