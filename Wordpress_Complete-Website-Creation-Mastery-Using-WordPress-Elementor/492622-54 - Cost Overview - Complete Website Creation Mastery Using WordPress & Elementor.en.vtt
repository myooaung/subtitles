00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
One more thing that you must be wondering

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:07.665
that how much total amount of money you will have to spend in order to build a website.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.125
Well, to understand this,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.365
let us divide the total cost into two categories.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:16.665
First category is the required cost,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:18.525
that is the compulsory cost,

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:20.715
which is impossible for you to avoid.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:25.125
It includes the cost for domain name and hosting plan.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.245
Next category is the optional cost.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:31.140
That is the cost that you can avoid if you are

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.275
willing to sacrifice on features and functionality.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:38.155
This includes the cost for themes and plugins.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:40.970
Let us start with the first category.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.135
And in it, the first thing is the domain name.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:46.940
Well, a domain name is very economical to get.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.420
The cost of the domain name depends on two factors.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.065
Number 1, where you register your domain name.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:58.445
And number two, what domain extension you want to use.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:02.330
The cost of a domain name can start from $5 and go up to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.349
$50 as per the choice of DLD or extension.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.590
But in general, a $10 dot com extension is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.310
recommended for beginners and most of the business websites.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.000
Next is the cost for hosting plan.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.845
You will always get a special deal on the first year of hosting plan.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:25.940
And you can also buy it for a long-term to get more discount.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.255
In general, A2 hosting static plan costs around $80 for the first year,

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.884
and Turbo Boost costs around 180 dollars.

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:38.600
And if you're going with Cloud ways than

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.485
a Digital Ocean server starts with $10 per month.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:48.080
So the basic compulsory required cost with a good performance hosting would

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.005
be somewhere around $90 or six to 7 thousand rupees for the first year.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.800
Keep in mind that this is the cost for the first website.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.255
You can save a lot of money if you create multiple websites.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.625
If you're going with Cloud ways,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:10.265
the cost for one-year hosting would be little more than the A2 hosting startup plan.

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.910
But here you have to make the payment on monthly basis.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.685
You wouldn't be paying the amount of friend.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:20.870
This might be a more convenient option for some of you.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.705
By the way, you get monthly payment options on A2 hosting as well.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:33.095
So it all depends upon your requirement of the type of server and resources.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:39.260
So this category one is that compulsory cost for creating the website.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.235
And this is the cost for creating the first website.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.950
If you wish to create multiple websites,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.645
then it is a more profitable situation for you because on the A2 hosting,

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.760
Turbo Boost or DR plan,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.730
you can come up with a decent number of websites and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.230
the PR website hosting cost will reduce significantly.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.830
The next category is the optimal cost,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.020
and it is really optional.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.720
It is up to you to buy the themes and plug-ins as per the requirement of the project.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.990
If you take my opinion and if you want to save money on board the themes and plug-ins,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.245
then Elementor Pro makes a great option

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:25.160
because it packs so much functionality into just one tool,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.215
Ang, at one price.

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:31.295
For example, you will need the special functionalities like

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:35.899
a landing page builder for creating conversion optimized pages.

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.575
If form plugin for contact and registration forms,

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:42.680
a pop up and email opt-in plug-in to go.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.850
The e-mail list is slider plugin to create the image and post

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.874
sliders is social share button plugin to integrate social media,

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:57.740
you will be getting all these with just one Elementor Pro subscription.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.090
Obviously, you can start with the free Elementor and upgrade

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.770
to Elementor Pro based on the number of websites you want to create.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.720
Investing some $50 or a $100 or $200 on

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.835
Elementor Pro is vert because you can get returns in the form of conversions,

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.820
seals, and with the awesome features,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.030
you will be able to charge more from the clients.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.655
So this is an optional one,

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:30.740
but a highly recommended one to invest for building professional websites.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.670
That's it in this lesson and we will continue in the next video.
