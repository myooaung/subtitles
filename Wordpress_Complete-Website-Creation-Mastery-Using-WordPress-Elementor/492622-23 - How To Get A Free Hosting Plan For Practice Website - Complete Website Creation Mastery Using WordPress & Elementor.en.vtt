00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.745
We all like the free things.

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:07.180
So if I tell you that you can get a free hosting plan,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.755
you will get very happy.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.475
But before telling you about the free hosting plans,

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:15.250
I want to alert you that never,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.630
ever use a free hosting plan for hosting a commercial or a client website,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.360
as these services are suitable only for

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.260
practice websites and not for the professional ones.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.690
So if you wish to get a hosting plan for free without spending any money,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.585
then I have a few good options for you.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:42.915
There are some hosting companies that provide hosting plans for 0 charges.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:47.135
But again, I'm repeating that you can use such hosting plans only

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.395
for the practice website as they're quite unreliable in service.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.020
And you may face many technical issues and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.520
downtime while hosting website on such three web servers.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.019
So in case you have to publish your website on a free server,

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.840
I have shortlisted a few decent companies that will provide you free hosting plan.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320
The first one recommended is extend hosting.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.280
And the other ones to give it a try is acute web hosting,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.950
bite host, goofy host,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.245
and infinity free hosting.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:26.420
Now, I expect that you will compare the features and benefits of all these men shared

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.000
hosting companies and select the one which

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.390
turns out to be providing the best value for your time.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.945
You may find lot many restrictions on usage limits and you may not even get a free SSL.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:43.985
But that will be fine as we are just creating this website for practice.

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.900
Select any one of the above hosting plans to proceed.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.790
And the steps to set up this free hosting account is also the same.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.060
You will be asked to create an account first,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.380
submit your credentials, select a sub-domain, that's it.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.275
You're free web hosting account is ready.

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:08.480
Now simply use a free sub-domain provided to you to enjoy the practice website

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.375
or else you can use the custom domain or a free domain that you purchased from 39.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.384
To use a custom domain,

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:21.830
you will need to update the DNS settings and we will learn about it in the next video.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.660
After that, you're going to install WordPress and create a website for free.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.765
And don't forget, you have to submit the assignment as well.

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:33.890
You have to create the practice website using these three options

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.455
and share the link with me so that I can share my feedback for your work.

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:43.860
All right, so we will continue in the next video.
