00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
We've been learning about using Figma in this lesson.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.785
If you just want to create the design and don't form the functional prototype,

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:12.315
then you can design for pages on gravid designer or Adobe Illustrator

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:17.325
or Photoshop or whatever tool that is available to you and convenient to you.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:23.100
But I highly recommend you to use Figma or XD or Sketch only.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.625
Let us go to Figma and sign up for a free account.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:32.440
You can access Figma on the browser or you can install the app on the computer as well.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.985
It is completely Cloud-based,

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:36.500
very easy to setup.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.420
And here is the dashboard.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.505
Now, let us create a new file,

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.679
and this is the blank canvas.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.740
It is just like any other graphic editing dude.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.100
You can give this file a name by clicking here.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.650
Now, the first step is to get our votes or frames on this page.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.545
Click on the frame tool and from the right,

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.950
you can select a device to get the dimensions for the frame.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.379
We want to create a responsive website.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.465
So we will be creating key frames.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.800
One for a computer,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.610
for tablet, and for a mobile phone.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.779
I am clicking on the MacBook here and a frame is inserted.

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:19.505
I can change the dimensions of the frame from the right styling menu.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:22.700
I am keeping the width to 100,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.640
400 pixels as a distinct default container width for our page builder inverters,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.115
you can press the Control key and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:37.430
You can click and drag the canvas with the mouse.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.690
Let me insert a frame for the tablet and mobile phone as well.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.595
Change the name of the frame to homepage by double-clicking on the title.

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:50.120
You can do this for the remaining frames as well.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.420
If you have some reference image for a website,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.100
you can click on this icon.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.630
Select the option, please stay image and select the file from the computer.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.745
You can place this near to the frame.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.025
And then if you want to take some inspiration,

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.170
it is always here to help you.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.140
So we always start by creating the header and

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.190
footer as they will be consistent for the entire website.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.155
Let me zoom in a bit.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:17.375
Yeah, that's fine.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:21.140
Select a rectangle by clicking on this option.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.960
Draw a rectangle using the mouse and let it come to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.700
the dimensions 1140 pixels width and 72 pixels height.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.380
You can adjust the dimensions from here as well and adjust the position and alignment.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.150
But wait, I've enlarged,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.815
give it the colors and content here.

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:40.585
In the website designing process,

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:45.220
it is always recommended to create a wireframe on a blog diagram first,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.480
that represents the layout and positioning of the content on the website.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.470
Yes.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.710
Simply create a skeleton in gray and white

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.265
colored in client to come up with the content positioning.

00:02:57.265 --> 00:03:00.220
You can do this for all the pages that are required on

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.180
the website and then start working on the visual elements.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.615
Putting the boxes and text is a simple task in Figma,

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.340
just like graphic designer,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.115
you can please the elements change the color,

00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:14.365
adjusted dimensions, change the forms,

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.380
alignments, hand positioning very easily.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.175
Once this wireframe is done.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:23.795
Tested whether it contains the desired sections to show

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:27.590
all the information we want on the website or not.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.180
Once you are satisfied,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.860
proceed with the visual design.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.460
Let us now give this a color as per my branding gate.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.070
Now let us place the logo by clicking on drop-down of this icon and select Place Image,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.445
select a logo file and click to place it on the frame.

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:47.840
You can adjust the size by holding the Shift key to maintain the ratio,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.245
drag it, and place at the appropriate position.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.650
Next, let us create the navigation menu.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.560
Since we are finalized with the list of pages,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.095
let us mention them in the navigation menu here.

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.655
Click on that text, Reagan,

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.215
and place the text.

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:07.850
You can move the position with the mouse and they kept off the snapping lanes.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.665
Adjust the font family,

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:13.565
font size and color of the text from the right scaling menu.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.335
Now, to create a copy,

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:17.825
you can either press Control C and Control V,

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.375
or simply holding the Alt key.

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:22.865
Drag, drag, drag and drop the layer.

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:25.670
It will create a copy. You can hold

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.675
the Shift key while dragging to keep the alignment intact.

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:31.820
You will please the different layers,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.140
the spacing between them is highlighted and you can arrange the alignment as well.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.915
So our header design is ready and next step is to design the filter.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:46.430
Let us take another rectangle and give it the dimensions 11,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.805
400 pixels invert and fought 100 pixels in height.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:53.030
You can obviously change the height like this.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.670
Here you can place the secondary menu,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.960
navigation items and links to legal pages like this leads to

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.925
social connection buttons and also please a newsletter subscribe form.

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:06.980
The idea is very simple.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.165
You can use Figma in coming up with the design of every part of the website.

00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.560
Now since the header and footer are ready,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.095
let us group the elements by making a selection,

00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:20.080
pressing Control G, and it is grouped.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.440
Double-click here and rename the layer.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.865
Seen with the footer,

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:27.985
double-click the name, that's it.

00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:31.660
The list of layers on the left are useful in arranging

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.945
the heirarchy and often locating a group of elements.

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.730
If the elements are grouped,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.150
you can click on this chevron to open the list of layers.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.405
Click on the individual layer and it is selected.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:47.350
Next is to create a hero section of the website.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.740
Again, thicker rectangle, give it the dimensions when,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.945
when Ford little pixels invert and I am taking 600 pixels height.

00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:59.330
Now please some background like solid color gradient or an image.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.575
I am taking an image.

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:03.245
In this case, to replace the image,

00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:04.760
we will follow the same process,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.930
select an image from the device and click on the blank area to insert it.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.830
Now, we want to place this image inside that rectangle.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.000
So let us bring the image layer just above the rectangle and then

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.350
select both right-click and select use as mosque.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.750
Now window double-click on that rectangle.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.855
You can adjust the position of the image.

00:06:26.855 --> 00:06:31.325
Don't forget to hold Shift key while the sizing to maintain the ratio.

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:35.000
And Figma also gives you some image editing options here.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.765
And if you want to export this image to upload on WordPress,

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.760
simply select the mask group,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.924
click on the plus icon here at the export option,

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:47.075
select the format and what we need,

00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:49.865
we need a JPEG, save it.

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:55.715
The image is resized aspart that required dimension to use on the website.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:59.660
We will have to use this technique a lot many times while exploiting

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.639
the logos and icons to maintain the consistent dimension.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:10.140
Next, you can add some texts like headings, subheading, and CD.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.920
Let me add them quickly.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.835
Adjust their phone style as for the branding guide.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.870
So here the sample hero section is ready.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.620
Similarly, you can create the next sections and more sections and more and more.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.515
Keep designing and keep adding the sections you've aren't in the website.

00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:37.925
In this way, a beach should be designed in Figma first

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:41.600
and all the content and layout experiments should be done here.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.180
Before moving on to the development part,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.365
you can create the design of this page for mobile and tablet as well,

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:53.135
and then proceed with the designing of other pages by creating more frames.

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:58.295
You can also collaborate with the team to work together on a website project,

00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:01.070
although there are some limitations in the free plan.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.529
Now, in order to see the preview,

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.305
simply click on the play button here and you can get

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:09.890
a preview of all the web pages that you have designed.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.740
Figma is not just a designing tool,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.250
it is in fact a complete prototyping tool where you can create

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.070
a complete workable prototype of the design that links to best a website or an app.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.290
Before development, go to

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.325
the prototype option here and assign link interactions like this.

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:30.980
They're not also advanced features like leading

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.805
a component and adjusting the visuals by assigning constraints.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:40.474
And lots more advanced stuff that is useful in website and app UI designing.

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:42.425
If you have scope to learn more,

00:08:42.425 --> 00:08:46.460
feel free to explore more about Figma and prototyping.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.215
There are a few main advantages of gaining a design first before development.

00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:55.000
Firstly, you're going share their designs with the client

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.209
to take feedback or to make changes.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:01.210
Next, it saves the hosting rental for the time

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.375
consumed in creating this design for the website.

00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:07.210
Next, you will always have the version history.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.700
Like if you redesign the website in future,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.570
you will still have the old design saved here in Figma.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.450
And if the client asks for variations,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.110
you can our genes the page again and again on the website

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:24.205
directly instead you can keep a copy of all the variations here,

00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:28.270
show it to the client and develop the one that is finalized.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.435
Next, you can zoom in and zoom out

00:09:31.435 --> 00:09:35.900
capacitor different pages for design consistency altogether,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.450
which is not possible during their development on the website step.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.925
Next, you can get a view of

00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:48.095
all the three versions that is computed mobile and tablet at the same screen,

00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:51.275
which is again not possible during development.

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:57.680
Finally, I want to say that designing a website or a webpage on Figma will save your time

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.920
because you have to experiment a lot with their designs and you

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.564
are never sure about the final content and design.

00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:06.545
Eic does start.

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:11.225
So if you jump medically do Elementor and start developing the website,

00:10:11.225 --> 00:10:13.790
it will be a tedious task to experiment with

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.210
the look and feel and eventually take up a lot of time.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.805
I am repeating myself here.

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:23.450
It is very important to design first because you can

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.635
experiment with designs and observed that responds to each design,

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:31.310
but just not possible with direct development.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.190
Another thing I want to clear is that you

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.935
must be wondering that after reading the design and Figma,

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:41.810
you have to just download InDesign and upload it on Elementor to create the website.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.530
But no, that is not possible.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:51.755
Figma is just a designing tool and you will be only able to export the image.

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.095
And to develop the website,

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:56.750
you have to follow the same steps again in

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.820
Elementor and create the webpages to complete the website.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.735
However, once you develop a webpage on Elementor,

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:09.995
that design can be saved and used.

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:13.490
You can export the sections or the complete page to use

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.345
on some other websites created with Elementor.

00:11:17.345 --> 00:11:20.660
We will learn more about this later in the course.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.905
So we are now ready with the website design.

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:27.140
Always start with the wireframe,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.575
that is the block design and then complete all the visual elements

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:34.475
before moving to the final state of development using Elementor.

00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:40.680
I hope you must have enjoyed this process and I will see you in the next video.
