00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.415
Do you know that phones are very important for the visual design of the website?

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.470
Forms can create an impression for

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.070
the visitors even before they start reading the content.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
So let us learn some concepts that are related to the art and technique of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.105
styling for marketing and arranging the phones, garlands, topography.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:26.430
Good paleography on our website makes the act of reading effortless for the visitors.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.955
Vile, poor topography, dance up the stairs of a.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:34.485
So it is important to use the right phones on a website

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:39.220
that looks well on all the three types of devices that is computed,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.375
tablet and mobile phone.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:47.000
The first and the most important step is to select the right forms that are easy to read.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.525
But again, it is a challenge here because there are

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:54.770
thousands of foreign families and typeface to choose from.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.155
To make the selection process easy,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.320
let us divide the phones into two categories.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.180
These are set of phones and sans serif forms.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.775
Thus set of phones have serifs or extra degradation at the end of stalks,

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.520
also called Les feet or tails.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.880
Serifs work great in headlines and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.410
headings because they give a special accent to make it look standout.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.945
Some of the most known set of form families include phones like Times New Roman,

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:32.210
Georgia, platinum, get him on and Cliff it displayed.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.100
Many brands and professional businesses often use setters for the logo and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.780
website when they want to appear more reputable, established, formal.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
But keep in mind that the set of phones are easy to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.710
read only when used for smaller quantities of x,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.640
like headings are global and not in the website paragraphs.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.005
On the other hand,

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.410
the sans serif forms are without set.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.015
It means that there is no extra degradation at the end of each letter.

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:05.164
They are used to convey minimalist design,

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:09.410
modernity, and most of all, sheared simplicity.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.590
Since the reforms and the best choice to use in main-content body and paragraphs,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.490
as they are very easy to read on screens and even on smaller screens of mobile phones.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.580
Some of the most widely used sensitive forms include evidence, Roboto,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.465
Open Sans Source Sans Pro lacto,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.225
marked Sadat, and Proxima Nova.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:38.495
You can avoid using the handwriting forms,

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.940
display phones and monospace forms,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.700
as they are not easy to read on screens,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.030
especially on smaller screens of mobile phones.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.855
To find the best phones that are available to use on websites.

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:54.575
I will recommend you to spend some time on Google fonts.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.620
This is a wonderful tool and you will find a list of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.990
the most commonly used forms and common pairing combinations along with the preview.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.225
You can also check the phones that are used on other websites in the industry.

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:09.185
Yes.

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:12.290
You can check the phone family by selecting the text,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.230
right-click and selecting the Inspect option.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.235
Here you will have to select the element tab and click on computed,

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:22.640
scroll down a bit to get the phone deleted information.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.275
You will find all the details about the phone that is being used on the website,

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:30.875
like font-family, font-size, line-height,

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.650
letter spacing, phone colored, and more.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.710
Alternatively, you can use a Chrome plugin to get the same details in an easy manner.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.795
Currently, I'm using Firm Finder to identify phones on any website.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:46.010
Awesome.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.425
Now, for our website project,

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:51.830
you will have to select between one to three phones.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.305
You will be using phones for headings,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.380
subheadings, paragraph, and buttons.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.980
If you're using different forms for heading and paragraph,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.220
make sure that two phones pair well with each other.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.575
To make the selection process easy,

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:09.860
you can also divide the phones into primary and secondary foods,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.740
and it is recommended to decide on the primary form

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.565
first and then explode options for the second default.

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:20.345
You can find that common pairing information on Google phones,

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:25.070
or you can make a Google search to find out the trending font combinations.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.820
But make sure you do not use more than three phones

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.389
and a website as a disturbs the user interface.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.070
Visual heirarchy.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.950
An important factor to select the right form for

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.880
the website is to think about the visitors.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.755
What type of perception you want people to think when they see the website?

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:51.275
Is it a bold statement or a professional and think it from the visitor point of view.

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:54.710
I'm happy to repeat it again and again.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.635
But the more you understand your customers better website you will create.

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.480
After selecting the phones,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.615
you have to ensure that you select the correct form, size,

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:11.150
weight, line-height, and letter spacing as per the design requirement of the website.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.585
The first adding in typography is to apply.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.870
It means limiting the length of a line.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.140
You can have it on 45 to 85 characters,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.259
but line preferably 60 on a computer.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.035
If you want to provide a good reading experience.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:31.415
For mobile devices, you should go for 30 to 40 characters per line.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:34.790
I even recommend using the word counter plus plug-in for

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.140
Google Chrome to count the characters by just selecting the text.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.125
Next is to choose the alignment from the left,

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.795
center, right, and justified options.

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:48.845
This will depend on the overall UA you're planning for the website.

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:51.950
Next factor is to adjust the letter spacing,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.005
also called Les kerning.

00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:59.030
It is the space between two letters and it enhances readability,

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.015
but I will advise to use it carefully.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:04.340
Next, adjust the line height.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.560
It is also called as leading.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.280
It is the amount of space between the two lines.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.620
Next is to select the phone size.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.985
And again, it depends on the overall UI that you are planning for the website.

00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:19.055
Just don't make it too small,

00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:22.730
otherwise have visited, we'll have to zoom in to read the content.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.245
In fact, make sure it is easy to read on all screen sizes.

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:31.850
You can play with the font-weight to make it appear heavier or lighter.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.590
You can select the form color as bird design color scheme.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.470
Make sure you have a good contrast issue.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.615
It means having a light text on a dark background or a dark phone on a light background.

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:48.410
After deciding on all these typographic factors,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.630
make sure you use the same styling in

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.430
the entire website to deliver a sense of consistency and branding.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.890
Always try the best to maintain the visual hierarchy on the web page.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.950
Get into the mind of the website visitor and try to

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.565
understand which words do you want them to notice first?

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:12.200
And what is the most visually pleasing format to communicate those words?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.980
Remember, ease of readability is the primary goal we

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.955
want to achieve by applying the concepts of a biography.

00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:25.130
All right, So you have learned about colors and topography,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.420
and in the next video,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.090
we will learn about the different layouts.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.930
See you there.
