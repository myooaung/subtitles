1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,400
Now with the lifecycle methods of your elements explained, it should be clear why append child causes

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,010
an error here. In the constructor,

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,430
the element has been created but it has not been added to the DOM yet and therefore, trying to append

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,610
a child which tries to append it to the real DOM will fail.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,790
Instead you should add the connectedCallback method here and make sure you spell this right because

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,420
the browser will look for exactly that method, spelled exactly like that,

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,380
it is case sensitive so make sure you have a capital C in there

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,350
but a lower case c at the beginning. And now we can grab all that code here where we want to append a

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,630
child or where we create the child,

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:57,520
we can move that into the connectedCallback. Now with that and no other changes, if we now save that and I then reload

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,610
this page,

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:05,230
now you see we get no error and we see our question mark being rendered here at the beginning.

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,770
Now obviously, it's added in front of our web component's text and not after it

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,060
and that is not the place where we want to have it. I'll come back to how it ends up there later

15
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:24,640
but at least we can see we can now render something without errors and the key takeaway which already

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:33,280
shows a little bit of the use custom components give us is that this question mark is not part of our

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:33,770
HTML 

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,060
markup here

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,050
but it's really something that is controlled by our web component

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,460
and again, we'll add more usefulness to that and more features over the next lectures.

21
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,290
But this is now a crucial first step and it's also important to understand that we are using the

22
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,890
connectedCallback here because we are accessing the DOM and our element has only been mounted onto the

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,760
real DOM

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,950
when this method gets called.
