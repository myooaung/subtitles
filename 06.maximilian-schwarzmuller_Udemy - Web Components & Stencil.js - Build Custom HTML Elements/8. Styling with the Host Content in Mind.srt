1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,070
Now you conclude special selectors.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,820
We learn about there's one average special selector that is worth pointing out and that is the host

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,170
context selector.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,420
Now let's say and that is actually the case here.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:24,160
We only want to apply a certain style to our custom element when it is inside of a paragraph.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,120
As our first tooltip as right here our first tool tip is out of a paragraph.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,930
The second one is not.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,310
So in this case you might want to set a certain style and for that there is never a special selector

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,180
Kolin host dash context.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:48,310
This also has this function for him with parentheses after it is selector and then the function arguments.

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:55,000
So with when the parentheses use specify the surrounding conditions you want to have around your element.

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,730
So in this case we could add the P selector So the tax collector for a paragraph element but you could

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,040
also have something like.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:10,160
It should be a paragraph with the Hello class like this or a paragraph with a nested element of hello

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,490
which surrounds our custom element all is possible.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,440
Here I'll just go for.

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,480
And if that is the case let's say then we want to have a font weight that is bold.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,950
So we want to have bold text and if we do that and we reload we see for the first web component we have

19
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,120
bold text for the second we don't and we have that because of this rule which kicks in due to our paragraph

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,180
around our custom element and for a second web component for our second tooltip this rule does simply

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,230
not apply because there is no paragraph around it.

22
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,780
And if we would nest is inside of a paragraph so it would move it.

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,830
And you can drag it in the developer tools.

24
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,700
So if I drag it here into my paragraph you see this gets bold too because it's now all the inside of

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,840
a paragraph and hence Now this whole context here also applies that moved out of there again.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,130
Then again it's not bold anymore.

27
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,630
So this is really really cool.

28
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,690
Gives us a lot of flexibility here.

29
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:18,390
And with host hosts in combination with this function for him to set conditions host context and slot

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,130
it you have a lot of powerful tools to style the content on your web components in exactly the way you

31
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,710
want.
