1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,380
Now that is all nice, what we saw thus far, we can copy our generated components into different folders

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,350
and import them into our web pages,

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,100
that is interesting but often we also want to share our projects across our entire organization and

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:26,180
not just on our machine or we want to share it with the public and for that, we would use the npm registry.

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,970
You might remember npm stands for Node Package Manager and the registry is what we already used, for

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,480
example in our stencil project when we ran npm init to create it or with all the dependencies we installed,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,560
like here with Node when I ran npm install. That stencil package and also the dependencies of the Node

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:52,700
project are fetched from npm and we can publish our own project to npm as well.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,890
Now for that, I just need to go back into my stencil project again and to publish to npm, we need to

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,880
tweak the package.json

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,900
file there a bit. In the package.json file,

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,470
you can give this package the name your published package should have and that

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,230
in my case here and I will unpublish this later so you won't be able to install that is uc-component,

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,360
you might want to use a more fitting name, like maybe if your company is called super-great and you have

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,690
your core UI component kit, you might name this super great core UI or whatever you want, here I'll just

16
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,030
name it

17
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,100
uc-components. You assign a version, we can go with the default

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,210
version, the description is something you can change but it's not required to change. Now

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,050
you can leave all the other settings as they are 

20
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:52,270
and now to publish to npm, you need an npm account. You can visit any npmjs.com and you can sign up

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,050
for free,

22
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,350
you don't need to pay for that,

23
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,110
you only need to pay if you want to publish private packages

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,700
otherwise you can only publish public packages which are accessible by everyone.

25
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,700
If you want to restrict the usage to your old company or to yourself, then you need to pay

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,060
otherwise you just need to sign up

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,870
and once you went through that entire sign up process here, simply click through, that generated your profile,

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
you can log into npm here from the command line.

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,130
You do that by running npm login

30
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:31,840
and now you need to enter your credentials, so the username you created and then your password. Once

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,230
you did login and you can find all details about the publishing process in the official docs of npm

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:47,040
of course, there under packages and modules if you search for publish, you'll find all the details about

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,580
how you can publish your packages. In the end after you logged in,

34
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:59,610
it's just npm publish and this will now publish your package under this name to the npm registry.

35
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,520
Once it is published, you'll be able to npm install it under that name.

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,220
Important, if you have a paid account you need to add --access public to publish this as a public

37
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,970
package

38
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,100
otherwise it will be published as a private package.

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,240
So now once this is done, you can install it into any project with npm install

40
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,200
and that's just what we do as a next step.
