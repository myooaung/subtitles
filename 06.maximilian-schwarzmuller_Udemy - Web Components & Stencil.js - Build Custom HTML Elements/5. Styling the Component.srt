00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,150
So let's dive into styling now and again you can skip this lecture if you're not interested, simply take

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,150
the finished code you find attached to this lecture then to proceed with the styling edit here.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,750
So I want to give this component we created here some basic styling and in that styling here,

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:24,570
I want to work on the input, the button and also on the way we present the output. For that I'll go

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,290
into the css file and first of all, I'll select the host element,

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,300
so the overall element and I'll set the font family to sans-serif.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,500
Often you might not want to do that,

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,260
you want to not set your own font family here in this component but instead let the user manage this in

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,960
the global styling for the entire app

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,050
but here, just to mix it up, I will set it here in the host element

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,910
and after reloading, after the style changes, you often need to reload,

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,460
we see that having an effect.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,770
And now of course, I also want to work on my form and the elements in the form and on the output of the

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,370
price and the overall container because for the overall container,

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:14,500
so on the host element itself, I will give this a border of let's say 2px solid and a nice

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,280
purple

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,590
look, let me hover over that and choose a darker purple, maybe something like this. I'll also set a margin of

18
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,060
2rem in all directions

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,820
just to have some spacing between this component and other components

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,550
and you can always adjust this to your liking of course

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,630
and I'll give this as a padding of 1rem. With that,

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,090
we actually have a broken component and

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,400
the reason for that is that components by default are of type inline.

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,670
So to take a fact of margin, padding and have the right border and so on, I will set the display of this

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,650
host element and this has to go on to the host element to target our component itself,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,170
I'll set this to block because this should become a block level element and now it indeed is.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:12,000
Now however, I don't like the width of it, so I will set the width here to let's say 20rem and give it

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,010
a max width of 100% to never be wider than the surrounding viewport or container to be precise.

29
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,640
So now we have that style here,

30
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,160
now I also want to work on the input and the button,

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,890
so let me select my form in here and always remember, these styles here will be scoped to this component

32
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,170
because we set shadow to true. On the form,

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,350
I don't really want to style the form itself for now but I want to style my input in the form. Here

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,720
I want to inherit the form settings we have in the rest of the app or in the rest of the component,

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:58,750
I also want to use set the text color to the same purple color we're using for the border of this component

36
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:06,310
and of course it's not text color, it's just color.

37
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,910
I also want to set some padding here,

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:16,100
.15rem to top and bottom, .25rem to left and right, there we go with .1rem top and

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,270
bottom. If we reload, this is how it looks like,

40
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,840
now let me also remove the focus here.

41
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,220
So on the input, when it's focused, I'll set the outline to none.

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:35,080
So I'm removing the outline of course not the focus and let's also work on the button now. For the button

43
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:46,260
in the form element here, I want to have also an inherited font and the padding of let's say .25rem

44
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:54,750
from top to bottom and .5rem  from left and right. Let's have a look, doesn't look too bad.

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,600
I'll give this a border of 1px solid

46
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:07,290
and my purple look here and I'll set the background color to that same purple and give it a text color

47
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,680
of white therefore and with that, get this nice button.

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,530
Now one last thing I want to add is I'll set my input to display block so that the button actually goes

49
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:29,610
onto a new line and I'll then give my input a margin bottom of let's say .5rem to have some distance.

50
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:37,840
And on the button, I want to set the cursor to a pointer and I also there want to add a hover effect

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
and an active effect.

52
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:47,410
So on my button here, I'll add a hover effect and I'll set the same styling for an active effect and

53
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,450
there, I simply want to change the background color a little bit,

54
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,760
so I'll start with that purple we have

55
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,000
and I'll just change it to be a little bit brighter, maybe something like this

56
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,000
and the same for the border color,

57
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,360
so on border color here, I'll set this same brighter purple. With that saved,

58
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,920
I like that look

59
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,110
and now if I have a hover over this, that looks quite good.

60
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,150
So now we have everything we need,

61
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,670
we have a nice styling, we can submit this.

62
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,170
One last thing which I forgot, on the button, the focus event also should have no outline just as my input

63
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,950
and yes, we could merge these two rules into one therefore, so let's quickly do that.

64
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,250
Let's move over here and 

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,590
let's add form button focus here,

66
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,020
both don't have an outline

67
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,250
and now I'm really done.

68
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,680
Now this is the state with which I want to continue

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,640
and now we'll dive into adding some API or using that API to get our stock data.
