00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.510
Now we added a lot of cool things to our little bit more complex component here,

2
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.430
now let's wrap this all up by changing the styling a little bit, by making sure that we also can close

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.470
the modal when we click the backdrop

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.140
and by also animating them a little bit when it comes in and goes away.

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.670
Now definitely feel free to do some of these things on your own,

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.090
pause the video, try it on your own at this point,

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.240
otherwise we'll do it together of course.

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.430
So were you successful?

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.940
Let's give this a try,

10
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.640
let's start with a click listener on the backdrop which closes the modal.

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.080
Now this shouldn't be too hard, right?

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.050
In our modal component, the backdrop in the end is this element with the ID backdrop,

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.400
so all we have to do is select it

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.790
and then add that event listener.

15
00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:01.330
So here, I will select my backdrop with this shadow root query selector and then #backdrop

16
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.950
because again we have that ID backdrop on that div and now I just need to add an event listener and I'll

17
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.520
do that here next to my button event listeners, there I'll access my backdrop and add an event listener,

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.400
add a click listener of course and in the end here, I want to do the same which I do when I click the

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.310
cancel button because in the end, we cancel the modal when we click the backdrop.

20
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.230
So I will use this cancel method here as an event handler,

21
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.330
bind this, so I will do exactly the same as I do for the cancel button. And with this change, it should already

22
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.980
work.

23
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.240
If I now go back, open this, click somewhere on the backdrop and it closes this, nice.

24
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.180
Now I want to work a little bit on the styling when I decrease the amount of whitespace we have up there,

25
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.710
maybe add a line below our header,

26
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.140
so for that, I'll go into my styling here.

27
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.990
Now for the line, I'll add a border bottom here on my header which wraps my, well header content in the

28
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.780
end and that should be 1px solid and #CCC,

29
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.340
so this is a light gray,

30
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.680
It's the same light gray I have as a border top on the actions and to reduce the amount of whitespace,

31
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.540
for slotted h1 content

32
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.880
which brings extra margins,

33
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.240
I'll set the margins of that h1 tag to 0 and now with that, if I reload, this looks much nicer.

34
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.270
So this is now the look I want to have,

35
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.050
last but not least, let's add a tiny animation, a CSS transition to be precise and for that, the modal

36
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.710
itself should be animated when it comes in.

37
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:54.330
So to do that, I want to have it slide in from the top and go from opacity 0 to opacity 1 over let's

38
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.370
say 300 milliseconds. So I'll actually reduce the top distance here to 10vh instead of 15 which

39
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.570
I had before,

40
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.800
opacity already is set to 0 initially and then when we show it, which of course is the case here,

41
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.400
I want to animate that. Now

42
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.770
for that, I will actually add an extra rule here

43
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.710
for the opened state on my modal, where I also set top to 15vh.

44
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.990
I can't do this in this combined rule because the backdrop should not be moved down,

45
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.810
so here, this is basically the end state, opacity 1, pointer events all and then for the modal

46
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.030
also in addition, top set to 15vh,

47
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.490
so it is pushed down further than it is initially when it is invisible.

48
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.540
And now, so that we can see that change,

49
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.950
I'll add the transition property to the modal and there, I'll transition everything so all properties

50
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.450
should be watched and animated over .3 seconds with an ease-out timing function and if CSS

51
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.900
transitions are something you're not familiar with, attached you find some helpful resources and my 

52
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.070
CSS, The Complete Guide here on Udemy

53
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.400
also of course is a great resource to learn more about that.

54
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:28.260
So now with that, if I reload this page, you'll see it slide in and also automatically slide out,

55
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.340
the same is the case when I click these buttons.

56
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.710
So now we have this nice little animation here for our modal

57
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.720
and with that, we built a pretty nice component which you can of course always enhance more,

58
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.360
you can style these buttons differently, whatever you want but I'm very happy with that and I think we

59
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.460
learned a lot of cool things in this module.
