00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.140
We can also use a different mechanism using the things you learned in the vanilla web component part

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.940
about just using CSS when you want to change the style or the visibility.

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.440
So I will actually kind of rever this, copy that code and always render that code and comment out my conditional

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.800
check,

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.630
I could remove it,

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.460
I just want to leave it there for you to be able to reference it when you download my resources

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.700
but now I always return this again and I ignore this open property

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.280
but this still is a property that now can be set or an attribute we can set, though we can even do that

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.670
of course, no one is stopping us from adding attributes without adding this prop decoration.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.440
So what we still also can do and what we already did in the vanilla web component part, we can just add

11
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
attributes checks to our CSS code.

12
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.760
So there on the overall aside,

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.220
we could set a default style of left which is -100%,

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.890
this should move our element out of the page, out of the view and I then add another style where I access

15
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.600
my host element itself with the host selector which still is available in stencil, all the special

16
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.930
selectors you learned about in the vanilla web components part are available in stencil because I

17
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.500
can't emphasize it enough,

18
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.170
stencil works with vanilla web components,

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.390
so here I can add host with the requirement of the open attribute being present on the host element

20
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.300
and then my aside inside of my host,

21
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.290
then this should receive a style of left 0. Side note,

22
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.190
if you were using

23
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.460
scoped true instead of shadow true, so you were using that emulation, then host would not be supported

24
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.060
because that only works with the shadow DOM, all these special selectors would not be supported because

25
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.100
they work with the shadow DOM, instead

26
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.050
you would then just use your normal component selector

27
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.960
and combine that with the requirement of having the open attribute being present on it

28
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.340
but with the shadow DOM being used as we do, you have to use host. Back to our main business here though,

29
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.580
now I'm setting left to 0 when we have this open attribute on our component tag

30
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.070
and now I will just add a transition here to animate this change of my left property. So I will watch

31
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.800
the left property, we could watch all, doesn't really matter here

32
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.370
and over .3 seconds, so 300 milliseconds, I'll animate with an easeOut timing function.

33
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.880
And now with that if we reload, we don't see it here

34
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.090
but if I now add this open attribute again, it slides in. And this works with out as using the prop decorator

35
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.620
here or without this being defined as a property at all because we don't use it as a property, we only

36
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.480
add or remove that attribute and we don't need to register attributes

37
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.470
we plan on using here, instead we can just use them in CSS

38
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.680
and if all you want to do is change some styling, then this is actually the way I would recommend going

39
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.470
about this.
