00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,350
Well before we finish this getting started

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,170
module, I want to ensure that you're getting the most out of this course because there are a couple

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,430
of tricks and steps you should follow to make sure you really get the most value for your money.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,900
Now this is a video based on-demand course, 

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,510
you can go through it at your pace and you really should do that.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,130
Watch the videos and watch them at your speed,

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,230
you can use the video player to increase or decrease the playback speed,

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,080
you can pause

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,780
when I'm going too fast and you want to code along, I try to balance my speed but a lot of students

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,600
want to code along and therefore I have to find the right talking speed

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,050
somewhere in the middle.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,180
Definitely pause if needed, slow me down or speed me up when I'm going too slow,

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,760
watch the videos at your pace, at your speed and make sure you get the most out of them.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,750
You will also get the most out of them if you code along,

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,280
so that is the part with pausing the videos potentially, do the assignments you find in this course but

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,760
also take all the other code as a big assignment.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,820
I also sometimes mention here you can pause to video and you should take advantage of this and try something

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,190
on your own before you follow along with my solution.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,540
Neither do I have the only correct solution nor would it be a problem if you come up with a different

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,110
solution that doesn't work because then, you will learn a lot

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,820
and that is why you're taking that course, right.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,070
So besides that and doing that whilst watching the videos, also make sure you use the course resources.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,780
To the last lecture of every module, you find helpful links as well as the source code for this module

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,140
attached, the source code is also attached to multiple lectures inside of module, so not just to the last

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,080
one, to the last one you always find all the code for the module though. Take this code to compare

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,850
it to yours

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,010
if you're facing any problems, if something is unclear, if you have any bugs. By comparing my code or

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,400
even replacing parts of your code with it temporarily, you can solve a lot of the issues and by solving

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,690
them like this, you will learn a lot because you solve your problems on your own,

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,140
there's no better way to learn.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Now if there is something where you get stuck or if a concept is unclear which I explain, don't hesitate

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,580
to ask in the

33
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,150
Q&A section and I'll do my best to help you there.

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,890
Now important, asking is simple,

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,700
also consider helping your fellow students.

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,370
Answering is much harder but there is no problem

37
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,440
if your answer should be wrong, at least you tried and you will learn a lot by answering

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,610
no matter if you're right or wrong. If you're wrong, you'll get corrected, if you're right,

39
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,540
hey you helped another student and you are challenged to think about a problem and solve it.

40
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,210
So really consider answering in the Q&A section,

41
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,170
this is the best practice you can get because solving problems, solving complex problems, that is what

42
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,760
makes you a pro developer.
