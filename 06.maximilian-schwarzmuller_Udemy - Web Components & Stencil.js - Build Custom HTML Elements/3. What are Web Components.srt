1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,910
So being able to write custom HTML elements is pretty cool,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,800
I did mention though that web components is actually a broad term for a couple of specifications that

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,370
are built into modern browsers that make up that web components term. Custom HTML elements is just

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,200
one part of that set of specifications,

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,830
it's one specification,

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,560
it's arguably the most important one because this defines a couple of features

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,830
modern browsers expose to you and you can use these features in Javascript then and you will also learn

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,610
how to make it work in older browsers in this course.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,860
So you got the set of features that allows you to register your own HTML tags and define some basic

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,300
logic behind that,

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,170
however this alone will not give you great web components.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,550
Another important specification that makes up the web components term is the shadow DOM specification.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,900
The shadow DOM is all about having a separate DOM, a tree of DOM nodes behind your custom element that

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,140
is separated from the normal DOM, this helps you for example with scoping your styles to your custom element,

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,840
so that styling you set up for your custom element doesn't interfere with other parts of your application,

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,270
really, really useful. Templates and slots is another important part of the specification,

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,530
your custom element will in the end just be a combination of default HTML elements because in the

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,930
end, the browser only knows how to handle these

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,020
but you can compose them and add styling and add Javascript logic to create more powerful widgets

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,410
like the modal you saw and you will learn how that works throughout the course. Templates and slots are another

21
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,860
important specification here because here

22
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,870
you define this core structure behind your element,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,230
so you basically define the template which is then rendered as a shadow DOM and slots are helpful for

24
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,970
exposing certain entry points, like that title we use in the last lecture,

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,830
this h1 tag

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,990
we passed to slot

27
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:08,050
title, that allows us to pass dynamic content into our web component so that developers using our web

28
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,140
components can use them and the set of features that are baked in

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,160
and still if our components wants that, pass extra content into the component and you will learn all about

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,190
that throughout the course as well.

31
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,570
Now last but not least, there's another specification you sometimes hear about when hearing about web

32
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:33,850
components and that is the HTML imports specification. That was meant to be a feature which allows you

33
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:41,510
to import HTML files into HTML files, so that you can define these templates for your components in HTML

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,020
files that are then imported dynamically.

35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,170
Now this is not continued anymore because the industry moved in a direction where we use Javascript

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,960
for all of that

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,700
and where we use modern build tools and Javascript modules to import and export inside of our Javascript

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,650
files and import the HTML templates as strings there as well

39
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,200
and this is also the approach you will see in this course and I will explain and show it there.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,930
So it's just important to be aware of these three core features, custom elements, shadow DOM, templates

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,180
and slots and we will dive deeply into them and learn all about them and how we use them throughout the course

42
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,140
of course.
