1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,460
So now that we're able to fetch data and that I showed you how this works with this promise in the fetch

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,480
API, we can use our own API key so that as a next step, we can actually have a look at what the user entered

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,250
and use that data instead of always using Microsoft.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,980
Now for that, I will create a new file here in the source folder, in a sub-folder which I'll name global,

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,860
you can name it whatever you want and I'll name that global.ts,

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,970
I want to store some global data in there which I can import into any component that needs it

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:47,250
and I could put it directly into this stock-price.tsx file but this allows me to manage my API key in

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,510
a central place instead of in a component.

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,330
So if I would use it in different components, I could always just import it from that file and when I ever

10
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,440
change it, I need to change it in one file only.

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:06,360
So here I'll export a constant which I'll name AV for alphavantage, API_KEY and then I will add

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,730
my API key there

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,820
and again I showed you how to request one,

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,290
make sure you do have an API key,

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,170
you will need one if you want to use different user inputs than the dummy data.

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,030
So I added my API key here, with that, I can just import it into my stock-price.tsx file or into any other

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,670
file and when stencil builds that component, it will merge the data into that file of course,

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,830
so we don't need to ship that global.ts file. When we share our components with other users,

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,020
it will be all included in the final build file here.

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:49,860
So here I will just import from that global, global files, so the global file in the global folder and

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,770
there, I will import my AV_API_KEY and I will use that instead of demo.

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,400
Now I will just change this from a string surrounded by single quotes to a string surrounded by back ticks

23
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,530
because back ticks allow me to use that dollar sign curly brace injection syntax and I will insert my

24
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,340
AV_API_KEY here

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,950
and of course remove demo, so that my API key is used as the API_KEY

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,760
and now we want to in our next step, fetch the user input of course.
