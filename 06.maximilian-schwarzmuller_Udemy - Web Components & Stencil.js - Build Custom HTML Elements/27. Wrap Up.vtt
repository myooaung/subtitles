00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.750
So now that we added CSS properties, we're done for this module. It was quite a large module with a lot

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.920
of exciting content covered.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.480
You learned a lot about advanced features that help you send HTTP requests here with the fetch

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.570
API but you could use any HTTP library for that,

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.420
you learned about the lifecycle of a component and how you can use the different hooks like

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.070
componentDidLoad to for example load some initial value.

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.520
You learned about watching properties and reacting to changes to them, to for example fetch data

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:45.110
again. You learned about the listen decorator and you learned about custom events in stencil which

9
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.290
you can emit, which helps you pass data round to your main application or between components if you want

10
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.860
to

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.030
and you learned cool things about styling, like using host data for styling your component and adding

12
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.200
conditional classes to your host element for example and how to also use CSS properties in stencil

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.440
components.

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.670
Now it's always all about practicing so I can only encourage you to do that,

15
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.420
build more components with all these cool features

16
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.910
but I hope that this already gives you a lot of nice insights into what's possible and what you can

17
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.860
do to build powerful and reusable web components.
