1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,570
Let's now work on that list of elements we're outputting here.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,260
I want to have both the symbol and the name,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,740
so let's say here we have the symbol between strong tags to make it bold,

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,770
we have result symbol here

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:23,610
and then after this, we have a dash with the result name. We could have more fancy styling of course,

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,950
I'll not make it too fancy,

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,520
I'll just do a little bit of styling here.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:40,170
On the unordered list, I'll remove the margin and I'll set the list style to none and on the list items,

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,160
I'll also set margin and padding to zero or to be precise, margin top and bottom should be .5rem

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,680
and I give this a border of let's say 1px solid and a light gray maybe and, well give them

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,000
some padding, let's say .5rem and on the unordered list, let's remove all padding. With that if we go back,

12
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,150
yeah that looks better,

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,730
now we have these list items and now we have a way of finding new tickers which we can use in our other component

14
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,100
up there.

15
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,320
Now we have some very nice components here,

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,660
we can use each of them standalone or together to find tickers here, for example search for Facebook

17
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,530
and find the ticker and then we can use that ticker up here.

18
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,300
So that is very convenient but it would be nice if we could also just click on one of the elements

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,970
and then emit some custom event to which we can listen in this component, in this first component for

20
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,100
example, to then automatically update the price.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,670
So we don't want to specifically target that first component from the second one because we don't know

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,330
if the first component will be there,

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,320
each component should work standalone but we can simply emit an event to anyone who's interested can

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,660
listen and that will cover something we haven't seen yet,

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,400
custom events and how we can listen to them conveniently in another component.
