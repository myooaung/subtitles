1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:08,130
So we added our very basic first component in the last lecture,

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,490
let's now tweak it.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,890
What we want to achieve here is or what we want to build here is a side drawer, a side menu.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,560
So first thing is I will actually change this div to an aside, this is totally optional but semantically,

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,790
this makes more sense,

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,770
an aside is a default HTML element.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,330
More importantly, I want to add my own styles and in our own vanilla component, we did this as part of

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,440
this innerHTML template.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,590
Now in stencil, we don't do it as part of that JSX template,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,010
instead stencil has a more convenient feature,

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:48,220
we can point at an external CSS file which styles will be pulled into this file at build time, so we

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,990
will still kind of end up with something like this

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,680
but we build it in a more convenient way. And for that, I'll add a new file in that folder and I'll name

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,740
it side-drawer.css and stencil actually also supports SASS

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,910
if you want to use it, in the official stencil docs you can find more about that, a link to those can

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,420
be found at the end of this module.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,590
So here I got the side drawer file,

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,580
now to use that, I just have to inform stencil where to find that file and that it should use such an external

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,880
CSS style by adding another configuration to this object we pass to component

20
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,430
and this is the style URL configuration.

21
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,340
Now you see we got multiple style related configurations we can pass actually, style

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,960
URLs

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,520
would allow you to define an array of paths to external files and they would all be pulled together

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,190
to form one stylesheet for this component, in case you want to split your styles across multiple files

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,630
and styles allows you to write inline styles.

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,030
So here, you could again use a template string and write your styles without style tags, so simply just

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,700
directly the CSS definitions inside of this file

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,760
but here, I want to point at one single external file,

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,630
so I will use style URL and then this takes a string with a relative path to your CSS file. Such

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,910
a relative path is constructed by adding ./ which means from the current folder on,

31
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:23,300
so from the folder this TSX file lives on and then simply, it's the side-drawer.css file.

32
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,630
This is how we point at this file and how we tell stencil to import this file.

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,540
And now there's one other thing we can add,

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,610
one other configuration, there is this shadow and this scoped property.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,290
Now scoped allows us to tell stencil that all the styles it finds in the external stylesheet or that

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,050
are defined for this common component

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,960
in general should be scoped to this component only and it does so but it does not use the shadow DOM,

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,320
it basically adds an attribute to all our elements and changes all our CSS styles to take that attribute

39
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,520
into account.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,370
This is an emulated way or this is an emulation of the shadow DOM

41
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,880
and this does offer a great support for older browsers because it doesn't rely on the shadow DOM

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:18,040
but I will set shadow to true here to use the native shadow DOM because stencil will automatically provide

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,630
polyfills for older browsers, so this should work in older browsers too

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,580
and then we simply save all these extra attributes and hence, we shrink our code a little bit,

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,170
the code we ship in the end and it also should be a little bit more performant.

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,980
Now with that, we can start defining styles in that side-drawer.css file

47
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,110
and I'll start by giving my aside a style,

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,110
so this aside.html element selected by its tag here and this should effectively be an overlay that slides

49
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,260
in from the left.

50
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,700
So I'll give it a position of fixed because it should be fixed to my page, that even when I scroll it

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,400
always stays in the same position, from the top it will have a distance of 0 and from the left, it will

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,910
have a distance of 0.

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:11,240
I'll have a width here of let's say 30rem but maybe a max width of 90 or of 80% so that on smaller

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,620
screens, it doesn't overlap the page width.

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,620
I want to have a height of 100vh to take the full page height.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,520
I'll give it a background of a slight grey,

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,220
maybe a little bit brighter,

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,130
somewhere around this and I'll give it a box shadow

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:52,460
with this configuration here, so that we have a nice little visual effect or elevation effect and

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,900
if I save that and we go back, we should see it here,

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,400
maybe you need to reload. I'll actually turned this background into a more whitish color,

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,660
looks better 

63
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,480
and if we inspect this on a mobile device which you can do by opening up your developer tools in Chrome

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,760
and clicking that toggle device toolbar mode here, there you can simulate different phones,

65
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,190
then this looks good on mobile too.

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,040
Let me zoom in a little bit there.

67
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,970
Ok,

68
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,420
so this is our side drawer, obviously right now we can't toggle it

69
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,810
and the way we display content in it isn't great but this is our first step,

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,610
we added styling.

71
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,230
Now let's make sure we can pass in different kinds of content from outside.
