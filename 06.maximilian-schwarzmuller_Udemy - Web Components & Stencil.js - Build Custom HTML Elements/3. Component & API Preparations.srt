00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,850
For fetching the stock data, I'll use an open API from alphavantage. You can simply google for alphavantage

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,780
and you should find that page, alphavantage.co.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,620
Now the API on this page is free to use but you need to get an API key by registering, so it will not

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,860
cost you anything but they want your email address,

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,510
if you don't want to give that away, you can of course just follow along here with the videos but you'll

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,110
not be able to follow along and code of course.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,030
So let's click on get your free API key here and fill in these fields,

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,690
choose your role, for example student, the organization you are working in,

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,070
simply enter your name if you don't have one for example and then your email address and you'll get

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,710
that API key thereafter.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,160
Now I already went through these steps, so I already have my API key and therefore, I can already go to

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,800
the documentation there to learn how to use the API and I can only recommend to dive into that if you want

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,060
to play around with it,

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,700
in the end you'll find a couple of URLs here to which you can send get requests to get different

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,630
kinds of data and you should include your API key

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,790
but we'll do all of that together in this course. We'll start with this quote endpoint here,

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:23,400
so with this, API URL will start and what this will give us in the end is simply the data for a given

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,610
symbol, for a given stock,

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,370
for example here in Microsoft and there, we'll be extracting that 05 price field later which is the

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,330
latest price of this stock and that is what I want to display.

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,800
So this is what we'll use. Now with that, let's start using it, let's start adding some logic here

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,860
and as you learned, we definitely need a render function. In that render function,

23
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:56,220
I want to render an input where the user can insert a symbol and we'll later add another component that

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,450
helps with finding these symbols,

25
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,820
so we'll add an input where users can enter this symbol and then, we'll add a place where we output that

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,660
price of course and potentially also some error message if we don't find a symbol.

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,600
So let's first of all add these two things by returning an array here because I want to have two sibling

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,340
top level elements which is only possible by passing them in an array and there for one, I'll have a

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,920
normal input and that input can of course be self-closing here and that input will be or 

30
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,390
I'll give it an ID,

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,630
stock symbol and I also will have my output area which

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,340
let's say is a div here and in that div, I'll have a paragraph where I say price and then thereafter,

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,160
I want to output the price.

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,650
I'll just plug in a zero here but of course later, we'll reference some property of our class here.

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,310
Now what is missing?

36
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,230
Well we need one other element,

37
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,610
we need a button where the user can confirm the symbol picked and I'll add this in a div where I wrap

38
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,500
both the input and the button.

39
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,280
So here I'll have my div and next to my input,

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,800
I have a button where I say fetch and we could wrap this in a form here.

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,800
Let's actually do that, makes sense I guess, to use a form instead of a div 

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:39,820
and now when this form get submitted, so I'll set this here to type submit, this button which is a default

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,530
type built into HTML, so that this form gets submitted when this button gets pressed,

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,750
we want to listen to the form submit and fetch that input value here.

45
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,210
That will be the first step because that will allow us to, as a next step, fetch our price.
