1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,720
Now of course it's nice to be able to open the side drawer,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,170
what about closing? In order to be able to close it,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,690
I'll add something in the header of my side drawer,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,650
I want to have like a close button there, so I will actually add a button, simply with the x on it

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,820
and now if we have a look at this,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,990
can't even see it because it will be placed below the main menu

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
but it has a black text by default,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,690
so we'll need to do some styling there,

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,440
let's quickly do that.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,160
Go into my side drawer style file and here, for the header, I'll

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,160
add a special rule for my button header

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,090
and first of all, I want to position this in an absolute way,

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,860
so I'll set the position of my header to relative, so that absolute positions inside of it refer to

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,320
the header and then for the button, the position will be absolute and I'll put it in the top right corner.

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,420
So from the top we have no distance and from the right, we have no distance

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,940
and then here in the button now, I'll have a padding of let's say 1rem.

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,180
I'll have a text color of white,

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,950
I'll have a background which should be transparent and I'll add a fun size of let's say 2rem and now

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,300
let's have a look at that.

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,590
This is now how it looks like,

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,900
better not perfect,

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,360
let's remove the border by setting border to none and it's a little bit too big,

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,080
so I'll actually set the font size to 1.5rem and now we have this x button here which will do

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,240
for now.

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,470
Now when I click this button, I want to close my modal.

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,140
I also don't want to have that outline around it, so I'll set the focus state and this is all normal CSS

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,510
by the way in case you want to learn more about that,

28
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,820
have a look at my Complete CSS Guide,

29
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,860
I want to set that focus state and I want to set the outline of the button to none here so that this

30
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,430
orange outline goes away.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,280
But now we have this button added, now with it being added,

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,790
I want to close my side drawer when we click it, right? Now for that and I will get rid of this comment here

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:15,350
because it takes up so much space, for that we can add a method, we can name it onCloseDrawer.

34
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,160
Now you can name these methods however you want but I like to name them in such a way if I trigger them

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,300
as a result or if I call them as a result of an event getting triggered from somewhere,

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,030
so then I like to have this on something naming convention here.

37
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,190
However ultimately, that naming is up to you and it's not like there is a single right or wrong way of

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,880
naming this.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,090
So here onCloseDrawer is the name and in onCloseDrawer,

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,830
I want to, guess what? Close the drawer,

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,950
so I want to set this open equal to false, right because open is what controls the mode of this drawer.

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,210
Now we just need to hook this up to the button and there are various ways of doing that,

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,310
one of the simplest ways is to add onClick

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,760
here, written like this as an attribute to this button,

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
this is again supported by JSX,

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,760
then you have curly braces and then you point at the method of your class you want to use here,

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,760
so this and then onCloseDrawer

48
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,820
and you don't execute it so no parentheses are added.

49
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,970
You just point at it,

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,090
you just point at the reference or you pass the reference of your method to onClick and then it will

51
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,870
be executed for you when the button is clicked.

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,920
Now one important gotcha here,

53
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,820
we use this in onCloseDrawer and due to the way the this keyword works in Javascript, this would not refer

54
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,180
to the class when being called but to the button,

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,720
so we have to bind this here to make sure it always refers to class.

56
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,340
Now if we try that and we reload here, we open and we click this button,

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,630
we get a warning that the side drawer or this open property there can't be modified

58
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,160
and indeed, it did not close.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,400
The reason for that is one important reason or thing you have to keep in mind. Props by default

60
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,630
are immutable, which means you can't change them from inside.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,370
You can change them from outside,

62
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,730
we can set a new value here from the index.html file or manually in the dev tools but from inside

63
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,000
the component, you can't change the value because stencil has something which is called a uni-directional

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,850
dataflow which means data always only flows in one direction,

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,820
in this case from outside the component to inside the component. If we want to change it this inside,

66
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,540
we can do so by adding another configuration where we set mutable to true

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,020
and now we are allowed to change this and together with reflect to attribute, this change will even be

68
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,510
reflected back to our tag

69
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:04,600
in the DOM. So now if I save this and I reload and I open this, if I click this, it indeed closes and we get no warning

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,340
and if I inspect this in the dev tools,

71
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,950
so my overall element, you see open, the attribute is present.

72
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,070
If I click this button, 

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,910
it is removed, so this reflect to attribute thing works there as well.

74
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,330
So this is how we can close it with the help of a click listener and our own method and the mutable

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,670
configuration which is a fine way of doing that

76
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,630
in this scenario but there is another way of changing data inside the component too.
