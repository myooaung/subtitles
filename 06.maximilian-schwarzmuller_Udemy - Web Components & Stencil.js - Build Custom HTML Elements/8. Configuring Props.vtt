00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.480
So we added the prop decorator

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.900
and this is one of the most common decorators you'll be using, besides the component decorator of course

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.990
because it allows you to communicate with your component from outside, through attributes or by directly

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.210
setting the properties.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.140
One important note, when you do set the property as we did here in this line, you know this because I also

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.640
showed it the attribute didn't change,

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.920
right.

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.130
Just to show this again, I comment it in.

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.690
Now watch the attribute here on the right, as this changes too it changed, the title here

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.380
still is main menu.

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.790
Now if we wanted to reflect changes to the props, to the attribute, we can configure prop here by passing

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.390
a Javascript object and then we can set reflect to attr to true

13
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.350
and now this will have one important effect if we reload this,

14
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.020
you will see that on the right here, main menu also changed to it changed.

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.680
So now stencil adds some logic to the generated web component that will update the attribute whenever

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.340
the property changes

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.790
and this can of course be a desired behavior when you also interact with this attribute from outside

18
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.670
your component,

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.550
so from inside your main application script where you want to target all components that have a specific

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.820
attribute value or anything like that.
