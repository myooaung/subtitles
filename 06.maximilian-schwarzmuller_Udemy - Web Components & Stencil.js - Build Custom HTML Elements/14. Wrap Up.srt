00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,190
So in this module, we built a more complex web component.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,630
It has more features and we also learned some new things we can do in web components.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,240
Our modal component extends a HTML element,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:23,320
so it's not extending a built-in HTML element but this base HTML element. We used the shadow DOM and

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,230
then we have our template here with a lot of styles being scoped to it.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,290
Our component actually consists of two parts, the backdrop and the modal, backdrop is in the background, modal

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,660
in the foreground.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,420
We've got multiple slots and they're named slots to make sure we can pass in content into these different

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,180
slots from outside,

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,360
we also have a listener to slot changes which doesn't do much here but which shows you how you can react

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,050
to changes in your slot content

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,840
and for example how you also can get access to the content that is rendered in your slots.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,820
We learned about attributes and how we can use them, not only to listen to changes to them but also

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,390
in our CSS styles which can give us a very convenient way of updating the look of our web component

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,330
based on some external stylings.

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,630
And we had to look at custom events, how we can dispatch them, how we can configure them with bubbles

17
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,780
and composed

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,490
and of course, how we can listen to them from outside our component with normal event listeners.

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,730
Last but not least, we also worked with some public properties and methods, really something that can

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:41,620
be helpful to allow you to not just reach or interact with your component through attributes but by directly

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,270
accessing a property or by directly accessing a method.
