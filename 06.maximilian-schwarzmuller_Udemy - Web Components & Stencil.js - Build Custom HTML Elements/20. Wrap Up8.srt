1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,860
So in this module, we learned a lot about the stencil basics.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,700
Stencil has more to offer,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,380
also more decorators to offer than what you saw thus far but you learned about the core crucial

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:21,130
decorators and features stencil offers you when it comes to building nice web components and I hope

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,050
you already start to see the advantage of using stencil.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,710
We have very clean code here,

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,540
we get a lot of magic done behind the scenes, like the watchers for state and prop changes and I hope

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,040
you also get the core idea behind stencil. Being declarative,

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,260
we write our template here and we have dynamic parts like this title which stencil automatically updates

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,360
for us when title changes

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:58,000
as long as it's a prop or state. That we have a very clean way of defining our methods, that we explicitly

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,030
have to define methods that should be callable from outside and that we have the special magic render

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:11,680
method which stencil uses heavily behind the scenes to update the DOM based on changes triggered through

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,200
props or state.

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,840
It can be strange to get started with JSX at first,

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:25,170
think about it as Javascript with a twist and therefore when you for example want to output conditional

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,530
content, so content A when a certain condition is true and content B if it is not,

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,240
you just use the normal Javascript features like if statements to output content under a different

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,810
condition.

20
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,950
This is stencil.js

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,920
in a nutshell or the basics about stencil.js,

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,320
there is way more we can do with it of course and there is way more we'll dive into in the next course

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,920
modules.
