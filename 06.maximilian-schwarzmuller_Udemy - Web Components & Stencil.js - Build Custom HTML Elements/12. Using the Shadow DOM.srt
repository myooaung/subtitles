00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:10,500
To understand the shadow DOM, let's understand how the normal DOM, also sometimes called the light DOM works.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,060
For that in your developer tools, you can click on the elements tab,

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,560
this is your DOM tree essentially.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,470
You see that paragraph and in there, you also see your custom component.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,460
Now when you expand your custom component, you also see that span that was added

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,480
and when you hover over the question mark, you'll see that this div gets added here too.

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,640
Now there is one important thing to note here,

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,690
the span with the question mark and that overlay div are all added to the normal, to the light

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,910
DOM here. We are not using anything special,

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,900
we're not using the shadow DOM.

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:57,590
So our custom component here in the end has a child which is this span with the question mark.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,700
Now what would be nice is if in a normal, in the light DOM, we had our custom component and the span

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,320
or anything else like this overlay div which gets added is kind of hidden away behind that and is not

14
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,650
added to the normal DOM because that would then mean that any styles we set up in a normal DOM would

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,180
not affect our nested custom component DOM.

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,410
So basically our custom component here should have its own DOM tree which is not mixed or which is not

17
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,430
kind of affected by the normal DOM tree and that would be the definition of the shadow DOM, our element

18
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,720
should have its own DOM behind it which kind of makes up what we see on the page but which is not directly

19
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,440
connected to the real DOM, which is not affected by global styles

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:59,160
and the other way around. Now we have a specification in the browser that allows us to add such a functionality

21
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,780
and we can unlock it in a very easy way. In the constructor,

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,800
we simply call this attachShadow and there, we pass a Javascript object where we simply set the mode

23
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,600
to open.

24
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:24,180
Now you can set it to closed and this simply defines whether you can access your shadow DOM tree from outside

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,160
this component or not.

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,860
Now closing is something you will typically not do because even if it is closed, there are ways to still

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,930
access it and it's simply not worth the effort,

28
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,110
after all you are the developer and if you don't want to access it from outside, you simply don't do

29
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,690
it.

30
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,140
So we'll set it to open throughout the rest of this course.

31
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,320
Now this element has its own shadow DOM tree attached to it,

32
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:58,560
we now just have to make sure that whenever we add new DOM elements with append child, we don't append

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,750
them to our HTML element which is still part of the light DOM but to the shadow DOM of that

34
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:13,770
HTML element and for that when I call append child, I will first of all access the shadow root and that

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,450
is now set since we set up a shadow DOM here in the constructor.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,990
So this will now access the shadow DOM tree and append the child to it. Visually, this will not change

37
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:32,700
much but you will see that this will have a great impact and I do the same here where I append this tooltipContainer

38
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,470
.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,640
I access my shadow root and also of course when I remove it, I access my shadow root,

40
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,310
so I access the shadow DOM. With that you can now save that

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,210
and if you now reload the page, you will notice one important thing right away. The text which was written

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,950
between our opening and closing tags here,

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,380
so web components and here we go,

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,830
that text is gone now and the reason for that can be seen when we inspect our custom element here. You'll

45
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,240
see it

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,080
now all of a sudden has a shadow root element which it didn't have before

47
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,900
and there, we see the shadow DOM. Now

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,620
conveniently we can see it here in the developer tools

49
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,890
but thanks to that shadow root, this is now detached from the main DOM

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,270
and we can prove that by hovering over the question mark, you see the orange border of the div is now gone

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,060
even though we still have that rule here. We still have that styling rule

52
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,890
but now with that shadow root being set up, this is gone.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,700
Now obviously as I just mentioned, our text between the opening and closing tags is also gone,

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,290
so we have to bring that back and to bring it back,

55
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,100
we'll use the other feature I mentioned, templates.

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,290
Now what's up with templates?
