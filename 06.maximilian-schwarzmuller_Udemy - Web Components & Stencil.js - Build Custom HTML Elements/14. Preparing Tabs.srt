00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,990
Let's say in our side drawer, we actually want to have two tabs.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,140
One tab has these links and the other tab has some information about our page,

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,890
something like the imprint contact information,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,530
anything like that. For that let me

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,380
first of all add a little tab toggle here.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:29,060
So above the main section, I'll add a section, may give it an ID maybe of tabs, you can name this however

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,680
you want

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,040
and in there, I'll have two buttons.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:41,510
I'll have my button with the text navigation and one with contact.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,720
Now if I save that, this is how it looks like,

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,650
let's change the styling a little bit.

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,220
So I'll go to my side drawer here,

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:00,490
select the tabs. Here I'll use flex box to justify my content in the center and I'll select my buttons

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,090
here to give them an equal width

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,130
essentially, both should have a width of let's say 30% of the available width, the tabs

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:19,470
overall have 100% of the width of the side drawer and each button should have a background color of

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:27,010
transparent let's say or of white maybe, text color of black, text should be aligned in the center

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:37,550
in the button, I want to have a border of 1px solid and black and the font should be inherited,

19
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,430
so that it takes the same font family as the rest of the page. With that, whoops, I should change this

20
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,580
by the way to

21
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,390
ID selector tb, so #tabs of course.

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,090
So with that if I go back, this looks a little bit better.

23
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,930
Now for the overall tabs, I want to have some margin to top and bottom, 0 to left and right but now

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,540
just to have some distance and then in my buttons, I also want to have some padding,

25
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,720
so I'll give this a padding to top and bottom of .15rem, 0 left or right because I have a fixed width

26
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,760
with text centering

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,740
anyways and this doesn't look too bad.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,020
Now I have these two tabs there.

29
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,760
Now let's also make sure we have an active tab and that we can change it,

30
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:32,400
the active tab should have some identifier, maybe a class named active or an attribute named active, whatever

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,270
you want

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,240
and then we can use that in CSS so that we say ok, in my tabs, a button with the active class, that

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,400
should actually have a background of black and a text color of white,

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,690
so basically inversed.

35
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,490
And now if I go back, we see that first one is active and if we click the other one, that should of course get active

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,600
and I want to be able to toggle between there and show different content based on the button that is

37
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,410
selected. For that, I'll just tweak that rule a little bit more quickly to have styles

38
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,000
when I hover over a button or I click it,

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:13,010
so I'll add my hover state and I'll also add my active state but that's just a little side note.

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:21,870
Now one last style I want to add here is that for my button here, when I focus them, then there should

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,780
be no outline. With that, we're done,

42
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,130
now I got these nice buttons, I can click them but of course nothing happens when I do so,

43
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,730
so we'll add the logic together in the next lecture.
