1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,720
The implementation we're currently using is absolutely fine,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,840
it opens the modal but we could also add another way of using our modal. We get access to it here in

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:21,180
code, in our Javascript code and it's always important to remember that what you get here is a full Javascript

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:30,330
object, the Javascript object representing this DOM node and this object can be used to set the attribute,

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,520
we could also set classes there,

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:40,250
we could even remove it from the DOM and since it is an object, it is an object based on our class here.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,040
This is in the end the object that was generated for us by the browser,

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,170
it has all the default properties of HTML element which we extend here and it has its default methods

9
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,970
and actually, set attribute is just a default method of every HTML

10
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,140
element

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,370
and since we extend HTML elements here, our own modal object also has set attribute available. But

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,600
this means that if we add any new properties or methods in our class, we can also access these from outside

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,960
and therefore, one thing we could add here is an open method.

14
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,770
Now please note that I did not add an underscore at the beginning here because I don't want to mark

15
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,200
this as private,

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,290
it should indeed be accessible from outside

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,280
and what I do in here is here,

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,050
I add some code to show my modal and again, this could be the code we used here before

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,650
or I set my attribute

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,270
inside here.

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,930
Now what this allows me to do with this open method added is that I go back to my index.html

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:02,030
HTML file and instead of setting the attribute here which I absolutely can do, I can call open here

23
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,330
on my modal object because I just added this open method and if you're wondering why I would do it like

24
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,900
this,

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:17,690
well I can abstract complexity away from my main document, from me as a component user and manage it inside

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,980
of my component.

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,770
Now obviously, the complexity is not very large here but if we were adding different elements or anything

28
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,940
like that, then all we have to do outside is call open and we do all the magic inside of this open method

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,780
inside of our component.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,170
So this is not a strictly better approach than setting the attribute manually as we did before

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,970
outside of the component, it's just an alternative, an alternative of which you should be aware.

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,260
And actually it's perfectly fine to handle both cases,

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,490
the case that we add opened manually from outside

34
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,580
or that we call open

35
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,620
and you do find built-in elements where you can call a method to do something or where you can call

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,690
a method from outside to do something.

37
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:11,090
Now with this adjusted, I can reload my page and still open a modal because it has still the same

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,850
mechanism,

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,480
still the open attribute gets added

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,440
but now we're not doing this manually with our own code,

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,810
we're calling open outside instead and this is just one alternative

42
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,860
I wanted to show you here.

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,940
Also be aware that you cannot just call methods from outside, if you had some public properties, so any

44
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:41,460
other properties like let's say this.isOpen and you set this to false initially and we change this

45
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,380
to true here,

46
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,240
then you can access this from outside too.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,560
So now we have isOpen here and now after calling modal open, if I console log modal isOpen here

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,920
from outside my component, you will see that if I open the console and I reload and I click this button,

49
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:12,200
we see false here because I should set it to true in open and not leave it as false.

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,810
So let's give this another try,

51
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,600
reload,

52
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,750
now we see true here.

53
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,620
So we can also access properties from outside our component and we might have some useful information

54
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,890
in there which we now can extract and use programmatically from our main document, from our main application

55
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,420
logic which would be this one and which we still manage inside of our modem.

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
Now a little side note, if we do expose this isOpen formation,

57
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,780
then we all of a sudden need to re-add our attributeChangedCallback, not change the styles here

58
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:57,970
but certainly change this.isOpen to true here. And on the other hand, if we don't have that open attribute,

59
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,880
we want to change isOpen to false here and

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,450
by the way, we can get rid of that outer check,

61
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,810
we can always check for the existence of this attribute even if this attributeChangedCallback was triggered

62
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,450
due to the change in some totally different attribute.

63
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,210
So now this is totally optional, just to show you that you can access properties from outside too

64
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:26,020
but now we have this extra functionality added where we can always access this information too through

65
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,330
this public property.

66
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,210
Now with this isOpen property exposed,

67
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,650
we can actually enhance our logic out here

68
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,500
and we can check that if this button gets clicked,

69
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,570
we only want to open a modal if modal is open is not true.

70
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,180
So if it is not true,

71
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,180
hence an exclamation mark at the beginning,

72
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,880
otherwise we don't have to call open because it already seems to be open.

73
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm not sure how we could click this but if we did something fishy, well then we would block this.

74
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,350
So here I can show console log opening

75
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,040
and now if I reload, we see opening here

76
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
but now if I hack this and I manually remove the backdrop,

77
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,590
now I all of a sudden can click this button again

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,070
but now you will see if I do

79
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,540
so, we don't see opening again because of this extra check.

80
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,850
So now we have this extra check which is a little bit useful here

81
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,720
but it's easy to imagine either components where you would need to get some information from inside

82
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,110
to prevent strange logic from running outside,

83
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,580
so in your main application and then public properties like isOpen can be very helpful.
