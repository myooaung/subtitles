00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.000
As you saw, within 10 minutes,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.850
we added authentication to our application by

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.940
outsourcing it to an authorization server.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.240
And longer term, it's a more scalable solution as the number

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.640
of applications in your organization grow.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.800
And Keycloak also supports microservices,

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.340
which I describe in the following modules of my previous OAuth 2 course.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.480
So if you're developing a new application,

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
you should consider using an authorization server or some sort

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980
of authorization authentication as a service.

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.340
It's more scalable, more secure, and yeah, it's just simpler.

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.160
And there are many more products out there now. And soon, Spring

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.140
Security will even have its own authorization server.

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.550
Next,

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.000
let's look at how logging out works with an OAuth 2 authorization server in the mix.
