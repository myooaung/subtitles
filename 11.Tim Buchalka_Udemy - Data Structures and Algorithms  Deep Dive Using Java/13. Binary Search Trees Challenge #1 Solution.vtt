00:00:00.487  -->  00:00:03.154
(opening music)
2

2

00:00:05.477  -->  00:00:08.438
<v Sarah>All right, so let's write the code to</v>
3

3

00:00:08.438  -->  00:00:11.377
traverse's tree using PreOrder.
4

4

00:00:11.377  -->  00:00:14.169
We're gonna start in the TreeNode class
5

5

00:00:14.169  -->  00:00:17.450
and here's our traverseInOrder method and all we have
6

6

00:00:17.450  -->  00:00:21.268
to do differently is we want to visit the route first.
7

7

00:00:21.268  -->  00:00:23.865
For InOrder we we visit the left subtree
8

8

00:00:23.865  -->  00:00:25.872
and then we visit the node itself
9

9

00:00:25.872  -->  00:00:27.745
and then we visit the right subtree.
10

10

00:00:27.745  -->  00:00:30.821
While for PreOrder, we want to visit the node itself
11

11

00:00:30.821  -->  00:00:33.789
and then the left subtree and then the right subtree.
12

12

00:00:33.789  -->  00:00:36.206
I'm gonna copy this code here
13

13

00:00:38.529  -->  00:00:39.733
and paste it
14

14

00:00:39.733  -->  00:00:42.150
and we're gonna call this one
15

15

00:00:43.473  -->  00:00:45.263
traversePreOrder.
16

16

00:00:45.263  -->  00:00:47.882
We want to call traversePreOrder in this method,
17

17

00:00:47.882  -->  00:00:51.120
we don't wanna do it InOrder traversal here
18

18

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:55.180
and then all we need to do is move this line
19

19

00:00:55.180  -->  00:00:59.206
above the lines that handle the left and right subtrees.
20

20

00:00:59.206  -->  00:01:02.622
And by doing that, we'll now if we call traversePreOrder
21

21

00:01:02.622  -->  00:01:05.529
we'll visit the node first, this node
22

22

00:01:05.529  -->  00:01:07.562
and then we'll visit its left subtree
23

23

00:01:07.562  -->  00:01:09.161
and then its right subtree.
24

24

00:01:09.161  -->  00:01:11.395
We're doing the root of the subtree first
25

25

00:01:11.395  -->  00:01:13.070
and then the left and then the right
26

26

00:01:13.070  -->  00:01:15.331
and that's all there is to it.
27

27

00:01:15.331  -->  00:01:18.255
Now if we wanted to do a PostOrder traversal of course
28

28

00:01:18.255  -->  00:01:21.036
we'd just move this line to the bottom of the method
29

29

00:01:21.036  -->  00:01:22.628
and of course we'd change the method
30

30

00:01:22.628  -->  00:01:24.891
calls to call traversePostOrder.
31

31

00:01:24.891  -->  00:01:28.570
So it's just a matter of where we actually visit this node.
32

32

00:01:28.570  -->  00:01:31.630
Do we visit it before the children, after the children
33

33

00:01:31.630  -->  00:01:34.968
or in the case of InOrder in between the left and right?
34

34

00:01:34.968  -->  00:01:39.135
Let's go to the Tree class and I'm gonna copy the
35

35

00:01:40.134  -->  00:01:42.457
traverseInOrder code
36

36

00:01:42.457  -->  00:01:46.479
and just change that to traversePreOrder
37

37

00:01:46.479  -->  00:01:49.312
and we'll do traversePreOrder here
38

38

00:01:50.208  -->  00:01:55.041
and let's go try Main method and I'll copy these two lines
39

39

00:01:56.974  -->  00:02:00.068
and just change this to traversePreOrder
40

40

00:02:00.068  -->  00:02:01.826
and that should be it.
41

41

00:02:01.826  -->  00:02:04.584
So here's traversePreOrder in the TreeNode class
42

42

00:02:04.584  -->  00:02:07.967
it's just a matter of visiting this node first
43

43

00:02:07.967  -->  00:02:11.146
in the Tree class which is called traversePreOrder
44

44

00:02:11.146  -->  00:02:13.610
instead of traverseInOrder and then in Main
45

45

00:02:13.610  -->  00:02:15.643
let's just call our method in the Tree class.
46

46

00:02:15.643  -->  00:02:16.643
So let's run
47

47

00:02:18.988  -->  00:02:20.942
and here's the InOrder traversal
48

48

00:02:20.942  -->  00:02:22.811
and you'll remember that when we traverse InOrder
49

49

00:02:22.811  -->  00:02:24.826
we get the values in sorted order
50

50

00:02:24.826  -->  00:02:28.034
and then here's our PreOrder traversal.
51

51

00:02:28.034  -->  00:02:31.409
So we have twenty five, twenty, fifteen, seventeen,
52

52

00:02:31.409  -->  00:02:35.734
twenty two, twenty seven, twenty six, thirty, twenty nine
53

53

00:02:35.734  -->  00:02:36.585
and thirty two.
54

54

00:02:36.585  -->  00:02:39.948
And that's what we expected, that's what we went through
55

55

00:02:39.948  -->  00:02:41.689
in the last video.
56

56

00:02:41.689  -->  00:02:44.046
That's it, fairly straight forward.
57

57

00:02:44.046  -->  00:02:45.879
Let's move on to the next challenge.
58

58

00:02:45.879  -->  00:02:47.546
I'll see you there.
