00:00:05.446  -->  00:00:06.392
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>
2

2

00:00:06.392  -->  00:00:07.748
we're gonna go ahead and download and instal
3

3

00:00:07.748  -->  00:00:08.944
the Java development kit.
4

4

00:00:08.944  -->  00:00:11.027
Also known as the JDK.
5

5

00:00:11.027  -->  00:00:12.310
We're gonna instal it on Linux,
6

6

00:00:12.310  -->  00:00:17.310
specifically were going to instal it on Ubuntu 16.04.
7

7

00:00:17.313  -->  00:00:19.761
So if you're running a different version of Linux
8

8

00:00:19.761  -->  00:00:22.196
you should be able to follow along and do something similar
9

9

00:00:22.196  -->  00:00:23.569
for your disc Drive.
10

10

00:00:23.569  -->  00:00:26.257
And also keep in mind if you're running on a Windows machine
11

11

00:00:26.257  -->  00:00:27.878
or a Mac computer,
12

12

00:00:27.878  -->  00:00:30.168
we've actually got separate videos
13

13

00:00:30.168  -->  00:00:31.471
for your operating systems
14

14

00:00:31.471  -->  00:00:33.667
because the process is slightly different.
15

15

00:00:33.667  -->  00:00:35.126
But if you're on a Linux machine,
16

16

00:00:35.126  -->  00:00:38.439
follow along because you're at the right place.
17

17

00:00:38.439  -->  00:00:39.659
All right so the first thing we wanna do
18

18

00:00:39.659  -->  00:00:41.216
is open up a command window.
19

19

00:00:41.216  -->  00:00:44.299
So I'm just going to open a terminal.
20

20

00:00:45.981  -->  00:00:48.892
I'm just going to bring that in and enlarge it a little bit.
21

21

00:00:48.892  -->  00:00:51.612
And what we'll do first is we'll do a sudo space,
22

22

00:00:51.612  -->  00:00:54.254
apt dash get space update.
23

23

00:00:54.254  -->  00:00:57.162
This will update the package index.
24

24

00:00:57.162  -->  00:00:58.995
Type in your password.
25

25

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:04.195
Give that a moment to complete.
26

26

00:01:04.195  -->  00:01:05.028
And you can see that that was pretty quick.
27

27

00:01:05.028  -->  00:01:06.686
So the next thing we're gonna do now is type
28

28

00:01:06.686  -->  00:01:09.936
sudo space add dash apt dash repository
29

29

00:01:13.144  -->  00:01:14.394
space ppa colon
30

30

00:01:16.216  -->  00:01:18.799
webupdateam forward slash java.
31

31

00:01:22.755  -->  00:01:25.634
Give that a moment to complete.
32

32

00:01:25.634  -->  00:01:26.634
Press Enter.
33

33

00:01:28.187  -->  00:01:29.888
Once that's finished you can do a
34

34

00:01:29.888  -->  00:01:32.971
sudo space apt dash get space update.
35

35

00:01:37.659  -->  00:01:39.305
Once that's finished we're gonna do a
36

36

00:01:39.305  -->  00:01:42.388
sudo space apt dash get space instal
37

37

00:01:44.226  -->  00:01:47.976
space oracle space Java eight dash Installer.
38

38

00:01:51.812  -->  00:01:53.638
And I'm going to press yes there
39

39

00:01:53.638  -->  00:01:55.494
or select yes and press enter,
40

40

00:01:55.494  -->  00:01:57.139
or select Y I should say,
41

41

00:01:57.139  -->  00:01:58.615
or type it anyway.
42

42

00:01:58.615  -->  00:02:00.217
And then we're going to go through this
43

43

00:02:00.217  -->  00:02:01.143
little configuration guide.
44

44

00:02:01.143  -->  00:02:03.723
So going to press enter.
45

45

00:02:03.723  -->  00:02:06.667
And do we accept the Oracle Binary Code Licence Terms?
46

46

00:02:06.667  -->  00:02:10.675
Yes to that and I'm going to press enter.
47

47

00:02:10.675  -->  00:02:11.508
And you can see that's now going away
48

48

00:02:11.508  -->  00:02:13.508
and downloading the JDK.
49

49

00:02:14.938  -->  00:02:16.146
So I'll give that a moment to complete.
50

50

00:02:16.146  -->  00:02:17.810
I'm just going to fast forward this video
51

51

00:02:17.810  -->  00:02:20.060
to the end of the download.
52

52

00:02:22.030  -->  00:02:23.406
Okay the download's complete.
53

53

00:02:23.406  -->  00:02:27.212
It's just finishing the configuration
54

54

00:02:27.212  -->  00:02:28.734
and that's now complete.
55

55

00:02:28.734  -->  00:02:30.730
And what we're doing now is we'll type in
56

56

00:02:30.730  -->  00:02:33.647
sudo space update dash alternatives
57

57

00:02:37.903  -->  00:02:38.736
two minus signs,
58

58

00:02:38.736  -->  00:02:40.369
two dashes in other words config space java.
59

59

00:02:40.369  -->  00:02:44.119
And you can see that there's an option there.
60

60

00:02:45.060  -->  00:02:46.339
You can select either of those
61

61

00:02:46.339  -->  00:02:48.526
but the correct option is showing for me.
62

62

00:02:48.526  -->  00:02:51.316
You can see that it shows Java 8 Oracle.
63

63

00:02:51.316  -->  00:02:53.425
So depending on your installation of Linux,
64

64

00:02:53.425  -->  00:02:56.337
you might have other versions of the Java,
65

65

00:02:56.337  -->  00:02:59.904
perhaps Open JDK or a different version of Java
66

66

00:02:59.904  -->  00:03:01.600
so you can select the relevant option.
67

67

00:03:01.600  -->  00:03:04.065
But in this case the default option is correct
68

68

00:03:04.065  -->  00:03:05.442
and we're good to go.
69

69

00:03:05.442  -->  00:03:08.866
So I'm just going to press enter there to not do anything
70

70

00:03:08.866  -->  00:03:10.771
and the last thing to do is just type in
71

71

00:03:10.771  -->  00:03:14.354
java space dash v or try dash dash version.
72

72

00:03:18.451  -->  00:03:21.928
[Mumbles] with java space dash version.
73

73

00:03:21.928  -->  00:03:23.276
That's what I was trying to do the first time.
74

74

00:03:23.276  -->  00:03:27.560
And that now confirms that we've successfully installed Java
75

75

00:03:27.560  -->  00:03:29.517
and you can see that it shows that we're running,
76

76

00:03:29.517  -->  00:03:33.269
in this particular case, build 25.144
77

77

00:03:33.269  -->  00:03:38.269
or we can see on the previous line up here build 1.8.0_1 4 4
78

78

00:03:38.872  -->  00:03:40.947
so this number here may be different for you.
79

79

00:03:40.947  -->  00:03:43.150
144 indicates the build release.
80

80

00:03:43.150  -->  00:03:47.586
In this case JD Java development kit version 8.
81

81

00:03:47.586  -->  00:03:49.626
But the point is that we're good to go.
82

82

00:03:49.626  -->  00:03:52.217
So that's now downloaded and installed correctly
83

83

00:03:52.217  -->  00:03:53.050
and what we can do.
84

84

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:54.367
We've checked that job is on there.
85

85

00:03:54.367  -->  00:03:58.143
We can type in JavaC which is the Java compiler
86

86

00:03:58.143  -->  00:03:59.919
just to confirm that that actually worked
87

87

00:03:59.919  -->  00:04:02.159
and that's part of the Java development kit.
88

88

00:04:02.159  -->  00:04:04.089
And you can see that that's come up as well
89

89

00:04:04.089  -->  00:04:05.565
and if we wanted to,
90

90

00:04:05.565  -->  00:04:08.398
we could do the same with version.
91

91

00:04:09.383  -->  00:04:10.716
JavaC 1.8.0_144.
92

92

00:04:12.057  -->  00:04:13.179
So in other words,
93

93

00:04:13.179  -->  00:04:15.116
we've gotta have Java development kit installed
94

94

00:04:15.116  -->  00:04:19.533
and we can proceed now and move on to the next video.
