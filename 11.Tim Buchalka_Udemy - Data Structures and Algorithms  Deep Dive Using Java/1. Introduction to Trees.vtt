<v Sarah>In this section,</v>

4

00:00:06.083  -->  00:00:08.420
we're gonna take a look at trees.
5

5

00:00:08.420  -->  00:00:11.350
Now some people say trees are data structures
6

6

00:00:11.350  -->  00:00:13.550
and others say they're abstract data types.
7

7

00:00:13.550  -->  00:00:14.740
It's a bit of a grey area,
8

8

00:00:14.740  -->  00:00:18.770
because trees do dictate how to organise the data.
9

9

00:00:18.770  -->  00:00:23.730
And you can write a tree using tree and tree note classes
10

10

00:00:23.730  -->  00:00:25.210
and that's commonly done,
11

11

00:00:25.210  -->  00:00:29.750
but you can also back certain types of trees with arrays.
12

12

00:00:29.750  -->  00:00:31.400
And so it's a little bit of a grey area.
13

13

00:00:31.400  -->  00:00:34.300
You'll hear them referred to as data structures
14

14

00:00:34.300  -->  00:00:36.470
and as abstract data types.
15

15

00:00:36.470  -->  00:00:37.770
So we're gonna start this section
16

16

00:00:37.770  -->  00:00:41.200
by looking at the characteristics of trees, in general.
17

17

00:00:41.200  -->  00:00:42.270
And then we're gonna move on
18

18

00:00:42.270  -->  00:00:46.060
to a special type of tree, called a binary search tree,
19

19

00:00:46.060  -->  00:00:50.480
because that's a tree that you'll probably use in practise.
20

20

00:00:50.480  -->  00:00:51.820
And so let's get started.
21

21

00:00:51.820  -->  00:00:53.370
I'll see you in the next video.
