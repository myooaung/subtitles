<v ->Alright, so, the first challenge for this section</v>
4

4

00:00:08,160  -->  00:00:09,950
is gonna be pretty easy.
5

5

00:00:09,950  -->  00:00:11,440
Gonna be a warm up challenge.
6

6

00:00:11,440  -->  00:00:15,690
What I want you to do is modify the merge sort algorithm
7

7

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:20,140
so that it sorts the integers in descending order.
8

8

00:00:20,140  -->  00:00:23,330
Now, I want you to sort the usual example array
9

9

00:00:23,330  -->  00:00:26,230
that we used for most of the sort algorithms
10

10

00:00:26,230  -->  00:00:30,050
and in the resources section there's a start project
11

11

00:00:30,050  -->  00:00:32,170
that basically contains what we did
12

12

00:00:32,170  -->  00:00:34,370
in the merge sort implementation video.
13

13

00:00:34,370  -->  00:00:37,850
So, it has the array and then the call to merge sort
14

14

00:00:37,850  -->  00:00:40,090
and then it has the merge sort code
15

15

00:00:40,090  -->  00:00:43,040
except the merge sort code that we implemented
16

16

00:00:43,040  -->  00:00:45,840
sorts the integers in ascending order.
17

17

00:00:45,840  -->  00:00:49,220
So, I want you to modify the implementation
18

18

00:00:49,220  -->  00:00:52,840
so that it sorts the integers in descending order.
19

19

00:00:52,840  -->  00:00:57,200
I strongly encourage you to actually do these challenges.
20

20

00:00:57,200  -->  00:01:00,620
Even if you struggle and you don't figure it out,
21

21

00:01:00,620  -->  00:01:03,560
you're going to be a lot farther ahead by trying
22

22

00:01:03,560  -->  00:01:06,470
than you will be if you just click the next video button
23

23

00:01:06,470  -->  00:01:07,750
and watch the solution.
24

24

00:01:07,750  -->  00:01:11,753
So, give it a try and I'll see you in the solution video.
