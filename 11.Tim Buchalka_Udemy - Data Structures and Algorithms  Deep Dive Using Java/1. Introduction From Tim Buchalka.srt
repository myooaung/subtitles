Hello and welcome to the Data Structures and
Algorithms Using Java course. My name is

2

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:10,349
Tim Buchalka and I'm the instructor in
this course. Now I wanted to make this

3

00:00:10,349  -->  00:00:14,250
video because you'll probably be
surprised when you go onto the next

4

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:18,690
video and see that there's another
instructor who's created the videos the

5

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:23,039
reason for that is fully explained in an
announcement that I sent out towards the

6

00:00:23,039  -->  00:00:27,300
end of January 2019 because there's a
link to that announcement in the

7

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:30,660
resources section for this video that's
at the top left so click on that if you

8

00:00:30,660  -->  00:00:33,690
want to find out the full details but I
just wanted to make it clear very

9

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:37,500
quickly that the bottom line is I've now
taken over the course and I'm going to

10

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:41,760
be releasing new content moving forward
in this course as well as updating it

11

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:45,719
now if you've seen a good portion of
this course already I suggest you go

12

00:00:45,719  -->  00:00:50,010
down towards the end of the
course, the last section and there's a

13

00:00:50,010  -->  00:00:54,930
lecture there with
a link to a survey and that survey will

14

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:58,920
alone enable you to give me some
feedback on what you like and dislike

15

00:00:58,920  -->  00:01:03,210
about the course what you'd like to see
added updated etc. If you could take a

16

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:06,540
moment to update that once you've seen a
good portion of the course or some of

17

00:01:06,540  -->  00:01:09,720
the course that would be great because
then I could start working on this new

18

00:01:09,720  -->  00:01:13,650
content I'm really committed to making
this the best possible course on Data

19

00:01:13,650  -->  00:01:18,090
Structures and Algorithms using Java
that I possibly can so with your help we

20

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:21,330
can actually do this together
so in terms of support nothing else is

21

00:01:21,330  -->  00:01:25,470
going to change I've got another person
who's helping me, Goran, he's going to be

22

00:01:25,470  -->  00:01:29,070
helping me as a co-instructor and
answering the questions

23

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:33,540
you have in the
course in the Q&amp;A section so look out

24

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:38,430
for him as well and we're here again to
teach you everything we can about data

25

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:41,400
structures and algorithms so that's it I
just wanted to give you a bit of an

26

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:44,640
update as to what's going on with the
course for now though, proceed to the next

27

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:48,240
video and you can get started
I look forward to seeing you as we work

28

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:52,080
forward in the next coming months updating the content

29

00:01:52,240  -->  00:01:54,680
Cheers for now.
