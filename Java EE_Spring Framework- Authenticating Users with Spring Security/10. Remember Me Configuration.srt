00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,500
The configuration in our security config is actually in two parts,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,540
and you can see that we've got these separated out with a

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,860
comment in between to show you the break.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,170
We need to add in our configure section the rememberMe method call using

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,860
that builder pattern. We'll give it a key, and I just put in there

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,090
superSecretKey, you can actually put one in there that is unique to your

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:31,340
organization, and the call to tokenRepository where we reference this

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,380
being we're going to define down below. The being that we're going to

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,510
create returns an instance of PersistentTokenRepository, which inside

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,270
that method uses a JdbcTokenRepositoryImpl where we pass in our data

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,550
source, and this will actually be used to communicate with our database,

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,900
which will actually be one of the next steps that we

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,410
configure to enable rememberMe services.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's add these two pieces to our security configuration, and then we can look at the changes we need for the database.
