1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,110
From our security configuration that we had before, we have

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,560
already defined the failure URL, and we're going to verify that

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,780
you have this in your project as well.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,640
And that is simply a /login? error=true.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,080
We need to send that error message as a URL

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,370
parameter back to the servicing page.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,660
This isn't the only way to handle errors, but it's definitely the most common.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,050
As you can see here in our configuration section,

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,490
we just add two pieces to our security configuration.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,490
First is the .failureUrl where you can see that we appended the

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,920
error=true parameter on the end, and then the .permitAll which is just

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,000
saying that we want to let everyone be able to see it. Let's add this to our code now.
