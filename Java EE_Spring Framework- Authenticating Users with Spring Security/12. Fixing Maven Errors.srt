00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,330
I wanted to take a second and show you one tip or trick that

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,610
you might need throughout this course, and it doesn't happen very often,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,740
but it's one I get asked enough in the discussion

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,550
forums that I wanted to show it to you.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,220
If you have a problem with the deployment of your project or something

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,310
doesn't seem to be working quite as you had expected it to,

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,800
you may want to go over here to your Maven sidebar and click the

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,820
clean goal and have this go through and completely delete all of

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,130
the resources associated with your generated files in your target

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,410
directory and then compile it.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,540
That's often enough.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,540
I actually like to do a package or even an install.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,910
If you're unfamiliar with those terms,

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,320
you may want to go through the Maven course that we

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,720
have out here on Pluralsight, it's actually another course of mine,

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,190
that will explain what's going on when it does this. And, essentially,

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,730
it's going to go through and completely rebuild your whole

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,900
deployment artifact that you send to your Tomcat server.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,190
So if something stuck, and I see this more with Windows

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,350
machines than I do other machines,

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,000
not just with them, but that does seem to have a resource every

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,940
now and then that gets hung up because it's stuck in a

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,670
deployment or something is not quite right.

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,310
If you're having problems, try that clean and compile or package.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,880
I will say that I see this more often if you are using GitHub or

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,080
a source code control repository, and you're checking out

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,540
versions of code, and you might have a file that's newer than

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,990
what you had before or vice versa.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,990
So it doesn't look to force a compile on it because the

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,740
timestamps have changed on that file.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,910
So if that's a problem,

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,410
something seems stuck, just click that Maven sidebar clean,

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:58,000
compile package, and 99 out of 100 times, it cleans up any problems you may have going on in your workspace.
