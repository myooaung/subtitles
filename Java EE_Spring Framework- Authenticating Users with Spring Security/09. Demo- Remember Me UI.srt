For the UI portion of the rememberMe services,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,390
we want to open up our login.jsp page,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,880
and I have mine open from our previous example.We want to scroll

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,060
down to our form where we perform our login,

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,810
and underneath our password input,

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,540
we want to give ourselves some white space and add in another div label,

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,370
Remember Me input type= checkbox name= remember‑me label div.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,420
So this checkbox, it's really simple,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,690
it's just basic HTML. This checkbox that we're adding in

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,400
here is just the box that we will select on the UI to

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,240
enable these rememberMe services.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,700
I've said it multiple times,

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,840
but I'm afraid you're going to miss it, yours does have to be named the same,

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
remember‑me.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,580
If not,

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,100
it will not work when we add the backend configuration. Let's start

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,140
our server up and see what this does on the UI.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,130
Now that our app is up we can click on Add Registration, and we'll

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,070
see our checkbox down here. Currently it won't do anything, it'll

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,200
submit it to the backend, but we haven't configured that security

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,000
config to accept those yet. Let's look at that configuration now.
