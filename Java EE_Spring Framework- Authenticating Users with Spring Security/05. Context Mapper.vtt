00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.130
The most complex part of customizing the Spring Security object

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.930
when dealing with LDAP is the context mapper.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.220
The context mapper is required to take the user that has been

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.840
authenticated and build the object that gets returned.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.970
We're going to import the data source we have defined for our database, pull the

6
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.840
username of the authenticated user out of that LDAP search,

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.410
then use the context to see what that username is inside the

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
variable ctx, and, finally, query the database to return the

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410
results we want, in this case, the extra fields we're storing,

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.340
such as the nickname.

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.580
Before we can do that, though,

12
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.000
let's alter our database that we used before to include that column for nickname, and then we can build our context mapper.
