1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.100
To create our account.jsp page.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.950
Let's start by opening up our login page,

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.710
and we're going to copy all of the source out of here,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
since we have it all stylized and everything ready to apply that,

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.190
and we want to rightâ€‘click on our jsp directory and say New,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.880
JSP.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090
We're going to call it account,

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.520
and it will add the extension of .jsp on there for us.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.380
We can highlight all this code and paste that in there,

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590
and then we're going to change a couple things inside of here.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.540
I'll make this full screen so we can get a better view of it.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
At the very top, we can change the title to Create

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.300
Account, and we scroll down here.

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.940
There's an h1. We'll change that Create Account as well.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.040
Then we can remove these two divs for error messages with the login.

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.740
And now we're down to the form that will handle just our account creation.

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.540
I want to start off by changing this to a model attribute.

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.080
We could leave the method of post there of account,

19
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.960
and that's going to tie to an account object on the back end.

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.360
And yours may be read like mine is here,

21
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080
and that's because we haven't created that account back in yet.

22
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.640
We're going to here in a second.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.410
I want to go ahead and change this to be Username, and it

24
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.940
can be tied to that name of username.

25
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.270
We'll copy that line a couple of times here, and we'll have First Name. We'll

26
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.860
change that text as well. I am going to do mine camelCase,

27
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.280
and I recommend you follow the exact same convention I am, because it

28
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.900
will work when we tie it to the bean on the back end.

29
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.740
So we'll have Last Name and do the same thing here, Last Name.

30
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:21.530
Now we need to also have an email field, tie that into Email, and

31
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.640
we have our password. We can get rid of this, remember me, from the

32
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.240
login page and paste that down below.

33
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.510
We'll give this a label of Confirm Password. We'll

34
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.540
change the name to Matching Password.

35
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.380
And then the last thing we want to do on this page is

36
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.130
change that value from login to just submit.

37
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.710
I'm going to make mine a capital S, and we'll save this.

38
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.200
Our account page is now set up for us to go ahead and back it, and

39
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.000
we'll next work on supplying that account class so that that red error attribute on my model attribute can go away.
