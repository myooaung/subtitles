00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.380
Just like we did with the registration process,

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.010
to understand the end‑to‑end solution that we're going

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.610
to build for the password reset,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.940
let's actually see the demo first of what we're going to build.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.820
We're going to walk through gathering the username and email

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.600
address information, posting to the controller,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300
sending the email,

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.060
confirming and obtaining the new password that we want to

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.110
set, and finally, updating the login information with that

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.140
new password in our database.

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.380
Let's go ahead and walk through that application now and see everything

12
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.140
that we're going to build in an end‑to‑end solution.

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.880
You'll notice here on our Login page that I have now included a

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.940
Forgot password link. And when we click on that,

15
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.320
it's going to navigate us to a page where it's going to ask us to enter our

16
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.140
username and the email address associated with our account.

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.040
So I'll put in our pluralsightbryantest that we have been using @gmail.com,

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.140
and when I click Reset Password,

19
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.880
it will go ahead and fire off an event that will send a

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.540
password reset email to our Gmail account.

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.540
When I open this up,

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.150
it will take me to a page where it passes that token in now to see

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.340
that we actually do have permissions to do that.

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.820
And I can enter in our new password and click Reset,

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.600
which will go through and round trip to the database and update

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.240
our logging information with that new password.

27
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.040
So, from the UI perspective,

28
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.700
not a lot different from what we did for the creation of

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.730
an account and confirming that account, but on the back end,

30
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.160
a few small tweaks.

31
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.000
So let's dive into those now by starting to look and see what we did with the UI portion of our application.
