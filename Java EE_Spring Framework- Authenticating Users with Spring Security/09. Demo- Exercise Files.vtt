00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.840
If you've gone the other route of not looking at the GitHub instance,

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.310
which is fine, you can navigate to the Home page for this course and

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.790
choose the Exercise files and Download exercise files,

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
and we'll download a ZIP file of all the before and

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.440
afters for each module that we've done.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.300
Once that is finished downloading,

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.760
you can open it up and see there's a folder for each

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.570
module. It has a before and an after,

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.030
as well as a setup.doc. I'm not going to go through and reâ€‘duplicate

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.530
from here how to set that up inside of the IDE because it's the exact

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.520
same as the GitHub demo from this point.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.330
So if you need to see how to set up the Tomcat instance or

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.240
configure Maven and that type of stuff,

14
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.000
you just go through and follow those same set of instructions, and the setup.doc will explain that as well.
