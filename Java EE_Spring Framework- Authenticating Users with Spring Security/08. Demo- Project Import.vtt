00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.090
Once you have downloaded that ZIP file and opened it up,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.630
it should look very similar to this.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.260
You'll see a source directory and a pom.xml,

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.500
and I've also got a .gitignore that's kind of grayed

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.100
out because it's a hidden file.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.650
But you can see inside of here we have our basic web

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.040
application that has all those pieces configured.

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.610
I'm going to copy that over to my dev workspace

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.420
directory that I use in all of my courses,

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300
if you've seen that before.

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.620
Here you can see where I've have copied it into my workspace,

12
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.180
and I created a spring‑security folder and,

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.460
underneath that, the conference folder.

14
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.240
Now I would recommend naming your project conference.

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.290
You can name it whatever you want, but if you name it conference,

16
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.260
it will follow along what we do inside of the examples,

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.810
as well as it does affect your URL if it's not tied to the POM the same way.

18
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.650
If that doesn't make any sense, don't worry about it.

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.170
I would recommend having it named the same way.

20
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.740
But this is the folder structure I have set up.

21
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.190
Let's go ahead and open up IntelliJ and import that project in now.

22
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.420
If this is the first time you've used IntelliJ Ultimate,

23
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.940
you'll be presented with this dialog that asks you if you want

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.220
to create a new project or import a project,

25
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.200
or if you remember when we were showing the GitHub URL,

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.340
you can paste that URL in here to get it from version control.

27
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700
We're going to go ahead and choose Import Project,

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.590
and you want to navigate to the directory where you copied it.

29
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.340
Mine is dev, workspace, spring‑security.

30
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.330
And I just want to go to the root of that project and

31
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.410
navigate into that folder structure.

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.340
Choose Open.

33
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.330
Then it will ask me if I want to import that project from an external model,

34
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.540
and I'm going to choose Maven and Finish.

35
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.780
And for a minute,

36
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.420
it will be building the project and indexing files and all of that stuff.

37
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.430
In fact, if we click on the Maven selection over here,

38
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.620
you'll see that it now shows our project inside of here and all

39
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.500
the different things we can do to our project,

40
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.550
as well as if we click on our project structure,

41
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.500
we can see conference and our source directories and

42
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590
all of those features inside of here.

43
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.090
So we have our project.

44
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.990
It's all imported.

45
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.490
And now we can start setting that up.

46
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.280
To begin with, if your project does not look like this now,

47
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.490
you have missed a step.

48
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.380
So don't try to go any further.

49
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.990
If you don't have the Maven selection on the right or your conference

50
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.760
structure doesn't look similar to mine on the left,

51
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.650
you have missed something somewhere.

52
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.940
So go back and double‑check yourself.

53
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.010
I'm going to open up conference inside of our Maven tab

54
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.800
on the right and go to Lifecycle, and I'm going to double‑click package.

55
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.900
And this will bring up a dialog at the bottom where it goes

56
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.660
through and builds all of my source code,

57
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.150
compiles it, and gets it all packaged up,

58
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.740
ready for me to go as it's built and deployed.

59
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.460
Now, this did a couple of things.

60
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.530
It set up my target directory for me,

61
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.630
but it also created a deployable artifact that we're going to use to

62
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.660
set up Tomcat now. Now that we've built our app,

63
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.460
I'm going to go ahead and add a server for it.

64
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.980
I'm going to go up and choose our Edit Configurations option.

65
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.840
You'll notice there's already one created for us,

66
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.390
and that's because they're trying to automatically deploy it to TC Server.

67
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.840
I don't want to use that.

68
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.550
It's Spring's proprietary server that they have that

69
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.920
they do different things with.

70
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.740
So I'm going to click Edit Configurations and click the plus sign,

71
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.120
scroll down to Tomcat Server, and say Add New 'Tomcat Server' Configuration,

72
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.620
Local. And inside of here, mine already chose Tomcat 9.0.30, and that's

73
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.590
because I have a Tomcat instance already downloaded.

74
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.890
If you don't,

75
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.290
you need to choose Configure and point it to a downloaded Tomcat server.

76
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.340
So I've already got one downloaded.

77
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.020
You just point it to whichever version you've downloaded, and

78
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.240
you're good to go. Click OK. You'll notice,

79
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.310
though, before we go any further,

80
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.510
there is a warning down here saying No artifacts

81
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.640
marked for deployment and a Fix link.

82
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.750
We're actually just going to click on the Deployment tab over here,

83
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.840
and this is why we ran Maven package a minute ago.

84
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.310
We want to click the plus sign and say Artifact and choose

85
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.950
conference:war. Hit OK. We can click Apply and OK.

86
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.040
And now our Server tab should pull up,

87
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:50.540
and we can choose to start that. It will deploy our application.

88
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.940
If you've added your project,

89
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.110
you can choose to not ask for all those files to automatically be added to

90
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.010
your GIT instance because you probably don't want them there.

91
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.610
And once it loads, it should pull up this application just like this.

92
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.720
So you should see exactly what I'm seeing here.

93
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.440
Notice it started us off by not going to the Login page,

94
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.540
and that's because we haven't created one yet.

95
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.320
So if we go in here now and click Add Registration,

96
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.750
it'll go through, and we can put in an Add Registration, and

97
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.480
it just functions like how we had left it at the end of the

98
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.690
Spring MVC Fundamentals course.

99
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.000
So now we can go through and start adding all the security features that we want to to our application.
