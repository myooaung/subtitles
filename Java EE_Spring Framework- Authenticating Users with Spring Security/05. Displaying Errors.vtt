00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
We put the logic into our UI to display errors already,

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.850
but we haven't added any CSS to it yet.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.050
We've actually already defined a simple CSS class in the top of our app,

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.670
and this can simply be applied to our div as we have here in this example.

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.640
You can also define them in their own CSS file.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.000
But for the sake of this example, let's just add that class to the code that we have already defined in this div.
