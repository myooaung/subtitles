Creating a process for people to register within your application,

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.680
while not requiring an admin on the back end, can be a fairly complex

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.960
process. In this module, we're going to build out the registration process

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.240
and all the moving parts that it requires to do this.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to outline the process and then walk through the flow of how registration occurs.
