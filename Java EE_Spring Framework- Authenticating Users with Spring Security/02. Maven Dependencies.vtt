00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.850
There are three dependencies that we need to add to our app in order

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.590
to use LDAP. It's easy to miss that these are from different group

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.110
IDs, so pay extra close attention to that.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.430
The first dependency is the spring‑ldap‑core artifact from

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.050
the org.springframework.ldap groupId.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.340
This dependency is used for all LDAP libraries and interactions for Spring.

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.020
The next dependency is the spring‑security‑ldap artifact. It is

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.640
from the org.springframework.security group.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.560
It is actually from this different groupId because it contains just the

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.040
interfaces to deal with LDAP and security‑related protocols.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.610
The last dependency is an artifact from unboundid for the

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.660
ldapsdk. This is actually the LDAP server we're going to

13
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.730
use for testing our app out.

14
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.000
It will create an in‑memory LDAP instance for us to test against. Let's add these into our app now.
