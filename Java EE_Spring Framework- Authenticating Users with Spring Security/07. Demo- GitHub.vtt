00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.550
There are a couple of ways to use GitHub,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.680
and I'm going to show you the simplest.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.990
As you can see from our URL here,

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.790
github.com/bh5k/spring‑security‑conference, that here is our

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.340
project, and I'm running this off of the master branch.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.630
If you know nothing about GitHub, it's not a big deal.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
Choose Clone or download and Download ZIP.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.490
This will download a ZIP file containing all of the

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.140
current source code to our desktop.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.300
Now the other options in here, Open in Desktop, the

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.310
URL, if you don't know what they are,

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.020
then I'm going to recommend, again, that you choose the Download ZIP option.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.710
If you understand what those are,

14
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.640
then you can go ahead and use GitHub desktop or one of the other tools

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.840
that will allow you to interact with GitHub locally.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.210
Another option is for you to fork this,

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.120
and I'm going to click on this to show you. Your

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.420
options are going to look different.

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.640
You'll have your local repository that you could fork this over to,

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.340
and if that makes sense to you, then great,

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.260
you may want to choose that option so that you can continue to use

22
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.530
source code control on your local project in case you want to roll

23
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.700
something back or you make a mistake or you just want to compare the

24
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.410
changes through each module.

25
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.690
If those are options to you and are entertaining, I recommend you do that.

26
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.460
If not,

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm going to show you how to go through the downloaded ZIP file that we just did and set up your project locally.
