00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,630
The last piece that we need to implement is adding a table to the

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,240
database that will store the reference to the cookie from the

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,770
user's local machine to verify against our server to make sure

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,740
that they are still logged in.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,540
I should point out that too,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,980
if we want to invalidate anybody logged in, we can just

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,090
delete their entry in this table, and it will force them to

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,790
log in the next time they visit,

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,440
regardless of whether or not their cookie has expired.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,000
We're just going to go ahead and add this table using the MySQL UI, and then we'll be all configured to run the rest of our demo.
