1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,010
All you need to do to run Docker is to have the Docker Desktop installed,

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,850
and you just go to docker.com for that,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,610
and download the version specific to your operating system.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,600
From there, we're going to add this dockerâ€‘compose file to your application,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,230
and it will set up everything.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,000
And in this case,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,790
we have a database, is image type is of mysequel5.7, the

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,250
container_name is conference_security.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,030
We're going to bind the ports that are exposed on your operating

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,050
system to this port inside the container of 3306. It's going to show

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,400
us where it's going to store the data,

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,930
which is underneath our project in a .data directory /db. And then for our

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,070
environment, we're going to say that the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is pass, and

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,850
the DATABASE name is conference_security.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:03,000
So we have all of our stuff set up and configured right here. Let's add this to our application now, and we can start up our Docker instance.
