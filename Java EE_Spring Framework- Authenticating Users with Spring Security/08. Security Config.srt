00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,910
Now that we've created our mapper,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,940
we need to configure our Spring Security config to inject this new service.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,140
We defined our mapper as a service, and that service,

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,110
since it's registered as a Spring being,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,940
can now be autowired how we have defined here.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,740
Lastly in our LDAP configuration,

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,850
we need to add the ContextMapper to our configuration,

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:32,000
so that when it builds our user, we can intercept and make the appropriate calls. Let's add this last little bit of configuration, and then we can run our demo.
