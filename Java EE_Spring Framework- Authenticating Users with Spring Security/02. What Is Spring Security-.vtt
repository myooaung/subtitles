Spring Security is a framework written on top of the Spring framework that will

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.940
provide you security features inside your web application.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.910
It handles things like authentication and authorization for web apps, as

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.310
well as web services, and can tie into just about any authentication

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.840
store or authorization store that's out there.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.720
Spring Security was how I got my start into Spring

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.140
development as there wasn't a robust, full‑featured security framework out there.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.840

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.000
Spring Security is still the most feature‑rich security framework that I have worked with in the web development space to date.
