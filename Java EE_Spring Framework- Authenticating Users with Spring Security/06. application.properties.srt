00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,450
To start up the test server that we created the dependency for and

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,130
referenced in our ConferenceSecurityConfig file, we need to add three

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,240
properties to our application.properties file.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,850
The first one is the spring.ldap.embedded.ldif, which we're going to add

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,240
to our classpath with the name of test‑server.ldif.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,270
This is not how you would typically populate a production server,

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,090
but we have to have a starting point to test

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,670
something inside of our application.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,190
So we're going to add this test‑server.ldif file inside of our code,

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,720
and that will populate our server with some default users that we can

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,380
run against. The next one is the same properties and appending .base

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,220
to the end of that for our dn,

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,830
which will contain our directory context or our structure,

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:03,140
which will be pluralsight and a context of com.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,180
And then, lastly, our port, which is 8389.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:16,000
So let's add these three properties in there, and then we'll go ahead and start creating our test‑server.ldif.
