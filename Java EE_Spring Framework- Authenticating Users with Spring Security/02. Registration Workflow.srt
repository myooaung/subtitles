00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,190
To understand the end‑to‑end solution that we're going to

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,560
build, let's actually see the demo first of what we're

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,200
going to build in its entirety.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,530
We're going to walk through gathering registration information,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,710
submitting the request, sending the email,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,100
confirming the account, and, finally, logging in with our

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,250
new account. You can see on our index page I've added a

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,440
Create Account link at the top, which will take a username,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,140
first name, last name, password, and a confirm password,

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,100
as well as an email address.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,370
Now I have created for me a sample just test account on

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,740
Gmail that I can send this stuff through.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,390
You'll want to use your own or create one like I have for this.

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,830
When I click Submit, it'll go through a round trip to the server,

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,340
and it's created the account.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,940
And if I go over to our test email address that I've set up,

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,770
you can see we've already received our registration confirmation.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,390
When I click on it,

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,640
it'll take me back in the app and tell me my account has been confirmed.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,440
Now if I pull up a new page and go into our conference app here,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,970
it will allow me to log in with that new account that we've created.

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,680
So if I click Add Registration and put in the username

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,090
and the password that we created, it'll log me in.

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,070
And, in fact,

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,740
it's going to bring up our Password Manager and see if

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,210
we want to save that for our app.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,080
So you can see we've gone through all the pieces,

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,550
had the correct username, email address,

29
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,860
password, and walked through that entire round

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,560
tripping process of creating the account,

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,440
storing it in the database, having that send a

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,400
confirmation email that we click on,

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,840
have the account confirmed, and then be able to log into our app.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's start adding that functionality to our application. Now we're going to start with the UI where we gather that account information.
