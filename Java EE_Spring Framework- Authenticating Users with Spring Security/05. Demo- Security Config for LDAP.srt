1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,100
I want to go ahead and open up our src, main,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,740
java com.pluralsight.conference package and open up

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,240
our ConferenceSecurityConfig class.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm going to make this full screen while we work on this for a little bit.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,660
Let's scroll down to our jdbcAuthentication dataSource,

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,840
and I'm going to comment that out.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,910
Now, below that, we're going to start putting in our LDAP configuration.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,640
So we're going to say auth.ldapAuthentication.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,920
And underneath here I can give it the new line and use that builder pattern

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,230
approach that we did before. So I can say .userDnPatterns.

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,790
And then here,

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,780
we're going to put in the contextual string of "uid". And that

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,530
is equal to a search parameter base of 0.

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,040
So this is the first character we're going to pass in

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,810
for our search, our first parameter.

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,940
We're going to use an organizational unit equal to people.

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,030
And this will make more sense when we set up our server here in a

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,480
little bit. We're going to specify all these things.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,890
We're going to do a groupSearchBase, and for the groupSearchBase,

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:30,740
we're going to do an organizational unit equal to groups.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:38,410
Now we're going to build our .contextSource, and then from that

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,240
.contextSource, we're going to pass in the URL.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,390
And as I mentioned in the previous slides that this

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,970
can be passed in as a variable.

25
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,380
But to not make this example any more complex than it needs to be,

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,550
I'm just going to put this string in here.

27
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,090
That's a standard practice of using a variable to pass those in,

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,560
and we can just inject that resource.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,710
And if you've gone through the Spring Fundamentals course,

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,960
you saw how we did that inside of there. You could also

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,260
look it up out of a database.

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,340
There are a lot of different ways that you could go about doing that.

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:24,640
So we'll do pluralsight, and we'll have a dc, or directory context, =com.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,890
Now once we have this,

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,590
we can now start building upon this with our password compare feature.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,300
So we're going to do .passwordCompare and do a

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,390
.passwordEncoder. And we're going to call the

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,550
passwordEncoder that we have defined down below.

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,730
And last but not least,

40
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:58,040
we're going to pass in the .passwordAttribute, and that is userPassword.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,450
At the end of this line,

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,600
put a semicolon because we're done using that builder

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,330
pattern, and I'm going to save that.

44
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,220
Make sure you save your pom.xml as well so that it will

45
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,040
do those automatic imports for Maven.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,000
Now your application is all configured to go against the LDAP server that we need to set up.
