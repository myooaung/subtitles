00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,370
As mentioned before, we moved this module to the end of the

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,580
course because you may or may not be using JSP or Timely for

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,740
your UI, but the same principles apply.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,460
We showed how to use the Spring Security Tag library to display

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,130
an element when the use of I is authenticated or is not

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,580
authenticated inside of the application.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,720
We then showed an interesting technique of injecting the current

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,320
logged in user to methods that are called by Spring.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,090
We could use the old static approach to grab the current logged in user,

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,160
but this injected model is actually an easier way to both unit test your

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,540
code and not have static access inside yourâ€‘app.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,820
And this module actually concludes the updates for this course.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to thank you for following along, and I hope to see you on some of my other courses here, on Pluralsight.
