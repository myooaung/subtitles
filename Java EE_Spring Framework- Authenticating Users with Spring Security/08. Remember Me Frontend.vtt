The front end component of rememberMe services is actually quite simple.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.320
You may recognize these fields already because this was

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.750
the form that we used on our login page.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.590
We had our username and password, we just need to add a

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.140
third component inside of that form,

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.630
and that is the checkbox we're going to select to choose

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.510
to have our app remember who we are.

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.220
Notice that there is a name for this that is rememberâ€‘me, that is

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.810
specific to Spring Security, and if you change that,

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.370
the service will not work. You can override it, but for our example,

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.040
we're going to leave it to the default.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.050
Just keep in mind that if you change yours,

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.040
you're going to need to change that configuration

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.000
inside of your security config. Let's add this to our application now.
