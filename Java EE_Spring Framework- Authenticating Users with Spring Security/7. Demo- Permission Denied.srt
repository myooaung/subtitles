1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,560
Switching back to our IDE, if we change our ROLE_USER to ROLE_ADMIN,

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,550
or honestly,

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,590
anything else because we don't have another role for

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,600
anybody stored inside of our application,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,440
if we do @Secured ROLE_ADMIN, and then restart our server,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,100
this is going to fail when they access that page. If we go through

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,920
the same steps again of Add Registration, Login because we have

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:40,800
restarted our app, and now go to the Add Registration, it will

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,470
fail because it's forbidden.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,870
In fact,

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,300
you can see in the error message right there type=Forbidden,

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,210
status=403. So, even though we're logged into the

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,780
application, and we can view that page,

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,800
it won't allow us to post back to it because we do not

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,150
have a ROLE_ADMIN. So we've effectively locked down

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,840
methods inside of our application,

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,730
and anybody logged in and going through that process,

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:15,000
you can go ahead and tie down any specific application piece that you want to prohibit them from accessing it.
