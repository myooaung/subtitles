Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.050
My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.240
Spring Framework: Authenticating Users with Spring Security.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.160
I am the CEO of Complete Programmer and the Practice Director at

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.460
Software Technology Group. Security is a complex topic, and doing

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.440
it correctly can be quite challenging.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.490
In this updated course, we're going to cover how to authenticate

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.910
users against LDAP and authorize against a standalone database. We're

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.680
also going to show you how to customize the Spring Security object to

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.850
add your own unique fields to it and have it more closely match your

11
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.040
application's needs.

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.540
We're going to show you how to create a custom registration process for

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.520
Spring Security and also handle the common problem of a forgotten

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.750
password inside of Spring Security. By the end of this course, you'll

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.980
know all the fundamentals of Spring Security and how to implement

16
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.340
security inside of your Java application.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.350
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Spring and

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.140
Spring MVC some. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn

19
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:24.000
security with the Spring Framework: Authenticating Users with Spring Security course, at Pluralsight.
