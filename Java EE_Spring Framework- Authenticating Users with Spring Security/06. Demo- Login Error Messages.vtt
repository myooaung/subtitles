00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.830
I'm going to go ahead and exit full screen,

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.560
and I'm actually going to stop my server as well,

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.110
just so it's not trying to redeploy as I'm making changes here.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.650
I want to navigate down to my src, main,

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.840
webapp, WEB_INF, jsp, and open up our login page.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.590
Inside of here, we have the div for our Invalid username and password,

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.740
and that will display now that we have that failure URL set up correctly,

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:39.040
but let's add a CSS class on here, and that is just a class= to error,

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.080
and save that.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.080
And just so you can see where that's coming from,

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.380
it's from the top of our head section in this JSP page.

12
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.050
So we have that error block right here on line 19 in my

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.270
code where you can see it's just defining a red color block

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.880
that's going to surround this.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.300
So, now down below in our login page,

16
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.710
we can go ahead and specify that we have this error message tied to this,

17
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.540
which is just an Invalid username and password.

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.920
Like I mentioned before,

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.280
you can handle errors differently, you could have different parameters

20
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.420
that you pass back, there's access to that inside of the spring object to

21
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.530
redirect back to a different parameter, so you could have more specific

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.230
errors set up here. Now one word of caution is that it's generally good

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.020
advice to send back more generic errors that doesn't expose any of your

24
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.440
security model.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.940
So just a word of caution there, that's why we've left it somewhat

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.710
vague, just saying Invalid username and password.

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.770
So let's start this up, and now that our app has launched, we can click on Add

28
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.040
Registration. Let's put in that bogus username and password,

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.320
and it now redirects us back and displays that red error

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.630
message of Invalid username and password.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.280
A little later in this module, we'll show you another

32
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.980
method to displaying that, but for now,

33
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:14.000
all of your error messages are being sent back to the UI, and we've even highlighted them in red.
