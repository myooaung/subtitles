00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.220
All of the configuration on the Java side takes place in one file,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.410
and that's our security config.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.340
So we're going to go down to src, main, java,

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.040
com.pluralsight.conference and open up our ConferenceSecurityConfig.

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.300
Then inside of here,

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.760
I'm going to start breaking some things up so that you

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.610
can see them a little bit easier.

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm going to go down to this .and and give it a little whitespace

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.390
between those sections because we're going to start adding more and

10
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.630
more sections throughout this module.

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.490
But for now, we need to add two things to here.

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.580
I'm going to go to our .loginProcessingUrl line and go to the end of that

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.870
and add a new line below that and type in .failureUrl,

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.240
and I want to put in there a login?error=true.

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.850
Now notice there's not a semicolon on the end of that.

16
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.040
I can't stress that enough that this is using the builder pattern approach.

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.680
Then I'm going to add one more line here and say .permitAll. And

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.320
now this .and section contains all the configuration that we

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.890
need inside of our app to handle a URL failure that sends it

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.510
back to the processing page.

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.770
Now you don't have to do it this way.

22
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.880
There are other ways,

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.510
but we're going to redirect back to our login page with a

24
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.140
parameter on the URL saying error=true.

25
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.620
And then we specify .permitAll because we want to be able to

26
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.000
allow everybody who does this to see this. If not, it would require them to be logged in to that failure URL.
