1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,850
It doesn't matter if we implement this functionality

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,010
before or after our login and remember me.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,390
It will all get built the same way.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,860
I'm going to go to the end of our configuration.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,730
But before that closing semicolon,

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,050
I'm going to move that down a couple of lines, and I'm going to

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:27,640
start typing in here and say .and. From here, we can start adding on

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,740
all of our functionality for the logout.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:38,540
So we'll say logout, and then we want to do the logoutSuccessfulUrl.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,620
And in our instance,

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,470
we want to send them back to the login page, and we want

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,840
to add a parameter of logout=true.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,040
And then on the next line, we're actually going to do a .logoutRequestMatcher,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:09,160
and that will enable us to do a GET instead of a POST for our logout function.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,280
And I'll show you on the UI what I'm talking about here in the next demo.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,170
But for this instance, it will make it to where our UI configuration is simpler,

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,040
and it's only one more line on the back end. From here, we can say

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,740
that we want to .invalidateHttpSession equal to true.

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,420
Then, we want to delete the cookies, and this is all caps. We'll

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,440
say JSESSIONID, and that is caseâ€‘sensitive.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,240
And then, last, but not least,

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,390
we're going to throw on the end there a permitAll. Now

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,640
before I move on to the next step,

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,820
I want to show you one other line of code that we are not going to

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,400
use. Because we are using that logoutRequestMatcher,

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,100
we do not use this line,

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,930
which is the logoutUrl. You may look at some other examples

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,290
that are using .logoutUrl, and this would be some performed

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,790
login or logout functionality, whatever.

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,750
We're not using that because we want to use a GET.

31
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,150
So if you see examples with that and you're wondering what the

32
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,330
difference is, we have opted to not use that because we're going

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:37,000
to do the logoutRequestMatcher. Let's look at what the UI aspect of this same call is.
