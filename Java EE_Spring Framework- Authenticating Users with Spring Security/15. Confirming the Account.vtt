00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.950
The actual confirmation of the account might look like the simplest part,

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.700
but it actually has the most work to do as far as

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.990
moving data around on the back end.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.510
The view is simply just what you see here,

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.120
but we need to go ahead and move the token and account out of

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.440
the table that we had and move them over to the users table

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.370
and associate roles with them.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.330
So we're going to do a lot of work in the service and

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.940
repository tiers to move this information around,

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.910
and then it's all done.

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.010
These are all the pieces that we needed to go through

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.540
the entire confirmation process.

13
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.860
I've gone ahead and closed down all of the open files that we had,

14
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.650
because we just had half of our project open while we were working on it,

15
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.930
and we're just doing the final confirmation step of this.

16
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.770
So, I've opened up our AccountController.

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.260
I'm going to add another method below here,

18
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.250
and it is a GetMapping for accountConfirm.

19
00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.970
And inside of here, we are going to look for the RequestParameter token,

20
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.060
you can tell by the @RequestParam annotation where we grab token,

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.970
and that's what's built in the email that we sent out,

22
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.040
and then we're going to call confirmAccount on our accountService.

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.640
Now, if we open up our AccountServiceImpl and look at it,

24
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.000
confirmAccount is empty,

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.370
and this is what we're going to go ahead and start putting all the

26
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.260
details in of what it means to actually confirm account.

27
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.110
And there's some round‑tripping with the database and looking up of the token,

28
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.170
so let's go ahead and start pseudo coding that out so we can see these steps

29
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.990
that we need to do. And that's going to look like this.

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.650
We're going to retrieve the token from the database,

31
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.740
then verify the date,

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.740
then move the user from the account table to the userdetails table,

33
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.780
create the userdetails object, delete from accounts,

34
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.720
and then finally delete from tokens if all of these things

35
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.140
flow in order and go how they should.

36
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.710
So let's start by retrieving that token. And we're going

37
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.950
to store that in a VerificationToken,

38
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.710
so we'll say VerificationToken verificationToken is

39
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.360
equal to accountRepository.findByToken,

40
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.200
and we'll pass in the token string that we have.

41
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.850
And we haven't created this method yet, so let's hover over that red helper,

42
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.840
we'll click findToken and save this, and if we open up our AccountRepository,

43
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.040
it'll ask us if we want to go ahead and implement those fields.

44
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.990
We can go to the top of our class and say Implement

45
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.210
methods, and OK. Let me make this full screen so that you

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.670
can see it a little bit easier.

47
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.510
I am going to paste in this already created,

48
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.270
because it is a little bit of typing to do,

49
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.760
and in the lieu of time, and import these so we have all of our pieces here.

50
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.010
And let me walk through this code with you.

51
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.870
Same as before, we created a JdbcTemplate,

52
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.940
put our dataSource in the constructor of that.

53
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.670
We're doing a queryForObject, as you can see here,

54
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.790
so we're saying template.queryForObject,

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.560
where we have the SQL that we're passing into it,

56
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.990
select username, token, expiry_date,

57
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.360
from verification_tokens where token =?, and then we'll use

58
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.440
the varargs to pass in what that value is.

59
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.100
Then we do an anonymous inner class,

60
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.000
which is really common to do in this type of query,

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.310
where we pass in a new RowMapper on the object VerificationToken,

62
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.440
and the mapRow method takes and looks for username,

63
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.960
token,

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.070
and expiry_date, and we're expecting one of these to come back so that's

65
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.640
why it is a queryForObject and not a queryForList,

66
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.350
builds that object,

67
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.360
and then you can see at the very bottom here on my line 58 there is a token,

68
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.170
and that is that varargs that's getting passed into that

69
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.050
question mark in our SQL statement.

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.110
And then finally,

71
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.430
all of that gets returned on line 59 back to our calling method,

72
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.670
so that that'll walk clear back out to our AccountServiceImpl

73
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.430
where we have here our VerificationToken.

74
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.880
Now let's verify the date that gets returned.

75
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.290
We're actually going to do this very simply by looking at

76
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.110
the date that comes out of our object,

77
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.600
which was our verificationToken where we calculated the expiration

78
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.560
date, and what this is simply doing is looking to see if that date

79
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.470
is after the date that we set to expire.

80
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.790
So if the date of now, or our current time,

81
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.520
is after the expiration date, then we know it's still good.

82
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.290
If it's before it,

83
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.700
then we know that our expiration date has in fact

84
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.860
expired and we shouldn't allow this,

85
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.790
which you should probably throw an exception and handle it from here,

86
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.040
but we're just trying to show the best‑case, happy‑path scenario here.

87
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.900
So if this data is valid,

88
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.070
now the next step that we want to do is go ahead and

89
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.100
call the accountRepository again.

90
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.630
So we'll say Account account is equal to

91
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:36.530
accountRepository.findByUsername. And we're going to go ahead and

92
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.940
use our verificationToken and get the username out of that.

93
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.740
And just like the findByToken,

94
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.640
we can hover over that red findByUsername and click Create findByUsername.

95
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.420
And if we save this, then in our AccountRepository it'll

96
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.340
give us the option to create this as well.

97
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.050
And like I mentioned before, you can use Hibernate to do this,

98
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.590
it's the same thing.

99
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.440
This is a little bit clearer, and if you're working with an existing data model,

100
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.710
it's actually a little easier.

101
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.940
It's a little bit more work up front to type the queries in,

102
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.040
but it's a lot better way to go.

103
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.910
So, I'm going to go ahead and paste that in there, as you just saw,

104
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.840
for our findByUsername, and this is just like the other query that we just did.

105
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.470
If I get this down to another line so you can see it,

106
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.360
we have the findByUsername, we create a JdbcTemplate,

107
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.070
it's also a queryForObject, we're getting one object returned.

108
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.520
In fact,

109
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.220
you can copy the one we did up above or you could grab the source code

110
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.010
out of the exercise files or out of my GitHub repo.

111
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.510
But you can see here we're doing a select username,

112
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.730
firstname, lastname,

113
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.830
password from accounts where username is equal to question mark.

114
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.640
Question mark is going to take that varargs of our username from down below.

115
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.630
We have an anonymous inner class of a new RowMapper on the Account object,

116
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.190
which takes the firstname, lastname, username,

117
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.920
password, returns all of that information,

118
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.510
and sets it on that Account object,

119
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.740
and that eventually returns everything back to our AccountService,

120
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.440
where we can now move to creating the user details.

121
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.140
Now we need to create our userDetails object,

122
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.140
which is an object that we used earlier in this course,

123
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.300
and that is simply a ConferenceUserDetails object.

124
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.560
And all this is,

125
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.230
is simply an instance of the ConferenceUserDetails, which

126
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.040
extends Spring's UserDetails object,

127
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.640
and we take and build that out with the username and

128
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.600
password that we had stored by the token,

129
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.420
and that is the encrypted password.

130
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.840
It's not declared text.

131
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.660
I can't stress that enough.

132
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.990
And then we give it a basic role inside of our application.

133
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.940
We haven't gone over roles yet, that's actually in a later module,

134
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.040
but we give it a role of _user, just the simplest basic role we can.

135
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.640
From here,

136
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.180
we haven't created anything, we've created this object, now we need

137
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.440
to go store this userDetails in our database.

138
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:27.440
And to do that, we're going to call accountRepository.createUserDetails,

139
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:37.530
and we will pass in our userDetails object that we just created here,

140
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.880
and save that.

141
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.090
And, again, we haven't created this method yet either,

142
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.200
so we'll hover over that, add that to our interface,

143
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.740
and we'll save this and go into our AccountRepository,

144
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.580
which will give us the option to create that unimplemented method in here.

145
00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.150
And there is a shortcut to do this is well, but this works for us.

146
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.530
And down below here we're going to do another JdbcTemplate.

147
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.170
And that is very simple, we just INSERT INTO users username,

148
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.870
password, and enabled,

149
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.240
and we grab out of that userDetails object our username and password.

150
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.810
And we can save this.

151
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.480
We've got to do the same thing with our authorities on

152
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.050
the other end that we just created,

153
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:30.180
so let's go back to our ServiceImpl, and we want to say

154
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:41.240
accountRepository.createAuthorities.

155
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.740
And we will also pass in the userDetails for that as well,

156
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.240
because we just stored the authorities inside that userDetails object.

157
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.460
Now, when we save this, we're going to get the same thing.

158
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.640
We hover over our red createAuthorities,

159
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.740
we can create the method createAuthorities in our AccountRepository interface.

160
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.260
And just a reminder, why do we want to do all the interfaces and all this stuff,

161
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.450
it's because with Spring we can use it for unit testing,

162
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.490
we can actually detach our code if the database tables aren't ready, and

163
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.090
stub this out so that we're not held up on specific pieces,

164
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.040
and it makes our application more modular and testable.

165
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:30.940
Now inside of our AccountRepository, we can hover over the class definition

166
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.960
and choose Implement methods again, and go down below.

167
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.500
And this is very similar to what we just did with the createUserDetails,

168
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.260
except now we're going to iterate over a list.

169
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:47.240
And so we can insert this in here. I've got a JdbcTemplate that we

170
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.440
pass in a dataSource just like we have been doing,

171
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.260
but now I grab an Iterator on GrantedAuthority from the

172
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.720
userDetails.getAuthorities object.

173
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.260
And this, while there are things to iterate over,

174
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.150
inserts into the authorities table the username and

175
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.500
the authority value into that table.

176
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.570
And this is a very important step. If you skip this,

177
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.890
even though you have a valid username and password,

178
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.140
it will not let you log in,

179
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.460
because it says they have no rights inside of the

180
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.140
application and we'll treat it as bad credentials.

181
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.230
At this point,

182
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.260
our application will actually log in and will create and confirm the account.

183
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.560
What we don't have, though, is any cleanup done or a page that shows us that,

184
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.650
hey, your account has finally been confirmed.

185
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.070
So, we're going to implement these two simple delete statements

186
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.520
really quick and then a splash page for us to land on when we

187
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.220
are done confirming the account,

188
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.450
but functionality‑wise it's actually working right now if you

189
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.140
ran it, it just won't clean up after itself.

190
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.960
Deleting from the accounts and tokens tables is really quite easy to do.

191
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.120
So we'll just say accountRepository.delete,

192
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.870
and since this is the main object that the accountRepository is built upon,

193
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:16.940
we'll just pass in account here, and save this.

194
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.140
When we hover over this,

195
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.640
we can get our implementation to create that in our interface.

196
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.090
And if we go to our implementation, the same as before,

197
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.720
we can get the opportunity to implement that method.

198
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.080
And inside of here,

199
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.290
all we're going to do is call a DELETE FROM accounts

200
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.860
where the username is equal to this, and pass in the account.username,

201
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.910
and save this.

202
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:57.030
And it's the same thing for the tokens, so we'll accountRepository.deleteToken,

203
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:03.840
and pass in token, and save that.

204
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.510
And we have not created that either.

205
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.340
This is the last one we have to create.

206
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.520
Create that method, save this,

207
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.320
and go into our AccountRepository and implement that.

208
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.550
This has been a whole bunch of SQL.

209
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.280
This is the last one.

210
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.900
We'll Implement methods, click OK,

211
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.170
and this SQL is very similar to what we just did up above,

212
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.840
JdbcTemplate, new JdbcTemplate with the dataSource.

213
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.750
We're deleting from VerificationTokens,

214
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.850
where the token is equal to question mark,

215
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.140
and it's just that token that we passed in from the actual confirmation email.

216
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.140
All of the pieces are in place.

217
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.740
Let's go back to our AccountServiceImpl,

218
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.440
we've fulfilled all the requirements there.

219
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.480
Going back to our Controller,

220
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.230
our Controller is going to return a view of accountConfirmed.

221
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.160
And we don't have a JSP page for that yet,

222
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.360
so let's just hurry and put a splash page in there,

223
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.050
nothing too serious.

224
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:10.730
We can, in fact, open up our account page that we've created and copy that,

225
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.280
and right‑click on jsp and say New, JSP,

226
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:25.160
and we'll call this accountConfirmed, and save that.

227
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.390
Then highlight all of this, and override that.

228
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:40.610
We're going to change the title to Account Confirmed.

229
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:46.690
And we can come down to the form down below here and get

230
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.690
rid of just about everything down here.

231
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:55.520
We've got this form inside of here, we can get rid of that.

232
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:05.060
And we'll have a very basic div that we're going to just give it a class.

233
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.810
Since we've styled our page with Twitter Bootstrap,

234
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:15.240
we can say class= and do an alert inside of here.

235
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:22.540
So we'll say alert alert‑success.

236
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:32.100
And the role is of type alert.

237
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:43.040
And inside of our div we can say Your account has been confirmed.

238
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.240
Let's save this.

239
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.700
Now, we can fire our application back up and go back over to our page,

240
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.190
and when we enter that in,

241
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:58.480
it should do the full round‑trip and clean up after itself even.

242
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.300
We go to our Account page and give it a valid username,

243
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.080
something that we haven't already used.

244
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.700
The First Name and Last Name can be reused.

245
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:15.280
And then I am going to give it a valid email address.

246
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.970
We'll want to do that, because if not,

247
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.360
all the work we just did will be for nothing.

248
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:28.440
And I can give it whatever password, and click Submit.

249
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.840
It's gone round‑trip now.

250
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.020
We could put one of those same alert boxes here on this page to notify you.

251
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.040
If we go into our email and click Refresh,

252
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.150
you'll see the Account Confirmation link,

253
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.200
and we can click on this link and it will open up a new page,

254
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:54.140
and should confirm our account as well. And you can see now it's been confirmed.

255
00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:00.140
If we pull up a new browser and go to it,

256
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:12.140
we can log in with the username and password that you just created,

257
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.940
and everything works.

258
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.260
We have done the full round‑tripping, fired off emails,

259
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.210
set up all the configuration to do it, the confirmation, tokens,

260
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.960
hashed passwords,

261
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:32.000
everything as you would in a full‑fledge production system inside your application now.
