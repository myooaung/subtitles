00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.020
At the demo at the beginning of this module, I already showed you

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.070
an email account that I had received the registration

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.940
confirmation email to, and clicked on that.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.470
What I didn't show you is that I also have another server email

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.120
set up in it. It doesn't make any difference.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.640
You could actually use the same email.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.480
In fact, for one of the demos that I did,

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.540
I had used the same email account that I was sending the

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.580
application messages from, to also receive an email that I could

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.640
click the registration confirmation in.

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.270
Typically,

12
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.130
that obviously wouldn't be the same situation, but what I did want to show

13
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.670
you is that if you create Gmail accounts, and I'm not going to show you

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.750
how in this video to create Gmail accounts,

15
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.760
that's pretty simple, and you can figure that out without me having you

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.790
walk through the steps, but if you do use Gmail accounts,

17
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.570
you do need to make sure that you have this Less secure

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.060
app access turned on to allow it.

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.140
So right now, this is shut off, and this is what yours will look like by default.

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.040
To be real honest with you, this was very hard for me to find this setting.

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.960
I actually had to get an error message inside my application and

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.510
click on that error message to retrieve this.

23
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.630
So if you look at this URL, myaccount.google.com,

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.290
it even looks like it's a fake URL, like they're

25
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.270
trying to garner your information.

26
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.680
They're not. The /u stands for user, I'm assuming, and /5 is the

27
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.840
fifth Gmail account I have logged into on this box.

28
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.510
So if we look at the URLs I have here,

29
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.200
I have a mail/u/4, that is the fourth account on this machine,

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.040
and /5 is the fifth account on this machine.

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.400
I had to go in to the server account and turn on the

32
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.880
option to Allow less secure apps.

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.190
If you don't do this and you are using Gmail,

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.960
it will go ahead and block your messages, because it thinks somebody is

35
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.460
trying to spoof an account through your SMTP server.

36
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.680
You'll notice immediately when I switch this on also, I got an email

37
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.950
saying that I have allowed less secure apps for this email address.

38
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.970
So if you use Gmail to go ahead and set up some sample accounts on

39
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.660
this, and it's very easy to do, and I recommend it,

40
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.640
you just need the username and password that you've created this account with

41
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.830
to configure that SMTP, you will need to go to this URL and allow less secure

42
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.580
access, and just make sure it's the same URL, that you're logged into the

43
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.210
correct one. As I hover over here, you can see pluralsightbryanserver as the

44
00:02:51.210 --> 00:03:00.000
email address that I have. Make sure you're in that correct app, and click to Allow less secure app apps.
