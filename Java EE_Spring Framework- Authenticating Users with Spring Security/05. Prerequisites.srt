1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,610
There are a few prerequisites you'll need to do the examples in this course.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,080
I am using Java 11.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,100
Java 11 is the current long‑term support version.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,310
There are already other releases that have been

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,950
published since doing this course.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,690
Realize that they are not long‑term support versions.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,840
Spring is very strategic,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,020
and we've tried to be very strategic as well about picking the

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,140
correct versions to line up with those to guarantee a

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,650
longer‑supported version of this course.

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,830
So we encourage you to use the same versions that we

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,040
have chosen inside of this course.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,770
I'm assuming that you already know how to install Java,

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,040
so we won't be covering that.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,980
And I'm also going to use Maven in this course.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,070
Just like Java, I pretty well assume that you already know how to install that,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,910
so we won't be covering that here.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,210
Spring no longer offers up a way to just download the jars,

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,540
and you're forced to use Maven or Gradle to download those dependencies.

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,680
There is a Pluralsight course on Maven if you have more questions about that,

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,050
and you can research and follow it.

22
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,640
The next thing you'll need is an IDE.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,060
This course has now been updated to use IntelliJ.

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,210
We got feedback that the majority of our users wanted to

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,740
see and use examples with IntelliJ, so we've changed the course to use it.

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,370
We are using IntelliJ Ultimate, and if you do not have that,

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,460
there is a trial version, as well as student versions

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,710
are available for fairly cheap,

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,930
and a lot of our users have it supplied by their work.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,050
If you don't want to use IntelliJ, you can ask questions on the forum,

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,210
and I will help you go through Spring STS or Eclipse.

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,710
Just realize that every example we will be doing and the videos

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,130
will be showing IntelliJ Ultimate. And, finally,

34
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,440
Tomcat.

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,250
We will walk through the deployment of our project through Tomcat.

36
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,790
I've had people ask me why we don't just use the bundled application,

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,190
how Spring Boot originally ships it,

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,740
and it's because of a lot of external factors.

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,890
Suffice it to say,

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,680
if you are using JSP Pages, you have a lot of external security pieces in place,

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,280
and generally how you deploy your application inside of an environment, you're

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:30,000
typically still doing that with a WAR to Tomcat, so we will use Tomcat inside of our course.
