00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,920
All right, in this module,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,510
we learned how to display error messages a little bit cleaner in our

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,290
UI. We had most of the functionality in there,

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,940
but we weren't fully utilizing it.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,120
We then added Remember Me services, which are a nice benefit.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,150
Most standard UIs now have this where it creates a cookie on your

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,580
local machine and then on the back end stores a reference to that

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,810
token in our database. So we added the database tables and tied that

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,390
all together. And then you almost immediately need to implement the

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,980
logout functionality because once that cookie is created, every time

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,180
you revisit that page, it will try and log you in automatically.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,150
And if you want to test something different or change anything,

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,440
you need to be able to break that cycle.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,310
As part of that,

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,730
we implemented the AntPathMatcher so that we could go ahead and implement

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,440
a GET instead of a POST for that logout functionality,

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,040
which is, by default, requiring a form to be built.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,240
And then we also looked at utilizing bootstrap messages.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,130
We did a successful logout bootstrap message. And if you want to go

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,690
ahead and change your alert messages on a invalid username and

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,640
password to utilize that bootstrap message, it's a little bit

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,310
cleaner UI, and we already have all the pieces built inside of our

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,440
application to do that.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,770
Next,

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:28,000
we're going to go ahead and implement a registration or an account creation page and do that programmatically inside of the app.
