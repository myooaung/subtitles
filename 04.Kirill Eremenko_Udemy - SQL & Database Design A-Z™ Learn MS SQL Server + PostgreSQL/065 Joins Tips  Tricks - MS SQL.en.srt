00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,250
Hello welcome back to the course on databases in today's tutorial we're going to talk about some tips

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,310
and tricks of Joines.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,870
We've already started the practical part of Joines but I thought it was a good idea to talk about the

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,080
tips and tricks early on because they will be handy for us going forward and they will simplify the

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,730
following tutorials in the section.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,790
So right away let's at the top put a comment here and say this part was about left joins And so this

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:39,500
part now is going to be about Joines tips and tricks.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,930
And also talk about right.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,470
All right.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,590
So let's get started.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,900
So what are our tips and tricks.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,370
Well first of all let's take this this take this code and here we're going to say no actually let's

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,340
take this call.

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,210
Let's take this code and Coppins.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,500
And here we go into Razzy remember this is the code that selects the name of the pet and the name of

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,800
the owner.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:20,060
What we want to do next is we want to add some additional information or additional code to this part.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,760
And why is that.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,630
Well I just want to illustrate that sometimes these joints can actually be quite complex so this one

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,010
has four lines already but they can grow really quickly.

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,850
So let's say if we want to set a condition where the first letter of the pet's name is the same as the

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,780
first letter of the author on his name so let's have a look an example of that cookie and Charles like

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,330
they both start with C and we want to pick out all of the elements or all of the rows from this table

24
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,110
where that is the case.

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,100
So how would we do that.

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:03,990
Well we would add a WHERE clause and here would say where left then we would say pets names are left

27
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,190
of this column.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,730
Comma one.

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,000
So this left function.

30
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:14,190
It will take the first letter of this string and why the first.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,390
Because we are specifying what are we here and here we're going to say left PED's name equals and we

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,060
say left owner's name.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,910
So if we have this condition in the SO X state and run it you'll see that we've now got a result with

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,810
only the rows are we looking for where the first letter of the pet's name equals to the first letter

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,320
of the owner's name.

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,900
In fact he's actually one pet owner combination where they have the same name which is quite funny.

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,400
All right.

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,780
So that's that's how we do that.

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,850
And once you can see from here so this isn't the tip or trick yet this is just a normal wear condition

40
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,640
which you can see here is that this joint is growing quite quickly.

41
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:10,100
And so every time writing out this PED's dog name owners not name can be tedious because it's just it's

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,840
just a lot of clutter in your code.

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
So what can you do about it.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,180
How can we fix it.

45
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,470
Well there's a very convenient way of going about it in a scale you can.

46
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,120
You can give aliases to these tables for specifically the purposes of this join.

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:33,660
So here you can go you can say from Pat's as a and from owners as B and now everywhere else you can

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,830
just take pets and replace it with a the actual table.

49
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,500
Except for this line of course.

50
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,530
And here and then take owners and replace it with B.

51
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,580
And what that does is it saves space it makes your code easier to read and is faster to code so.

52
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,330
So if you want to just add another condition you just simply instead of specifying the whole name of

53
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,110
the table you just specify the alias and it's much faster.

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:11,030
So that is tip or trick number one that is alias's for tables.

55
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,890
So trick number 2.

56
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,810
Have a look at this result that we've got here here in the results everything is great except for the

57
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,640
names of the columns.

58
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,140
Both of the columns are called name and that can be confusing especially if you want to save this table

59
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,230
into another table.

60
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,590
Or if you want to present this result to somebody it's not intuitive which is which.

61
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,950
Right.

62
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:49,260
Especially you know when you're dealing with names of with names or roof other columns that actually

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,390
contain symbol values.

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,360
So here we're going to talk about aliases for columns and you guessed it right.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:10,520
You can actually specify them right here or you can say as a pet name that name and as owner name so

66
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,610
if you run this now you'll see you've got pet name onery where it doesn't look that good because we

67
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,860
don't want to capitalize this try this

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,780
owner.

69
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,850
So far on this.

70
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,840
Now you'll see that we've got a beautiful table with pet name and owner.

71
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,730
Beautiful.

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,640
And another little hack over here is that as he'll isn't advanced programming language and you don't

73
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,290
really have to write the word as it allows you to admit that word and still understand exactly what's

74
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,310
going on and it will therefore Ill just make your coding experience easier so you can just remove as

75
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,430
like that and it will understand that that is what's assumed if you run this everything is.

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,400
But personally I don't take it that far I prefer to keep the AS because it's in a different color and

77
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,190
because it's it's just easier to separate the two it's visually easier to see that you are using an

78
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,630
alias.

79
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,450
And personally I prefer to use as here.

80
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:16,910
All right.

81
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,600
So that was our trick number two.

82
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,430
And before we proceed to number three actually what I wanted to show you is you see these red underlines

83
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,620
they're a bit you know getting in the way there are actually no errors but a skill is still underlining

84
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,230
them and that happens sometimes so if that happens to you as well then you can switch it off you just

85
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,680
go to Tools Options and then here in text editor.

86
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:50,850
So you go to text editor transacts skill Intellisense and uncheck underline errors that way these errors

87
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,990
are not going to be underlined and it's going to be easier to code and see everything.

88
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,310
So there we go.

89
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,510
That's a little hack for you just in a scale hack.

90
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:08,560
And finally what we're going to talk about is a third trick or tip is right Joines.

91
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:15,770
So let's create a right join and see what it's going to be.

92
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,830
It's going to look like.

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:25,170
So we're going to take just simply this whole code and remove the WHERE clause.

94
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,540
And here we're going to replace left join with a right join.

95
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,510
And we're also going take pets and put them on this side and owners.

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,820
We're going to put them here.

97
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,170
Now one more thing we need to remember to do is to switch the alias's as well because you can see this

98
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,440
Aliase is a dog name as pet name so that came from a pet table and that came from the pet table so you

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:58,410
may remember in this specific procedure if you were doing it to replace the aces as well.

100
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,250
So right now what we did is we took this code and we replaced the left turn.

101
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,300
And we also switched the tables around including the alias's.

102
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,620
So if we run this now we'll get exactly the same result as we had with this query.

103
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,440
So if out the where clause if you run this you'll see you've got 100 rows and you've got the pet name

104
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,750
you got the owner name.

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,020
If you run this you got 100 rows again and again you got the pet name and onery on the name and the

106
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,690
result is exactly the same simply.

107
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:39,600
Well just because the way we did it is we took a right join and we switch the tables switch places of

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,730
the tables and that's a good illustration of the fact that a right join is identical to live joins just

109
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,820
the tables are switched positions or the tables are switched and that is the reason why.

110
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,780
In school you will rarely see a writes join.

111
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:05,430
Most of the time people use left joins because you can replace your I join the full left join and simply

112
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,770
because we've all Always were always used to reading from left to right and that's how we write code

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,380
and so on.

114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,930
And we used to thinking that way.

115
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:21,210
So most of the time you'll see left joins the only time you will ever or the one of the reasons you

116
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,050
will ever see a right join is.

117
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,080
For example when you have a huge select huge like a huge join where you've got a table and then adjoining

118
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,740
to another table and another table and another table is growing like it's growing to many many lines.

119
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,000
So it's like that big already and then you need to add another table but you want that table to be the

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,780
primary table in the join and instead of like revamping the whole code and putting that new table on

121
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,190
the left and then the result the existing join on the right sort of doing that.

122
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:01,200
Sometimes it's just easier and it's more convenient to add the table as a right join to this final query

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,390
and that's one of the rare cases when you will see a writer and other than that it's most of the time

124
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,700
it's a left join.

125
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,660
So there we go that's all we had for today.

126
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,470
Let's just quickly recap so we talked about quite a few tips and tricks.

127
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,600
The main ones are listed here so we talked about aliases for tables which help you save time.

128
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:30,240
Talked about aces for columns which allow you to rename the columns in the output and make your results

129
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,210
more presentable and more intuitive.

130
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,580
We talked about right joins that in fact they are the same as left joins.

131
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,680
Plus we also covered a few little tricks.

132
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,920
One was that you don't have to say the word as a skill or understand what's going going on anyway and

133
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,680
also how to remove those underlines from the errors or the formatting of your text editor.

134
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,250
So there we go.

135
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,920
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

136
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,450
I can't wait to see you next time.

137
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,990
Until then happy analyzing.
