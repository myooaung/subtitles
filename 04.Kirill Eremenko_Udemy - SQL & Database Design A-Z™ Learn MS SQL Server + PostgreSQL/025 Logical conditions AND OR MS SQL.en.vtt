00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:11.300
Hello and welcome back in today's lecture we will be learning about and and or statements in a school

2
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.880
as you can see our Microsoft skills Server Management Studio open up.

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.970
I have my consumer complaints database ready to go with consumer complaints table with all the columns

4
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.910
inside of it.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.710
All good.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.500
Ready to go.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.660
So let's go ahead create new equerry in which we'll say select all from consumer complaints.

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.230
Just our basic query that we'll just be doing a lot in this course just to identify what we will be

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.070
working with inside of each lecture.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.120
So as you can see here we have a lot of data saying previous 65000 rows.

11
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.930
Nothing has changed so a huge amount of data.

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.330
And what I'm going to be showing you today or rather what we're going to be learning to use today is

13
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.850
two very interesting words in a school.

14
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.860
One is and then the other one is or as you can see there are not functions that are not lit up by blue

15
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.170
light.

16
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.450
There is a number of them that are just like this even equal signs the same grade.

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.090
Nice color as well as you can see star here.

18
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.440
So just nothing to be worried about.

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.160
Just remember that they still exist and they're very useful and they come useful.

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.540
A lot of times.

21
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
So what we're going to be working today with is the first task.

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.250
Let's say your employer talks the he gives you this database and he tells you hey can you please go

23
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.610
ahead and give me products the shoes and the companies that have anything to do with states of New York

24
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.860
and California.

25
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.700
So what are you going to be doing is you're going to be obviously first working with the select statement

26
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.660
you're going to be saying hey I want to only slight product name then I only want to select issue then

27
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.620
I only want to like company.

28
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.300
Then I only want a select state.

29
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.840
So now that you have this figure it out it wasn't that hard because basically he told me exactly what

30
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.880
he wanted to see.

31
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.630
What's the hard part is figuring out how to narrow that data down.

32
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.760
And as we already know we're going to be using a function in our case we will be working with state

33
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.060
things.

34
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.570
So let's go ahead and immediately put them out.

35
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.460
Now our life is a bit easier.

36
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.420
All we have to do is figure out what to do with the state.

37
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.140
Well first of all we need to display everything from the state of New York so we put equals apostrophe's

38
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.610
New York and now because she wants everything to be displayed from the states of New York and California

39
00:02:49.710 --> 00:03:00.490
what you can say is that where state name equals New York and state name equals the Fornier if we try

40
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.290
and run this right now what will happen.

41
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.660
Do you think everything will be shown as we expected.

42
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.590
No.

43
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.700
Zeroes of data return and this is very easy to explain because what he wanted us to display to him is

44
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:27.450
everything products issue companies that come from either New York or California states.

45
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:37.350
So in a well that and specifies a very very precise thing that you want the state name to be both New

46
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.370
York and California at the same time as you can see in our table that just impossible because every

47
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.840
single row of data is tied to only one state if any at all.

48
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.800
So instead of writing this we need to do is swap and four or and we get to go if we get it now we'll

49
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.510
get 14000 rows of data which is bigger than just the roll of data for New York.

50
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.230
So it obviously is working.

51
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.300
And if we go down we can see that New York and California are inside of here.

52
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.840
Now another interesting thing is that most of the time it's up to you whether you want to put state

53
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.780
name into the select function because if we're in all of this and we're going to call it before it nothing

54
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.460
will change it will give us the exact same amount of those exact same data because there were functions

55
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.340
still being execute.

56
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.480
It still works.

57
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.330
We just don't see the state column here and why I'm saying this is a personal preference.

58
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.720
Most of the time is because you can present this data to your employer.

59
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.350
And if he knows what you're talking about if he knows what he ask you to do he might be OK with it he

60
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.930
might say hey that's all right.

61
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.540
That's awesome.

62
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.320
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.560
And he might even be grateful for you to not wasting more paper by printing out more columns or more

64
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.510
incrusted.

65
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.490
But if you're working with anybody who has no idea what the database contains what the tables contain

66
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:19.160
or what exactly they're looking for or just unsure of working with there's data printing this out just

67
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.510
showing them the state name as well as every other day that you found is a very good idea because by

68
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.530
looking at it they will be immediately able to identify that hey this came from California.

69
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.830
This came from New York.

70
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.430
So that's the first thing and second thing is that they can see that you've made no mistake.

71
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.040
Because who knows if they trust you enough.

72
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.980
They understand how rescue works.

73
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.710
They just might don't have that level of confidence in you.

74
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.340
Most of the time I would recommend to put this in here to just display it all the time because it's

75
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.690
easier for you to see any mistakes you made and it's easier for them to understand what you're talking

76
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.200
about.

77
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.280
But if you feel very confident and if you know that your clients or your employers will be happy about

78
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.280
it you can't just avoid putting it there.

79
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.050
But again as I said most of the time it's personal preference.

80
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.470
Now let's do something else fun.

81
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.780
In this case again just delete all of this or rather just create an inquiry in which again as the guests

82
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.760
will say select all from consumer complaints now who run it.

83
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.570
What we'll see is the same same same old information with soap before.

84
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.840
But what I'm curious is is how can we use the end.

85
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:41.270
So where and instead of it will use and how can we use it as you could see when we asked it to show

86
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.180
STATE name equals New York and state name equals California that did not work.

87
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.210
Obviously that didn't work because it was in the same column in the column that has only one information

88
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.560
in it.

89
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.240
Only one instance of State in it.

90
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.960
So the best way to use and is to use it with two different columns.

91
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.070
So what we can say is that we want to display all the products that came from the state of New York

92
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.260
and that had time to respond.

93
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.220
Indicated as yes.

94
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:25.440
So we want to select all the products so so like product name from consumer complaints where state name

95
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:36.040
equals apostrophe's New York and timely response equals apostrophe's.

96
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.290
Yes.

97
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:45.650
So if we run this now you will see that we get only four thousand three hundred thirty four rows of

98
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.160
data.

99
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.920
So let's just put a stage name inside of here.

100
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.820
So we see what's happening behind the scenes and time the response here as well and you get it now as

101
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:02.060
you can see mortgage game from State of New York Times response yes student loan came from New York

102
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.790
time response yes.

103
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.150
Now a bit more insight will be given to us if we put in the company.

104
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:15.380
And as you can see I'm putting it in between product name and state name because I want it to be displayed

105
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.270
in that order.

106
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:21.310
I don't want it to be displayed in the very end or in the very beginning of the table.

107
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.760
So now we see product name company state name and Taimanov response.

108
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:33.500
It's very interesting to see which companies from the state of New York had a time response concerning

109
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:40.990
which products in our case we can see that GBM Morgan had a mortgage and credit card and bank accounts

110
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:46.410
are within again mortgaged that they all answered in a timely fashion.

111
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.740
Of course this is just the beginning of this very complicated query that can go on forever just trying

112
00:08:51.740 --> 00:09:00.050
to identify which exact companies in which exact instances the answer to their customers in timely fashion

113
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:06.360
and then get to the bottom of it by answering the question why what was different to this case.

114
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.540
Do all the other cases where they didn't answer in time maybe it wasn't their problem maybe it was the

115
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:18.260
problem of the service providers maybe it was something to do with consumers having different privileges

116
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:26.060
or different abilities or there's a lot of data you can track from it in theory and all you have to

117
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.030
be doing for it is just adding and tag.

118
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:40.460
For example you can add here that I also want tags to be equals older American.

119
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.140
And if we're on this now we will get.

120
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.410
Sorry about that.

121
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.530
We just put it in here as well just to get a bit more insight.

122
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:56.970
As you can see now we only have 300 rows of data and all of them have tags older Americans so.

123
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:05.600
So as you can see and is a very powerful tool to use and as well as well as or and combination of them

124
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:15.110
can be very useful for you to identify any particular sort of type or amount of data that you want.

125
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.260
Never forget.

126
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:23.630
And or in Eskew all that are very powerful they're very useful not only they allow you to write one

127
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.240
query instead of writing two three four five.

128
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:33.410
They also love you to narrow your data down to extreme levels just by using these two small very powerful

129
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.350
words.

130
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:41.870
I hope you enjoy this lecture and I hope you learnt a lot today and understood a bit more about what

131
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:49.640
you can do to data why you should do it and in which ways you can narrow it down using which tools and

132
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:56.120
really looked that glimpse of them so far but they were ready as you can see can narrow 65000 rows of

133
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:04.990
data to about 300 which is absolutely insane when writing this very small very precise very neat query.

134
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.430
And as always I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
