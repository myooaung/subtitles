00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,690
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,230
So today we want to upload the data dataset for this section.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,060
And let's go ahead and open up.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,250
P.J. admen So here we go it's Jasmine and inside the first thing what's great is the database so let's

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,960
Right-Click.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,800
So they create and create a database which we will call.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,580
They just simply call its oil T-P for online transaction processing.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,750
Save there is our database.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,530
Wonderful.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,550
And now we want to upload the data set.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,080
So in order to that we're going to query create a new query and then we're going to open up a browser

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,740
again.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,570
And there it is.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,110
So once again go to WWE super day signs that comes as well.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:01:00,060
And if you scroll down here you'll see a file called section on postgresql upload code so Dallow that

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,630
files a doc X file.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,290
So if you just now minimize that window the file looks like this and it basically has the code that

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,060
you need to run to upload this database.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:24,630
Right so we're going to now go ahead and just copy this code and we posted over here in time and you

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,660
query.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,860
So this is are we prepared for you got create table call where you just were just specifying the table

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,620
that we're creating which is transactions and basically then all of the columns that we want to create.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,880
And then if you just need to select which version you're using either Windows or Mac.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,220
And then just select the appropriate code and then just modify it you're going to have a look at where

25
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,270
my data is stored and it's stored here so it's stored in databases on my desktop there's a folder called

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,930
databases.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,320
There it is.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,930
And then there's a folder in there called Section 9.

29
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:13,470
So if I go ahead and so I'm on Windows I'm just going to comment on the Mac version which is a Windows

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,740
version and I'm going to say here.

31
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,240
Copy transactions from C users curial desktop databases.

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:29,870
And then here it is actually Section 9 OLTP don't see a Svea OK.

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,570
And that should do it.

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:39,940
So I'm just going to run this topline first part 5 then just run this part 5 and then you go you can

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,290
see that that's how many rows were inserted.

36
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,210
There you go.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,360
So in fact you can just remove this one that you don't need.

38
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,140
And then if you go to schemas public tables you should see a table here or if you've had this or in

39
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,100
the open just click refresh and then just to confirm that it has loaded indeed we'll just say select

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,180
star for all transactions and put a semi-colon.

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,090
Run that and there is our table.

42
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:17,170
So everything looks fine just check the columns check the rosemary scroll to the bottom.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,870
Just make sure everything was good.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,940
And there we go.

45
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,520
So you're all set to proceed with this section.

46
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,650
We've got some very exciting stories coming up ahead.

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,850
And is going to be good fun.

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,330
And we're going to learn quite a lot.

49
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,090
So I look fortune.

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,920
And until then happy analyzing.
