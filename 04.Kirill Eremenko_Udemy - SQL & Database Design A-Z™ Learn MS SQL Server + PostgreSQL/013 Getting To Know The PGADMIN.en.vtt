00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.640
Hello and welcome back and as you can see I have even for loaded up and today's lecture is nothing too

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.000
hard.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.780
We're going to be taking a look around the job and getting familiar with it.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.370
So you are not afraid about it so we're not stressed when using it.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.370
It's very simple and very user friendly tool.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.370
First things first you can see that the server has many in it.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.860
We have to ask you well in it.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.440
We have already two databases because we already upload the data for consumer complaints.

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.010
So if we click here we can see a bunch of different cascade looks and then triggers extensions for that

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.520
reference.

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.370
No worry about that in 90 percent of data management cases you will never even look in here.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.720
Then you have schemas and here you have public schemas right now.

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.390
These elements come to play sometimes but still the amount of time you will actually have to use them

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.760
is very rare.

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.500
And don't worry about it at all just the most important thing here is the table element.

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.570
All you care about is that it has some data in that.

17
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.580
And that's achieved through opening the columns section and inside.

18
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.070
Here we can see that we have 18 columns.

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.900
Now if we want to see what's inside these columns we have to go open up a query tool and this one is

20
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.250
really opened up.

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.930
The one that we've completed just now we have select all from consumer complaints and it put us all

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.650
the data out so we can straighten this around to make sure it fits on our screen to make sure that we

23
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.150
can read everything.

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.770
It's pretty easy pretty convenient.

25
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.420
Explain.

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.980
So if you click on the lightning I can write or press Phyfe it will run the query but if you click here

27
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.930
and press F 7 or shift of 7 you can explain and what explain that is it tells you basically when you

28
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.010
have a lot of different tables it will show you an image of where it's combining the data from and how

29
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.540
these tables are connected.

30
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.010
So if you're getting the wrong data or you're getting enough of it you can take a look here and then

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.640
the sound like maybe you forget to tie one table to another.

32
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.270
So as Joel does not recognize the connection between them and it just can't display anything to you.

33
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.250
Messages will basically tell you what just happened with your query and history.

34
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.780
You can see we open it up here you can see that it does it shows us what we run.

35
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.680
What grows at the fact that how much time at the end and if you get any errors it will be in the message

36
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.440
type here.

37
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.050
So again let's go back to data output here.

38
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.720
It gives us this weird thing and thus we stretch it out here it already gives not such a weird thing.

39
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.370
Basically what it does it shows us the explain.

40
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.490
But in the query language so if we go back to execute it we'll have the correct data.

41
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.160
I could hear people inside of this menu what you can do is you can open inquiry or you can save this.

42
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.480
So if you want to save the square you would just click Save select where we want and save it up.

43
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.010
This might be useful when you're working with Biribi queries or the queries that you use a lot and you

44
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.660
don't type and over and over and over again.

45
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.190
So you just want to right click mode up and you query and then just open a query that's saved from your

46
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.650
computer and run it straight through.

47
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.040
Also there is just delete.

48
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.210
Copy all the usual stuff you'll see on any other programming language.

49
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.520
Daughter thing is that if you don't want to click here to create a new query you can always go to tools

50
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.760
and click it here.

51
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.480
So that basically doesn't the same.

52
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.330
Now if we go here to databases you will notice that if you right click on different elements it will

53
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.870
give you different options.

54
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.530
For example if you click on columns This is everything you get.

55
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.280
And if you right click on those tables you'll get a lot more.

56
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.150
You'll get the Grand Wizard all ready.

57
00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.540
So the difference between is that there are several there are rules inside as you well that you can

58
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.610
grant access to different tables.

59
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.250
You can drop different databases on grouping under databases or you can drop databases while grouping

60
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.950
schemas and so on and so on.

61
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.900
So with time you will learn all of them if you need to.

62
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.570
Again with my experience when it comes to the job and comes to grad school most of the time you will

63
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.070
still be working inside of the command line.

64
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.800
So all of the actions you can do here by right clicking it for me it's easier quicker and just more

65
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.520
fun to write it all out because I know that where I made mistakes and I feel good when a write a huge

66
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.320
Querrey it runs and it successfully runs.

67
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.970
So again don't be afraid of anything here.

68
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.610
The dashboard just shows you how your servers are doing so the stronger your machine the more powerful

69
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.180
your machine is the better.

70
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.010
The stats here propertys just show you what you have in right now.

71
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.960
Ask you well is if we click here it can be displayed for several elements.

72
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.930
Statistics will again show you what we do when we will be working with bigger databases as you can see

73
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.910
it will show you this mistakes.

74
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.080
It will show you as well.

75
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.340
So remember that when we right click here and we press great database Well we could have just wrote

76
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.630
in this query and that would be the same thing.

77
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.560
We could have avoided writing this down because.

78
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.690
And right now for training purposes this is not important.

79
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.150
So this is exactly what I mean that if you just follow the command line and learn all the commands manually

80
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.840
you will never have an issue.

81
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.610
And the thing with all the goys even though they're fun and easy to use a lot of times when they're

82
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:52.440
updated or when they're rolled back or when they release a new version it's a big deal to learn all

83
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.750
these changes and you need to adjust to the new software whereas if you're working inside the command

84
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.350
line.

85
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:06.510
So inside your old query here you can write the same queries on any software Duras and you will encounter

86
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.520
no problems.

87
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.730
So in the file we have preferences and you will access that time to time to change some things inside

88
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.190
of your pajamas.

89
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.390
I recently.

90
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.540
It's useful if you for example drag this out and you need to set layout.

91
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.500
Also if you just drag this out I recommend just open a new query.

92
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.550
Close this one.

93
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.070
Don't worry about it and just move on with your life.

94
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.930
It's almost impossible to fix this manually.

95
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.770
Tools again as you can see we have import export maintenance you have restore points you have backups

96
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.860
backups Global's all of those things can be done to databases.

97
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.100
Most of those things can be done only to databases and for now they're not important.

98
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:55.710
If everything we encounter in this course is important and will be used or encountered in real life

99
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.630
and for all of those things we will show you either the command line equivalent or how you can right

100
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.270
click here to have a bit of a shortcut.

101
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.790
Don't worry about anything.

102
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:13.830
PGI admin is nothing more than a tool to make your life easier and to make your databases more efficient.

103
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:20.760
I hope you have a bit more confidence going into the next section where we'll actually be starting to

104
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.920
query our stuff to write all the queries and for the data from the database and I can't wait to see

105
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.540
you there.
