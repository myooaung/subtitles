00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,590
And today we're talking about types of joins now joins operations that are performed on tables in relational

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,670
databases.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:20,120
So you would perform them in as well Microsoft as well in Oracle and Maya skill in many different platforms

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,080
where the data is stored in a structured format.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,590
So let's have a look at some Joines and understand how exactly they work to start off with.

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,720
Let's assume that we have two tables table A and Table B.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,440
And in our example table A will have the following rows.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,010
It's got three columns.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,060
Customer gender and age.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,560
And it's basically a table that is describing our customers.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,980
So we've got five customers.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,250
Adam Benjamin Jack Niek And Susan we've got their genders listed and their ages.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,410
Now if we go to Table B it's a table of employees of a certain store of our store basically.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,030
So it's got the employee name the title and the wage.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,800
And so what are we going to try and do and we're going to try and find out which of our customers are

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:15,490
also our employees so basically where where do we have matching roles in these two tables and how are

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,090
we going to do that.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,680
Well basically if we look at the tables we can see right away that Jack and Susan both appear in the

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,470
customer and in the employee tables.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,730
So how do we do this from an skill perspective for basically from a jointing perspective.

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,190
Well if we start off with an inner join then let's have a look at how it will work.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:45,410
An inner join will take the two tables and it will look at only their intersect so basically if we're

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:51,830
joining our tables on customer equals employee then and it's an inner join.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,220
Then the remaining rows will only be the matching rows.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,970
So in this case Jack is matched with Jack and Susan is matched with Susan because we're just looking

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,620
at the customer column in the left table and at the employee column and the right table.

28
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,040
So once that matching is done the rest of the rows which haven't matched are discarded and the remaining

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
table looks like this.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,320
So it only has those rows that match and kind of glues them together and that's it.

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,410
That's what's the result of an inner join on these two tables would look like.

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,330
Now let's have a look at the left join.

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,090
So there's a few different types of joins.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,480
Now we're going to proceed to the next one was called a left outer join and in short it can also be

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,620
called the left join.

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,330
So Elif joined basically says that the primary table is the one on the left.

37
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,030
Once again we're joining on the first column of the first table customer equals to the first column

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,780
or the second table which is in play.

39
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,620
And since the Left table is a primary one rows cannot be discarded from the left table rows will only

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,290
be discarded from the non-primary table so here Jack is mashed with Jack.

41
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,920
Susan is matched with Susan again.

42
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,260
And then the rest of the rows in the second table are discarded because they didn't have a match and

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,430
so the resulting table will look like this where there was a match.

44
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,830
The rows are glued together.

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:20,990
And where there was no match the associated columns left blank or some in scale basically those columns

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,270
will be nolde.

47
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,530
So let's just keep them blank for now.

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,720
That's whole left join works.

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,290
And basically the main idea here is that the table in the left of the join is considered to be the primary

50
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,740
table and therefore rows cannot be discarded from the table.

51
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,320
Now let's have a look at the right join a right join works in a very similar way but on this in this

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,140
case the table on the right is the primary table.

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,920
So once again Jack has much to Jack Susan is much to Susan and the rest of the rows in the left table

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,200
are discarded because it is the secondary table it's not the primary rows in the primary table.

55
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,210
On the other hand cannot be discarded.

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,980
So the final result here is a table which looks like this.

57
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,680
Once again the two sets of columns have been glued together and where there was no match on the left.

58
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,120
The values in the columns are left blank or Lord.

59
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,930
And finally let's have a look at a full outer join.

60
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,510
So in a full outer join we're looking at the union of the two tables or pillar probably unions not the

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,110
right word.

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,950
We're looking at all of the rows in the two tables and that's why you see those two circles in the Venn

63
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,710
diagram up at the top of full the yellow.

64
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,340
And that means that we cannot discard or the join will not discard any of the rows in any of the two

65
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,680
tables.

66
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,720
Once again we're looking for matches So Jack is matched with Jack.

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,450
Susan is matched with Susan.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,900
And then what happens is no rows are discarded and the tables are glued together.

69
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,970
And that is what the final result looks like.

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,300
So on the right there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the left and on the left

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,570
there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the right.

72
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:06,580
So once again I'll just go back to the previous slide and here you'll see the two table separately and

73
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,380
now off to the join.

74
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,110
This is what the final table will look like.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
So that's how a full outer join works.

76
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,780
And now let's just quickly recap on the types of drawings that we discussed.

77
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,170
So we had a look at four different joins the inner join which only looks at the matching rows.

78
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,830
The Left join which keeps the left the table on the left as a primary table the right join which keeps

79
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,920
the table in the right as the primary table and the full join or the full outer join which does not

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,130
discard and euros from any of the tables.

81
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,270
So in your work you're probably going to be using inner joins and left joins mostly.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,130
And that is because right joins are rarely used simply because are-I join is the same as a left join

83
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,370
just the tables you just have to switch the tables around.

84
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,000
So put the one on the right on the left and the one that was on the left on the right and you'll get

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
a left join.

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,150
And again so most of the time all personnel use inner joins and left joins.

87
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,530
Sometimes you'll rarely find that people do require full Jones for the task at hand.

88
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,840
So those were the type of joins.

89
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,790
And that brings us to the conclusion of today's tutorial.

90
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,080
Loquats see you next time.
