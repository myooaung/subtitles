00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.670
OK so now that you have downloaded both files because you can into to city and Section 3 is great.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.060
How do we get it to work in pajamas.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.530
Well first things first we need to open the pajamas for lunch just make it a bit bigger.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.610
And here as you can see just click conservers postgresql databases post-grads Doocey like just regular

5
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.510
database.

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.290
All is good old working doesn't show any errors show any mistakes.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.140
That's perfect.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.370
So now what we need to do we need to create a new database.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.900
You can call it whatever you want.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.710
I want to call it consumer complaints.

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880
Just so we understand what we're working with later on.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310
So all night and time here.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.190
You can skip creating new database for every section but I would strongly advise against that just so

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.750
the habit that different tables have to be in different databases.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.290
So now if we click on it the cross disappears we're in the database it's connected.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.850
Everything's good here.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.180
So what we do right now is we need to go to schemas public and then check table.

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.600
So because it shows nothing that means there's absolutely nothing inside this database.

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.570
What we need to do right click on tables or on any element on the dropdown menu and select query tool.

20
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.330
Now that the query tool is often what you want to do is open up your docs file.

21
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
Select this code copy it and insert it.

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.860
Now this is just this window here and make sure that it's all correct and so on the stakes as you can

23
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.350
see it returns that return successfully.

24
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.770
In Hungary 28 milliseconds now it says great table query turn successfully in 128 seconds.

25
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.230
Again this is just repetition.

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.840
In case you missed that small window that's a good.

27
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.380
Great.

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.730
So now let's go right click on tables refresh it.

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.620
Now we get that we have one table that consists of 18 columns and that's exactly what we want to see.

30
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.880
Now let's go ahead.

31
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.530
Select anywhere inside the consumer complaints database.

32
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.730
Right click so like Querrey toll we can go and close this one.

33
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.500
Don't worry about it.

34
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.450
We don't need to use it again.

35
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.570
So now let's open up fuzzy gray section free as you all upload code.

36
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.730
And here if you're working on Mac you want to copy this and put it here.

37
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.890
And if you're working on Windows you want to copy editor the text and copy it into your Jetman.

38
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
The most important thing here is that all of the code is correct.

39
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.170
You just have to make sure that the read part corresponds with the location and the name of your file.

40
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.850
For example right here right now the consumer complaints city is located on users Elior Menko desktop.

41
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.340
Right.

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.890
But as you can see the SMB file was renamed and all we need to do is change it here.

43
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.110
Just make sure because otherwise you will get mistakes you will not be able to access the file and you

44
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.930
will spend a lot of time searching for mistakes and one don't mistake you've done is just incorrectly

45
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.490
put the name of the file.

46
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.200
So now if we press a we can see that it's copying it copied sixty five thousand four hundred ninety

47
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.770
nine rows inside this table which is insane.

48
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.900
So all we need to do right now.

49
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.760
It's already uploaded all the data is there but if you don't trust me stick around.

50
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.290
Let's go ahead.

51
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.330
Select all deleted.

52
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.560
Select.

53
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.810
All right.

54
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.810
This from.

55
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.470
And then we input the name of the table.

56
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.690
Don't worry you will learn all this and thinks in the section.

57
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.780
This is just show you that old data is there is save is correct.

58
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.030
This will take a minute or two on my machine to run.

59
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.310
It's pretty slow.

60
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.190
So while it's doing so the only mistake the only mistake or rather bog.

61
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.530
The only other mistake or other inconvenience that you will most run with exporting and importing data

62
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.160
is that as you well we'll keep giving you the error that there is no such file or directory.

63
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.140
And this is not the fact that there is no desktop or not the fact that there is no consumer complaints

64
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.800
file is due to the fact that if you click here and go to get infl In Windows you can do it in properties

65
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.210
that we were not mistaken.

66
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.180
You will see that there is sharing and permissions that so you have to make sure that everybody has

67
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.720
read and write permissions.

68
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.480
And sometimes you have to go to the folder and change the permissions.

69
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.290
The whole folder.

70
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.600
So as you can access it so it does go the same way so get info make sure it's all read and write for

71
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.170
everybody.

72
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.140
This is a pretty big deal.

73
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.170
And this is where a lot of times we all have the same annoying mistake.

74
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.060
There is no such file and directory and if you forget about this you will have a lot of time trying

75
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.590
to solve an issue that there isn't any.

76
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.740
So now as you can see the query is still being executed I'll just fast for that for you.

77
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.560
Oh never mind this just on time.

78
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.420
So if we just go this fullscreen we can see a bit clearer now.

79
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.380
What does.

80
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.620
It basically displaces the same table that we had in Excel.

81
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.310
And your question might be well why do we need this.

82
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.070
Then why not just use the Excel file and while Excel looks pretty and you can color it nicely.

83
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.750
This puts efficiency and productivity over everything else.

84
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.290
Them all in a function zem out of commands.

85
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:43.070
You can do with this data with this table with this database is incredible and it truly is amazing what

86
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.210
we can do and what you will be able to achieve by the end of this course.

87
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.880
So I hope this wasn't too hard for you.

88
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.420
I know it's quite a lot to get your hand around but just remember to copy the code from the super data

89
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.100
science slash ASCII well and then you'll be all right.

90
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.240
I'll see you in the next one.
