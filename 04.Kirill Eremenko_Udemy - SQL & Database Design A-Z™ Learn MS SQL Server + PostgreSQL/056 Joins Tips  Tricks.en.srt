00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,510
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases in the previous tutorial we learned how to create

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:11,140
a very first live join and today we're going to talk about some tips and tricks for joins yes.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,540
Already we're going to talk about that because it will help us streamline and expedite our learning

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,440
going forward.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,720
It will really add value to what we're going to be learning throughout the rest of this section so it

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,550
is I think is a good idea to uncover some tips and tricks now.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,150
OK.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:40,330
So that's a new part to this code so maybe at the top of this previous part we're going to say that

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:49,170
we spoke about a left join now we're going to change this up a bit and we're going to talk about tips

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,000
and tricks.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,830
And actually we're going to talk about.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,900
All right Joy.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:03,930
So first tip first tip is that as you can see here we've got quite a lot of the time we have to repeat

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,980
pets and owners pets and owners and so on.

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,380
And as you Joines become more involved to become more complex and that means and what you might have

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,540
more tables you might be specifying more columns you might have some conditions and so on.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,360
So in fact let's just go ahead and do that.

18
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,910
Let's let's just rerun this query right.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:35,130
And so we've got the pets and George and so let's say we want to let's say we want to find out which

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,940
of our pets and owners have the first letter of the same first.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:59,460
There's a saying somewhere left pets were left name or pets taught name one equals left of owners.

22
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,190
Name one meaning one letter.

23
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,180
That's all we want if we run that you will see that here we've got eight rows total we've got Biskit

24
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,730
and Bessie Lily and Louisa cook and Carolyn Daisy and Dorothy Tiger and Tom Cook and Charles danger

25
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,690
and Dan Bruce.

26
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,750
Bruce actually one pet had the same name as the owner.

27
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,760
Very interesting.

28
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,130
So what we can see is that now we've even made it even more complex.

29
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,340
We've got a WHERE clause and again we have to specify pets and owners so we have to specify the data

30
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,110
or the table name every single time we refer to call them.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,290
And as you can imagine that can get quite convoluted as your join grows and trust me your choices will

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,720
grow as you perform them more and more in your career.

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,010
And so there's a quick trick here that you can use to make things easier.

34
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,890
Are you still going to have to specify which data.

35
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,410
Which table this column is coming from there's no way around that but you can make a life easier by

36
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,740
reducing the amount of letters you need to type every time.

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:12,240
So what are we going to do here is we're going to say as a and here is as be so jarring this joint part

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,320
where you're saying from which table lift table as left table left join right table you're actually

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,850
specifying what you want to call them you creating aliases these are aliases for the tables.

40
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,480
So you're creating an alias.

41
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,630
An alias.

42
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,980
And now everywhere instead of Petz you can say a.

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,080
Let's fix that and everywhere instead of owners you can say B B B and B.

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,130
And as you see that reduces the amount of code you have to type and makes things easier.

45
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,690
So if I run this you'll see we get the same result eight Aitraaz selected.

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,350
It's just a little bit easier to type.

47
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,880
And whenever you're not really sure what B means and what it means you just look back at this part of

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,990
the code and you'll see very quickly.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,640
So there we go.

50
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,220
That's that's part one that's tip number one tip number two.

51
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,460
So let's go ahead and copy that.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:15,660
So here I'm actually just going to comment that when I say alias's for tables and here we're going to

53
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,510
say alias's all this is the tip.

54
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:25,260
Number two I'm doing it every four columns so you can also create the same way aliases for called and

55
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,260
this can be handy when I look at your data.

56
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,710
So if you look here you'll see that you've got name and name and unless if we didn't know the dataset

57
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,760
we wouldn't be able to tell which one came from which table which one is the only name which one has

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:47,650
the pet name and that's why here we can say selects a duck name and then we'll say as.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,130
And we will specify that he is the pet name and he'll say as owner name.

60
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,510
So if you run this now because we can see that table A's pets will be owners and that's why they're

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,990
in that order if you're on that you'll see that the names of the table columns have changed.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,570
Now pet name and owner's name and that can be handy when you are running these select statements.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,690
So there's another quick tip for you that you can take away.

64
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:34,570
In fact skills quite advanced and to save even more time you can just avoid typing in this as here so

65
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,900
you can just get rid of that and you can just say a and b and it'll still work.

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,580
So far on that you see that everything works totally fine.

67
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:49,180
And same thing here you can get rid of that get rid of that and run that and you'll see that everything

68
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,690
works fine.

69
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,980
So in you well you don't have to type in the as you can just say a dog name pet name breed name or name

70
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,820
and will understand what you mean.

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,520
But personally I don't take it that far I prefer not to.

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,340
I prefer to keep that as just so that you know other people read my code don't have to think about it

73
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,020
and understand what's going on.

74
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,460
So I recommend leaving as two totally kind of mood if you like.

75
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,810
And finally to finish off the day we're going to talk about the right join.

76
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,470
So right join here.

77
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,800
And why are we not spending a whole separate tutorial on the ride.

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,820
Well because a right join is identical to the left join in just that the tables are switched around.

79
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,320
Then let's have a look at that right now.

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,530
So to take this.

81
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,170
We're here.

82
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,200
This query from here and place it here.

83
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,430
Let's get rid of the WHERE clause see if I run this.

84
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,230
This is a left join and there's a result.

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,320
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to switch this to a right join but I'm also going to switch to

86
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,810
tables or on the ground take pets and put it here.

87
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,520
We're going to take owners and put it here.

88
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,360
Now one thing that you do need to remember is that that is insufficient.

89
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,900
You also need to switch to alias's if you are using aliases because pets used to be a and now everywhere

90
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,260
here you see a dog name is pet name.

91
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:21,080
And now it's going to be incorrect so we have to change this to a and this to be a quicker way to do

92
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,710
this would have been if when you switch around the tables if you just take pets as a put it here owners

93
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,260
as B and put it here.

94
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,220
And that's the correct way of doing it.

95
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,700
So now you've got pets keeps its own alias and then you don't have to worry about the rest because you're

96
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:45,380
probably not going to be doing that much in your career switching a 11.0 right join.

97
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,930
But if you do happen to need to do that just remember about aliases.

98
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,830
So now I'm going to write join and I've moved the tables around but if I run this I'll get exactly the

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,420
same result as I have here.

100
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:03,260
Say again 100 rows exactly the same result because indeed the left left join and the right join are

101
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,960
identical is just the tables are basic which aren't.

102
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,970
And that's why we're not spending so much time on the right join because you can always replace a writes

103
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,520
join with a left join if you just switch around the tables.

104
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,320
That's why you'll find that joins are way more common.

105
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,480
It's just because the way we're used to reading code and reading text from left to right and that's

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,400
why we're kind of used to having the primary table on the left.

107
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,720
Having said that situations when the right joint might come up in are or include situations where there's

108
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,210
like the join is so complex there so many different tables that you're joining at as many different

109
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:50,670
Joines going on that is just more code efficient and more ergonomic to put her right joining me.

110
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,610
Imagine like you've got a lot of text here and then you've got a lot of text here already and you need

111
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,170
to join those two tables and you just put a right join in between them instead of like trying to switch

112
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,660
it around and wasting time on that.

113
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,530
So that's one of the stations which you might encounter I join but those are quite rare.

114
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,470
And now because we had this little quick example you really know how to deal with.

115
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,560
I'd join as well.

116
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,470
So there we go.

117
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,350
That concludes our tutorial for today.

118
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,070
I hope you enjoyed these quick tips and tricks so we had three.

119
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,750
One was alias has four tables to save you time.

120
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:34,300
The next one was alias's for Calment columns to make the select statement more user friendly.

121
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:41,360
And finally we've got the right join which is in fact the same thing as a Left-Right homepage this Tauriel

122
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,200
and I look forward to see you next time.

123
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,860
Until then happy analyzing.
