00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.490
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.540
And today we'll be taking a look at the last option of manipulating databases or tables deleting them.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.290
So let's go ahead open our my database open up our columns go ahead and select new quarry.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:26.110
So tool and here you can write and select all for movies just to make sure we didn't change anything

5
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.960
in between.

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.860
And as you can see our directors Christopher Nolan most of it is empty.

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.770
We have movie name and we have movie year and character as well.

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.890
Now what we can do is the first thing I want to do is I want to delete this test movie this Deathstroke

9
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.150
because it just messes up the whole database.

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.960
And it really brings no value.

11
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.830
And so in order to do that what I've done is I basically have to say delete then I have to say from

12
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:10.060
where I want to delete from movies and I want to put in condition that where movie name equals to test.

13
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:20.530
So now for on this it says that deletes everything we can go ahead and refresh select all from movies.

14
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.550
An hour from this we can see that this column distro of data has been indeed deleted and others.

15
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.270
Very good for us.

16
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500
Now let's say one a dropped dead director call.

17
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.590
We just didn't like it.

18
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.780
We didn't have time to fill in the data or we didn't have enough data to fill it in with in order to

19
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.460
do this.

20
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.490
We have to come back to our ultra function because we're not working with the data inside of this column.

21
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.250
We're working with movies table.

22
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.230
We have to say that we're working with movies table first of all.

23
00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:04.350
And then we have to drop the columns so alter movies drop director and now for we're It will say that

24
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.780
everything is done and if we just refresh it here we can see that it was ready.

25
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.140
No direct recall them.

26
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.350
So again because we were working with our column rather than inside that column we had to use the ultra

27
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.570
function.

28
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.020
Now let's talk about the dropkicks can't function.

29
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.470
So what's the difference between Tropika skate and drop drop because Kate drove this column.

30
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.850
This table this database and anything else that's depending on it.

31
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.720
So this will prevent you from having data that doesn't exist.

32
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.900
For example if you were using the country in another table from table movies and you delete table movies

33
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.120
then that table will have no information in its country column.

34
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
So that's why you want to drop because Kate most of the time you just want to drop because you will

35
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.400
not have a big scheme.

36
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.800
But if you do have a scheme where if you do have a lot of data depending on each other then you want

37
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.710
to do a drop cascade again.

38
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.710
Alternatively you can do all of this inside the Jetman by simply clicking here selecting delete drop

39
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.930
and it will do everything automatically for you.

40
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.330
The same goes for the table.

41
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.810
All you need to do is right click on it.

42
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.180
Select Delete drop or drop cascade and goes for my database.

43
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.410
So again you can just like delete drop and it will do everything for you.

44
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.920
OK so we have learned a lot about creating and maintaining databases.

45
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.890
We've learned how to create a database where we learn how to lead and learn how to create a table and

46
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.140
how to fill this table with columns and these columns of data that we've created ourselves.

47
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.690
We've learned how to put different constraints and primary keys on the tables.

48
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.340
We've learned how to update them.

49
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.600
Alternate name and add new columns to already existing tables.

50
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.760
That's a lot of tools that will allow you to do most common operations with tables.

51
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.790
The most important thing is that you should not be afraid of it working with databases working with

52
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.260
database structures and table structures is as easy if not easier than working with data inside those

53
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.010
tables.

54
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.260
The only thing you need to really understand is you need to understand the logic behind it and when

55
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.930
it comes to this skill is very logical as you can see again.

56
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.680
If we select alter we need to specify if we're altering a table then we need to specify which column

57
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.260
were altered.

58
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.180
Then we need to specify the column name and then we want to do what we're going to do with this column.

59
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.370
If we're deleting we need to say what are we deleting if we're deleting a database then we deleted.

60
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.700
If we're dropping it we're going to drop it and if we're creating again we need to specify it for getting

61
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.780
a database we're writing database of overtraining in the table we need to specify that it's going to

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.820
be a table.

63
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.460
It's very logical if falls all this indexers of most other languages and I really hope you'll have no

64
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.460
mistakes in this part of bascule But if you do have any just come back to this section re watch every

65
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.970
lecture try to create your own database try to create your own table filled with your own information.

66
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.430
Just following the example I set.

67
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.810
So now for the last Partlow.

68
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.370
Go ahead and delete the whole database my database so it doesn't distract us anymore.

69
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:20.640
In on this what we need to do we need to drop database my database and if we click right now it will

70
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.360
give us an issue because we are currently inside as database.

71
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.400
So what do we need to do.

72
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.850
We need to click here on any other database we need to open a new query tool inside that database.

73
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.370
We need to close this one.

74
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.050
Otherwise it will give us another mistake.

75
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:47.380
And inside this new query we need to say we want a drop database and then say my base there we go.

76
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.570
It's dropped.

77
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.570
It takes a bit of time to drop the database especially because it's filled with some data and some constraints

78
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.760
and some functions.

79
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.670
So there we go.

80
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.680
It's all done.

81
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.820
And sorry about that.

82
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.110
Just the way this mistake would just close it and disconnected this way.

83
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.960
It will not give us any of these mistakes.

84
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.110
Now as you can see it's done enough quicker.

85
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.460
And now for a refresh here it's gone but it's not gone forever.

86
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.130
You can always create a new database and I hope you will create a new database and fill it with a lot

87
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.420
of awesome data and I really hope you enjoyed this section.

88
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.270
It's a different approach to ask you well but it's still the same.

89
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.460
As long as you understand the logic behind it you will be right.

90
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:41.110
You can always find any specific use of functions or any specific task you need to complete on the internets

91
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.650
or inside the Help section of BGA admin.

92
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.710
If you're working with some big data and you have to do this one thing that nobody else has done or

93
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.550
less than 1 percent of people using admin do you can always click click on help go to admin website

94
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.770
or postgresql website go to documentation section and figure out what you need to do.

95
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.460
But in order to understand what exact function you want or what's the exact data you're going to be

96
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.820
working at or the table you need to understand the whole process behind it.

97
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.240
And I hope this section help you develop exactly that and I hope you enjoyed this whole section.

98
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.440
It was a lot of fun creating our own database filling it with whatever information we want and then

99
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.800
ultimately deleting it and I'll see you in the next one.
