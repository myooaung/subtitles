00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,690
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,410
And today we'll be working with Earth medic data types.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,440
So we'll be calculating and adding up different maladies and you will understand how this syntax works

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,840
how the logic behind it works.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:20,850
And we'll be able to reconstruct this example or tackle any problem that comes your way that has anything

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,550
to do with our many data types.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,640
So first things first as you can see we're in admin for was gray Ezekiel nine point six I have free

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,810
databases now.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,220
So we today will be working with console games.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,400
So let's quickly go ahead and check that we have that correct that a base here open up.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,860
And indeed as you can see we have two tables.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,360
One is named cancel dates out and one is the console games.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,480
So to begin with let's quickly run a secure query on console games.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,840
So we just will go here or select query 2.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,140
And I just want to select all from here just so we refresh our memory.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,760
What's inside of this table.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,630
So select all then we do console games.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:16,320
And after that we run a expressive 5 and it should run you to query.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,430
This might take a little while because again my machine is slow but that's nothing to worry about.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:22,850
OK.

21
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,930
So there it is.

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,010
As we can see it consists of 10 columns and indeed we have here all the 10 columns.

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,450
First we have the game rank then we have the game name.

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:41,140
Then we have the platform then we have the game your genre of game publisher of this game sales in North

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,010
America.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,700
Europeans sell Japanese sale and other sales as you can see this is a pretty straightforward table.

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,160
It has all of the real data from real world.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,290
It is quite interesting to work with and to begin with.

29
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,330
Let's calculate total sales.

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,500
So instead of having to manually write down the total number of sales for every single game by combining

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,790
this for let's create a new table that will be called Global sales.

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,580
And for now just follow what I do.

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,670
There is a whole section about this vote in the course bar and I'll just follow what I type and we will

34
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,360
be right.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,200
So first thing I want to say is I want to say that we are altering the table and the table is called

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,130
To console games.

37
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,870
And then on to say exactly what we're doing with this table.

38
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,950
In our case we want to add a column that's going to be called Global sales and it will be of a data

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,110
type of float 8 basically float a means it has numbers and the decimal point in there.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,710
Quickly go ahead run that as you can see it altered it successfully.

41
00:02:50,710 --> 00:03:01,160
Now that we have this table if we go again and select all from the console games you will see that it

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,050
will be empty because we just added it and there is no data in it.

43
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:13,340
Now the question is if we want to add data into that global sales how do we do it manually go and feel

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,600
in every cell.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,300
By combining this for of course not that will take forever and that's not what school is used for.

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,240
SAGAL That used for fast data management and I'll show you the way how to do it.

47
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,680
So again I just quickly leave it alone.

48
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:34,580
And what we want to do is we want to update console games so we're again working with this table.

49
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:43,220
So we want to see that we update it and then we want to say that we set global sales to be equal to

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:55,140
North American sales plus European sales plys Japanese sales and plus other sales of course all the

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,660
sales are in millions.

52
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,890
So don't be alarmed that they only sold 41 copies was quickly go ahead.

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,280
And if you only select this part of the code it will only run select part of the code and see it updated

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,300
all 16000 rows.

55
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:17,700
And now if we go and only select these two top rows of the code and run this select 0 from console games

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,410
if reach a display to us all 11 columns now.

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,030
And it will have global sales as you can see it messed up our database a bit.

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,190
So it added these rows on top of the previous ones.

59
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,410
This is completely normal because databases are about storing the data and not organizing it.

60
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,790
We can easily reorganize this database to follow the game rank or any other column and I will actually

61
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,910
go for that in the next tutorial of knowledge just make sure that when the sound was happening here

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:57,450
because as you can see global sales do correspond to some of the other four columns and don't be alarmed

63
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,980
that there is only 10 columns displayed played here even though there should be 11 because if we go

64
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,560
ahead and refresh each display does that data.

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,840
Now there are 11 columns as you can see we have global sales.

66
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:17,790
Now that was really interesting wasn't it that we have all of these four values added up and we created

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,310
a new column so we don't have to go in manually and all this stuff up and now we can see who sold the

68
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,420
most copies and who sold the least amount of copies.

69
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:35,610
Before we go any further let's find out what percent of the sales of the global sales do North American

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,490
sales make up in order to do this.

71
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,200
We just basically have to say great.

72
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,450
And you call them cold and they sales percent.

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,310
So if you wanted to you can post the video now and go ahead and try it yourself.

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,530
Is basically following what we just did.

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,440
And if you want to do that pause ahead and go now.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,390
Otherwise I'm going to demonstrate to you how to do it right now.

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,090
So first thing you want to do is Aldred that table.

78
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,230
So we all the tables called console games.

79
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,040
The one that we're working with right now and this is done just to stay to skew all that we're working

80
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,170
with this table and on the other.

81
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,710
So now we say that we want to add a column called a salesperson.

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,050
You can call it whatever you want but I think this makes sense and it makes logic.

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,960
It has to be of a float 8 data type again because we have not only whole numbers but most of these numbers

84
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,330
are have decimal point.

85
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,230
If we go and quickly run that we can see that the table has been altered.

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:50,290
But again as you guessed if we show all from console games we will see that.

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,120
Now we have 12 tables but the last table.

88
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Sorry.

89
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,370
Select all.

90
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,570
If we select all from puzzle games we'll see that.

91
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,690
Now we have 12 columns.

92
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,260
The last column the newest column and they sell.

93
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,480
Percent does not have any information any data in it.

94
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,240
And indeed that is correct.

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,350
So now what we want to do is we want to update console games.

96
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,620
This is done again to show the scale that we're working with this particular table.

97
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:29,620
And here was say that we want to set and they salesperson's to be equal.

98
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,200
And now we're working directly with this table and we're basically setting the data inside of it to

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,450
be equal to whatever we want.

100
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,750
So how do we do it right now as we say that we want and they sell us percent to be equal.

101
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,970
And they say all divided by global sales

102
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,670
and then we can say where global sales

103
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,560
bigger than zero.

104
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:12,110
Because obviously we can't divide by zero and we just want to avoid making that mistake in case any

105
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,810
game sold does zero amount of copies globally which is hard to imagine but it might happen.

106
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,240
So we just want to weigh up.

107
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,280
So now if we again select the top two rows of the code and run it we should have 12 columns that will

108
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,260
all be filled with information.

109
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,520
So let's wait for it to finish first Sengcan

110
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,710
And as you can see indeed it is.

111
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:45,190
So now if we go and update this to multiply by a hundred we'll have a much nicer representation of the

112
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,200
table that we don't have to deal with multiplying by a hundred in our heads.

113
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,080
So as you can see here

114
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,770
now we have a much cleaner version representation of the percent.

115
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,670
So now we can go ahead and say that for just pick any game we want.

116
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,240
And again don't worry that the game ranks are all messed up because again you're always about storing

117
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,840
data and not nicely organizing it you'll have to type that in to you know make sure that it's nicely

118
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,240
represented and will definitely do that later.

119
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,610
I just want to get around this topic because it's pretty important.

120
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,390
So as you can see if we go for a card game that was released for Wii U in 2006 that North American sales

121
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,800
represented at sixty three point seventy five percent of the total sales.

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,200
And again these numbers can be all represented in this way but we'll get that done later in the course

123
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,010
once we already have enough knowledge and we can go to cosmetics.

124
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,360
So you say so I think that was quite interesting.

125
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:00,670
Today we're practiced with division and some the same way goes for any other arithmetic operations.

126
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:08,250
So you can multiply divide subtract some any number of values as long as you follow basic math rules.

127
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,900
For example you cannot divide by zero.

128
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,850
And yeah the update sad altered commands will be discussed further in the course and they are very important

129
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,930
to create your own database or as you can see altered these databases.

130
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,320
But I hope you learned a lot from today's lecture.

131
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,670
And you were excited to learn even more.

132
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,490
So that concludes our today's lecture.

133
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,690
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
