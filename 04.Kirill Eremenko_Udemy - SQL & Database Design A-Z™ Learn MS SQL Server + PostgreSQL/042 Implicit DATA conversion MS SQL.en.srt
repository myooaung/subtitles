Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,330
Today we'll be working with implicit data conversion in school as you can see I have Microsoft Asriel

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,540
Server Management Studio loaded up inside of it a have console games I like that inside of it.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,660
I have a table called console games and I will be working with this table today.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:25,420
So I go ahead and run an inquiry in which we'll say select all from console games and drag and drop

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,990
with here.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,470
Run it.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,330
See that all the data is still in place.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,600
Nothing has changed.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Nothing significant has happened.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,060
Now if we open up console games in here and in columns we can see that there are 12 different columns

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,670
in here and they have different data types.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,210
So we're have game ring that's integer plus or minus watcher and a cells that's plot.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,050
So let's go ahead and say I want to change name Year from integer to float.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,110
In this case what I need to do is I need to select all who can actually leave this code in here and

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:03,340
then just put a comma here and say cast open brackets and say what we're casting in our case we're casting

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,080
game here.

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,470
And then we can press as.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,180
And then we say the new data time the twant in our case is going to be decimal flow.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,510
Decimal doesn't really matter.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,890
When they convert integer to something different had run it.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,040
As you can see Game year nothing changed but Game year is of a type decimal right now.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,060
But what's interesting about us if it were pressure here nothing will show.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,910
Nothing will change.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,120
And this is due to the fact that if you want to change the data type in the column permanently you will

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,270
have to do that later on you will have to run a very specific commands that ultra commands update commands

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
and even maybe go to the database or table design and change it in there.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,350
This is just temporary.

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,160
This is just for this query.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,580
For example if we need to run some more specific functions or integer specific functions or decimals

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,670
specific functions for this glary that's where you're going to be using this functions.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,960
Most of the time again converting data types is not something you will do every day.

33
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,690
It's something you will do on very rare occasions but it's good to just remember how it's done and understand

34
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,350
the simple logic behind it.

35
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,170
So again this is how it's done.

36
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,610
Cast selfing as there is also a convert command in which you specify convert to want to type and then

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,260
you put the comma.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,480
And what you want to convert.

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,790
So it goes like this.

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,220
Convert.

41
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:38,570
And then you will put in game year and then you'll put Kahwa and then you put decimal.

42
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,920
So there's just a different way of doing the same function.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,180
But the most important part of it is when you're going to be working with the same query and in the

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,340
square you want to do some for example in this case we could have converted game year to float and work

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,420
with adding it up to North American cells or European cells.

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,690
But as you can see that makes no sense.

47
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,090
So again it was a very brief short lecture about introducing you to implicit data convergence in Microsoft

48
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,270
as CULE server.

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,350
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
