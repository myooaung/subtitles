Hello and welcome back to the course on databases we've had a look at a left join.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,330
So that's scroll up here.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,770
We've had a look at the left join.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,800
We've had a look at a RIGHT JOIN.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,960
So as part of our tips and tricks and we've had a look at an inner join today we've got one more show

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,650
to look at which is a full outer join So let's have a look at that's full outer join now the full outer

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,160
join is quite a rare species.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,970
You won't find it in the wild quite that often.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,750
And why is that.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,360
Well because a full outer join the most common one you use is probably a left join.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,080
It's a very it's very simple to look up in Excel.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,210
Then there's an inner join which trims away all the fat to all of the things that don't match on both

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,660
sides whereas the full outer join it doesn't trim anything at all it just basically matched sub two

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:03,880
tables and leaves everything that doesn't match up that doesn't have a pair in the other table and that's

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,990
something we discuss reading the theory tutorials so let's have a look at in practice so I was going

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,280
to take this same example.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,720
And as you recall we've seen how this works.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,110
An inner join is left joins an outer join.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:23,540
So as an inner join if I just rerun this you will see that we've got 41 rows right now if I do a I was

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:32,160
going to replace this with a full outer join and this doesn't have a lot of meaning for us.

21
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,990
This operation we're going to perform now because we've been hit with the task we had was to find only

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:45,310
the pets in our clinic that have had procedures but still it just for argument's sake just for demonstration

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,310
purposes we're going to run this fall or joint and see what we get.

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,730
So if you're on this now you don't have floodwaters you have 2000 or and â‚¬50.

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,890
And what happened now.

26
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,550
So basically you all picked up these two tables and match them together.

27
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,340
Tried to match as much as it can in anything it matches.

28
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,500
But then the stuff that didn't match it still left and so you can see here you've got all these pets

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,770
that actually had procedures but they're not from our clinic so they don't have any information in this

30
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,370
local pets table.

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,380
On the other hand you do have some that matched up so you've got this pet bird the cat who did match

32
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,750
up because it's a pet in our clinic and our pets table and it had a procedure done.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,390
Then again you have lots and lots and lots that didn't wash up than some other there's cuddles our favorite

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
dog.

35
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,070
So then you've got lots and lots and lots that didn't match up again.

36
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:49,310
And then if you scroll down to the bottom scroll down scroll down what you'll find is at the very bottom

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,060
you've got these ones on the left right.

38
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,060
So where did these come from.

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,740
Well these are pets that are are in our database are our table and our local pets table who or which

40
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,730
never actually had a procedure and therefore they didn't match anything on the right and the full outer

41
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,770
join did not remove them.

42
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,680
So sometimes this might be useful too if you're doing some sort of more involved analysis where you

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,980
do want to see what not only what matched up like this like this one over here like bright dog.

44
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,600
Not only what did match up you also want to see what didn't match up on one side on this side and what

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,420
didn't match up on the other side.

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,380
So again just to reiterate I left to join if we were to replace her for live and would keep everything

47
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,690
that's on the left and would remove any rose that didn't match up on the right so this would be removed

48
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,710
right.

49
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,250
These would actually Sardi's would stay these would stay.

50
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,430
These would be removed.

51
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,900
So basically they because they have nothing on the left and left and only keeps the rows that do have

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,070
something on the left right.

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,290
These rows would be kept and then rows like these that did match up would be kept right join would only

54
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,520
keep only the row all the rows that have something on the right.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,190
These rows basically not.

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,990
But not these rows and inner join would only keep rows that have something in both.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,830
So these are the rows that actually did match up had a pair.

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,210
And don't forget that some of them are duplicated on one of the sides because some parts are on the

59
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,980
left side because some pens have had several procedures.

60
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,790
And finally a four hour journey just keeps everything.

61
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,170
There we go.

62
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:34,430
That's how full outer join works it's always good to know these things because one day you will probably

63
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,810
encounter a full hour of join and you will this knowledge will come in handy.

64
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,070
So now you're prepared for your first full outer join when you do encounter it in your days and career.

65
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,420
I hope you enjoy today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

66
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,140
Until then happy analyzing.
