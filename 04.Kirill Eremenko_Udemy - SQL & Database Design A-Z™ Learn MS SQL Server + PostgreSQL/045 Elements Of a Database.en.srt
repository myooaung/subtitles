Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,010
And today we're going to be discussing elements of database databases consist of several elements and

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,930
we're going to be taking a closer look at them right now.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,010
So as you can guess the most common element of any database is a table because it consists of all the

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,810
data.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,690
Now apart from having tables that is also consist of schemas to manage the bends and seas between different

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,460
tables catalogues and extensions to store different functions.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,830
So now back to tables right here you can see a table or formally known lation console games from console

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,900
games database.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,530
So this is relation.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,420
Console games now every named column of this table is called an attribute.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,640
So this relation has eight attributes and every row of data is named tuple.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,650
So this relation consists of eight attributes and then tuples Now table consist of more elements than

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,570
just attributes and tuples.

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,620
For example the number of columns in any table is referred to as degree and the number of rows of data

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,680
is generally referred to as cardinality.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,140
So cardinality of this relation is 10 and degree of this relation is 8.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,310
Now cardinality can also be referred to.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,540
You need data inside any columns or in the whole relation to have any column or a cell that has a unique

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,470
constraint on it.

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,310
You can say that this is cardinality for this table.

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:36,160
The last element of the table is the main the main is a set of allowable values for one or more columns.

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,370
In this particular table we can say that European sales have a domain of zero to infinity.

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,840
And this is due to the fact that we cannot possibly sell less than zero copies and there is no limit

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,380
to how much money we can get.

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,450
So again database consists of schemas to manage dependencies of different tables can looks and extensions

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,470
to start different functions and tables to store data and tables consist of attributes or columns tuples

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,790
arose degree and cardinalities as well as sometimes the means.

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:17,790
And lastly every table has primary or foreign keys otherwise known as Super keys.

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,730
So if we take a look at this table again we can say that the game rank will be our primary key because

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,360
we can use game rank to uniquely identify any one roll of data in this table because no two games can

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,410
share the same rank.

33
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,890
And if we add another table into here game dates we can see that they're both connected to each other

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,240
through the blast per night.

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,720
So this one we call a foreign key because we can connect the game dates the table and the right to game

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,910
sales and table on the left throughout this column.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,960
So I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
