1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,090
Hello and welcome back to a course on database's today we're going to install Microsoft as school server

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,550
for a windows.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,420
So let's get started with this.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,670
Now the first thing we're going to need is a browser.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,010
So there we go.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:26,720
Chrome is my browser and I'm going to look for apps skills or if you let it load here you'll see a couple

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,440
of links.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,670
The one you need is actually this one.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,380
So where in your cell you've got a scale server Eskdale server 2016 or at the time when you're watching

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,730
it might be a bit over a later version.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,510
But you can go ahead and install that one.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,640
So basically the latest version should be fine if you have the option to install 2016.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,400
Then you can also do that too far along with the tutorials exactly exactly the same things.

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,450
But there's no big difference usually between the new versions as always good to know the new version

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,960
as well.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,200
So once you're on this page it might change with time as well.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,560
But just look for the downloads section.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,620
And then when you go to the download section what you are ultimately after is the Express Edition of

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,530
Escal server so you have the free trial evaluation which is one hundred and eighty day free trial of

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,400
the full scale server.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,670
You've got the developer edition we've got the Express Edition.

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,520
So for this course all we need is Express Edition.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:35,270
It's free and you won't have all those unnecessary elements of the server that you actually don't need

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,570
in this class so go ahead and find the Express Edition of Asgill server.

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,100
Right now the latest one is Eskdale server 20:16 Service Pack 1.

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,860
So click download 1 download now and it's over there.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,300
Actually dollars pretty quickly.

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,230
Go ahead and launch that.

29
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,420
There it is.

30
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,750
Yes.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,740
And let's see.

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,760
So sex insulation type basic insulation is what we actually need is sufficient for us.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,100
Read through the terms.

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,530
If you accept the terms click accept and select an installation path.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,790
It will tell you how much space you need and it's actually going to download the files right now.

36
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:27,830
So that was just the installation starter and I are going to prepare the installation and go ahead and

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,100
install it so you can see the files have been downloaded.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,280
So I'm just actually going to pause this recording and resume it when we're closer to the end of the

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,150
download so we don't have to wait.

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,300
All right so we're near the end of the download.

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,750
And Don successfulness installing.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,530
So an important thing I wanted to mention is that for as Phil sort of 2016 you actually need Windows

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,400
8 minimum.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,840
So if you have Windows 7 or below then you won't be able to install it.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,850
So make sure you have Windows 8 or Windows 10 on your computer before you proceed with this installation.

46
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,930
And yeah that's a prerequisite and you can check those in the descriptions of SQL Server or it will

47
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,430
just not let you proceed with installation after a certain point if you don't have the right windows.

48
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,490
So that's something just to keep in mind.

49
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,800
All right.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,740
So let's again pause the video until this installation process is actually complete.

51
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,950
All right so the installation is progressing.

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,290
And here we've got a solution as completed successfully.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,140
So here's got some pausa ways which you can specify.

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,290
I prefer to leave them as default and that way I'll know that it's all set up correctly if you want

55
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:55,510
to change anything and then feel free to explore this further but I'm just going to Kleek leave it as

56
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,010
it is close and show an exit.

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,950
Yes.

58
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:05,320
And at this point you need to restart your computer for that installation to complete successfully so

59
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm going to go ahead a resawing computer and then we'll continue with this video.

60
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,420
All right welcome back.

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,890
The computer has been restarted.

62
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:20,030
And now what we've really installed is Microsoft as kill server and in order to interact with Microsoft

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,410
Haskel So we're going to need to install a.

64
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,080
All right.

65
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,750
Welcome back.

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,390
So the computer has been restarted and therefore the installation of Microsoft SQL Server is complete.

67
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,540
But that is not the end for us.

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:44,510
For but that is not the end of our installation process because in order to interact with the database

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:53,030
that we have just installed we need a studio a way a program that will allow us to manipulate databases

70
00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:00,410
and program and do exactly what we need to do in these tutorials and this situation is similar to what

71
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,720
we have with postgresql also we have postgresql which is a database engine itself.

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,330
And then you've got PGE admin which is the visual interface which allows you to interact with postgresql.

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,810
Same thing here we've installed Microsoft a SQL Server.

74
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,210
Now we want to install Microsoft Eskew all server management studio which will allow us to interact

75
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,110
with Microsoft SQL Server.

76
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,080
So let's go ahead and solve that.

77
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,360
We're going to go to the browser and we're going to search for M-S as KJo server.

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,210
There it is Massman studio.

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,580
And here just scroll down and find a link that looks like this is the end of March of that column and

80
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,810
here you'll find Esky also reminds miss shooter as the sims.

81
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,320
Also there is an option during the installation process of asking a server at the very end we could

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,600
have selected historicism as you can feel free to do that.

83
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,630
If you still have that window up or you can just download it from here install it.

84
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,380
It's exactly the same thing.

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:09,110
You'll get the same result so here we're going to install the current release of SDL sermons MS studio

86
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,150
so go ahead and just click the installation download.

87
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,850
It's about this one is about 900 megabytes is going to take a few minutes to download and we'll resume

88
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,010
the video when it's when the Delonas finished.

89
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,240
All right so a download is complete.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,730
Let's go ahead and run this.

91
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,160
All right.

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:41,530
Microsoft as kill server management studio install Yes.

93
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,460
And let's give it a second actually is going to take more than a second.

94
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,980
So once again let's resume the video once there's some progress.

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,200
All right so any solution has been completed and now we're done so we can just close here.

96
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:07,720
Well so now we can go and launch Microsoft ask you all server management studio.

97
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,920
So let's have a look at what this looks like.

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:19,230
This is the task bar and here just type in something like Microsoft or even better as well.

99
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,620
There you go so as Kjellstrom as with studio

100
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,280
so you can actually what you can do is pin to taskbar what I normally do.

101
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,920
And that way it's always here.

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,630
So just click on it.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,360
All right so now let's launch a scale Server Management Studio and a second.

104
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,430
There it is.

105
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,160
So everything is set up.

106
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Just click connect here and voila everything is working.

107
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,810
So the set up is complete.

108
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:59,180
And in the next story we will learn how to start working inside Microsoft Asgill server code wait to

109
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,920
see you next.

110
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,610
Until then happy analyzing.
