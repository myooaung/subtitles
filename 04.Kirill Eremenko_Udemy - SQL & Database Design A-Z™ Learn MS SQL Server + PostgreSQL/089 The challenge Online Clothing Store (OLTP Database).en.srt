00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,100
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases we've got another exciting challenge ahead of us today.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,890
We're working for an online clothing store.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,370
So let's see what we have to do.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,460
OK.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,120
So you've been hired as a data analyst for an online clothing store.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,970
The company is expecting to undergo a rapid expansion in the coming months and they are not sure if

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,870
the databases can handle the amount of transactions that will come with the increased number of customers.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,500
So is the rapid expansion means lots more customers there trying to get on board means they'll be connected

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,710
with more purchase introductions and can there be data databases Hamlett or not they're not sure.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,100
So you have been tasked to investigate the current design of the database.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,440
If the design is found to be inefficient for online transaction processing they need to redesign the

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,340
database.

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,550
So this is a very interesting challenge because it is a it sounds like a very classic challenge for

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,520
a database administrator or a database architect and probably is.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,090
But at the same time it's a very good opportunity for us as data scientists and analysts to practice

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,570
our skills the skills that we learn about normalization of databases.

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,400
So Charles in a session are definitely captivating and we'll certainly learn a lot.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,170
Now let's have a look where we can get the data set for today.

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:31,340
So as usual we're going to need a browser and we're going to go to W.W. supercilious and dot com slash

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:40,550
S Q L and if you scroll down here to the bottom you will see Section 9 database design and you got the

21
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,600
challenge if you'd like to get the pedia file.

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,830
The challenge you've got.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,260
PostgreSQL upload code and you've got the online store sales are LCP database example so go ahead and

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,010
download that.

25
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,140
That is our database for today OLTP database example.

26
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,470
And I'm just going to bring it up here on my computer.

27
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,590
So here it is the o l T.P. database.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
And by the way oil Tippee stands for online transaction processing.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,630
That's a common abbreviation that you'll be hearing quite a lot.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,850
And here we've got our database quite a large database.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,280
It's it's an extract and you'll see that here they've got three thousand four hundred fifty five rows

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,880
total.

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:31,010
And these are just the transactions for the past three days so this is 13th of December 2016 then 12th

34
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,370
of December 2016 and 11th of December 22nd are actually also a bit of 10th of December.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,180
So.

36
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:49,610
So it comes from the 18:00 on the 10th to 6pm on the 13th so exactly three times 24 hours 72 hours possed

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,420
and they got three thousand nearly three and a half thousand transaction go through right.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,880
So that's over a thousand purchases per day.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,420
And this as you'll see further down the store has about 900 customers something like that.

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,640
And if they're expecting a rapid expansion this number is going to grow.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,780
So can their database handle the amount of purchase that's coming their way.

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,300
Not sure.

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,750
So basically to upload this data set and then we're going to start investigating which normal forms

44
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,570
this database is in and correcting along the way.

45
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:33,050
If it's not meeting certain forms and as we do that we'll also understand how that's going to benefit

46
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,780
this company in the long run.

47
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,050
All right.

48
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,490
So this is a data set.

49
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,710
Let's have a look we've got a transaction ID.

50
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:46,400
We've got the time stamp when basically the transaction was conducted.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,130
So when the purchasers made customer ID who purchased that name surname where the shipping is going

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,060
the item number description.

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,760
So basically what they purchased item and description and then the price and the discount that was applied

54
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,270
to that purchase.

55
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,750
So looks like a standard data set doesn't look like or database type of structure doesn't look like

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,670
anything's wrong with it.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,160
But as you'll see through the tutorials in this section there is a lot wrong with it.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,490
So the design is very inefficient for oil T.P. type of transactions.

59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,560
So there we go.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,300
Go ahead and download this database our dataset and I will see you in the next tutorial.

61
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,250
And until next I'm happy analyzing.
