Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,180
Today we'll be learning about comments in Microsoft Escudo server as you can see you have Microsoft

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
SQL Server Management Studio open up ready to go.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,480
As always I have my consumer complaints database and it's over the consumer complaints table.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,270
So let's go ahead and quickly run a query.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,020
So just click the query here.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,970
Select all from consumer and consumer complaints.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,100
Now I'm going to execute it.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,710
Sorry about that.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,140
Just let's say I'm going to actually get to see what data I have inside of it and start working on my

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,750
bigger.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:45,590
So let's say I want to add some more code in here that will say Alster table consumer complaints ad

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,220
column

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:01:04,560
and I want to free one free of data type load updates consumer complaints table set one to free on the

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,470
free to be equal to 22 just something like that.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,750
It might make sense to you just like writing down some crazy weird code but basically what we're going

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,670
to be working today with is comments.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,790
So there's not that many applications of Commons and ask you all as well as any other programming languages

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,650
as far as I've encountered Commins are mostly used in two stations.

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,920
The first one is if you're a debugging code and you're trying to understand where exactly the issue

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,310
is or what's going wrong or was going actually good what do you want to do then is to comment out different

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:56,150
parts of the code until you find your issue or your animality to us what you need to do is dash dash

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:04,250
star and then at the end where you want to end your comment you could star Bash our star slash.

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,430
So now you can see it all lit up in green.

25
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,370
That means it's common.

26
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,910
And that means nothing will happen so we just execute it.

27
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,720
As you can see nothing happened.

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,290
This car wasn't even read.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,030
No columns are created on the stakes were given.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,230
Now if you want to go ahead and move forward as you can see if I don't close the star slash then the

31
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,990
comment will be infinite and that will obviously be very inconvenient for us so always remember that

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,440
when you open a star you can also close star slash.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:46,040
Now you can put them in infinite amount of comments inside the same Querrey Just remember to always

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,310
close them.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:56,210
Now there's a second way of using comments and I would say it's more commonly used when it's actually

36
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,160
coming something out.

37
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,740
So this is the second type of comments just by double slash and basically everything right.

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,540
Of the double slash on the same row will become a column.

39
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,590
So as you can see update here is not comment.

40
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,550
Then they can write here comment and then I can set a comment here where I want to continue my forte

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:27,370
which will say something like make sure there's no mistakes here and then all I need to do is run it

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,800
and everything will run correctly.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,630
Of course if we just get rid of this code and this code just because there was comments so as you can

44
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:42,040
see these comments work on row level on every line level and they only come in out riffing right of

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,370
it.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,890
So double dash is mostly used to leave yourself useful notes or tips or if you have to finish your work

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,140
and you're afraid you will remember what you were thinking about tomorrow.

48
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:02,490
You can always say that hey remember remember to check for null or something like that.

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,180
Also very important when you're collaborating with other people and you give them your code for them

50
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,700
not to come to you and ask you all the questions and for you to resolve them you can just leave them

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,760
some useful comments to explain what you want to do with your.

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,410
Call it what it needs to do and so forth.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,280
So you can see comments are very simple very easy topic and ask you all.

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,770
It's definitely not the one that's necessary to know in order to run your queries but it's definitely

55
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,700
a useful tool from time to time.

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,780
I hope you enjoy this lecture.

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,030
I hope you enjoyed the section.

58
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:44,230
I hope you enjoyed working with this fundamental basic very important functions.

59
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,160
I hope you have no questions and you had any results.

60
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,130
All of them.

61
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:56,100
And I most of them are in the hope that you're looking forward to writing more queries later on in this

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,480
course because there is much more we need to practice there's much more we need to do and there is much

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
more you need to learn.

64
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,180
I hope you enjoy this later and I'll see in the next one.
