[Autogenerated] Hello.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,960
Welcome to the planning and configuring A W s systems manager

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,600
module within this managing AWS operations course.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,880
Now, what are we going to learn in this course?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,310
Well, we're gonna have a deep dive into A W s systems manager.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,790
We're going to discuss monitoring and compliance

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,940
dealing with Cloudwatch and Cloud Trail.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,530
We're gonna look at leveraging service catalog to offer our applications and

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,870
services as needed to separate clients or our own organization.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,340
And then we're going to explore the different S

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,840
three features that AWS provides.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,360
So let's dive into this first module in this module.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,540
We have a few learning objectives that we want to cover.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,030
The main overarching objective is we want to have a

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,010
deep dive into A W S systems manager.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,230
Now this breaks apart into three things.

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,590
We're going to identify benefits of the service itself.

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,380
We're going to explore actions that can be performed using the service.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,090
And then we're going to look at managing actions

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,140
and events using systems manager.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,930
So with that,

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:24,000
let's go ahead and break here and in the next clip will pick up by diving into why we want to use systems manager
