00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.420
[Autogenerated] all right.

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:01.910
We did it.

3
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.170
We made it to the end of module three.

4
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.130
During our time in this module,

5
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.420
we actually looked at a few different services provided to us by AWS.

6
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.300
We looked at service catalog,

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.970
which is going to allow us to publish a version

8
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.410
controlled set of services for use by others.

9
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.420
And if you recall,

10
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.430
we can do it either within our own account or we could even

11
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.090
share to other AWS accounts as needed.

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.930
And then we also looked at the multiple offerings that AWS

13
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.270
gives us from managing our s three storage.

14
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.950
We looked at life cycle rules, encryption and then even cross region replication,

15
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.380
just to name a few.

16
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.860
So what's next?

17
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.840
What do we want to really get into following this course?

18
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.200
Well, I'll always recommend that you go ahead and you get your hands dirty.

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.810
The best way to learn is through experience.

20
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.950
So whenever you can dive into playing with all of these

21
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.810
different tools that we looked at,

22
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.940
you want to get comfortable with systems manager.

23
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.210
Now, this is going to mean you're creating automation documents.

24
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.050
You're executing different run commands and even creating patching

25
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.720
windows as well as utilizing parameter store really dig in and see

26
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.510
which of the services that are offered through systems manager are

27
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.750
going to benefit you.

28
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.100
In your use case,

29
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.510
there are several in there that can help you meet many different requirements.

30
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.640
And then we're gonna want to go ahead and optimize our data storage.

31
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.260
So this could mean a few different things.

32
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.270
We can start implementing lifecycle rules now that we know

33
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.240
how they work and what they look like.

34
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.060
We can enable cross region replication wherever it's

35
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.320
needed for many different purposes.

36
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.080
And we can even play around with intelligent tearing and allow s

37
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.280
three to utilize some machine learning to transfer our objects

38
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.420
within S three into the best storage class.

39
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.390
Now that's gonna do it for this course.

40
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.290
I'd like to thank you for watching it and please feel free

41
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.540
to reach out with any concerns or questions or really even

42
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.400
any input that you may have.

43
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.000
So once again, I'd really like to thank you for watching this course, and I hope to see you again soon.
