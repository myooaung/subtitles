1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,720
[Autogenerated] Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,710
Now, in this clip,

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,810
we're gonna work on publishing a new version of our existing product.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,550
So I'm in the plural site products screen here.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,720
And if I scroll down two versions,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,040
we can see there's a few different things we can do.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,660
We can create a new version of our product,

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,480
or we can click on actions here, which is going to allow us to activate,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,530
deactivate or delete in existing version.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,250
So what I want to do is I'm gonna click on create version

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,060
and I'm actually gonna choose a file here.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,570
Now, What I did is I went ahead and updated our existing service catalog product.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,280
I just took away one particular parameter,

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
and I'm gonna give this a new version title.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,370
So I'm gonna call it new and improved because it's new and it's improved,

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,140
and I'm gonna give it a description that calls out the differences.

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,920
And there we go.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,030
So this newest version is limiting the instance types that are deployable,

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,280
some to click on save here and there we go.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,060
Success.

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,200
A new product version has been created, so we now have two versions.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,900
And if I scroll down here, we can see both versions.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,890
So let me go and clear this message here.

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,240
And if I scroll back down, let's go ahead and de activate our initial version.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,330
So I'm gonna select it.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,540
I'm gonna goto actions, and I'm gonna deactivate it.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,100
So we get a warning here, we're gonna continue,

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,100
and we can see now that our version was deactivated.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,860
And what this means is that are provisioned.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,780
Products can no longer launch this version,

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,910
and you can see that they actually market with an inactive tag here,

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,340
right next to the name.

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,320
So now, if I click on new and improved and I click on actions,

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,580
this is the new activated version, so we can see we have activate is great out.

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,930
But we can now deactivate or delete this version as well.

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,120
So basically any new deployments of our product are going

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,410
to deploy this new and improved version.

38
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,690
So if I load this up,

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,510
we can see the description at the top and then some of the

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,030
actions that might be associated with it.

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,510
And then they also describe the template,

42
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,370
or they list the template that was uploaded here.

43
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,320
So this is a long Yamil based cloud information template.

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,130
So now you can see how weaken,

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,380
activate and deactivate and even delete older versions.

46
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,200
So if I go back here and I go down and select the initial version,

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,010
let's go ahead and delete this version.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,450
So I'm gonna click on, continue here after our warning, and there we go.

49
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,360
We now have only one version, and that's the new and improved one.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,900
So this is how the version control ties in to the service catalogue offering.

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,840
Now, before we wrap this clip up,

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,870
I'm actually gonna go ahead and let's actually look at our products list.

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,210
This is a different view than what we have seen.

54
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,220
So this is where we can upload new products if we want to,

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,340
to an individual product list.

56
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,240
And that would allow us to add these products to existing

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,890
or new portfolio list that we create.

58
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,660
So, underneath this menu again,

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,300
you can see that we also have our portfolios list,

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,450
along with other options, something to click on portfolios list,

61
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,840
and that takes us to our portfolio screen.

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,320
So be sure to poke around this consul menu and really see what

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,640
you can do using the service catalogue service.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,550
You can see you can even set colors in a logo specific to your service catalog.

65
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,580
So they really allow for custom branding and very custom specifications

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,930
that you can set all for your particular product.

67
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,560
Now, we're gonna go ahead and wrap this clip up on AWS service catalog,

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,000
and I'll see you in the next one where we're gonna start diving into storage management tools.
