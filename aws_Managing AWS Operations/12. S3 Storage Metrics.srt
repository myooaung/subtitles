1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,710
[Autogenerated] now we just got done discussing cross region replication,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,830
and we're going to move on now to storage metrics that

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,290
are built in for Amazon s three.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,260
So I filtered out my buckets here to this particular one here

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,040
because I have certain objects in there that have lived for a

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,730
long enough period of time.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,510
So I'm gonna open up this bucket and I'm gonna go over

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,390
here to the management pain again.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,700
And there's a metrics tab now.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,090
So let's click on that, and you can see we have a metrics section down here,

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,550
So let me scroll down a little bit and you can see

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,420
it's basically a simple graph.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,480
We have our metrics over here on the left.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,230
So we select the bucket that we're trying to measure.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,890
We can add filters if we wanted to.

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,970
I'm not going to do that.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,120
So I'm gonna click on cancel or we can even alter

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,040
which metrics are getting measured.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,020
So you'll see the 1st 2 which are storage metrics and my 1st 2 I mean,

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,190
the actual two metrics within here are free metrics that are provided to us,

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,100
the other ones which fall into request metrics which are all of your

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,650
different request toe s three and the data transfer metrics so you

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,680
can see all of those different ones.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,640
These are going to be a paid feature.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,830
So you're paying per object that's getting measured for these metrics.

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,140
So I'm not going to enable these for this demo.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,920
But it's just something to keep in mind to know that you

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
can enable these if you so wish to.

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,040
So let me click on cancel here, and we'll just use the defaults that air free.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,620
Now we see our storage is selected and then we see two options.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,650
There's total size and then object count.

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,140
So we click on total size here.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,050
It's going to bring us to our graph,

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,360
and you can see we have a standard storage of 26.2

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,130
pretty much all the way through out.

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,610
So starting several weeks back toe all the way up to a couple of days ago.

37
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,180
Now let's say we want to actually go and switch this so I'm

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,230
gonna click on object count now and you can see our graph

39
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,940
changes for all storage types.

40
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,490
We have five objects in this bucket and this is a per day count.

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,870
So now you can see how you can actually enable in view storage

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,500
metrics within Amazon s three to get a better understanding of how

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,280
your objects and buckets are being used.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,000
So we're gonna go and wrap this clip up, and then we're gonna move on to intelligent storage tearing.
