00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,090
[Autogenerated] All right, Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,250
Now, In the previous clip,

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,940
we discussed setting specific constraints on our products

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,150
that we have listed in our portfolios.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,060
And in this clip,

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,960
we're going to start diving into allowing users groups and rolls

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,760
and other AWS accounts to get in there in,

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,670
publish or deploy our product that we have listed.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,620
So I'm gonna expand users groups and rolls here,

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,720
and you can see that we can click this ad button.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,940
So I'm gonna click on add, and we can see we can either browse groups,

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,450
weaken, browse users or weaken do roles.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,610
So this is going to isolate on which users and our account

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,520
can access in view and launch this product.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,430
So let's say we want to lock this down to our deployment Engineers group here.

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,920
So all these users that are within this group,

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,110
we'll have access to our plural site products.

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,370
So I click on add access and there we go.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,880
We now have a user permission set up under our user

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,090
groups and Rolls section here.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,260
So this is going to allow this group within our account the

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,340
ability to access this published product.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,640
Now,

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,600
let's also say we want to share this with some partnering A W s accounts or

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,640
maybe an organization account that lives underneath us.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,000
Now,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,150
I won't be able to do organizations because I don't have one

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,840
created because I'm Onley in a single account,

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,040
but the process is going to be the same.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,740
What I would do here is goto add account and you can see

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,100
that we can specify an account I d.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,940
So what we would do here is type the 12 digit account i d,

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,940
and this is going to share it with this particular account.

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,210
I'll click on share and there we go.

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,020
We have now shared our portfolio,

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,490
which is the plural site portfolio with this account here,

37
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,520
and you can see that the administrator of that account can now import the

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,130
portfolio at this particular link that they provide.

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,630
So, just like that,

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,680
we can easily share it with specific AWS accounts and allow these accounts

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,040
access into viewing our products within our portfolio.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,370
So I'm gonna go ahead and remove this account really quick before I forget to,

43
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,420
and that's going to wrap this clip up.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,370
I'll see you in the next one where we're gonna finish up

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:20,000
editing our existing product and then viewing the service catalog consul screen and running through it
