00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,530
[Autogenerated] All right.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,240
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,230
Now this clip,

4
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,490
we're going to start diving into the cloudwatch dashboard

5
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,240
capability under operations management.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,490
Now,

7
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:16,000
Cloudwatch dashboard here is essentially a customizable page or a dashboard

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,670
that allows us to view cloudwatch metrics and alarms.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,040
Now, I'm not going to dive into this too much in detail right now,

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,730
but let's just go ahead and take this out so I can create

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,440
a dashboard here will give it a name.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,180
Let me create dashboard.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,780
And there we go.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,690
We have now created a plural site, dashboard.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,870
We're going to learn cloudwatch dashboards a lot deeper in in

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,740
a lot more detail later on in this course.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,390
So for now,

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,820
just bear with me and we're just gonna walk through

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,000
this so you can see what it does.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,830
Not gonna click line here.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,480
I'll click on configure.

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,930
We can give our graph a title and then we can see we have our metrics so I

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,010
can look at the different metrics within this region.

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,600
Because remember, cloudwatch is a regional service.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,270
So what I can do here is I can goto s three just for it.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,960
An example.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,650
Here.

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,680
I can look at my logs directory that I have and my number of objects.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,090
Let's just do number of objects for now.

30
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,950
And if I had some data that was being reported,

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,210
we would see it up here at the top on this craft.

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,500
Now, I don't have anything here,

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,040
so let me go and switch this in number just to be sure.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,660
And there you go.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,140
You can see we have nothing in this bucket.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,640
But what this would allow us to do is create this widget.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,420
And now it's on our dashboard.

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,120
So make sure you always save your dashboard when you're done.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,640
I've done it before where I've created this beautiful dashboard.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,830
And then I forgot to click Save in.

41
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,570
All of my work was lost.

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,500
So really be sure to save her dashboard whenever you edit or created.

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,700
So now what we could do from here is we could view many

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
different metrics in a single pane of glass,

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,100
all under systems manager.

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,020
And if we see something out of whack or out of the ordinary,

47
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,800
we could go in the ops center and then resolve some of

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
those issues if they're occurring.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,410
So this portion really allows us to have an extremely flexible

50
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,720
and customizable display for viewing our source data about a

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,010
metrics and alarms within our accounts.

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,060
Now, the next thing we have here is trusted advisor in personal health.

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,240
Dashboard.

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,480
Now a trusted advisor is going to compare all of your AWS

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,580
resource is to the A W s recommended best practices,

56
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,880
so you can see that it's came.

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,690
My account for 55 of my resource is there's no problems detected.

58
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,880
We have zero investigations recommended, and then we have actions recommended.

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,900
So, five, you all check details here.

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,220
It brings me to trusted adviser,

61
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,650
and you can see I have a security group that was just

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,400
showing up for unrestricted access.

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,160
So I created a security group that allowed Internet traffic from

64
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,110
anywhere for a demo that I was doing previously.

65
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,790
So that's why it's picking that up.

66
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,540
So if I expand this,

67
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,070
you can see I have tons of security groups down here in a lot

68
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,570
of them are recommending investigation.

69
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,820
But then I do have the defaults that are left in place,

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,080
and this is a best practice to erase default security groups,

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,140
by the way.

72
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,110
But these air allowing already P traffic from anywhere,

73
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,600
So that's why they're flagged.

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,330
And this is all viewable under one service within systems Manager.

75
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,020
The next thing we see is personal health dashboard.

76
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,170
So this is where if a W s was having events that

77
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,260
affected your resource is health.

78
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,660
Like maybe they had an s three outage which has

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,960
happened before in North Virginia.

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,370
It would show up here.

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,850
Or maybe they're having a E C s or I am related

82
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,900
issue and it affects your accounts.

83
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,580
They're going to show up within this dashboard for you to view.

84
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,430
So if I go to a view,

85
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,840
all you'll see it brings me the personal health dashboard and this is an idea of

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,390
what you might see now these are all closed and completed.

87
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,840
So there's nothing showing up on our dashboard, these air all in the past.

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,440
So you can see we had a cloud formacion operational issue.

89
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,640
We can go in here and look at the details,

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,750
and if needed,

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,330
we can look at affected Resource is so if I had cloud

92
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,330
formacion templates and stacks deployed,

93
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,570
it would list My affected resource is here.

94
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,790
So I could be aware there's e C to weaken.

95
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,170
See it was resolved the time stamps when they happened and

96
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,240
were resolved if there was any affected resource is once again

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,790
and you can see the list goes on.

98
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,020
It's for any service in A W s.

99
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,650
So that's going to do it for this section on the Operations

100
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,070
Management capability section will go ahead and we're going to

101
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:02,000
wrap up this section and then move on to application management in the next upcoming clips.
