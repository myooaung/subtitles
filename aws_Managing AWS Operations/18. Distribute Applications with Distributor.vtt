[Autogenerated] No way.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.620
Let's pick up where we left off and let's start talking about distributor Now.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.750
Distributor is going to allow us to package our own

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.240
software to install on our managed instances.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.390
So it's essentially allows us to publish software to install so

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.680
you'll see some ones that are provided here,

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.310
for instance, Amazon Cloudwatch agent.

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.180
And this is gonna install the cloudwatch agent on our instances that we specify.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.240
So let's just see what creating one looks like.

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.740
I click on create.

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.690
We can do simple or advanced, and let's just go ahead and do simple.

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.340
For the sake of the length of this video we give our package of name,

13
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.110
we can give it a version.

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.690
We specify where we want to pull this info from,

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.580
and you can see my version was wrong.

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.840
So what I would do is I could specify the URL.

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.840
We would add software as needed.

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.010
We would create a manifest which shows what's being

19
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.380
installed and what version this is.

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.990
And then will we create our package and then using are distributed package,

21
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.590
we could select it, install on a schedule or install one time.

22
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.830
So if I do install one time.

23
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.610
Once again,

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.810
it brings us to our run command documents because

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.820
documents are how systems Manager operates.

26
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.210
It all operates on documents in the background,

27
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.980
so you can see we're configuring a package were installing.

28
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.340
Here's the name of the package.

29
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.540
We can specify the version.

30
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.840
We do the same old thing where we select our resource group.

31
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.000
Our parameters will skip all this.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.910
I won't write to s three.

33
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.070
And then what I would do is I would run this.

34
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.740
So if I click on run,

35
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.980
what this is doing is if we had a managed instance in that resource group,

36
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.520
it would run and install that CLOUDWATCH agent on that instance.

37
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.970
And there we go right there.

38
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.530
So success,

39
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.630
and you can see that it installed CLOUDWATCH agent with

40
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.180
this version number on our server.

41
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.280
So now, on that instance, we have cloudwatch agent installed,

42
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.090
and we can configure it to push to our law groups for

43
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.650
centralized monitoring and logging.

44
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.330
Now we'll talk about cloudwatch and depth later on,

45
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.700
so I'm not gonna go into that on this.

46
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.470
I just wanted to show you how distributor works for distributing

47
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.200
our own custom packages or Amazon provided ones.

48
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.440
So let's go ahead.

49
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.360
Let's take a break here and then when you're ready,

50
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.000
will move on to shared resource is where we're gonna look at documents at a deeper level.
