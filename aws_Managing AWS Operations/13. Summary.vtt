00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.780
[Autogenerated] all right, way to go.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.360
You did it.

3
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.000
You made it all the way to the end of this second module in this course,

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.470
and we're just gonna end this on a really quick summary.

5
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.400
Now, the first thing we really talked about was cloudwatch.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.140
And what we use cloudwatch for is monitoring in logging needs.

7
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.640
So remember, we're always gonna push all of our logs to cloudwatch.

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.810
And then from there we can actually stream those two

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.140
different locations like kinesis, a Lambda function,

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.450
or even something off site that we can monitor on using metric filters.

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.960
And we also use cloudwatch for alarming in notifying us via an SMS

12
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.140
topic when certain metric thresholds were crossed.

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.080
The next thing we talked on was implementing cloud trail

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.770
for your monitoring in auditing actions.

15
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.510
So we created an enabled our cloud trail trail to really track all of

16
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.260
the events that were going on within our account.

17
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.530
And if you remember, we pushed him to a specific bucket where we encrypted them.

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.600
And then we also made sure that they were validated as they were being saved.

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.390
And then we took a look at guard duty and inspector.

20
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.300
And how those tools can really offload vulnerability management.

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.390
They really allow an automated process to be taken for

22
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670
all of the tedious vulnerability, scanning and malicious activity monitoring.

23
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.340
And then we just finished up with an I am best practices review touching on

24
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.070
some of the key aspects that AWS recommends themselves.

25
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.140
Now that's gonna do it for the second module.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.040
We're gonna wrap it up and I'll see you in the next one where we're

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.000
going to start looking at the different tools that are available to us from managing our storage in AWS.
