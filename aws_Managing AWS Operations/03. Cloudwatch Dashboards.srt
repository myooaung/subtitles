1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,870
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,910
Now, in this clip,

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,200
we're gonna actually start talking about cloudwatch dashboards.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,480
So when I select dashboards on the left side of my screen here,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,960
we can actually see I already have a few already created.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,830
Now, if you recall, we actually made this plural site.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,640
Andrew Demo Dashboard.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,430
When we were working through this from the Insights menu in Systems

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,710
Manager and we can see we have our widgets that we added.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,550
So let's go ahead and go back to dashboards here,

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,060
and we're gonna walk through this again.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,500
We're going to create a new dashboard, so I'm gonna click, create dashboard.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,300
Let me go ahead and give this name the default name,

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,500
if you remember, which is cloudwatch Dash default,

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,950
someone a click on Create dashboard now.

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,130
And it brings us to this ad to dashboard screen,

17
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,440
which is where we select our first widget type.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,810
Now, before we go through with this,

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,500
let me show you some examples of what these look like.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,170
A line graph is going to look like that so you can see there's

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,770
lines here and in this particular example,

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,480
there's this dots because there's not multiple indications on that

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,100
graph but depending on the metric you're measuring,

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,410
those lines might be connected all the way.

25
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,940
Throughout that graph, we have a number widget, which is what it sounds like.

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,250
It displays a text number on the dashboard itself.

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,810
We have a stack area, so this has a shaded portion underneath that line.

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,170
It basically builds off of that first line widget that we see on the

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,400
left of the screen and building some shading and some coloring to

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,540
make it a little bit easier to picture.

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,940
And it makes it look nicer.

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,460
And then finally, we have text, which is marked down now.

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,420
I don't see this one use very often, but it's good to know that they do offer it.

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,020
You can basically have a marked down page as a widget on your dashboard,

35
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,470
so it allows you to do a lot of different handy things.

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,260
Anything you can do in mark down, you can actually do in this text widget.

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,070
Now, one last important thing is the Remember to always save your dashboard.

38
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,380
After adding your widgets,

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,980
I stress that in the systems manager module and all stress it again.

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,460
Any time you make a change, or add a new widget.

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,440
You need to save your dashboard.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,090
Let's go back to the council now.

43
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,690
So for this one, let's just go ahead and do stacked area.

44
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,490
We'll click on Configure and then let's give this a graph

45
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,800
name we can see here on the top left weaken,

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,410
Click on this little edit button and we'll call this graph one.

47
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,570
I'm gonna click this little check mark to accept it,

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,010
and I'm gonna scroll down to all metrics down here.

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,280
And if we scroll through this, we can see we have building cloudfront E B s logs,

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,450
Lambda E.

51
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,550
C two and then s three and S s.

52
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,860
Now,

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,650
the reason we see these metro groups listed and not every

54
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,960
single one is that's because we have only these resource

55
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,950
is within our account active.

56
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,350
So let's go ahead and let's select SNS for now.

57
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,650
And we can do several things.

58
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,350
We can look by the country or SMS type.

59
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,920
We can look at topic metrics or we can look at metrics with no dimensions.

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,910
So for this example,

61
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,680
let's click on topic metrics here and you can see here we have one topic.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,660
There's four topic names, but it's really all the same topic.

63
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,010
It's just different metrics that are being measured.

64
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,730
So if I scroll down, let's just go and see number of messages published.

65
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,320
So I'm gonna select this because I want to see the total

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,340
number of messages that were published.

67
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,360
And I want to change this graft metric here to a statistic of some.

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,520
So I want to see the total sum of messages published.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,950
And let's turn this up a little bit.

70
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,540
I'm gonna go to Period and let's go down to one minute.

71
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,210
So that's a very active monitoring period.

72
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,170
And then finally, I want to go up to custom here the timeline.

73
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,700
And let's just do three months so you can see here that we've had exactly two

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,250
messages published in the last three months and that's a sum.

75
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,010
So it's a total of two messages.

76
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,200
So what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna pause this clip.

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm gonna go published a few different messages on this topic,

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,390
and then we'll come back and check this out again.

79
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,330
So for now, I'm gonna click, create widget.

80
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm gonna save my dashboard, remember?

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,520
And then I'm gonna pause this and then I'll resume it

82
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,150
after I published a few messages.

83
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,230
All right, so I posted a few more messages.

84
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,500
Three to be exact.

85
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,360
And we can see here.

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,170
Now that our graph is updated, you can see the count now is at three.

87
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,860
Number of messages published.

88
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,460
Three.

89
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,020
Now, one thing to keep in mind here by default.

90
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,650
When you create this widget and it gets on the screen,

91
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,230
there's a default period here that's gonna check every five minutes.

92
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,120
So to speed this up or even customized for your own stuff if you want,

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,520
what we did here is I wanted to actions.

94
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
And then from this,

95
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,380
you can see there's a period override now with in this period over right?

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,010
I said it toe one minute, so it would be a lot quicker,

97
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,680
and we don't have to wait a long time,

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,150
but you can see that it actually allows you to do a lot.

99
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,340
You can do one second five seconds all the way up to 30 days.

100
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,490
And what this period is is the amount of time that it's collecting data.

101
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,870
So for every one minute,

102
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,660
Cloudwatch is going to post an updated amount of data on this graph here.

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,190
So I sent it to a one minute, but usually it's gonna be set,

104
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,200
Otto, or five minutes now.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,960
Since I changed that, I'm gonna save my dashboard again.

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,460
And the next thing I want to do is open up this actions menu again.

107
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,730
Now,

108
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,470
what we can do here is we can make a new dashboard weaken

109
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,850
save this one is a copy to a new one.

110
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,940
We can favored it.

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,850
Weaken, rename, delete and weaken, view and edit the source.

112
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,500
And then here at the bottom, we can actually even inter full screen,

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,200
which is kind of a cool little thing.

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,120
If you have maybe a monitor or display that's strictly for

115
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,740
monitoring this dashboard Nyman exit full screen here.

116
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,930
And the next thing I'm going to show is we can add another widget.

117
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,650
So using this add widget button that I just clicked on,

118
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,430
it brings us back to this main screen.

119
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,300
So if he wanted to weaken, select another widget,

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,770
we can configure it and we can go back in and

121
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,790
measure metrics again if we wanted to.

122
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,200
So let's just do lambda I'll do by function.

123
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Name will do invocations.

124
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,970
Forget SSN parameter.

125
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,540
And another handy thing here is if you're looking for a

126
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,760
specific metric name or even us resource name,

127
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,550
you can click on this little drop down here,

128
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,820
this little tree, and you can actually search for this on Lee.

129
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,290
So if I wanted to, I can look here.

130
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,430
It indications.

131
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,130
And I can search for this on Lee and we can see that I only

132
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,080
have one function here that's being measured.

133
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,770
But if I had more than one,

134
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,410
it would show indications Metric name for multiple function names and you

135
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,930
can see that it's populated here in this search bar.

136
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,120
So I'm gonna select this.

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,910
I'm gonna go to graft metrics.

138
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm going to select the some again, and then we'll do a period of one minute.

139
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,730
Now I'm gonna say this.

140
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,110
So create this widget.

141
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,750
I'm going to save my dashboard.

142
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,600
So now if we had any indications on that land of function,

143
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,290
it's gonna populate this number widget for us,

144
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,980
we don't have any.

145
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,610
So that's why it's a dash dash.

146
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,310
But one last thing.

147
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,960
I want to show you up here we have our timeframe again.

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,090
So if I went to one week now you can see a better view of

149
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,970
what a stack area graph looks like.

150
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,290
We see two originally.

151
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,640
And then it went up to three during this period.

152
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,230
Now let me save this dashboard.

153
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,700
And the very last thing I'm gonna show you is if we go

154
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,540
back to this overall screen here.

155
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,250
If you remember,

156
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,090
they had this where we can scroll down and we can see our default dashboard now.

157
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,420
