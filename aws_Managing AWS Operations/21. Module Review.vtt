00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.960
[Autogenerated] all right, way to go.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.960
You made it to the end of this systems manager module Before we move on.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
Let's just have a quick wrap up and review what we learned

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.260
so we can reinforce it before we move on.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.710
We learn that systems manager is essentially a suite of tools

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.540
that enable easier operations management.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.690
Within AWS,

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.320
we saw there were five core categories that each had their own subset or

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.950
suite of tools and capabilities that they can perform.

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.270
We saw their operations management, which allowed us to manage.

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
Our AWS resource is from a central location.

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.860
We looked at application management,

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.990
which allows us to configure our applications.

14
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.030
Running on our resource is like app config, for example.

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.850
We explored actions and change, so we looked at automation,

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.600
XYZ and different maintenance windows that we could use.

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.170
We explored the long list of instances and nodes related capabilities,

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.380
including inventory in session manager and then we finished up with

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.600
shared resource is where we looked at that automation document and

20
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
then explored using them within a W s.

21
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.640
Now that's gonna do it.

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's go ahead and wrap up here, and when you're ready, you can move on to the next module
