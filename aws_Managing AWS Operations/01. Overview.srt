00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,040
[Autogenerated] Okay, welcome to Module three,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,960
where we're going to start diving into using additional

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,320
monitoring services offer to us by a ws.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,790
Now, what should we expect to learn in this module?

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:13,980
Well,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,910
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to identify the

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,420
benefits of using AWS service catalog And then with that,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,850
we're actually gonna work on publishing a new product to service

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,470
catalog from within our account so other users can actually use it

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,810
and deploy it into their own accounts.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,130
The very next thing we're going to do is we're going to explore the

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,010
different tools available for managing AWS storage.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,340
And believe it or not,

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,180
there's quite a few tools that AWS offers for either

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,540
extremely cheap or for free for us to use.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,300
So let's go ahead and wrap this overview clip up,

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,000
and then I'll see you in the next one where we're going to start diving into what service catalog is and what it's used for.
