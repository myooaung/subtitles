1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,980
[Autogenerated] All right, let's dive into systems manager now.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,880
Why would we want to use a systems manager in AWS?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
Well, there's three main reasons now.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,500
The first is that it allows us to group.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,640
Our resource is into resource groups,

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
which allows for easier management using those resource groups.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,100
We can then analyze our workloads and gain insights toe

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,940
operational data that we're working with inside a ws.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,880
And then using those insights,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,240
we can then perform actions on our resource groups as needed.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,220
Now we'll dive in deeper to each of these three topics as

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,200
we work our way through this module.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,000
In this course now a W s systems manager is really a suite of

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,440
tools and services offered to us by a W S.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,500
They all simply live under one roof called systems Manager.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,180
So let's talk about the first subsection now.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,070
The first thing we see in the Consul which will see here

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,940
upcoming in the next clip is operations management.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,300
Now,

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:15,170
Operations management is a sub suite of tools built into A W s systems manager.

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,080
It has something called Explorer, which allows us to customize dashboards.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,040
Four reports of our resource is in our accounts.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,840
We then have ops Center and this is going toe offer us

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,190
a centralized place for viewing,

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,840
investigating and remediating operational tasks that we need to perform.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,460
So a good example here would be patching, weaken.

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,250
See that hate?

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,270
We need to go ahead and re mediate these instances and get them up to

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,970
date for the patching standards that we put into place.

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,950
The next thing that's offered his cloudwatch dashboards.

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,920
Now we'll discuss dashboards in depth later in this course,

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,190
but at a high level,

33
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,510
they allow us to monitor cloudwatch metrics from

34
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,060
within the Systems Manager page.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,130
This is a handy thing toe have.

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,040
Since you'll be poking around the different systems,

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,680
you don't wanna have to keep hopping back and forth between

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,500
services like system Manager and Cloudwatch.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,310
Now it's in one location,

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,320
and the final capability is trusted advisor for real time

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,540
guidance in the Personal Health dashboard,

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,570
which monitors A W s health events.

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,340
And it will put event notifications in our consul for us to view.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,900
So if AWS is having a service malfunction in a specific region,

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,670
it would appear in our personal health dashboard.

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,540
Now that's going to do it for this overview on operations management.

47
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's go ahead and jump away from the presentations and let's get into the console and start exploring each of these capabilities.
