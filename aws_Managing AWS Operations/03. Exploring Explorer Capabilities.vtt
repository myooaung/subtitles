00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.330
[Autogenerated] All right,

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.140
let's go ahead and start diving into systems manager within the console.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.610
We just had an overview of operations management,

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.710
which you can see here on the left side of the console.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.630
And let's just go ahead and walk through these four different capabilities.

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.080
The first thing we have is Explorer.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.270
Now Explore is going to allow us to quickly view ops related data in tasks.

8
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.240
So if I click on get started here,

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.200
it's gonna walk us through an interactive set up.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.760
It's going to create some I am role for us,

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.600
which is a cloudwatch event role in the cloudwatch events,

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.140
or Howard generating our ops items that we want to interact with.

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.550
We can configure default rules.

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.280
So using those cloudwatch events,

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.780
AWS provides a default set that we can enable for viewing,

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.840
so we'll leave this checked.

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.110
Then we set up our data sources that are used to populate

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.040
our widgets that we're going to set up and you can see

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.220
there's several listed here, including patch compliance,

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.570
and easy to now you'll also notice that not all of them are

21
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.790
supported because of the business plan that I have.

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.000
So if you have a support plan of business or enterprise

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.290
that will unlock all of the features.

24
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.940
I'm on a basic or free support plan, so I don't get access to all of that now.

25
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.910
What I can do is I can also specify a tag for reporting.

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.500
We'll leave the default here and I'm gonna click on

27
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.620
Enable Explorer and then we go.

28
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.980
It's that simple.

29
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.190
So now, after a while, we should see some data populated.

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.090
Now we might not see it here because I just recently

31
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.220
started running some instances,

32
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.910
and I'm not really performing a lot of actions or a P I calls that

33
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.840
might get measured an output into this dashboard.

34
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.740
But you can see it's going to give us our instance count how many managed

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.250
instances we have and will discuss those a little bit later on.

36
00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.610
Over.

37
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.730
In the instances and nodes section, we can see which am eyes are in place,

38
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.350
Trusted adviser, and then it even shows our compliance for patching.

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.370
Now, here at the bottom, we have our ops items.

40
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.650
So based on those rules that we put into place,

41
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.340
our operations team could come in here and they can see Hey,

42
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.930
we have so many unresolved ops items,

43
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.840
and then on the right side we have the severity level that we've classified.

44
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.120
So what's nice is that we can see quickly how many ops

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.880
items that we need to take care of now.

46
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.890
There's obviously none here because I have nothing going on within this account.

47
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.840
But this is a very efficient way to see how many unresolved

48
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.840
operational items you need to take care of.

49
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.310
And they even give you this fancy graph down here,

50
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.380
showing you over time the different ops items categories that were reported.

51
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.200
Now, before we wrap up this explore clip,

52
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.830
you'll see that they have a recommended configuration

53
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.200
where we can set up a resource data, sync across regions and accounts.

54
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.940
So let's go ahead.

55
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.140
I'm gonna go in here.

56
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.940
I'm not going to complete it.

57
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.870
But you can see we give it a name.

58
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.620
We can include our accounts.

59
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.790
So if I was in a master organization account,

60
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.270
we would be able to select all accounts in our organization,

61
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.000
or you can select specific organization units from the organization service.

62
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.660
So this allows us to centrally log in,

63
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.590
monitor different ops items in all of the regions,

64
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.500
as you can see here in one location for all of our accounts.

65
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.170
So this is a very powerful tool that's offered to us within systems manager.

66
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.650
Now, when I canceled out here, you'll notice it took me to the settings page.

67
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.950
Now you can see all of the different rules that were

68
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.370
enabled by default S S M ops items,

69
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.300
and then it has the category or service and then the different rules

70
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.330
that are in there and you can see they're all enabled.

71
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.170
So before we wrap up, let's just dig in tow.

72
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.180
One of these issues will do easy to issue,

73
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.490
and you'll see it brings us to event bridge.

74
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.190
So vem bridges a new service within a WS that allows for notifications

75
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.550
or events to trigger whatever resource you need.

76
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.400
Whether it be some type of alerting tool like pager duty or whatever you choose,

77
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.940
we can see our rule details at the top.

78
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.910
We see the event pattern that we're looking for,

79
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.410
and then we have our targets,

80
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.230
which is our ops item that we defined when we were setting this up.

81
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.890
So that's going to do it for digging into explorer within operations management.

82
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.000
Let's go in in here. In the next clip will pick up with Ops Center
