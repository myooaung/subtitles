00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.680
[Autogenerated] awesome.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.870
Now let's dive into actions and change.

4
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.860
Now Actions and change allows us to perform certain capabilities,

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.100
which I'm sure you've guessed Our actions and changes

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.350
against our resource is in our accounts.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.130
Now the first capability is automation,

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.100
and this is going to simplify our common maintenance in deployment

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.820
tasks with regards to easy to in other AWS resource is that we

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.840
need to keep up to date or compliant.

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.940
The next capability is a maintenance window.

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.440
Now a maintenance window allows us to define a schedule or a window.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.650
In other words,

14
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.950
for when we want to perform potentially disruptive actions so

15
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.870
you don't wanna have to patch midday potentially so you can

16
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.490
schedule a maintenance window, maybe overnight,

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.770
where your automation kicks in and starts patching all of your instances.

18
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.820
And we'll look at these a little bit deeper here.

19
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.940
Coming up.

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.280
The last capability that's here is change calendar,

21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.940
so this works hand in hand with the maintenance windows,

22
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.380
and these allow us to create date and time ranges for

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
when actions can or cannot be performed.

24
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.220
So it allows us to create a calendar based schedule on when things can be done

25
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150
now a change calendar is pretty common in large enterprises,

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.400
so this is a very,

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.620
very good addition by a ws for any platform or operational teams.

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.430
So let's go ahead well in the presentation part of this,

29
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.000
and let's actually dive into the AWS consul again and start working with actions and change.
