00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.720
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's dive into APP.

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.800
Config Now at Come FIG is another capability under application management,

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.360
and it allows us to use systems manager to quickly create,

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.110
manage and deploy different application configurations.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.250
Some interesting use cases that are provided our application tuning so we

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.010
can test our app and then make config changes quickly.

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.130
Or we can even enable a feature toggle for a new feature

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.910
that were pushing out with our application.

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.840
So if we want to show it at sometimes and then not at others,

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.690
we can quickly toggle a feature on and off.

12
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.980
Now I'm gonna go ahead and click on create CONFIG data and

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.530
let's just create our application So we'll give this a

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.430
production application name.

15
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.540
We can give it a description, and then we can also give it some tags.

16
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.300
So if I wanted to,

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.440
I can do environment and then prod and building off the last clip.

18
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.700
This would allow us to tie this into our prod resource group that we created.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.680
So I'll click on create application and there you go.

20
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.390
We have now created our application in APP Config.

21
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.540
Now I'm not going to deploy a true application here.

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.900
But let's walk through this as much as we can,

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.840
and then I'll touch on pieces that were not actually going to do.

24
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.520
Now the first thing we have to do is we at the create an environment.

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.580
So an example of this might be test weaken set our monitors.

26
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.700
So what kind of role do we want to use for cloudwatch alarms?

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.000
And we can specify the alarm itself.

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.870
So if we want to tie in alarms, we can do that.

29
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.020
We can create more tags once again, and then I click on create.

30
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.410
So we've now created our test environment in It's Ready for deployment.

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.040
So if I go back to APP config, I go into my production application,

32
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.940
let's create one more environment.

33
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.560
So I'm gonna call.

34
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.860
This prod will create it quickly, and there we go.

35
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.860
We now have two environments for the same application,

36
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.540
So this mimics a real world scenario where you would push appointments to test,

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.560
and then once they're tested and successful,

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.350
you can quickly deploy them to prod.

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.320
Let's go in a test here, and you could see we have a start deployment button.

40
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.270
So if I go to start deployment,

41
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.820
we had to create or choose a configuration to deploy.

42
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.200
Now we don't have any.

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.210
So let's go ahead and click on Create.

44
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.220
And this is where we give it a name.

45
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040
We can give a description.

46
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.210
We can create a new service role or using existing, and we can create more tags.

47
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.490
I'll click on next.

48
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.580
And this is where we configure the source provider.

49
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.000
So where are we actually getting our config?

50
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.180
Data from you can see we can pull from parameter store,

51
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.140
which will talk about later.

52
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.180
We can pull from a document which will also cover a little bit later,

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.960
or we can pull from s three.

54
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.010
We can point to an s three object that holds our configuration data.

55
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.900
Now, once again, I don't have any config to deploy,

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.610
so we're not going to go through this.

57
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.440
But you can see the next step is add validators.

58
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.290
Now what add Validators does is it allows us to add a

59
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.700
validation for AP convict to use as a checkpoint before

60
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.940
actually deploying this config.

61
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.110
So it's kind of ah,

62
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.200
stopgap measure to make sure that everything's correct before it deploys.

63
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.710
You can see once we choose our configuration,

64
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.780
we would get a version option as well.

65
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.510
So this is what allows us to quickly change the versions

66
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.340
of our app config that were the point.

67
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.470
And then we moved to deployment strategy.

68
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.420
So what kind of deployment strategy do we want?

69
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.870
You can do linear or exponential as a deployment type.

70
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.170
So for linear,

71
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.390
what this is going to do is it allows app config to push out

72
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.510
the deployments in small defined increments based on the

73
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.210
number that we'd put into place.

74
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.590
And then exponential is going to use a growth factor here,

75
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.870
and it's going toe exponentially.

76
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.450
Deploy.

77
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.340
The resource is so they're a little bit different in how they work.

78
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.200
So essentially, if we have several,

79
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.900
resource is it's going to start with two and then four and then so

80
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.340
on and so forth by an exponential factor of two.

81
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.890
And then the final two settings that we have are our deployment time.

82
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.460
So we can specify how long we want this to run, and we can specify a bake time.

83
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.390
So how long is it taking our systems to get up and fully

84
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.310
running before they're considered complete?

85
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.150
So this is similar to a load balancer in the fact

86
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.840
that you can perform health checks.

87
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.880
But you've specify a cool down period or a grace period that allows you to say,

88
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.560
Hey, we don't know if this is good or bad yet,

89
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.840
but I want to hold off and give it some time to come up properly.

90
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.140
So from here I would create my deployment strategy.

91
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.630
I would give a deployment description and then I would start might appointment.

92
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.640
I don't have a config set, so this won't work.

93
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.960
But that's how easy it is to deploy toe one environment for your application.

94
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.270
And then once we tested everything appropriately,

95
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.430
we would see our deployments down here.

96
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.850
We could go back to our prod APP application.

97
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.350
I can go into prod and we could do the same thing here.

98
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.330
We can use a deployment using the same config profile that we

99
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.140
specified a similar deployment strategy.

100
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.130
We can quickly identify which version were pushing,

101
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.530
and then I could start that employment for my prod Group of resource is now.

102
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.750
This is a very new tool to systems manager.

103
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.960
It's a really meet one,

104
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.440
so really go through here and check this out and see how it can help you with

105
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.190
your application configuration needs within your AWS accounts.

106
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.680
For now,

107
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.000
we're going to wrap up here and then we'll pick up again with parameter store coming up next.
