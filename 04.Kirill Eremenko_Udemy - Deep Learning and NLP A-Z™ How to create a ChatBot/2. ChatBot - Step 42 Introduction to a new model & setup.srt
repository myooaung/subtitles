Hi everyone and welcome to this new update to our deep learning A.P. atheism course in this update we're

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,660
going to be focusing on a recently released version of the chapter from his course that was created

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,180
by Abraham Sanders.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,040
So with that being said let's take a moment to thank Abraham because it's a great extension with some

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,970
awesome changes and features so to become more familiar with the chapter and the code.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,210
When you get a chance you can find the repository here if we visit the following page.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,770
At good hub dot com slash Abraham Sander's slash set to sec dash Chaput we can see the repository along

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,020
with the associated files and information.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,080
In addition to the files here the files or the folder and containing the files is set to sec Chamba

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,130
will be attached to this lecture.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,840
And you can find other related information useful context including the checkpoints and Waite's file

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,450
interactive options for running it and continuing training instructions within the repository.

13
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,060
So when you get the chance scroll through it it is a great way to familiarize yourself with the information.

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,350
And for the purpose of these lectures we're going to be examining a few changes in the code along with

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,570
some relevant useful information.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,490
And at the end of the lectures we will look at how to visualize the intenser board and we will experiment

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,760
with the chap while running it and testing some of the commands.

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,950
Overall going through this code and this update is intended to help give you some ideas so that you'll

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,350
be able to incorporate some new features to your chat bots or help in the future if you decide to extend

20
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,190
the algorithm.

21
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,390
And you're also going to be able to train and chat with a new model.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,650
But for now let's get everything set up that we need in order to run this version in the model we need

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,390
to upgrade our tensor of low by running the following command.

24
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,870
So we can launch the terminal and if you were working with a virtual platform or a container environment

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,670
such as the one we created in the course you will have to activate it first.

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,650
So if you're on a Mac or Linux you will use the source activate Shambat command.

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,420
If you are on Windows you will use the Activate chap on command.

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,210
Now I'm just gonna install it in my root directory here.

29
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,650
We will run those first.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:27,300
If you are working with the Chaput platform so we want to run Pipp install upgrade tents or float and

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,450
I already have it installed so it will come back with a requirement already installed.

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,270
But we need to upgrade our tender flow for this model and we also need to install Jason Pickel and we'll

33
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,600
be using the same command.

34
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,580
The Pipp install upgrade Jaison pic will run

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,890
all right so we have everything set up and now we can get started.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,920
If you get the chance I'd recommend again taking a look around the repository.

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,770
Since it has some very useful information for running the japa along with some of the information related

38
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,800
to the arguments and parameters and methods that were passed in and built into this chap but with that

39
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,150
we can wrap this up and I will see you in the next video.
