00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.060
Hayes welcome to this tutorial and let's do the final step before the big training step.

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.810
That is before the big training for loop.

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.510
So this final step is to split the questions and answers into the training and validation sets.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.210
So I'm saying sets because we're going to make basically a set for the training questions a set for

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.880
the training answers then a set for the validation questions and the set for the validation answers.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.330
And for those of you who see Krust edition for the first time well I remind that it is a technique that

7
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:43.810
consists of during the training keeping 10 or 15 percent of the training data aside which won't be used

8
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.710
to train the neural network that is which would be basically back propagate it.

9
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.230
And just to keep track of the predictive power of the model on these observations are like new observations.

10
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.940
So basically we're just testing the model on the side.

11
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.380
But during the training just to keep track of what it's capable to do on new observations.

12
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.380
And so this validation set that we have to make for both the questions and answers is exactly this 10

13
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.120
or 15 percent of the data on the site.

14
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.950
So let's apply cross-validation and that consist exactly of splitting the questions and answers into

15
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.970
four sets the training and validation sets.

16
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.000
So let's do it.

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.210
The first step we need to do is to get the index that will separate the First 50 percent questions of

18
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.960
all our questions and the next 85 percent of questions of all questions.

19
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.310
So basically we're finding the index that will split the first 50 percent questions and the last question

20
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.250
and we're going to call this index training validation split.

21
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.020
All right.

22
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.680
And how are we going to get this index.

23
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.830
Well that's pretty simple.

24
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.920
First this index is an integer.

25
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.120
I'm going to use the int function to make sure we have an integer and then inside this function will

26
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.760
basically do a simple operation that will basically multiply the total number of questions we have.

27
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.450
By 15 percent.

28
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.070
But then we'll probably get a float.

29
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.310
And that's why we have to use this function to make sure we have an integer because an index is always

30
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.090
an integer.

31
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.610
All right.

32
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.560
Let's make that simple operation we need to take the total number of questions we have.

33
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:33.360
And actually we're going to use our sordid clean questions list we made in part one data processing.

34
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.510
Remember there was the last step of the preparation of our questions.

35
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.760
That was the last update of the questions.

36
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.490
Basically these are all the questions all cleaned and sorted by the length of the questions and gathering

37
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.840
two sequences of unique encoding integers.

38
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.760
And so we're going to use this which contains the whole list of encoded questions we are going to use

39
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.220
this to get the total number of questions that we're going to multiply by 15 percent so that we get

40
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.320
this index of the split between the validation set and the training set.

41
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.870
All right so let's get this the total number of elements in selecting questions which we can get by

42
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.190
taking the len function of these sordid clean questions.

43
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.700
All right so that's the total number of questions basically and this we are going to multiply by 15

44
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.320
percent.

45
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.920
That is on point 15.

46
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.510
All right.

47
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.570
And that will give us the index splitting the first 15 percent of the questions and the last 85 percent

48
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.730
of the questions all right now that we have this index.

49
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.630
Well this is going to be very easy.

50
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.640
We'll get our training questions our training answers our validation questions and our validation answers

51
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.120
and to get them will take of course our sort of questions for the trainings that will go from this training

52
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.970
validation split index up to the end and for the validation that we'll go from the beginning up to this

53
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.390
training validation spit index and then to get the training and validation answers we'll take the Salten

54
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.180
answers list and to get the training answer as well same We'll take all the answers from this and direct

55
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.160
them to the end and to get validation answers will take all the answers from the beginning up to this

56
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.820
index.

57
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.950
So let's do it.

58
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.380
Let's start with our training questions.

59
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.990
Training questions.

60
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.360
And so now we're going to take our sordid clean questions and to get what we want.

61
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.610
Well what we need to get exactly is that 85 percent last questions of this whole list of Salten questions

62
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.990
and to get this we need to get all the indexes from the training validation split index.

63
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.550
So I'm copying that here.

64
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.330
Up to the net and a trick to take it up to the end it's just had this come in here and then nothing

65
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.650
that will take all the questions from this index up to the end in the whole list of Salten questions.

66
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880
All right and I'm going to copy this because the rest is going to be quite the same.

67
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.660
Then we're going to get the training answers therefore we're placing here questions by answers.

68
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.210
All right.

69
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.690
And then same here as well we're going to get our trending answers from the sordid clean answers a whole

70
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.810
list of answers.

71
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.580
And same to get the training answers we're taking all the answers and the sorting answers list from

72
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.040
the training validation split index up to the end.

73
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.860
All right.

74
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:37.330
And now I'm going to copy these two lines because we're going to do the same for our validation questions

75
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.790
and our validation answers and so we'll just have a few things to place here.

76
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.160
First training by validation same here training by validation.

77
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.870
Then here we keep to selecting questions and the short answers because basically we just have to take

78
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.710
some other indexes which are complimentary indexes.

79
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.210
Starting from the beginning.

80
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.440
Therefore I'm cutting this up too.

81
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.160
Well this same training validation split index and since our validation questions are from the beginning

82
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.110
up to 15 first person questions.

83
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.530
Well we have to go from the beginning up to this training validation split index and therefore when

84
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.020
I'm going to do now is just copy this because it's going to be the same for our answers we of course

85
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.750
need to keep the right answers aligned with their questions.

86
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.610
Otherwise the dataset will not make any sense.

87
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.800
And there we go.

88
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.020
Now we have our training questions our training answers our validation questions and our validation

89
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.650
answers.

90
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.980
And so that's wonderful because basically there you go.

91
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.700
We are ready to start the big training for loop.

92
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.920
I'm super excited to start but I'll have to take a nap because I'm going to need a lot of energy for

93
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.860
this and also some chocolate.

94
00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.800
But as soon as I get that I will start recording the biggest total of discours which is the training.

95
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.910
I can't wait to start.

96
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.820
I'm going to select this and execute.

97
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.370
And now we have our training questions training answers validation questions validation answers.

98
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.310
So we're more than ready to start the training until then Id been on P.
