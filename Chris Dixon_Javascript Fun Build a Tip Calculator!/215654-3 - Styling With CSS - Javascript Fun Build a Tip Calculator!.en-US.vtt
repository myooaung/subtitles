00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.760
Moving on from our HTML,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.960
we're now going to make our project look and feel a lot nicer,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.545
and we're going to do this by applying some CSS.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.780
The first thing we need to do if we open over

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
this sidebar is to create a new file, our styles.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm going to call mine the styles.css,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.190
and then we can link this in the index.html.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.970
We do this about the top inside of the head section using needed link element.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.415
This is a relationship to a stylesheet,

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:36.800
so this is fine, and the href is the location of this file.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.510
This file is contained alongside this index page so we

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.405
can simply reference this with the name of styles.css.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.260
Back over to our stylesheet,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.780
we can begin with the HTML element,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.310
which is the root of our project.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.725
I'm going to start off by declaring the font-size to be a value of 10 pixels.

00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:59.315
Now, this value is completely optional,

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:02.060
just as is all these CSS which we're going to add.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.639
You can make it your own, you can change values

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.820
to make it look and feel exactly how we wanted to.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.610
Now the reason I've selected at 10 pixels for

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.220
the root project size is because it's

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.030
a nice rounded number and we can use the rem values.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.840
The scale is up and down really easily.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.380
For example, if we create a value of padding as one rem,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.155
this will be a value of 10 pixels.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.570
If we want this to be 16 pixels,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.565
this will be 1.6 rems,

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:36.820
so rounded value makes things nice and easy when scaling up and down.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.305
Next, we'll set the value of the color.

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:42.980
This is going to be the color of our text.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.725
The color I'm going to select is 4e4d4d.

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:51.105
Let's check this out and test if this is working.

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:54.315
Save the file, reload the browser,

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.830
I'm going to see the styles have now taken effect.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.495
We're going to open up the split view inside of Visual Studio Code,

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:07.150
so you can see both the index page and also the styles alongside.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.419
The next element which I'm going to style is the main container.

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.760
If you remember from the last video,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.335
we surrounded all of the tip calculator in this main section.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.680
This is going to be our main wrapper.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.095
We can set the maximum width of the tip calculator to be 50 rem.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:31.100
Remember since we've set the root font-size to be 10 pixels,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.040
50 times 10 will make this the equivalent of 500 pixels.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.635
We can also center this by using the margin zero auto.

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:43.500
This will apply zero margin on the top and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.230
bottom and divide up the rest of the space on the left and right equally.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.590
Save and refresh, and this has now placed

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.595
an equal amount of white space on the left as it is on the right.

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:59.075
But just to give this some spacing from the very top of the page,

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:05.170
we can change this value to be two rems to give us 20 pixels margin.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.285
Next up, we can set the background color.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.020
We can set this as a regular solid background color,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.255
or I'm going to set mine to take advantage of the linear gradients.

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.340
This linear gradient will allow us to transition from

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.730
one color to another in a straight line.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.089
Let's make some space,

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.465
apply the linear gradient,

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:31.595
and then we can add two values which you want to transition between.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:36.660
The first value which I'm going to add is a value of 3dc0c0,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.720
separated by a comma our second value is 5bceae.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.205
If we save this, we should see the main section

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:53.100
now has a transition from one shade to another.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.430
By default, these colors will transition vertically from top to bottom.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.550
We can also change the angle as the first value.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.465
I want to change mine to be 30 degrees.

00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:07.970
Refresh, this now changes our gradient from

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.695
vertical to go across the page at an angle of 30 degrees.

00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:16.689
After our background, we can also add some padding values,

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.045
and inside here I'm going to add four different values.

00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:23.910
So three rem, 1.6 rem,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.290
six, and then finally, 1.6 rems.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.775
These four values of padding will appear on the top,

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.965
right, bottom, and left.

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:37.185
Let's save and refresh the browser,

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:40.885
leaving this with some space in around the edges.

00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:46.150
Next, the border-radius, and I'm going to add this as a value of four rems.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.435
This is going to be pretty large,

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:52.525
and this will apply to all four sides of our tip calculator.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:55.880
To give this tip calculator the impression of a little depth,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.875
we can also add a box-shadow.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:03.510
I'm going to add a box-shadow to the very bottom of our surrounding main section.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.445
This box-shadow is going to take in four different values.

00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:10.855
The first one is the x position,

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:12.459
we have the y position,

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.335
we have the value of the blur,

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:16.800
and then also the color to apply.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.715
If we go over to the Mozilla website,

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.890
this has a box-shadow generator,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.505
so we can better see what is going on.

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:28.025
At the moment, we just have a simple element with a border.

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.930
If we add a box-shadow,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.515
we can then play around with the x and y values.

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:37.925
The x-axis is the value from left to right or across the page.

00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:40.720
Only y value is up and down.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.920
Currently, the x value is five pixels,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.270
so this means this is pushed over from five pixels.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
We can also set this to be negative five,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.215
and this will place these five pixels to the left.

00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:56.205
On the y-axis which is up and down,

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:58.620
this is a value of negative five,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.034
we changed this to be positive,

00:06:01.034 --> 00:06:03.470
this will then appear down at the bottom.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.120
We can also change the colors,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.885
we can change the blur values and make this really big.

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:12.305
But for our example we're just going to make this pretty subtle,

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.445
so we're going to stick with some small values.

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.050
The first value which is on the x-axis,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.510
I'm going to set this as zero so it

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.825
doesn't push over from the left or the right-hand side.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:26.630
The second value is two pixels,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.005
so this will appear at the bottom of our element.

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:32.645
Next to it we have the value of the blur.

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:35.120
Again, this is going to be pretty small,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.560
and then also a pretty light and subtle color of light gray.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.100
Back to our project,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.725
refresh the browser and we see a very small box-shadow at the bottom of our main section.

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:55.370
This takes care of the styling for our main section,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.565
and now we I work on the individual elements inside.

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:01.625
Starting at the very top, we have the quick tip,

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:04.580
which is surrounded in the level 1 heading.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.710
Let's target the h1.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.215
We can set the text-align to be in the center.

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:14.630
We also want this to be a little larger so we can set

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.400
this font-size the value of three rem.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.435
Level 1 headings have a default margin which is applied by the browser,

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:28.340
so I'm going to remove this by setting this to be a value of zero.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.230
Just above this level 1 heading,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.600
we'll see there's a lot more space on the top than the bottom.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600
This is because the main surrounding div

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.305
has this padding value of three rem on the very top.

00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:45.360
We can also balance this up inside of our level one heading by

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.955
adding some padding on the bottom also of three rems.

00:07:49.955 --> 00:07:52.720
If we take a look at the final version,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.115
we'll see that each one of our sections also has this white background color.

00:07:57.115 --> 00:08:00.385
We can also target this inside of our CSS,

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:02.995
so let's grab the section element,

00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:06.860
and we can begin with the background color of white.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.740
The font-size, we can set this to be 18 pixels,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.220
which is the equivalent of 1.8 rems.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.750
Save and reload.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.120
There's currently no space in between our two sections,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.250
so we can fix this with some margin on the bottom.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.490
Let's go for 1.6 rems.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.785
In padding, which will give us the spacing inside of our white section,

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:36.295
when working with padding margin if we only had two values,

00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:38.995
the first value will be the top and bottom,

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.795
which I'm going to set as zero,

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:44.385
and the second value will be the left and also the right.

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:47.630
If it's consistent, we'll also add this as 1.6

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:54.170
rems to give us some spacing on the left and right of each of these sections.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.585
A border-radius of one rem,

00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:03.080
and then also a box-shadow to the section 2.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.580
To give this consistent,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.565
we can match our values from before.

00:09:06.565 --> 00:09:09.615
So zero, two pixels,

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:13.915
two pixels blur, and also the color of light gray.

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:16.850
The one difference we saw in this section is we want this to

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.620
appear as though it's inset inside of the main section.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.050
We can add to the value of inset to our box-shadow,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.890
and this will replace the box-shadow inside rather than outside of the element.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.330
If we go back to the Mozilla website we can see this more clearly.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.725
We can click "Inset",

00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:39.980
and also reduce the blur,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.350
and we see this blur is now inside of the element rather than outside like we had before.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.295
Going inside one level deeper from all sections,

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:56.755
we see that each one of our parts of our tip calculator is surrounded in a div.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.650
We can now target this in the CSS.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:05.590
We want to target all divs which are a direct child of section.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.990
We have the section and then one level in,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.245
and we have this div, then we have this div.

00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:15.790
All the styling will apply to these first divs nested inside.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:20.200
For example, this one which we see here is one level further in.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.630
So this won't apply to the section.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.980
If we did want the styling to apply to all of our divs inside the section,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.800
we would do the CSS just like this,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.400
but we only want to select the direct children.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.430
All we're going to do here is to add some padding values

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.175
of 1.6 rems on the top and bottom,

00:10:39.175 --> 00:10:41.830
and zero on the left and right.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.180
This is going to give us the spacing around each one of these sections.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.400
Next, let's add some styling to our bill section at the top of our first section.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.830
To do this, we can add a class to this wrapper of bill,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.160
and then we can target this in the CSS.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.340
Since it is a class, we use the dot,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.290
so.bill, and we're going to make use of the CSS flexbox.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.200
We do this by first setting the wrapper to have

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.460
the display type of flex, save and refresh.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.530
We don't see any difference just yet,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.600
but we can also now use this display of

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.905
flex to apply styling to these children nested inside.

00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:29.080
Nested inside will have the label and also the input with the type and number.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.795
Let's begin with the label.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:35.290
So.bill and the label.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.980
This will target the label inside of our bill section.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.110
Since we're using the flexbox,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.900
we can set a flex value of one,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.015
and then just below this,

00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:48.979
we can target the bill input,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.870
and give this a flex value of three.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.105
Save and reload.

00:11:55.105 --> 00:12:00.925
This now means that the input will take up three times the available space as our label.

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:05.875
Next, let's add some styling to this inputs with the type of number.

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:07.930
Remember, inside of our HTML,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.000
we have various different inputs.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.535
We have this one here, we have our range,

00:12:12.535 --> 00:12:15.500
and also the range down at the bottom too.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:21.705
How do we be more specific with the type of input which you want to apply styling to?

00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:26.280
Well, we can do this inside of these square brackets by selecting the type.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.825
Only type which we want to target is the number.

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:32.770
This will mean that the style which we add inside

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.535
these curly braces will only apply to our number inputs,

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.530
rather than our range just below.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.690
First of all, let's set the background color.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.860
The value I'm going to use is f4f4f5.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.590
The font size to make this a little larger,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.720
1.6 rems, which is equivalent of 16 pixels.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.389
The border, we can set the thickness to be one pixel,

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:03.950
the line to be solid,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.270
and let's give this a light gray color.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.890
We can also round the corners by applying

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:18.220
some border radius of 0.5 rems, some padding, and again,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.080
I want to add four different values,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.735
so 0.8 rems on the top,

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.910
zero on the right,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.925
0.8 also on the bottom,

00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:31.315
and 0.8 rem on the left.

00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:35.980
Reload the browser, and this will give us equal spacing on the top,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.565
left and bottom, and zero on the right-hand side.

00:13:39.565 --> 00:13:41.860
Now our input is a little taller,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.595
we'll now see a problem lining this up with the bill.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.755
If you look at the final version,

00:13:47.755 --> 00:13:52.255
this is also going to be lined up in the center line of our input.

00:13:52.255 --> 00:13:56.395
Well, since we set the section to have the display type of flex,

00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:01.735
we can easily fix this by adding a flex property called align-self,

00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:04.570
set this to be the center.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.095
This now lines up with the center line of our input.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:12.370
Next up, we're going to add a box shadow just like on the finished version.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.410
To match up with our surrounding section,

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.270
we're also going to set this to be inset.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.395
Also making use of the same values as earlier.

00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:25.510
The box shadow is going to be inset.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.635
The x and y values are going to be zero and two pixels,

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.270
a two pixel blur,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.580
followed by the color of light gray.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.875
Next up, if we take a look at our final version,

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.660
we see that each one of our sections,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.655
such as the tip and the value,

00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:46.135
is based out on each side of our calculator.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.450
This also applies for the total section,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.790
the tip, and also the value,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.820
and also these values down at the bottom too.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.220
The way we can create the spacing is also by taking advantage of the flexbox.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.300
The flexbox has a property called justify-content,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.785
where we can set the space to be between both of these elements.

00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:13.135
To do this, we need to target multiple sections of our HTML,

00:15:13.135 --> 00:15:15.760
so we can add a class to each one of these.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.410
The first one is going to be the select tip label and the value.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.695
Let's take a look for this in our HTML.

00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:26.590
This is the section just here.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.720
Let's add a class.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.765
Let's go for space-between.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:35.680
Copy this and we can reuse this in multiple places.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.365
We also need to add this to the tip section,

00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:43.420
and also the total section where we have two values on the same line.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:49.435
The tip wrapper, the wrapper for our total section,

00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:54.565
the split, and also the billEach,

00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:57.505
and tipEach sections down at the bottom.

00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:01.820
Now in the CSS, we can target this space-between,

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.910
set the display type to be flex.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.025
Now if we select justify-content,

00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:15.590
we can apply all of these space to be between.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.910
Save and reload.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.795
Now instead of having the text and values alongside each other,

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:25.750
these now have our space in between.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.390
Just to round off the CSS for this video,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.510
we're going to make our total section a little bolder.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.125
We can do this by adding a class to our total section.

00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:39.260
Just after space-between, we can add a second class,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.800
wrap this in the CSS.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.550
Let's first set the font size to be two rems,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.020
and also set the font-weight be bolder.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.905
Reload, we now have this larger bolder text.

00:16:59.905 --> 00:17:04.045
This now leaves us with the main CSS done for this project.

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.860
However, in the next video,

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.375
we're going to continue on,

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:10.150
and add a few more nice finishing touches.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.135
For example, we're going to include a different font.

00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:16.735
We're also going to make our own custom range slider,

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.985
rather than using the browser default,

00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:21.200
which we currently see here.
