00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.415
This section is all about creating our Tip Calculator.

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:11.320
This is going to be the final version which we're going to be building in this section.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.265
The user can enter a bill inside the input field up at the top.

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:19.410
Then just below we can add the tip percentage,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.450
which we want to add to this bill.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.940
For example, let's go for 20 percent and

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.535
all of the rest of the values are updated dynamically.

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.960
Just below, we have the tip value and this is also

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.860
added to the total bill to give us the total to pay.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340
Below this, we also have a separate section which is going to allow

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.135
the user to split the bill between multiple people.

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:46.499
At the moment, we only have this as one person,

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.870
so all the values are the same.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.195
If we want this to be divided between two people,

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:57.425
the values are halved and we see exactly how much each user needs to pay.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:03.835
This first video is going to be focused on creating the user interface by using HTML.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.350
In the upcoming videos,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.685
we're going to add some styling and layout with CSS,

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:12.175
and then we'll move on to the workings and calculations,

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:16.915
and also make the user interface dynamic by using JavaScript.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:20.140
Let's begin by creating a new folder.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.170
I'm going to add mine onto the desktop and call this the tip calculator.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.460
You can also organize this inside of a project folder if you prefer,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.215
but I'm just going to begin by dragging over this project folder into Visual Studio Code.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:44.070
The first thing we need is a Index page which will contain the HTML.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.720
Inside of the project,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.595
create a new file.

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:51.345
I'm going to call this the index.html,

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:55.250
and we can also close down the sidebar for more space.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.540
Visual Studio Code comes complete with a plugin called Emmet,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.760
which will allow us to add shortcuts to create our HTML structure.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.515
For example, we can add HTML column 5,

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:12.350
hit "Enter", and this will give us a starting point for our project.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.210
It simply includes all of the metadata which we'll commonly add,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.510
such as the viewport meta tag and also the character set which we're using.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.240
The title up at the top,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.130
I'm going to call mine Quick Tip,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.285
and then we can get to work by creating our content inside of the body section.

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:35.800
We can wrap all of these Tip Calculator inside of the main tags,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.765
followed by a level 1 heading which is going to be the title of our project.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:44.745
Save this file, and now if we right-click,

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:49.605
copy the path, paste this in the browser,

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:52.695
this is now the link to our project.

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:58.265
You can also go into the project folder and double click on the "Index.html",

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:02.070
which will also open this up in the default browser.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.420
What we're going to do next is go through all of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.420
the available sections from top to bottom.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.380
We're going to create this white section up at the top which is going to be

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.255
for the user inputs such as the bill and the tip amount,

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:20.220
we'll add certain divs which you're going to wrap all of these elements,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.635
and then we'll add our second section down at the bottom.

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:27.195
Below the level 1 heading we can add our first section,

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.909
inside here we'll add our first div,

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.000
which is for our first section which includes

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.755
the label of bill and also the number input.

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.940
Let's include this. Now, we have our div.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.340
This will have a label called Bill, our input.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.755
Now, since this is going to be a number input,

00:03:46.755 --> 00:03:49.545
we can give this a type of number.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:52.820
We can also add the placeholder attribute,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.370
which is going to be the text of your bill.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.130
This will be the value which is displayed inside of

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.750
the inputs if no number has been added,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.265
followed by a unique ID which is going to be your bill.

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:09.510
This will allow us to target this input with

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.655
JavaScript so we can grab the value which the user has entered.

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:19.325
We can also link this to our label by adding the same name for attribute.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.020
This will mean if we save this and go over to the browser,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.285
each time we click on the label,

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:28.145
this will also activate our number input.

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:31.990
Moving down, we also have a range slider which is just here.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.135
This is going to have a section which is going to wrap

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:39.665
both the inputs and also the label and also the percentage.

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:41.810
Let's add this now as a div,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.695
and then we can add a new div nested inside.

00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:49.865
This is going to be for the top row of the label and percentage.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:56.970
The label will have the label elements and the value of select tip.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.430
Just after this, we'll create a span element and give this

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.925
a ID so we can target this from our JavaScript.

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.450
We can call this the tipPercent.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.944
Later on, we'll populate the contents of this using JavaScript.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.640
For now we'll just add this as

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.424
zero percent so we can see how this looks in our user interface.

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:23.300
Just after the surrounding div we can then create our input,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.530
and this is going to be a type of range.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.539
This will give us this range slider which we'll see in the final version,

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.665
although it may look a little bit different at the moment.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:36.350
We can set the initial value,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.990
we want this to begin at zero percent followed by a ID of tipInput.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.095
Again, we can use this for the label.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:51.080
This will also be used with JavaScript later on to grab the tip value.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.695
Let's save this and see how this looks over in the browser.

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:57.110
The structure is there, we have the label,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.639
we have the percentage,

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.910
and also the range slider.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.080
This obviously looks a lot different than

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.535
our finished version but we'll fix this with CSS very soon.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:12.935
Moving down if we go back to the finished version we next need a tip section.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.630
This is going to be pretty simple.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.530
We have the label and also the value on the right-hand side.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.930
We'll have a horizontal rule,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.415
and then a section which is going to be for the total.

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:29.360
Let's first create this tip section just below our last div.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.615
Create a new div for this section,

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:35.795
a span with the value of tip,

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:42.715
followed by an empty span with the ID which is going to be equal to tipValue.

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:47.570
This will allow us to later on grab this elements by the ID,

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.910
and then place a value inside.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.480
After this a horizontal rule to create our line,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.680
and then the final section down at the bottom.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.670
Add our div as a wrapper,

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.945
the span with the text of total.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:09.920
Then just like above we'll add a empty span which is going to be updated with JavaScript.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.415
The value is going to be the total which includes a tip.

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:16.500
We'll call this totalWithTip.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.010
This is now all of the elements in place for our first section,

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.670
if we reload the browser these are all now in place.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.180
The next thing to do is to move down to the final section which is to split the bill.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.750
Just below our closing tag for this section,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.215
let's create a new section.

00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:42.325
The first round in div is going to be for the split input.

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.125
This section just here.

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.825
Just like we did with the tip value up at the top,

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:51.695
we'll create a div which will contain the label and also the number of people.

00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:54.990
We'll then follow this with a range slider.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.810
The div for the text,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.980
this will have the label with the text of split.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:10.100
Next to this we'll add an inline span with the ID of splitValue.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.640
This will be updated with the value of one person.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.235
As this increases, this will be two people,

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:20.600
three people, and so on.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.315
Just below this div section we can then create the input.

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:27.675
Just like above this we'll have the type of range.

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:31.900
We can also restrict the values inside of this range input.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.845
To begin, we want to create the minimum value of one.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.600
This is because is always going to be a minimum of

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.455
one person which the bill is going to be split between.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.555
We can set a max value.

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:46.895
This can be any value which you prefer.

00:08:46.895 --> 00:08:52.430
I'm going to go for 10 and set the initial default value to be one.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.890
This also needs a unique ID.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:01.055
I'm going to call this the splitInput which we can also match with the label.

00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:03.275
Let's check if this is all working,

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:07.445
refresh the browser, and we have a new range input.

00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:11.420
You can also add a default value into here if you prefer.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.030
So one person and we'll see this inside the browser.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.210
Next up, we have two more simple sections at the bottom which is

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.740
a simple div with the label and also the values on the right.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.810
The first div, this is going to have a span with the value of bill each,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.750
also followed by an empty span with the ID of billEach.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.245
The final section at the bottom is the tip each and also the value.

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:48.170
Create a new div, the span with the text of tip each,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.620
followed by an empty span with the ID which is going to be equal to tipEach.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.640
Save our index.html file and this is now all of the HTML content which we need.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.615
Reload the browser and everything is now in place.

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:11.495
Obviously, our Tip Calculator doesn't look anything like the final version at the moment,

00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:17.030
but we'll begin to fix this in the next video where we'll apply some CSS.
