00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.115
Hey, welcome to this class.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.680
If you are a web development beginner and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.595
want to just jump in and build some fun projects,

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:18.835
you've came to the right place.

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.730
The idea behind this series is to show you what you can do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.540
with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.820
We're not going to be using any frameworks,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.545
any boilerplate, any libraries, or any templates.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:35.970
Instead, we're going to be building everything completely from scratch,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.060
step by step, to show you how these free technologies all work together.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.920
This class' project is going to be a tip calculator application.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.910
The user can enter any value or the total bill into the top input field.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.775
We can then select a percentage or the tip,

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.335
which they want to add on,

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.255
and then this will automatically recalculates all of the values.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:05.000
You will see the total value of the tip which is being calculated,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.605
and then this is also added to the total bill too.

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:11.990
If they would like and they want to split the bill between multiple people,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.590
we'll have this range slider here too.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.605
Then we can split the bill between multiple people.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:21.200
This will then recalculate the total bill per person,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.355
and also the tip value per person too.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.910
This project will be built completely from scratch.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.065
We'll create the user interface using HTML.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.445
We'll move on to adding styling with CSS.

00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:37.565
Along with looking at how to add these fully custom range [inaudible] too.

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.550
We'll look at font, browser prefixes,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.785
and then move on to making our application fully interactive using JavaScript.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.865
You'll learn about functions, math, events,

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:51.755
all [inaudible] currency values, reading,

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.165
and updating the DOM,

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:54.900
and so much more.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.720
This project has been designed for beginners,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680
and it's ideal for somebody with just a little HTML,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.350
CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.005
I'm excited to teach you this class,

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.060
and I'll see you in the first lesson.
