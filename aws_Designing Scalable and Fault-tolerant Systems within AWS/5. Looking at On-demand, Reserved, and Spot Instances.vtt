00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.280
[Autogenerated] All right, let's dive into E C.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.140
Two instance types.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.090
So this is where we're going to learn the optimal usage for

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.240
different instance types that are available to us.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.200
Now there's three main types of instances.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.070
The first is on demand.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.450
Now on demand is the typical E.

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.660
C.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.410
Two instance that you spin up when you create one in the console you pay per

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.640
use so you pay for what you're running here on the compute,

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.740
and it's always available to you to spend up,

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.670
in instance, and then tear down when you want.

13
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.290
The next option is reserved and reserved.

14
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.340
Instances allow us to save money by committing to a

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.760
guaranteed usage rate for different terms and will demo

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.850
that in the consul here in a bit, the last one is a spot.

17
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.580
Instance.

18
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.980
Now a spot instance is extra capacity within a W s that

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.240
can be terminated at any point in time.

20
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.250
When a W s needs to pull that excess capacity back into another customer that's

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.270
running an on demand or reserved instance type so workloads on spot should be

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.540
treated differently than reserved and on demand.

23
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.420
Now let's go ahead and dive into our demos.

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
Firstly, we're going to launch different E C two instances.

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.640
Well, look at launching a spot instance in the process for that.

26
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.140
Well, look it on demand, which you're more than likely already familiar with.

27
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.940
And then we'll walk through the reserved instance purchase process

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:54.000
within the consul so we can see how that's done as well. Let's go ahead in here and then we'll pick up in the console in the next clip.
