[Autogenerated] Hello.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,520
My name is Andrew Estes and welcome to my course designing,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,740
scalable in fault tolerant systems within a W s.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,050
I am an enterprise cloud architect at CSG International as well as founder of

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,350
quick to cloud reliability and performance efficiency or two of the five

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,680
pillars that make up the well-architected framework.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,100
This course is going to cover a range of topics that help

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,140
you meet the guidelines for both pillars.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,040
In this course,

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,510
we're going to look at implementing resilient systems

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,220
by using auto scaling technologies,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,950
multi ese implementations and A W s content delivery network service is

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,730
some of the major topics that we're going to cover include designing

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,970
stateless architectures within A W s understanding auto Skilling groups

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,030
and multi ese implementations with load balancers using cloudfront to

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,080
serve as a CD en for applications.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,710
And then we'll leverage Route 53 for advanced

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,090
routing policies and health checks.

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,060
By the end of this course,

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,590
you're going to know how to design and implement a resilient

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,590
architecture for any system within AWS.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,370
Now, before beginning, you should be familiar with the solutions architect,

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,740
associate exam materials,

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,280
and it will be helpful to understand what is tested on for the

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,410
solutions Architect Professional exam as well.

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,980
You need to know the core A W s service is for architecture

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,080
design and you should have a general understanding of

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,540
networking designs and protocols.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,170
From here,

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,990
they're going to feel comfortable diving into other solutions architect,

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,410
professional related prep materials.

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,240
And this includes courses on gaining operational excellence,

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,710
managing A W S operations and any of the other relevant solutions.

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,330
Architect Professional Learning path courses provided by plural site.

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,590
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to implement

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:20,000
a resilient architecture with the designing, scalable in fault tolerant systems within a W s course here in plural site.
