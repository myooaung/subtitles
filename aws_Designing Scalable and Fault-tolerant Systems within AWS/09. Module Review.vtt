00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.660
[Autogenerated] well done.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.440
You've made it through the final module in this portal site courts.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.650
Let's just have a quick wrap up so we can review what

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.840
we learned throughout this module.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.410
Now we looked at what cloudfront is in its multiple use cases,

6
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.550
where we can put it into place and building off.

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.930
Of that,

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.430
we started to look at the security and logging that's based within

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.160
cloudfront and then focusing on the security aspect.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.690
We looked at putting restrictive access into place using cloudfront,

11
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.610
and in addition,

12
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.250
we looked at generating signed You are Wells and how they're used now.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.540
After Cloudfront, we began to look at root for the three concepts,

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
and within Route 53 we looked at health checks and the

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.810
different fail overs that are provided to us.

16
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.800
And then we looked at routing policies specific to traffic.

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.790
So we looked at Leyton Sea based Geo based the different

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.740
policies that are available to us within Route 53.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.550
I mean, that's it.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
So that's the bulk of what we learned throughout this module.

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:16.000
Now in the next clip will have a quick course wrap up in review, and then we'll talk about some of the next steps that you may want to take
