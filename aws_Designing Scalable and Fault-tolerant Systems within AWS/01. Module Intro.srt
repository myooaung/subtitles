00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,870
[Autogenerated] in this module.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:08,240
We're going to start looking at using Cloudfront and Route 33 advanced concepts.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,310
Let's discuss some of learning objectives that we want to cover in this module.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,450
Now,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,560
the first main one is we wanna learn how we can place cloudfront in

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,440
front of distributions within our AWS account.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,290
We're gonna look at generating signed You are l's for access.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,460
And then we're going to discuss de dos attack

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,840
mitigation strategies with cloudfront.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,370
The next major focus point is understanding how we can use advance

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,590
Route 53 configurations within our architectures.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,440
This will touch on routing policies.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,540
It's gonna touch on health checks,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,440
and then it's also gonna look at creating some records.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,920
So just an overview on how we could create different

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,000
records in our account now well, in here and on the next clip will begin diving into cloudfront
