00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:05,880
Learn.

2

00:00:05,880  -->  00:00:09,490
Welcome back to the Python programming course in the historial.

3

00:00:09,500  -->  00:00:18,110
We created a fascinating facet grid which tells us about how audience rating versus critic ratings evolved

4

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:22,170
throughout the years from 2007 to 2011 based on the genre.

5

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:25,330
So we're going to perform some preliminary analytics here.

6

00:00:25,460  -->  00:00:32,190
However before we finalized this report or chart what we do want to is we want to tidy it up so let's

7

00:00:32,190  -->  00:00:33,730
zoom in a bit first.

8

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:40,290
And what specifically I'm talking about is that you can see for example that the access here goes from

9

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:42,030
minus 20 to 120.

10

00:00:42,030  -->  00:00:46,560
It's not really necessary given that ratings can only be from 0 to 100.

11

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:54,900
And same thing for the x axis and also one thing that we are definitely interested in is how the audience

12

00:00:54,900  -->  00:00:57,500
ratings are comparing to critic ratings.

13

00:00:57,500  -->  00:01:02,640
That's that's the reason why we built this chart and what would help us really help us is a diagonal

14

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:08,520
across each one of these parts of the Fassett grid which would show us which would help us very quickly

15

00:01:08,520  -->  00:01:12,350
to visually assess where the dots slide to the line above the diagonal.

16

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:17,520
Or do they live below the diagonal so if they're above the diagonal then the audience gives higher ratings

17

00:01:17,520  -->  00:01:19,650
than the critics if they're below the diagonal.

18

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:22,150
And the critics give higher ratings than the audience.

19

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:25,880
So how do we add or how do we make those changes.

20

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:28,680
Let's go ahead and find out.

21

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:34,220
So we're going to just copy this code here and the top is say.

22

00:01:34,310  -->  00:01:40,640
Say controlling axes and adding diagonals.

23

00:01:40,650  -->  00:01:42,820
All right so how are we going to do this.

24

00:01:43,080  -->  00:01:52,620
Well the first thing that we want to do is we want to say let's set the limits for our x and y axis

25

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:57,930
we'll say gee Daut set X slim equals.

26

00:01:57,930  -->  00:02:01,010
So here in a tuple you say zero to 100.

27

00:02:01,140  -->  00:02:02,980
And while him he calls.

28

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:03,650
Same thing.

29

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:09,600
Zero to 100 for on that and give it a second for me.

30

00:02:09,600  -->  00:02:10,740
There you go.

31

00:02:10,740  -->  00:02:17,100
So now what you can see is that they are from 0 to 100 and 0 to 100 here as well.

32

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:18,090
So that's the first step.

33

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:19,380
That's a good thing.

34

00:02:19,500  -->  00:02:21,030
Raggles is going to be a bit trickier.

35

00:02:21,030  -->  00:02:27,000
We have to iterate and we have to go through each one of these and add a diagonal to each one of these

36

00:02:27,010  -->  00:02:27,270
.

37

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:33,810
And once again another example of us having to use loops because Python isn't a vectorize programming

38

00:02:33,810  -->  00:02:38,310
language unlike our in our you rarely use loops in Python.

39

00:02:38,310  -->  00:02:40,960
As you've noticed we've used them for a couple of times.

40

00:02:41,130  -->  00:02:49,390
So you get a greater loop and we're going to iterate over g Daut hak says we're axes Daut flat.

41

00:02:49,710  -->  00:02:52,940
Let's start off our axes What does that axes do.

42

00:02:53,100  -->  00:03:01,050
Cheater axes is an aere of the subplots or all of the elements of the five faceted grid that we are

43

00:03:01,110  -->  00:03:06,900
working with for an area of an area object or presents a multidimensional homogeneous array of fixed

44

00:03:06,900  -->  00:03:08,550
size items and so on.

45

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:15,750
So basically we actually that are irrelevant or the main point is that it's an ashtray which represents

46

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:18,540
each one which contains each one of these.

47

00:03:18,750  -->  00:03:24,810
And now what we can do on top of that is we can say Daut flat and what it will do is will flatten out

48

00:03:24,810  -->  00:03:25,170
the array.

49

00:03:25,170  -->  00:03:31,490
So if you just press a shift explain it as well so flat iterator object to trade over areas.

50

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:35,340
So basically what it'll do is it'll iterate over the area.

51

00:03:35,370  -->  00:03:41,010
Even though this is a two dimensional array Woodell it will do is Ill iterate over it as if it was just

52

00:03:41,010  -->  00:03:42,170
a simple list.

53

00:03:42,300  -->  00:03:44,280
And there's going to be easier for us.

54

00:03:44,330  -->  00:03:50,040
And that's exactly what we want so that we don't have to think about the two dimensionality of this

55

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:51,710
object or iterating over.

56

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:55,730
I know it can sound a bit complex but basically what we're doing is we're taking G.

57

00:03:55,800  -->  00:04:02,190
We're using ADOT axes to access all of these elements of the Fassett grid or all of these little plots

58

00:04:02,640  -->  00:04:09,110
and then we're using flat to flatten out this area that we have so that we can iterate over it.

59

00:04:09,120  -->  00:04:11,820
We're using this variable in a simple matter.

60

00:04:12,090  -->  00:04:19,380
And so now we're going to say X dot plot and we're going to plot a line onto each one of these.

61

00:04:19,380  -->  00:04:30,900
So let's just for fun say 20 to 60 and that's the x axis and then here we'll say 20 to 60 as well.

62

00:04:31,080  -->  00:04:33,820
That's the y axis and let's have a look at that.

63

00:04:33,930  -->  00:04:36,460
See how that just works out for us.

64

00:04:36,540  -->  00:04:41,120
You can see that's a line from 20 to 60 on both axes on x and y.

65

00:04:41,610  -->  00:04:44,010
And now we're going to actually replace it with the one we want.

66

00:04:44,010  -->  00:04:47,250
From 0 to 100 0 to 100.

67

00:04:47,250  -->  00:04:53,640
And as you can see it's a blue line we're going to replace the caliber of see he calls gray and then

68

00:04:53,730  -->  00:04:58,410
line style We're going to just do dash dash dash line.

69

00:04:58,740  -->  00:05:05,240
So if you're on this now you can see that we've got that dashed line and it does definitely simplify

70

00:05:05,240  -->  00:05:06,190
our analysis.

71

00:05:06,300  -->  00:05:10,230
We can much easier to understand where exactly the dotted lines are right away.

72

00:05:10,230  -->  00:05:17,250
Here you can see that in 2009 in the genre of action the audience gave much better ratings and the critics

73

00:05:17,640  -->  00:05:18,510
overall.

74

00:05:18,510  -->  00:05:20,250
So each one of these dots is a movie.

75

00:05:20,250  -->  00:05:25,200
And here you can see that whenever dot is above the diagonal It means that audience rating for that

76

00:05:25,200  -->  00:05:28,210
movie was greater than the critic creating.

77

00:05:28,230  -->  00:05:31,320
Very interesting if we can find an opposite situation.

78

00:05:31,320  -->  00:05:37,790
So in this scenario for instance in a drama or in 2011 looks like the critics were more prone to give

79

00:05:37,790  -->  00:05:38,970
better ratings.

80

00:05:38,970  -->  00:05:44,670
And the same thing and Thriller in 2011 critics gave better ratings and then the audience especially

81

00:05:44,670  -->  00:05:52,460
in the higher numbers and 60s 80s and hundred or close to 100 out of 100 in the lower spectrum.

82

00:05:52,500  -->  00:05:58,170
The audience gave better ratings so it's definitely a very convenient very simple tool but a very convenient

83

00:05:58,170  -->  00:06:02,670
tool just a diagonal that helps us analyze these charts better.

84

00:06:02,910  -->  00:06:04,780
And just as a quick bonus.

85

00:06:04,950  -->  00:06:11,010
One more thing I wanted to show you how to add to this plot since you've powered through these tutorials

86

00:06:11,040  -->  00:06:12,760
and you're all here.

87

00:06:12,810  -->  00:06:13,840
How do we add age.

88

00:06:13,920  -->  00:06:14,790
A legend.

89

00:06:14,850  -->  00:06:18,250
It's very simple just say Gee Dot add legend.

90

00:06:18,270  -->  00:06:19,580
I know it can be complex.

91

00:06:19,650  -->  00:06:21,200
It can be a bit confusing sometimes.

92

00:06:21,200  -->  00:06:24,470
So for instance why is it add legend and not just legend.

93

00:06:24,470  -->  00:06:27,060
We've we've already seen that type of use case.

94

00:06:27,360  -->  00:06:35,040
And also why is it seen at color like there is sometimes you find that there isn't consistency throughout

95

00:06:35,340  -->  00:06:40,730
but these are just things that with time you'll either remember or at the point where you need to use

96

00:06:40,730  -->  00:06:44,570
a search function you'll just look it up and very quickly get the hang of it.

97

00:06:44,820  -->  00:06:45,690
So there we go.

98

00:06:45,720  -->  00:06:47,670
We've added a legend as you can see over there.

99

00:06:47,670  -->  00:06:54,710
So it may seem a bit blurry or not crisp if I zoom out it will become better right away.

100

00:06:54,720  -->  00:06:55,460
So there we go.

101

00:06:55,470  -->  00:07:03,690
The chart is much more crisp and on its own this whole chart is you can just drag it like an image and

102

00:07:03,750  -->  00:07:06,550
it can act as a whole report on its own.

103

00:07:06,570  -->  00:07:10,910
You can spend at least half an hour just analyzing this if not longer.

104

00:07:10,920  -->  00:07:15,180
It's a very very powerful chart on in its own right.

105

00:07:15,210  -->  00:07:20,460
So this is going to be our chart number five that we're going to include.

106

00:07:20,610  -->  00:07:25,440
It's big but it does carry a lot of insightful information.

107

00:07:25,440  -->  00:07:32,160
All right so hopefully you enjoyed these tutorials on creating working fast grids and creating this

108

00:07:32,310  -->  00:07:33,600
monster of a chart.

109

00:07:33,600  -->  00:07:37,200
And if you fall along and create this chart then congratulations.

110

00:07:37,200  -->  00:07:41,610
This has been quite a feat to get to this result.

111

00:07:41,610  -->  00:07:47,550
Definitely enjoyed walking through this creation process together and I look forward to seeing on the

112

00:07:47,550  -->  00:07:48,330
next after.

113

00:07:48,390  -->  00:07:49,600
Until then I'd be coding
