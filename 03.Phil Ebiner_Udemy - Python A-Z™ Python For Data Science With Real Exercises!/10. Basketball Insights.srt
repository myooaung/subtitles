00:00:04,940  -->  00:00:05,330
Hello.

2

00:00:05,450  -->  00:00:07,440
Welcome back to the course of programming.

3

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:10,810
And today we're going to finally get to analyze the NBA data.

4

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:15,690
I hope you're pretty excited about today's tutorial and to start off what we're going to do is we're

5

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:21,510
going to have a look at what we created last time because that is going to help us a lot during today's

6

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:22,070
tutorial.

7

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:25,500
And last time we created our own very first function.

8

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:26,990
This function is called My plot.

9

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:30,030
It requires two parameters data and rose.

10

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:35,850
The first parameter is compulsory makes sense because our function can operate without any data and

11

00:00:35,880  -->  00:00:41,410
Rose isn't compulsory because it has a default value so if you don't supply the rows you want to visualize

12

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:43,840
it will just visualize all of the values.

13

00:00:44,070  -->  00:00:49,740
Here you can see what this function does it takes any data that you supply and it replaces it over here

14

00:00:49,800  -->  00:00:52,430
and the rows that you supply get replaced here.

15

00:00:52,560  -->  00:00:58,350
And so here I've got an example I'm going to plot the games of the top 10 page NBA players for the past

16

00:00:58,350  -->  00:01:00,640
10 years just by running this one line.

17

00:01:00,900  -->  00:01:02,480
And as you can see there we go.

18

00:01:02,490  -->  00:01:03,750
That's the plot.

19

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:10,350
So now what we're going to do is we're going to move on to analyzing and driving insight and I'm going

20

00:01:10,350  -->  00:01:16,260
to go to this new tab so I've prepared some code here already and I invite you to follow along so as

21

00:01:16,260  -->  00:01:18,370
we run these lines just code them up.

22

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:25,200
I decided not to write them up one by one because we're kind of moving now from the stage where we're

23

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:29,580
learning all these things that we need for this analysis to actually performing the analysis.

24

00:01:29,580  -->  00:01:36,800
So the focus today is going to be on analytics and on data science and you know doing analysis in smart

25

00:01:36,800  -->  00:01:37,710
thought through way.

26

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:40,600
So that's what we're going to be talking about most of the day today.

27

00:01:40,830  -->  00:01:42,150
So let's get started.

28

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:45,240
My plot salary what are we going to plot here.

29

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:50,790
First thing that I was interested to see was how have the salaries of these players been changing so

30

00:01:50,790  -->  00:01:55,020
how did they actually get here to being the top ten paid players.

31

00:01:55,020  -->  00:02:00,660
As you can see Kobe Bryant was always quite up there and his salary has been going up until the previous

32

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:03,050
season 2014 2015.

33

00:02:03,150  -->  00:02:09,960
And his record was over 30 million dollars for a one year of playing.

34

00:02:10,110  -->  00:02:15,580
And then here we've got the rest so you can see that Joe Johnson started quite above.

35

00:02:15,590  -->  00:02:18,930
But then the rest caught up with him and now they're all sitting over here.

36

00:02:18,930  -->  00:02:21,150
So that's how the salaries have been changing.

37

00:02:21,150  -->  00:02:24,290
Now let's applaud how much they get paid per game.

38

00:02:24,300  -->  00:02:31,110
So salary divide by game and this is where I first ran into this conundrum that we've got some anomalies

39

00:02:31,110  -->  00:02:32,060
here what happened here.

40

00:02:32,060  -->  00:02:38,400
So why is is this Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose so why are they getting paid so much per game as we saw

41

00:02:38,430  -->  00:02:39,260
previously.

42

00:02:39,270  -->  00:02:41,760
Their salaries are comparable to the others.

43

00:02:41,760  -->  00:02:48,140
Well the reason here is that both of these players were actually injured in that 2013 14th season.

44

00:02:48,300  -->  00:02:51,710
They didn't play that many games so their salary pre-game is quite high.

45

00:02:51,920  -->  00:02:54,720
And same thing salary for field goals.

46

00:02:54,720  -->  00:03:00,090
So what we could do from a daughter and a league's point of view we could remove these anomalies then

47

00:03:00,090  -->  00:03:01,500
continue for analysis.

48

00:03:01,500  -->  00:03:06,810
However digging further into the Basketball daughter I found that these players put so much effort into

49

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:11,370
their game that they get injured quite a lot so we would see discrepancies like this throughout the

50

00:03:11,370  -->  00:03:17,310
whole dataset and moreover where we wouldn't see them there would be still skewing 0.04 us snowing and

51

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:22,990
so therefore visualizing salary and in games to six together might not be the best option.

52

00:03:23,190  -->  00:03:28,750
The reason for that is that salary is not affected by injuries whereas in game statistics are.

53

00:03:28,890  -->  00:03:32,150
So the players get paid regardless of whether they're playing or not.

54

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:33,170
They have contracts.

55

00:03:33,360  -->  00:03:38,610
But there are statistics such as games played field goals and so on they do get affected so from an

56

00:03:38,610  -->  00:03:45,300
analytical point of view unless we can somehow exclude those effect of injuries we shouldn't visualize

57

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:47,660
salaries and in game statistics together.

58

00:03:47,850  -->  00:03:50,660
So let's go and look at the in-game metrics.

59

00:03:50,940  -->  00:03:53,870
Let's see what the minutes played and what do we see here.

60

00:03:53,880  -->  00:03:58,540
Well here we see how many minutes each of the players played in the past 10 years.

61

00:03:58,560  -->  00:03:59,030
OK.

62

00:03:59,040  -->  00:04:01,090
And let's plot points.

63

00:04:01,140  -->  00:04:06,480
So what we see here is another thing like we know that Derrick Rose is for instance a great player and

64

00:04:06,570  -->  00:04:09,420
he was MVP in 2010 11 season.

65

00:04:09,480  -->  00:04:14,420
But here we can see that the points that he brought to his team dropped over here.

66

00:04:14,640  -->  00:04:16,690
And so Same with Kobe Bryant.

67

00:04:16,740  -->  00:04:19,980
But the reason for that is that both these players were injured over here.

68

00:04:19,980  -->  00:04:23,980
So once again we can see that injuries are affecting our vessels.

69

00:04:24,270  -->  00:04:25,610
So how do we fix that.

70

00:04:25,740  -->  00:04:29,750
How to approach it as a scientist and how do we take injuries out of the equation.

71

00:04:30,060  -->  00:04:33,650
Well we know that injuries affect all in game statistics.

72

00:04:33,660  -->  00:04:37,770
So if you don't attend a game you're injured you don't attend the game but you also don't score goals

73

00:04:37,770  -->  00:04:38,100
.

74

00:04:38,100  -->  00:04:42,960
So what we can do is we can normalize in-game metrics by in-game metrics.

75

00:04:43,020  -->  00:04:44,470
That's what I have here.

76

00:04:44,490  -->  00:04:50,280
So if we take field goals and divide them per game rather than just plodding field goals but by themselves

77

00:04:50,640  -->  00:04:53,090
if we plot that then you will see that.

78

00:04:53,100  -->  00:04:58,820
Now we can actually compare them so even though some players were injured some players were not your

79

00:04:58,820  -->  00:05:03,960
device your calculator how many goals is scored per game so actually per game that they're tender.

80

00:05:04,100  -->  00:05:07,810
No injuries do sometimes affect and quite often affect players even when they're playing.

81

00:05:07,810  -->  00:05:14,000
But already we're extracting or we're mitigating some of that effects that injuries have on our vessels

82

00:05:14,190  -->  00:05:14,590
.

83

00:05:14,870  -->  00:05:20,510
And so now you can go ahead and compare their goals per game that players score and as you can see back

84

00:05:20,570  -->  00:05:28,720
in the day Kobe Bryant had a crazy amount of 13 per game and now it's quite is dropped quite a lot.

85

00:05:28,820  -->  00:05:32,510
And right now in the lead we've got Libran LeBron James.

86

00:05:32,520  -->  00:05:36,870
We're about just over nine goals per game on average.

87

00:05:37,130  -->  00:05:37,850
That's on points.

88

00:05:37,850  -->  00:05:39,130
That's actually goals.

89

00:05:39,350  -->  00:05:39,910
OK.

90

00:05:39,980  -->  00:05:46,400
And now let's visualize another normalized metric let's visualize field goals per field goal attempts

91

00:05:46,400  -->  00:05:46,480
.

92

00:05:46,490  -->  00:05:51,320
I think that one will be pretty interesting so if we look at that this is basically the accuracy of

93

00:05:51,320  -->  00:05:51,680
the play.

94

00:05:51,680  -->  00:05:56,100
So how many goals a day make divided by that how many attempts did they make.

95

00:05:56,270  -->  00:06:02,930
So here you can see right away that Dwight Howard is up there up at the top and way above all other

96

00:06:02,930  -->  00:06:08,290
players in terms of accuracy and he is the fifth highest paid player in the NBA currently.

97

00:06:08,510  -->  00:06:09,730
So what does that mean.

98

00:06:09,740  -->  00:06:16,290
Well that means that basically out of the balls that he throws at the net about 60 percent nearly 6

99

00:06:16,290  -->  00:06:18,950
percent actually and in a goal.

100

00:06:19,190  -->  00:06:25,120
So let's see how he's going in terms of actual attempts so we know that his attempts convert very well

101

00:06:25,130  -->  00:06:27,940
but how many attempts per game does he have.

102

00:06:28,220  -->  00:06:30,070
Let's look at this visualization.

103

00:06:30,140  -->  00:06:34,170
Here we see that Dwight Howard is actually at the very bottom.

104

00:06:34,250  -->  00:06:38,960
So he was at the top for conversion of or successful attempts.

105

00:06:38,960  -->  00:06:45,020
Now he's at the bottom for the actual number of attempts per game and therefore it makes sense that

106

00:06:45,080  -->  00:06:50,390
he doesn't actually score that many points per game even though that his accuracy is quite high because

107

00:06:50,390  -->  00:06:52,160
he makes a few attempts.

108

00:06:52,160  -->  00:06:54,000
He doesn't score that many points.

109

00:06:54,030  -->  00:06:58,300
So that's an inside we could drive right away and probably basketball.

110

00:06:58,370  -->  00:07:02,960
People have a lot of knowledge about basketball could comment on this and could say why exactly he doesn't

111

00:07:02,960  -->  00:07:03,890
make that many attempts.

112

00:07:03,890  -->  00:07:09,220
Maybe he's on the court in a position that is not designed to make that many attempt.

113

00:07:09,320  -->  00:07:14,450
Or maybe it's not the case maybe he can start making more tense and then because his accuracy is so

114

00:07:14,450  -->  00:07:16,600
high maybe he'll start scoring more goals.

115

00:07:16,700  -->  00:07:22,450
So that's something to look into that requires more as it's called domain knowledge or knowledge of

116

00:07:22,530  -->  00:07:24,020
basketball.

117

00:07:24,050  -->  00:07:27,500
Now we're going to move on to some more interesting observations.

118

00:07:27,530  -->  00:07:29,510
Let's say minutes played per game.

119

00:07:29,510  -->  00:07:31,130
So I thought this was quite interesting.

120

00:07:31,340  -->  00:07:36,680
You can see that the minutes played per game for these top ten players has been dropping overall so

121

00:07:36,680  -->  00:07:42,210
you can see the trend here it's going down and I couldn't explain that I can explain why so I understand

122

00:07:42,200  -->  00:07:48,500
if it was for one or two players but overall these players seemed to play less minutes per game on average

123

00:07:48,500  -->  00:07:48,890
.

124

00:07:48,890  -->  00:07:54,020
As we move from earlier years in their career to later years and that would be interesting to find out

125

00:07:54,020  -->  00:07:54,520
why.

126

00:07:54,770  -->  00:07:58,820
At the same time if you plot the games you can see that they haven't the number of games that they've

127

00:07:58,820  -->  00:08:00,440
been playing is actually pretty consistent.

128

00:08:00,440  -->  00:08:03,530
Not that they're playing more games and therefore they're playing less minutes.

129

00:08:03,560  -->  00:08:08,090
They're playing pretty much the same number of games but they're playing less minutes per game so that's

130

00:08:08,090  -->  00:08:09,460
that's an interesting one.

131

00:08:09,870  -->  00:08:14,990
OK so time is valuable since they're less on the court less minutes per game on the court.

132

00:08:14,990  -->  00:08:19,790
There are times available let's see who uses that time most efficiently so who scores the most field

133

00:08:19,790  -->  00:08:21,530
goals per minute played.

134

00:08:21,800  -->  00:08:22,780
Let's run that one.

135

00:08:23,000  -->  00:08:26,420
And here we can see that it's actually Kevin Durant.

136

00:08:26,420  -->  00:08:29,060
He is quite young.

137

00:08:29,060  -->  00:08:33,710
When I was gathering this data I noticed that he joined the NBA quite recently.

138

00:08:33,730  -->  00:08:35,620
A coach like relatively recently.

139

00:08:35,720  -->  00:08:43,820
So he's young and you can see that his goals for minutes played have been increasing with time so I've

140

00:08:43,820  -->  00:08:46,250
seen a few articles calling him the rising star.

141

00:08:46,250  -->  00:08:47,480
So we'll see how it goes.

142

00:08:47,480  -->  00:08:51,940
But so far the data does confirm that he's using his time on the court.

143

00:08:52,010  -->  00:08:54,070
Valuably and that's what we're seeing.

144

00:08:54,070  -->  00:08:58,280
And also we see in kind of two groups we've seen some players are here and we've seen some players over

145

00:08:58,280  -->  00:09:01,460
here so players that fall into this group.

146

00:09:01,460  -->  00:09:06,830
Kevin Durant Dwayne Wade cover Melo Anthony and LeBron James.

147

00:09:06,860  -->  00:09:09,420
Very interesting to see this type of grouping.

148

00:09:09,710  -->  00:09:15,470
And finally one more interesting disposition that I found was points divided by field goals so it's

149

00:09:15,470  -->  00:09:17,160
kind of player style.

150

00:09:17,270  -->  00:09:21,510
So in baseball you can score a two point goal or he can score a three point goal.

151

00:09:21,560  -->  00:09:25,950
And also you'll see that some of the the averages here actually above three points.

152

00:09:25,950  -->  00:09:32,240
That's because our field goals are all points Dadda includes both goals field goals and also includes

153

00:09:32,290  -->  00:09:33,530
the free shots that they get.

154

00:09:33,530  -->  00:09:39,320
So we would need to subtract the free shot points from points to exclude that effect but unfortunately

155

00:09:39,320  -->  00:09:44,810
we don't have that data in in our data set so it's just Beruf this we can still see that player playing

156

00:09:44,810  -->  00:09:49,850
style is changing with time so a good example that jumps out right away is Kevin Durant you can see

157

00:09:49,850  -->  00:09:50,730
that first.

158

00:09:50,750  -->  00:09:57,230
He used to score less points per field goal so he was going for the two point shots more and then he

159

00:09:57,230  -->  00:09:58,910
started scoring more points.

160

00:09:58,910  -->  00:10:04,520
So that means he was started to go for more for three point shots or he was getting more free throws

161

00:10:04,530  -->  00:10:04,700
.

162

00:10:04,970  -->  00:10:06,410
And then it dropped and then went up.

163

00:10:06,410  -->  00:10:11,930
So it's interesting to see how some of the players have a change in style like that or Kobe Bryant for

164

00:10:11,930  -->  00:10:17,740
instance like the average dropped and then it started going up again or what's another one.

165

00:10:17,740  -->  00:10:19,730
Here we can see Chris Bosh.

166

00:10:19,730  -->  00:10:23,830
You can see that his average was dropping consistently and then started growing.

167

00:10:23,840  -->  00:10:30,440
So it'd be interesting to see what is the cause of these changes are that there trainers telling them

168

00:10:30,440  -->  00:10:37,670
to change the style or other trends in the basketball the sport that change over time and things like

169

00:10:37,670  -->  00:10:40,130
that it would be interesting to observe that.

170

00:10:40,460  -->  00:10:49,040
OK so there we go that's some analysis of the stats that we have and what you can do is you can perform

171

00:10:49,230  -->  00:10:54,080
a take a similar approach and explore some other things because there's so many things that we haven't

172

00:10:54,080  -->  00:11:00,740
explored yet here you can just try and normalize different matrices by different matrices and plot some

173

00:11:00,740  -->  00:11:05,620
of these things and find some insights of your own and see what you're able to discover.

174

00:11:05,630  -->  00:11:07,930
I hope you found this article interesting and exciting.

175

00:11:07,940  -->  00:11:10,120
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

176

00:11:10,130  -->  00:11:11,590
Until then happy coding

177

00:11:13,550  -->  00:11:15,590
