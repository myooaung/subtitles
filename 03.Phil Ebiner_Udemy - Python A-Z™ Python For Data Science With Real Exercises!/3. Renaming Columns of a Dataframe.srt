00:00:04,870  -->  00:00:05,730
Alone.

2

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:08,370
Welcome back to the course on mice and programming.

3

00:00:08,370  -->  00:00:13,110
Today is going to be a quick tutorial we're going to learn how to rename or old daughter frame.

4

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:15,930
All right let's get started right away.

5

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:19,620
First thing we're going to do is we're going to look at our table and we're going to use the head function

6

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:26,400
because that will save us the trouble through all of scrolling through the whole doorframe so that our

7

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:32,400
head is our doorframe so we can see that the column names here that are displayed here and they all

8

00:00:32,400  -->  00:00:37,980
have spaces some of them for instance here the are is not a capital they use on a couple So it's not

9

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:38,900
consistent.

10

00:00:39,120  -->  00:00:43,770
And often you'll find that when you upload a data set you might need to perform some cleaning.

11

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:49,200
So what I'm going to go into Jeff on cleaning yet because we haven't mastered Python to the level that

12

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:52,310
we need to to understand how to perform those kind of things.

13

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:53,450
But at the same time.

14

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:57,570
For this section we are going to need to rename the columns.

15

00:00:57,570  -->  00:01:02,760
You will see this further down in the next upcoming tutorial so why don't we learn how to do it right

16

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:03,480
now.

17

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:03,750
All right.

18

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:08,760
So how do we access how columns were very talked about this stat start columns.

19

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:12,220
And if you run that you'll get your columns beautiful.

20

00:01:12,450  -->  00:01:16,450
And now what we want to do is we want to rename our columns.

21

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:22,350
It's very simple to do you just take this object as well and you just say stats columns equals and you

22

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:26,690
can give them a different name so you can say pretty much anything.

23

00:01:26,700  -->  00:01:27,370
A.

24

00:01:27,600  -->  00:01:33,450
So we've got two columns five columns say A B C D and E.

25

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:39,930
So if I run that and I look at stats Daut head you'll see that the colors have been renamed as simple

26

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:40,300
as that.

27

00:01:40,470  -->  00:01:45,130
But of course we don't want those names we're just going to copy this these names from here so this

28

00:01:45,150  -->  00:01:47,160
is going to be a list of names.

29

00:01:47,490  -->  00:01:53,700
And when we put this over here by the way I would like to show you right away how to create a new line

30

00:01:53,700  -->  00:01:59,010
in Python so or tenue your code on your line so let's say I want to continue my code like that.

31

00:01:59,040  -->  00:01:59,920
I totally can.

32

00:02:00,060  -->  00:02:05,850
In Jupiter notebooks I can write a way without any problems because the cell gets run everything in

33

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:10,440
the cell gets run if you want to do it in Python the way the correct way to do it is put a backslash

34

00:02:10,440  -->  00:02:11,020
or here.

35

00:02:11,340  -->  00:02:16,800
And that way your code will get continued onto the next line.

36

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:17,100
All right.

37

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:21,120
And now we're just going to change the names so they're consistent we're going to remove the spaces

38

00:02:21,480  -->  00:02:27,540
and you will notice why further down in the section and we're going to replace lower case letters with

39

00:02:27,590  -->  00:02:34,020
the Capitals birthrate Internet users and income group.

40

00:02:34,020  -->  00:02:34,650
Beautiful.

41

00:02:34,650  -->  00:02:37,440
So let's run that let's run that line.

42

00:02:37,890  -->  00:02:43,520
And if you look at the top Rosenau it's all consistent and it looks lovely.

43

00:02:43,530  -->  00:02:47,570
All right so that's how your name your columns in your doorframe.

44

00:02:47,960  -->  00:02:49,460
I look forward to your the next Tauriel.

45

00:02:49,470  -->  00:02:50,910
And until then happy coding
