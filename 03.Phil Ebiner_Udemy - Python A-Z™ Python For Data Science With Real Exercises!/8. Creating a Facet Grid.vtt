00:00:05.210  -->  00:00:09.570
Hello welcome back to the course in Python programming today we're going to talk about an interesting

2

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:10.040
topic.

3

00:00:10.080  -->  00:00:14.050
Well actually we'll kick off an interesting topic that will last for a couple of tutorials.

4

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:18.700
We're going to talk about fast grids and how to create them and pie and how to work with them and fight

5

00:00:18.690  -->  00:00:19.330
them.

6

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:20.820
All right so what is this all about.

7

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:22.950
Carol what are Fassett grids.

8

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:28.480
Well if we scroll back up to the top you'll find a chart that we created previously.

9

00:00:28.500  -->  00:00:30.180
This is just a scatterplot.

10

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:37.710
And here we've got lots of different genres on a one chart as you can see because there are so many

11

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:38.820
points here.

12

00:00:38.880  -->  00:00:42.510
It looks quite cumbersome unless you're looking for analytics.

13

00:00:42.550  -->  00:00:47.910
Overall you just want to see some sort of density or some sort of overall trends.

14

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:53.000
Then this chart is too cumbersome and it needs to be somehow simplified or split up.

15

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:55.170
And that's exactly what we're going talk about.

16

00:00:55.170  -->  00:01:01.920
We're going to learn how to create multiple charts for separate genres or even for based on other criteria

17

00:01:01.940  -->  00:01:02.050
.

18

00:01:02.050  -->  00:01:03.520
Split up that chart.

19

00:01:03.930  -->  00:01:06.740
So let's let's go ahead and get started.

20

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:11.450
How do we create this contract which is actually called a fast grid.

21

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:16.160
Well first of all we need to prepare the Fassett grid in order to do that.

22

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:23.430
We're going to say energy equals S and S to all that fast that just press tabouli or populate for you

23

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:24.990
and then say movies.

24

00:01:25.170  -->  00:01:30.740
And now here what we want to do is we want to specify what kind of Fassett grid we want.

25

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:37.080
So let's say we want to split up our daughter by Shanor will say a row equals Shannara and then Heugh

26

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:41.160
which is the color of the doors will also be genre.

27

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:44.400
So if we run this movies made a mistake there.

28

00:01:44.400  -->  00:01:54.140
So movies if we run this you'll see that now we've got a fast grid where ROEs are movies and those are

29

00:01:54.250  -->  00:01:55.100
the genre.

30

00:01:55.200  -->  00:01:58.270
And so you've got obviously seven separate rows.

31

00:01:58.290  -->  00:02:03.840
It's still empty but we'll be able to populate it and the concept is very similar to what we discussed

32

00:02:03.840  -->  00:02:05.300
with subplots.

33

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:11.640
So it's not a subplot subplots is a separate thing in subplots you basically create a plot which then

34

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:17.220
you populate or you create figer and then you populated with several subplots and then you populate

35

00:02:17.220  -->  00:02:25.080
the subplots with the viz. that you want to populate them with where it is in a facet grid.

36

00:02:25.080  -->  00:02:30.630
You're basically splitting up a Brazil's zation based on some sort of rule so you're not going to populate

37

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:33.090
these you can populate them with different things.

38

00:02:33.090  -->  00:02:36.920
This will be populated automatically based on the rules that you specify.

39

00:02:37.170  -->  00:02:42.100
So we're actually not going to just have a fast grid that small We're going to have a bigger faster

40

00:02:42.150  -->  00:02:42.390
grid.

41

00:02:42.390  -->  00:02:48.480
We're going to say RO is genre and call them is years.

42

00:02:48.500  -->  00:02:53.820
We're going to have a massive fast read Colma run that you add a second.

43

00:02:53.940  -->  00:02:54.330
There we go.

44

00:02:54.330  -->  00:03:00.100
So now we have a very very big fat cigarette so we're going to actually zoom out a bit so we can see

45

00:03:00.100  -->  00:03:00.120
.

46

00:03:00.120  -->  00:03:01.430
So that's the normal zoom.

47

00:03:01.620  -->  00:03:06.960
So you can see that top to bottom we have seven rows one two three four five six seven.

48

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:09.030
That's for genre and left right.

49

00:03:09.030  -->  00:03:13.650
That's the years and kind of makes sense to put the years left right and then we can observe any changes

50

00:03:13.940  -->  00:03:15.890
just by looking from left to right.

51

00:03:15.930  -->  00:03:17.590
And changes in time.

52

00:03:17.610  -->  00:03:18.050
All right.

53

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:24.000
So what I'm going to do in pipo or in Jupiter I'm going to actually click here and that will reduce

54

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:30.780
it or kind of collapses like that so we don't have to scroll up and down too far and I can zoom back

55

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:31.480
in.

56

00:03:31.500  -->  00:03:32.650
So that's how fast grid.

57

00:03:32.660  -->  00:03:34.680
That's what it's going to be like.

58

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:38.930
I know it looks huge already so it'll be interesting to see it when it's populated.

59

00:03:38.930  -->  00:03:41.660
So let's let's get to the fun stuff.

60

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:44.130
So now what we're going to do is we're going to populate it.

61

00:03:44.130  -->  00:03:47.680
So we really have a facet rootlets as we remember it's the letter G.

62

00:03:47.790  -->  00:03:53.400
And now what we're going to do is going to apply the map function to it and that will allow us to map

63

00:03:53.400  -->  00:03:59.340
something onto that fastened grids and say Gee equals G map and in here what we're going to place is

64

00:03:59.340  -->  00:04:02.520
going to put a scatterplot into each one of the.

65

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:08.220
So basically what we're doing is we're going to create a scatterplot that is going to be split across

66

00:04:08.250  -->  00:04:11.160
all of this construct that we've created.

67

00:04:11.160  -->  00:04:13.440
So how would we create a scatterplot.

68

00:04:13.450  -->  00:04:16.160
Well let's just forget about G for a second.

69

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:24.450
Scatterplot as you say BLT does scatter in PI plot and here you would specify x and y so X would be

70

00:04:24.570  -->  00:04:32.660
movies Daut critic aerating and y would be movies Daut audience rating.

71

00:04:32.670  -->  00:04:38.250
So we're going to stick to the convention that we've created that create ratings on the x axis audience

72

00:04:38.250  -->  00:04:44.460
rating is on the way axis so far and that you'll see that I've created scatterplot using the pipeful

73

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:45.500
function scatter.

74

00:04:45.690  -->  00:04:54.120
So now what we want to do is we want to map this scatter function or this whole construct onto our Fassett

75

00:04:54.120  -->  00:04:55.260
grid that we've prepared.

76

00:04:55.260  -->  00:04:56.380
How do we do that.

77

00:04:56.580  -->  00:05:02.040
Well we're going to use this cheat or map function and where are we going to take is we're going to

78

00:05:02.040  -->  00:05:06.540
pause this again construct I'm using that word too often.

79

00:05:06.630  -->  00:05:11.680
So we're going to take Peltier's scatter and we're going to pass all of it step by step into that map

80

00:05:11.690  -->  00:05:12.030
.

81

00:05:12.060  -->  00:05:12.790
Let's go ahead and do it.

82

00:05:12.800  -->  00:05:16.160
So you're going to remove cut them as I do that.

83

00:05:16.160  -->  00:05:17.270
So there it is.

84

00:05:17.280  -->  00:05:18.500
I'm going to say karma.

85

00:05:18.740  -->  00:05:23.060
So as you can see always I can put another set of brackets in there because I don't want to call the

86

00:05:23.060  -->  00:05:27.760
function in there I want to map the function onto the grid.

87

00:05:28.000  -->  00:05:37.760
So I'm going to take this now put it there and it won't take this a second go take this and put it there

88

00:05:37.750  -->  00:05:39.500
as well.

89

00:05:39.500  -->  00:05:39.850
All right.

90

00:05:39.860  -->  00:05:41.370
Get rid of these two.

91

00:05:41.380  -->  00:05:43.660
So what we did is we're actually passing.

92

00:05:43.670  -->  00:05:45.270
So if you press shift tab.

93

00:05:45.310  -->  00:05:46.670
All right so what's going on here.

94

00:05:46.670  -->  00:05:51.070
Well here the map is requesting a function which we are parsing.

95

00:05:51.110  -->  00:05:57.430
It says peel t scatter so passing a function to the dot map and then is requesting some arguments.

96

00:05:57.590  -->  00:06:02.960
And this starts on August basically means they can be any number of arguments because the map doesn't

97

00:06:02.960  -->  00:06:04.940
really know which function you're going to pass.

98

00:06:05.000  -->  00:06:11.470
So imposing penalties scatter and then repassing the arguments that are requested or required by penalty

99

00:06:11.470  -->  00:06:18.290
scatter to build the scatterplot And then what's going to happen is the map is going to map this function

100

00:06:18.350  -->  00:06:20.240
onto all Fassett grid.

101

00:06:20.240  -->  00:06:22.370
All right so there's a couple of things that we have to adjust here.

102

00:06:22.370  -->  00:06:28.760
First of all that code is not going to work unless we run it together with the Fassett grid.

103

00:06:28.750  -->  00:06:33.550
So this is part of the constructing of the and grid so we're going to need to put this bit over here

104

00:06:33.560  -->  00:06:33.580
.

105

00:06:33.590  -->  00:06:38.660
And so if we run it again I'll just recreate the Fassett grid for us and then map this function onto

106

00:06:38.660  -->  00:06:39.140
it.

107

00:06:39.440  -->  00:06:45.290
Then you will see that here we are using movies that create grading we don't need to use movies because

108

00:06:45.500  -->  00:06:47.770
movies are already specified in the Fassett grid.

109

00:06:47.780  -->  00:06:51.730
So the Fassett grid is based on the movies doorframe.

110

00:06:51.760  -->  00:06:59.800
It's already waiting to be able to split whatever it gets by genre according to Rose by year according

111

00:06:59.810  -->  00:07:02.390
to columns and colored by genre.

112

00:07:02.690  -->  00:07:06.560
We don't need the movies here and we don't need the movies here.

113

00:07:06.560  -->  00:07:09.420
The other thing is because we removed movies now.

114

00:07:09.470  -->  00:07:12.340
These need quotation marks.

115

00:07:12.350  -->  00:07:17.750
All right so once that is all prepared you can run this code for a second.

116

00:07:18.050  -->  00:07:19.490
And there we go.

117

00:07:19.490  -->  00:07:26.290
That is our scatterplot mapped onto the Fassett grid so you can see that it has been split.

118

00:07:26.300  -->  00:07:33.680
Magically it looks like it's been split magically by different genres so here you've got the genre specified

119

00:07:33.710  -->  00:07:40.040
action adventure comedy and so on and virtually is being split by years.

120

00:07:40.070  -->  00:07:46.190
So it's thousand seven eight nine 10 11 and also it has been colored by genre so you can see it's been

121

00:07:46.190  -->  00:07:47.550
colored by the rose.

122

00:07:47.690  -->  00:07:53.600
So that's that's wonderful that's exactly what we wanted and we're going to also collapse that so we

123

00:07:53.600  -->  00:07:55.100
can see it in one go.

124

00:07:55.170  -->  00:08:03.620
One other thing actually I wanted to show you is that you can populate with pretty much any type of

125

00:08:03.620  -->  00:08:05.540
chart chart.

126

00:08:05.550  -->  00:08:09.270
So let's have example histograms.

127

00:08:09.520  -->  00:08:12.770
Right so let's do that same whole procedure again.

128

00:08:12.800  -->  00:08:16.250
Let's copy this and put it in here.

129

00:08:16.270  -->  00:08:20.520
And so this time instead of PLG scatter we're going to say peel dad Hist.

130

00:08:20.840  -->  00:08:26.930
And for people to hear we only need only one variable right because we're putting a histogram.

131

00:08:27.050  -->  00:08:32.370
And in this case we can say Budget millions for instance so far on this.

132

00:08:32.410  -->  00:08:36.330
So now you can see that we've got the histograms have been created.

133

00:08:36.500  -->  00:08:44.020
Again it's split by genre by year so genres like that the roads the years are columns and it's showing

134

00:08:44.020  -->  00:08:49.430
you the budget millions in that genre in that year the distribution for the budget million.

135

00:08:49.420  -->  00:08:56.090
All right so that's just an example that you can populate anything into your scatterplot or into your

136

00:08:56.260  -->  00:08:57.060
facet good.

137

00:08:57.080  -->  00:09:04.180
It can be a bit tricky sometimes some sort of charts you just need to do some research on how exactly

138

00:09:04.190  -->  00:09:06.530
to populate your specific type of chart.

139

00:09:06.520  -->  00:09:11.020
But we're going to move back to our scatter plots because that's the charge we're working on that's

140

00:09:11.020  -->  00:09:12.560
the one we actually need.

141

00:09:12.710  -->  00:09:19.280
And here what we need to do is just type here back to the scatter plots.

142

00:09:19.610  -->  00:09:24.190
So here what we want to do is we want to add one more argument.

143

00:09:24.210  -->  00:09:27.600
So we talked about the keyword arguments previously.

144

00:09:27.740  -->  00:09:32.770
They are passed on as a dictionary so let's go ahead and practice that and you'll see here that if you

145

00:09:32.860  -->  00:09:36.670
wish X shift tab you'll see that G and postes the keyword arguments here.

146

00:09:36.940  -->  00:09:39.880
What keyword arguments can we possibly want to pass.

147

00:09:40.040  -->  00:09:44.250
Well if you're on this code you'll see that the DOTs are quite small.

148

00:09:44.300  -->  00:09:50.120
The color might be OK but they don't have a contour we might want to change the contour or the edge

149

00:09:50.120  -->  00:09:53.950
of the dots so let's go ahead and try that out.

150

00:09:53.980  -->  00:09:54.340
We'll say.

151

00:09:54.350  -->  00:09:58.370
KW As for keywords and Hirose dictionary.

152

00:09:58.550  -->  00:10:08.900
And he'll say as equals 50 for example that's the size that we want line of with equals 0.5 and edge

153

00:10:09.110  -->  00:10:10.580
color.

154

00:10:11.280  -->  00:10:12.260
What the U.

155

00:10:12.360  -->  00:10:14.340
Equals black.

156

00:10:14.380  -->  00:10:16.420
So this is something we discussed before.

157

00:10:16.420  -->  00:10:22.960
So what that basically does is creates the keyword arguments or a dictionary of keywords.

158

00:10:22.970  -->  00:10:28.640
So if I just run key KW separate to here you'll see that you've got Eshkol in black line with serpent

159

00:10:28.650  -->  00:10:30.220
5 five is 50.

160

00:10:30.270  -->  00:10:35.690
I remember in a dictionary they're not stored in a particular order because the keys is what matters

161

00:10:35.680  -->  00:10:36.750
not the order.

162

00:10:37.040  -->  00:10:41.020
And then I can just pass the dictionary here so of had double Starcade.

163

00:10:41.030  -->  00:10:41.940
Yes.

164

00:10:42.230  -->  00:10:47.340
If I passed the dictionary there now you'll see that our chart is going to look a bit different.

165

00:10:47.500  -->  00:10:50.100
Now it is a bit bigger indeed.

166

00:10:50.410  -->  00:10:56.390
And the dots themselves the points are bigger and they have an outline a black outline which makes them

167

00:10:56.380  -->  00:10:59.000
stand out better especially if they're overlapping.

168

00:10:59.000  -->  00:11:04.260
So if I zoom out a bit there is a whole chart so it looks pretty neat.

169

00:11:04.280  -->  00:11:05.630
And it is a bit big.

170

00:11:05.620  -->  00:11:10.700
So it is bigger than you'd expect but at the same time we've got to remember that we're going to be

171

00:11:10.690  -->  00:11:18.060
analyzing this more left to right then top to bottom so we're going to be looking at how did the relationship

172

00:11:18.060  -->  00:11:18.080
.

173

00:11:18.080  -->  00:11:19.760
This is what the CEO asked for.

174

00:11:19.750  -->  00:11:24.670
How did the relationship between the audience rating and the critic rating evolve throughout the years

175

00:11:24.670  -->  00:11:24.750
.

176

00:11:24.770  -->  00:11:29.510
And so here we can actually see it by genre so for action this is how it evolved.

177

00:11:29.500  -->  00:11:35.530
You can see that it became a bit more scattered and then kind of like separate into two groups here

178

00:11:35.540  -->  00:11:35.710
.

179

00:11:35.750  -->  00:11:43.050
It became a bit more condensed and a more lined out again for this one for drama.

180

00:11:43.070  -->  00:11:47.230
It definitely became more condensed and went up into the top right corner.

181

00:11:47.330  -->  00:11:53.740
So you can already observe some sort of trends even from this preliminary set up that we've done for

182

00:11:53.750  -->  00:11:55.500
our Fassett grid.

183

00:11:55.520  -->  00:11:59.600
All right so hopefully you are able to following that tutorial and you enjoyed it.

184

00:11:59.720  -->  00:12:00.790
Give that a go.

185

00:12:00.790  -->  00:12:03.340
Play around with the Fassett grid.

186

00:12:03.340  -->  00:12:10.150
It is a quite important concept in visualization and Python because oftentimes if you're going to be

187

00:12:10.180  -->  00:12:16.040
continuing doing analytic centralization By think oftentimes you'll find that Fassett grids might be

188

00:12:16.040  -->  00:12:18.570
a good solution to your analytics challenges.

189

00:12:18.770  -->  00:12:21.990
And on that note I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

190

00:12:22.000  -->  00:12:26.990
Until then happy coding.
