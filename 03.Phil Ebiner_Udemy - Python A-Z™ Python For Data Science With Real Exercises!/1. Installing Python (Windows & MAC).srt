00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,340
Hello and welcome the course in Python programming in today's tutorial we start our epic journey into the world
1

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,320
of Python.
2

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,620
And today I'll show you how to install Python on your computer.
3

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,550
Whether it's a Mac or a Windows computer we will learn how to do it.
4

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,370
In either case.
5

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,950
So let's dive straight into it.
6

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,300
So installing Python What does it involve.
7

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,000
Well of course it's all about installing the programming language Python
8

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,130
However this can be done in many different ways.
9

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,550
So you could install Python just by itself onto a computer and then install an IDE an integrated development
10

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,210
environment such as pi charm or Eclipse onto a computer as well and use Python through there.
11

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,120
But what we're going to do is we are going to install Python through the Anaconda distribution so Anaconda
12

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,260
is kind of a pre-packaged solution that already includes Python and it also includes Jupiter.
13

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,540
And it includes which we'll talk about just now it also includes other IDEs already inside Anaconda
14

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,320
and it actually also includes a lot of packages like NUMP pie and Pandas and some vizualization packages
15

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,900
so you won't have to then worry about installing them separately so basically Anaconda is a very convenient
16

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,670
way for data scientists and analysts to get Python up and running very quickly and I'll demonstrate
17

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,720
how to use how to install Python using Anaconda and get it up and running on your machine very fast.
18

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,400
And also we will be using Jupiter so Jupiter notebook's is a solution which used to be previously called
19

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,300
IPython notebooks but then they expanded and now they you can you're able to code in Julia in Python
20

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,200
and in R among other languages in the Jupiter notebooks and that's where the name comes from.
21

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,220
So Julia Python and R it is a solution that works in your browser so instead of installing an integrated
22

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,730
development environment and install in python there.
23

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,960
So like a separate program that you would be coding in Python and there you can actually do it through
24

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,090
your browser and you'll see how it all runs.
25

26
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,520
I know it might sound a bit dodgy even that it's running through a browser but it's actually a very
26

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,520
very powerful solution especially for data scientists because it allows you to get results very quickly
27

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,030
.
28

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,330
All right.
29

30
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,710
So let's get started.
30

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,200
How do we install all of these things on to a machine.
31

32
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,430
It's actually not a very complicated process.
32

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,770
There's a few steps as just three basic steps that we will go through together and you'll see that it's
33

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,750
very straightforward.
34

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,400
So first step is installing Anaconda
35

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,530
Second step is open the command line or the terminal on your computer.
36

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,770
And the third step is a run Jupiter notebooks and that's pretty much it.
37

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,980
So as soon as we get through these three steps you'll be able to start coding in Python is pretty exciting isn't
38

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,600
it.
39

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:47,910
All right.
40

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,040
So let's get started.
41

42
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,700
Step one.
42

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,610
Installing Anaconda, so to get Anaconda.
43

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,110
I'll show you which website to go to.
44

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,030
But basically you can just search through Google just google Anaconda Python and then you will need
45

46
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,870
this version on the right you'll need the python 3.5 either for Windows or for a Mac and it will do
46

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,350
all these steps together just now this is just like a summary of the steps.
47

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,130
Step two open the command line.
48

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,520
There's two different approaches one for Windows one for Mac.
49

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,240
So if you're on a Windows machine then in your Start Menu in the search bar just start typing Anaconda
50

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,330
.
51

52
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,020
This is after Anaconda's downloaded installed.
52

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,060
You'll be able to bring up the command prompt So as you can see here we started typing in Anaconda and
53

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,790
that brought up this option.
54

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,110
And we need to just click and icon the command prompt.
55

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,000
By the way if for any reason you're having trouble finding the Anaconda command prompt then you can
56

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,980
just use the standard command line.
57

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,360
So in the search.
58

59
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,480
Just type in C M D those three letters and it'll bring up a similar window to the Anaconda command
59

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,900
prompt and you'll be able to use that as well.
60

61
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,130
So this is what the Anaconda command prompt looks like it's just a black screen or a black little window
61

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,690
where you can type commands so you don't need to type that command that's in there right now.
62

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,810
The one you will need to type in is Jupyter notebook so if you just type in Jupyter notebook after an Anaconda
63

64
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,470
is installed then Jupyter notebooks will be brought up in your browser and the browser I recommend is
64

65
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,240
chrome.
65

66
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,700
And also you will notice that the Anaconda distribution actually already includes Jupyter.
66

67
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,370
You don't need to install Jupyter separately as long as you install any distribution.
67

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,390
You will have Jupiter and you'll be able to run it through this command line.
68

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,310
Here and will go through these steps just now.
69

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,130
And if you're on a Mac you just need to bring up the terminal if you press command space on the keyboard
70

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,280
.
71

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,910
That will bring up the search and then you start typing terminal.
72

73
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,070
This will bring up this terminal option if you run terminal.
73

74
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,160
You will get a box like this or a window like this.
74

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,840
And inside this window once again all you had to type in is Jupyter notebook.
75

76
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,530
All right.
76

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,080
And then once that's done what you will see is Jupyter.
77

78
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,910
So this is Jupyter it's running in my browser which is chrome.
78

79
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,360
And basically you can type in Python code in the cells and then the code will be run underneath.
79

80
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,450
So this is actual code from our tutorials.
80

81
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,010
This is from one of the sections in this course and this is one of those visualizations that will be
81

82
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,730
creating some very powerful analytics around basketball players that will be conducting.
82

83
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,390
All right.
83

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,550
So those are the steps.
84

85
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,160
Let's now go through them in practice.
85

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,890
All right so here I'm going to Google to get Anaconda all you have to type in is Anaconda Python.
86

87
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,650
So just search for that.
87

88
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,280
And then the link that takes you to Continuum dot I O.
88

89
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,370
Slash downloads.
89

90
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,060
So when you want and continue analytics provider the Anaconda distribution so you can read about it
90

91
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,790
a bit here and there is an icon for Windows.
91

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,220
The one you need here is Python 3.5.
92

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,640
So get the graphical installer and be careful that it is quite large is 350 megabytes.
93

94
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,320
Also if you're on a Mac.
94

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,230
So I'm doing these tutorials on a Mac.
95

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,460
You'll see that I'm installing the Mac OS version here so once again graphical installer.
96

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,670
And there isn't a big difference in terms of how they're running because it is going to be running in your
97

98
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,080
browser and we're going to be typing up all the same code as just this installation part that is different
98

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,230
.
99

100
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,080
So go ahead and pick the one that's right for you.
100

101
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,750
And just remember we don't need Python 2.7.
101

102
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,820
We need Python 3 point something.
102

103
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,640
So your version of Python might be more at the time watching this video it might be higher than 3.5
103

104
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:19,950
.
104

105
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,830
Just go ahead and install that one as long as it starts it doesn't start with a two as long as it's a python
105

106
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,490
3 point something version or later.
106

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,200
So go ahead install that and once that is installed it might take some time.
107

108
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,640
Then we will proceed to the next step and the next step is to bring up that Anaconda command line or
108

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,540
on Windows.
109

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,690
So remember you need to search for Anaconda in your search bar in the Start menu or on a Mac.
110

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,730
I'm going to type in it's already typed in here so what we need is typing in the spotlight search is
111

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,640
terminal.
112

113
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,710
So just press command space on your keyboard and then type in terminal and then brings up the terminal
113

114
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,450
and once again whether you're on Windows or Mac you just need to type in the same thing.
114

115
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,220
Jupyter notebook.
115

116
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,400
Cingular and then just click enter.
116

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,860
And so what that does is it starts launching Jupyter notebook, Python and everything is launched and
117

118
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,750
then you are presented with Jupyter notebooks inside your browser.
118

119
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,940
So here all you need to do is select a folder where you want to run all of your Jupyter notebooks or create
119

120
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,890
all your Python code.
120

121
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,750
So I recommend creating a folder maybe somewhere on your desktop or somewhere so all of your notebooks
121

122
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,110
are in one place.
122

123
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,730
I created a folder called Python programming course for this course.
123

124
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,640
And if you just go inside you can see already here that I've got some code prepared here.
124

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:48,420
So, for instance, I can open Basketball analysis and this is a program that we were going to be writing
125

126
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,790
inside this course already so you can see there is already code in here if you want to create a brand new
126

127
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,830
program again.
127

128
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,810
So once you're open you've opened the folder that you want.
128

129
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,860
Just click here new and then select Python so because you installed it through Anaconda and for Python
129

130
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,850
you will have this option to start a python notebook and there we go so we can start typing in code
130

131
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,440
here we can say print Hello world.
131

132
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,990
Exclamation mark.
132

133
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,760
Very classic.
133

134
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,650
And there it is.
134

135
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,830
It's running as you can see that's where we type the code.
135

136
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,820
That's the result of our code Jupyter notebooks might seem a bit different at first to what you might be
136

137
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,390
used used to too.
137

138
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,630
Working in integrated development environments with programming languages but at the same time will
138

139
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,110
get used to them very quickly and they're a very powerful solution to not only learning programming
139

140
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,440
language but also actually performing real life analytics and data science as you will see in this course
140

141
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,620
can't wait to see in the next tutorial.
141

142
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,190
And until then happy coding
