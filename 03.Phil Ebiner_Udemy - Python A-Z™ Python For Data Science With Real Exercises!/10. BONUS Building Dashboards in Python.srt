00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:09,950
Hello and welcome back to the course and fight and programming in the previous tutorial we completed

2

00:00:09,950  -->  00:00:11,010
the challenge.

3

00:00:11,010  -->  00:00:17,820
Among other things we created this lovely facet grid with lots of different scatterplot on it.

4

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:24,840
So which allows us to analyze how audience ratings and critic rating has evolved over the years for

5

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:25,920
different genres.

6

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:31,290
We also created some amazing charts some while in plot a bomb explodes.

7

00:00:31,410  -->  00:00:36,800
Cady diagrams are kiddie plots more kitty applause applause.

8

00:00:37,000  -->  00:00:43,770
We created some amazing histograms which took us quite some effort to create and we did some analysis

9

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:43,820
.

10

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:48,110
So quite a lot of things were done and more or less the challenge is over.

11

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:56,850
However I still wanted to throw in a few bonus tutorials to demonstrate how we can build dashboards

12

00:00:56,850  -->  00:00:57,570
in Python.

13

00:00:57,570  -->  00:01:03,060
Now I know we don't really need to build a dashboard for this challenge it wasn't requested but at the

14

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:06,390
same time it's really fun and useful topic.

15

00:01:06,390  -->  00:01:11,700
So if you are in a rush or if this you find that this is not something you need then feel free to skip

16

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:17,430
these 2 tutorials they're not compulsory but if you'd like to learn some additional skills and hacks

17

00:01:17,430  -->  00:01:21,890
and tricks then stick around and we're going to kick it off right now.

18

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:22,640
All right.

19

00:01:22,650  -->  00:01:24,290
So what is a dashboard.

20

00:01:24,540  -->  00:01:26,770
How do we build a dashboard in Python.

21

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:29,600
Well a dashboard is a combination of charts.

22

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:31,560
For instance this is a radio dashboard.

23

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:38,280
This even though it's just a figure of two plots is actually a dashboard because it combines two different

24

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:42,600
types of flaws two different sets of information and so on.

25

00:01:42,600  -->  00:01:43,980
So that's what we're going to be focused on.

26

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:46,260
We're going to be using the subplots function.

27

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:49,150
Let me zoom in here so we can see better.

28

00:01:49,200  -->  00:01:55,200
We're going to be using the subplots function to create dashboards and populate those dashboards with

29

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:57,530
different types of chart.

30

00:01:57,630  -->  00:01:59,400
So let's go ahead and do that.

31

00:01:59,430  -->  00:02:04,210
We're going to need plots dot subplots we might as well just copy it now.

32

00:02:04,470  -->  00:02:06,480
And let's kick things off.

33

00:02:06,480  -->  00:02:13,410
So here I'm going to I'm going to add are guilty subplots.

34

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:19,680
You know what for consistency purposes I'm actually going to copy this whole hit or that we use for

35

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:21,740
our imports.

36

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:23,630
So that way we don't miss out.

37

00:02:23,630  -->  00:02:29,110
So even if you jump just into this tutorial you'll be able to follow along as well.

38

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:35,800
So I'm just going to put this above here and then let's get rid of this for now.

39

00:02:36,180  -->  00:02:37,640
So there is our hitter.

40

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:43,610
Just make sure you run that and that prepares our workspace for creating dashboard.

41

00:02:43,740  -->  00:02:46,450
And now we're going to use BLT dots or plot.

42

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:48,350
It returns two values.

43

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:58,260
F is our figure axis or axes is the axes and T Dot subplots and let's say we want a dashboard with two

44

00:02:58,260  -->  00:02:58,830
by two.

45

00:02:58,830  -->  00:03:04,480
So four in total four plots on the dashboard and you can see it's rather small right now so let's increase

46

00:03:04,490  -->  00:03:10,020
settler's go and say Fig's size equals 15 15.

47

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:11,280
So if I were on that.

48

00:03:11,280  -->  00:03:13,630
Now you can see that it's bigger.

49

00:03:13,710  -->  00:03:14,210
OK.

50

00:03:14,280  -->  00:03:15,570
That's good.

51

00:03:15,570  -->  00:03:18,880
And what we want to do now is we want to start populating these.

52

00:03:18,900  -->  00:03:26,430
But before we do let's change the styling let's say as soon as Dot said style so Seaborn that said style

53

00:03:26,430  -->  00:03:29,450
and all say dark grid.

54

00:03:29,490  -->  00:03:30,790
So now we have the grid.

55

00:03:31,050  -->  00:03:35,340
OK beautiful so what are we going to populate these plots with.

56

00:03:35,340  -->  00:03:41,580
Well let's go through our chart and let's decide which ones we might want to see in the final dashboard

57

00:03:41,580  -->  00:03:42,250
.

58

00:03:42,270  -->  00:03:46,380
It's totally up to you you can choose any one of them or just follow along with the code.

59

00:03:46,380  -->  00:03:51,690
So what I'm going to choose I would like to see this one this one so these two that we've already put

60

00:03:51,690  -->  00:03:58,350
in dush in our previous dashboard then I'd like to see the violent plot in the results and to finish

61

00:03:58,350  -->  00:03:58,890
off.

62

00:03:58,950  -->  00:04:02,340
I would like to see this beautiful Katipunan.

63

00:04:02,340  -->  00:04:05,210
I know there's quite a few Kaytee plus but they are quite useful.

64

00:04:05,250  -->  00:04:08,260
And that's kind of going to be the theme of our dashboard.

65

00:04:08,280  -->  00:04:09,440
So what are we going to do here.

66

00:04:09,450  -->  00:04:15,030
We're going to actually copy these lines of code and we'll just take that all of that including the

67

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:18,590
limit and move it over here.

68

00:04:18,590  -->  00:04:19,130
There you go.

69

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:22,630
So now we've got K-1 equals as soon as Cady plot.

70

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:24,860
Movies budget millions movies.

71

00:04:24,870  -->  00:04:26,110
Audience ratings.

72

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:29,220
And then a x equals x rays axes.

73

00:04:29,250  -->  00:04:37,350
So this axes and this time it's not just 0 because as you remember we discussed axes is now a two dimensional

74

00:04:37,350  -->  00:04:38,030
object.

75

00:04:38,100  -->  00:04:44,290
So we have to parse the exact coordinates we want to put this chart over here so it will be 0 0.

76

00:04:44,510  -->  00:04:47,600
And just so that it looks better.

77

00:04:47,610  -->  00:04:50,910
We're going to move that to a new line some of this one here.

78

00:04:50,940  -->  00:04:55,700
So the second one we want to put it on the second spot so there's going to be road zero column one.

79

00:04:55,760  -->  00:05:01,820
Remember numeration starts from zero and then said lym is going to be minus 22 and 60 so will keep it

80

00:05:01,820  -->  00:05:02,480
like that for now.

81

00:05:02,490  -->  00:05:09,770
But notice that we're not using share X for they're sharing the access and therefore this limit will

82

00:05:09,770  -->  00:05:11,420
only apply to the first plot.

83

00:05:11,430  -->  00:05:14,620
So let's have a look at that by click shift enter.

84

00:05:14,690  -->  00:05:16,460
You'll see that there it is.

85

00:05:16,460  -->  00:05:21,310
So the limit did apply only to the first part minus 20 to 160 the second plot is still up to 300 or

86

00:05:21,310  -->  00:05:21,830
above.

87

00:05:21,990  -->  00:05:27,290
So we can either show the axes but because we've got other plots involved it might not be the best idea

88

00:05:27,300  -->  00:05:27,750
right now.

89

00:05:27,750  -->  00:05:32,990
So until we know how they look and what axes they request we are just going to set the X limb for the

90

00:05:33,000  -->  00:05:35,660
second plot by itself.

91

00:05:35,730  -->  00:05:36,550
So there we go.

92

00:05:36,560  -->  00:05:39,350
That's that's our first plot that's our second plot.

93

00:05:39,380  -->  00:05:40,840
Now we want to populate these two.

94

00:05:40,920  -->  00:05:43,680
So let's put the violent plot in here.

95

00:05:43,700  -->  00:05:44,630
Go up.

96

00:05:44,630  -->  00:05:49,210
So for example if you want to mix it up you can use a box plot just to practice something else.

97

00:05:49,230  -->  00:05:54,180
Or if you'd like for long with the code as it is then feel free just to use the while employed as well

98

00:05:54,180  -->  00:05:54,750
.

99

00:05:54,750  -->  00:06:00,210
So if I scroll down now as you can see it's very straightforward you just copy the code that you've

100

00:06:00,200  -->  00:06:04,060
already created and you place it into your charts.

101

00:06:04,060  -->  00:06:07,900
Just don't forget to specify a x as Xs.

102

00:06:08,050  -->  00:06:12,430
Now with the violin Plaut we also need to finish off this code.

103

00:06:12,480  -->  00:06:17,430
So if I just run this now you'll notice that of course it's not specific.

104

00:06:17,550  -->  00:06:22,100
Even though the van plot is being added to the dashboard it's all being added where we wanted to be

105

00:06:22,110  -->  00:06:25,640
added is just being added to the last plot that was created on the dashboard.

106

00:06:25,740  -->  00:06:27,750
The last plotting space.

107

00:06:27,750  -->  00:06:30,020
So we need to specify exactly where we wanted to go.

108

00:06:30,020  -->  00:06:34,480
Will say X equals axes and then we'll say first.

109

00:06:34,610  -->  00:06:37,260
So this is our first roll call them number zero.

110

00:06:37,500  -->  00:06:44,460
So if I do that and run this doesn't really matter what name you give to the Plaut they go.

111

00:06:44,450  -->  00:06:47,100
Now it's been placed in the correct space.

112

00:06:47,600  -->  00:06:51,190
OK so I copy this remove that there.

113

00:06:51,310  -->  00:06:51,760
All right.

114

00:06:51,770  -->  00:06:54,530
And finally we want to put one more in here.

115

00:06:54,840  -->  00:07:01,360
So let's go ahead and select that last Katie plot that we wanted to add this one over here.

116

00:07:01,400  -->  00:07:03,550
The beautiful Katy plot.

117

00:07:03,760  -->  00:07:04,930
Got two parts to it.

118

00:07:04,940  -->  00:07:10,590
Is got the feeling and then it's got the outline so we're going to copy everything because as you remember

119

00:07:10,590  -->  00:07:13,880
we can put two plots into one plotting space.

120

00:07:13,880  -->  00:07:18,220
So if my space specify this here so for now let's comment this out.

121

00:07:18,240  -->  00:07:20,200
We won't be running this right now.

122

00:07:20,250  -->  00:07:21,680
This will call.

123

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:22,970
It's called K4.

124

00:07:23,270  -->  00:07:25,080
As NSK the plot.

125

00:07:25,280  -->  00:07:26,030
That's correct.

126

00:07:26,030  -->  00:07:29,350
And then we just want to add where exactly it will go.

127

00:07:29,750  -->  00:07:34,290
So here will say X-C cause let's fix this up a bit.

128

00:07:34,450  -->  00:07:35,900
Sickles axes.

129

00:07:36,140  -->  00:07:39,820
So this one's going to roll one column one so far on this.

130

00:07:39,870  -->  00:07:43,640
That's going to add the plot to that last block.

131

00:07:43,940  -->  00:07:44,420
That's correct.

132

00:07:44,430  -->  00:07:49,130
But now you can see it's a bit edgy and that's because we haven't added the outline as you remember

133

00:07:49,140  -->  00:07:51,230
we can add several plots into one.

134

00:07:51,240  -->  00:07:59,240
So for instance I can add this k k for B S and S K D plot and then we're going to just keep it like

135

00:07:59,250  -->  00:08:06,410
that and then just for example I'm going to say axes just to explain the whole concept.

136

00:08:06,410  -->  00:08:11,400
I'm going to say X He's 0 0 so I'm going to add this outline onto the wrong plot.

137

00:08:11,390  -->  00:08:14,810
I'm going to add it to here and we'll see what that looks like.

138

00:08:14,810  -->  00:08:15,290
There you go.

139

00:08:15,290  -->  00:08:19,530
So you can see that outline that was supposed to be out on top of this plot has been added to the wrong

140

00:08:19,520  -->  00:08:25,580
plot but it's just to illustrate that these two concepts are these two Charsadda separate the filling

141

00:08:25,620  -->  00:08:26,730
and the outline.

142

00:08:26,780  -->  00:08:32,300
We're just adding it for styling purposes and now we're going to overlay it on top of our actual plot

143

00:08:32,410  -->  00:08:32,940
here.

144

00:08:33,120  -->  00:08:36,010
So just remember how that looks and looks a bit edgy.

145

00:08:36,020  -->  00:08:42,740
It's not a smooth and an outline doesn't look like there's a contour so far on this it will make it

146

00:08:42,750  -->  00:08:44,390
look much neater.

147

00:08:44,420  -->  00:08:49,210
There you go you can now see it looks very nice and neat and very well presented.

148

00:08:49,230  -->  00:08:51,330
So that's exactly what we wanted.

149

00:08:51,360  -->  00:08:53,210
So those are the things we want.

150

00:08:53,250  -->  00:08:57,990
Now here we want to fix this up because we don't want to see that we want to just see the plots against

151

00:08:57,990  -->  00:09:00,930
a plot show BLT dog show.

152

00:09:00,990  -->  00:09:05,200
OK so now we don't see that line at the top we just see the plot.

153

00:09:05,200  -->  00:09:06,970
That's that's beautiful.

154

00:09:06,990  -->  00:09:15,180
And that is what I wanted to discuss here so you can see that it's pretty simple to add charts that

155

00:09:15,170  -->  00:09:19,940
you've already created into a dashboard you just pretty much copy the code and then add this line a

156

00:09:19,940  -->  00:09:23,610
x equals X is now one more thing that we need to look at.

157

00:09:23,610  -->  00:09:29,600
Here is what if we want to add a plot that is not a seaborn plot into our diagram.

158

00:09:29,730  -->  00:09:34,310
So here you can see that in the dashboard we've got only seaborne plots they're all asinus.

159

00:09:34,620  -->  00:09:40,290
What if you want to add one that's not a seaborn plotless go find one and see how we can at it.

160

00:09:40,700  -->  00:09:47,340
So let's say for instance let's say this plot plotted on hist for the critic ratings right.

161

00:09:47,370  -->  00:09:51,450
So we're going take this and you know that's.

162

00:09:51,460  -->  00:09:56,160
And now I'm going to copy it into our code just like we did with the seaborne part.

163

00:09:56,320  -->  00:10:02,300
So let's say I want to replace this last diagram with that plot that I have copied just now.

164

00:10:02,530  -->  00:10:03,650
So let's say there it is.

165

00:10:03,670  -->  00:10:11,050
And I would just do the same old say Komarr a x equals x he's won one so far on this which he'll see

166

00:10:11,050  -->  00:10:13,090
is I will get an error.

167

00:10:13,090  -->  00:10:13,800
You get an error.

168

00:10:13,810  -->  00:10:18,210
And what it's saying is enter got multiple values from argument a x.

169

00:10:18,220  -->  00:10:23,770
So basically and there is nothing in our plot what is happening here is that for non seaborne plots

170

00:10:24,250  -->  00:10:25,940
the procedures are a bit different.

171

00:10:25,940  -->  00:10:33,010
It's so Seaborn actually it's a situation where there was a standard approach and then Seaborn had to

172

00:10:33,010  -->  00:10:38,110
change legs that's a way to think about it that a seaborne plus use a different approach to the standard

173

00:10:38,110  -->  00:10:38,350
approach.

174

00:10:38,350  -->  00:10:44,640
So the standard approach is actually not to specify asexuals axes but it's to say axes.

175

00:10:44,680  -->  00:10:50,650
So instead of PBT down here as you say axes one one that you specify where you want to plot you were

176

00:10:50,650  -->  00:10:57,010
specifying we're going to plot in here and then you say Daut and then you specify a char so if I run

177

00:10:57,010  -->  00:10:59,210
this this time it should work.

178

00:10:59,530  -->  00:11:00,140
Let's have a look.

179

00:11:00,130  -->  00:11:05,450
So if I scroll down you can see that our charts in there are we didn't comment out the outline.

180

00:11:05,470  -->  00:11:08,770
So let's come in and outline it looks pretty cool though.

181

00:11:09,070  -->  00:11:11,060
So if I scroll down you can see there's our chart.

182

00:11:11,080  -->  00:11:17,860
It has been placed in there so that is the standard pipelined approach and you can look up more of this

183

00:11:18,190  -->  00:11:22,390
information if you check out the PI plot page.

184

00:11:22,390  -->  00:11:25,420
So let me show you this page.

185

00:11:25,420  -->  00:11:25,660
All right.

186

00:11:25,660  -->  00:11:32,440
So this is the map plot Lippa page for pi plot or it's got some examples of the subplots So this is

187

00:11:32,440  -->  00:11:38,590
subplot demo and you can go you can find it at my pod libbed org slash example slush pile AB underscore

188

00:11:38,590  -->  00:11:43,360
examples slash subplots underscore demo dot html or you can just google for it.

189

00:11:43,360  -->  00:11:45,100
It'll be one of the top results.

190

00:11:45,100  -->  00:11:51,280
And so here's a few examples of how the dashboards that they have been created here and you can read

191

00:11:51,280  -->  00:11:54,880
through these to get a better grasp around Pipelet.

192

00:11:54,970  -->  00:11:57,140
Or actually subplots how to use them.

193

00:11:57,400  -->  00:12:04,510
But in this case what we did is we just said the plot space that we want to add a char to Daut and then

194

00:12:04,510  -->  00:12:05,650
the chart that we want to add.

195

00:12:05,650  -->  00:12:08,710
So that's how it works with seaborne you can do the same thing.

196

00:12:08,710  -->  00:12:13,780
So for instance if I wanted to let's say with a violent plot I wanted to do the same thing.

197

00:12:14,050  -->  00:12:22,780
Let's say I want to remove this and instead of S as well and plot out say a second so remove that instead

198

00:12:22,780  -->  00:12:24,030
of s and as that will implode.

199

00:12:24,040  -->  00:12:31,630
I would say same thing axes 1 0 1 plus if I try to run this then that will cause an error.

200

00:12:31,780  -->  00:12:35,890
Now you can see that that doesn't work so well in plot doesn't appear and actually the second plot doesn't

201

00:12:35,890  -->  00:12:38,300
appear either because it comes after the world plot.

202

00:12:38,410  -->  00:12:46,190
So what is going on here is that you can call violin Plaut from axes because axes is a PI plot object

203

00:12:46,190  -->  00:12:46,210
.

204

00:12:46,210  -->  00:12:51,880
So this is important on this and this is the fundamentals around how does all this stuff work so axes

205

00:12:51,880  -->  00:12:56,520
is being created over here right so f axes comes from Piel tee'd dot subplots.

206

00:12:56,590  -->  00:13:04,300
So basically you can see right away that axes just as f is a PI plot generated object.

207

00:13:04,300  -->  00:13:08,740
So that means axes is created within the pipeline package.

208

00:13:08,740  -->  00:13:14,320
And if it does have access to certain functions and methods then they will all be PI plot.

209

00:13:14,500  -->  00:13:18,270
The thing about seaborne is that Seaborn is an upgrade on top of pipelined.

210

00:13:18,280  -->  00:13:19,790
It's like an add on.

211

00:13:19,840  -->  00:13:25,900
So therefore X has no way of knowing about things that are contained within the seaborne package because

212

00:13:26,210  -->  00:13:30,990
Pipelet is a basis package seaborne comes on top of pipeline.

213

00:13:31,150  -->  00:13:35,920
So xes has no visibility of Katie Plaut a violin Plaut and so on.

214

00:13:35,920  -->  00:13:43,000
So even though you can call axes dot hissed you cannot call axes dot violently because hearsay is also

215

00:13:43,000  -->  00:13:45,860
part of the pipeline package right.

216

00:13:45,880  -->  00:13:52,420
It's not part of Seaborn as part of pipelined and therefore axes does have visibility of hist but axes

217

00:13:52,420  -->  00:13:54,730
will not have visibility or bandplan.

218

00:13:54,730  -->  00:14:01,840
So hopefully all that makes sense and thats why for the violent plot we need to say Zed equals violent

219

00:14:01,870  -->  00:14:05,110
Plaut and then here will say x.

220

00:14:05,200  -->  00:14:11,680
This is the way that the seaborne guys have circumvented that problem that you cannot call axes not

221

00:14:11,690  -->  00:14:16,520
violent plots so theyre saying how about we just pause an extra argument inside our Seaborn functions

222

00:14:16,540  -->  00:14:23,200
so here we get to say S and S in all Seaborn functions and will called a X and that will specify where

223

00:14:23,200  -->  00:14:23,710
it needs to go.

224

00:14:23,710  -->  00:14:28,450
So its kind of two different methodologies and the only reason they're different is because seaborne

225

00:14:28,450  -->  00:14:34,300
came later than pipelined and therefore had to come up with a new approach and approach to circumvent

226

00:14:34,300  -->  00:14:39,190
the problem that Pipelet objects don't have visibility of Seaborn objects.

227

00:14:39,190  -->  00:14:43,230
So if I run this you'll see that everything works just fine.

228

00:14:43,600  -->  00:14:49,960
All right so now let's let's remove this distribution and let's replace it with our Keady plot that

229

00:14:49,960  -->  00:14:56,710
we wanted originally but that was just to illustrate that indeed we can put any type of plot's into

230

00:14:56,710  -->  00:15:02,350
our dashboard sometimes it might just require a bit of research just to make sure how that plot is going

231

00:15:02,350  -->  00:15:07,060
to be placed in there what the methodology is because some packages come before others some come after

232

00:15:07,060  -->  00:15:07,720
.

233

00:15:07,720  -->  00:15:14,410
But at the end of the day it's all possible and you get some beautiful dashboards as a result.

234

00:15:14,410  -->  00:15:16,210
So let's see this one pop up.

235

00:15:16,330  -->  00:15:16,900
There it is.

236

00:15:16,900  -->  00:15:18,020
I might zoom out a bit.

237

00:15:18,220  -->  00:15:20,380
Let's put it 100 percent.

238

00:15:20,380  -->  00:15:24,190
There you go so you can see it's a lovely lovely dashboard which you can including report.

239

00:15:24,460  -->  00:15:27,160
So hopefully enjoy this tutorial we had some practice.

240

00:15:27,160  -->  00:15:30,140
We put some charts together you could see it was pretty simple.

241

00:15:30,140  -->  00:15:34,180
Just after you've prepared those charges you just copy them into a dashboard.

242

00:15:34,180  -->  00:15:39,720
Also we talked about some theory some fundamentals how things happen in the background or in the back

243

00:15:39,720  -->  00:15:45,940
end of Pi thin white packages some some packages have some certain approaches and some packages.

244

00:15:46,020  -->  00:15:52,180
So some other approaches and also we had a look at where you can find more information on subplots.

245

00:15:52,210  -->  00:15:54,200
So lots of information this tutorial.

246

00:15:54,250  -->  00:15:56,800
Hope you're digesting this quite well.

247

00:15:56,800  -->  00:16:02,680
Practice that tried put in some different Plus we've created lots of plots in this section try put some

248

00:16:02,680  -->  00:16:07,420
different plots into your dashboard make you maybe make a dashboard bigger maybe make it a three by

249

00:16:07,420  -->  00:16:09,210
three or four by three.

250

00:16:09,250  -->  00:16:11,240
Try adding different Plus see how you go.

251

00:16:11,530  -->  00:16:17,530
And in the next tutorial we're going to have some exciting new features we're going to learn how to

252

00:16:17,530  -->  00:16:22,960
style our dashboards so I'll give you some tips on styling dashboards to make them look fantastic and

253

00:16:22,960  -->  00:16:24,190
I look forward to seeing you there.

254

00:16:24,220  -->  00:16:25,690
Until next time happy coding

255

00:16:28,030  -->  00:16:30,450
.
