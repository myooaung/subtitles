00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,370
Hello this is Carol from Fargo dot com and welcome to the 21st tutorial on algorithmic trading for beginners.

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,070
And this is going to be a very exciting tutorial because we're moving onto a new section which is called

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,900
putting everything together.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,630
And as you can tell from the name of the section we're actually going to be putting all of the knowledge

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:37,200
we've accumulated so far in MQ all four we're going to putting it all into action and we will be building

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,310
our first standalone fully functional for X robot.

7
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,190
And I hope you guys are excited as me and this is going to be fun.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,040
It's going to be a very interesting thing.

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:01,050
This is the second last section after this we will just have one short section for a course summary

10
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,110
where we'll wrap up the course.

11
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,340
So pay attention this is where all the magic happens.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,650
All right.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,940
And today we're talking about expert advisors and I'm kill for you so far.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,190
If you have noticed we've been working with scripts predominantly and it was a very convenient way to

15
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,910
learn the language and to understand how basic trading operations are executed.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,750
However when we move on to creating Forex robots or standalone algorithmic trading systems which can

17
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:42,870
function over a long period of time and our new profits we will be working with expert advisors.

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,930
Well that's that's the name they're given in em kill for and it's arrogance.

19
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:54,200
Find out what the main difference is between them and the scripts that we've been looking at.

20
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,980
So let's have a look.

21
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,150
This is a script Well this is how a script works.

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:08,270
We attach a script to a chart and then the script is executed it has a start of execution and a finish.

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:15,970
Basically any program has a start of execution and a finish for the script the way it works is assume

24
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,390
you attach it to the chart that On-Star function that within the body of which we've been writing all

25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,060
of our code it gets cold.

26
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:35,540
And as soon as it is it is executed when that function finishes working the script completes its life.

27
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,600
And basically that's it.

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,090
The execution has been completed.

29
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:49,140
Whereas expert advisors are a bit different expert advisors are designed to continue working for a long

30
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:56,160
period of time and the execution part likelike and you program.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,100
They have a start and finish because sooner or later you'll probably close them take them off the chart

32
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,020
or close a terminal or something.

33
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,920
But until that happens this is how it works.

34
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,690
First of all the there's three functions three main functions within an expert advisor.

35
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:24,180
And originally the ON IN IT function is called and that allows your program to set up the environment

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,400
it wants to work and do some in the initializations of variables and so on.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,490
So that function gets execute only once when the program is when the expert advisor is launched.

38
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:46,630
Then there's the tick function and that is the main working function that's like the the main body or

39
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,030
the heart if you will of the expert adviser.

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:59,010
And what it does is it gets executed on every tick so every time a tick comes in to your terminal meaning

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:09,930
a new price or change in price in the instrument that exported Wiser's is attached to every time a new

42
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,620
tick arrives this function gets executed gets executed and then the expert advice waits for another

43
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,580
tick to arrive and then gets executed again and again and again and so on.

44
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:28,740
So that just keeps happening until the expert advisor is taken off the chart and that there may be may

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,680
be many causes to why it's taken off the chart or why it has been forced to complete its execution.

46
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:44,490
And once that happens when the execution is complete the expert advises still has a few brief moments

47
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:53,250
to finalize its work by actually calling on DNA to function and that function just cleans up or basically

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,210
any code that you put in there will be executed upon termination of expertize.

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,190
So that's how they look.

50
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,540
Schematically what the different looks like between the scripts and expert advisers might be a bit hard

51
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,180
to grasp before actually looking at the code understanding and having a feel for what's happening so

52
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,730
why don't we just jump to Mitta editor and have a look there.

53
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,740
And so this is meant as sir and here are the scripts that we've been working with.

54
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:30,330
And now we're going to create a new expert analyzer which should appear in this different folders separate

55
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,440
folder for experts.

56
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,530
It should appear here.

57
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,920
So now we're going to look at new years.

58
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,250
As usual we'll use them for Wizard.

59
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,040
But this time will select expert adviser up here.

60
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,940
We will call this expert adviser.

61
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,010
My first D.A. and will stick to that name throughout the throughout the section.

62
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,480
So just building up on that same file.

63
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,120
Don't forget to put your credentials in there next.

64
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,340
We don't need to click anything here.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,120
Nothing here either.

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,760
And there we go.

67
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,540
Click Finish.

68
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,020
And as you can see the template has been set up.

69
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,200
And the expert advice that has appeared here my first E-A.

70
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:28,040
And as you can see there's three functions on it on d it and on tick.

71
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,540
So this function gets executed.

72
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,280
Initially this function gets executed when the expert visor is terminated and this function gets execute

73
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,420
on every take.

74
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:46,410
So for further ado let's populate some text or some test function some test code into these functions

75
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,430
and see how they'll work.

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:00,000
So when we attach the expert adviser to the chart why don't we say tell the trade of that it has been

77
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,290
attached.

78
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,350
Launched

79
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:23,850
There we go then on tick every time a new tech arrives Usually it would have some analysis here or some

80
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:31,350
sort of rule based decision making which we'll talk about in the next tutorial.

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,120
But for now we'll just also have an alert.

82
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:42,710
We'll just put an alert in here saying that maybe we'll tell the trade of what the new bid price is

83
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,700
the price is.

84
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,430
And then as we remember we need to concatenate it.

85
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:03,630
So put a string in here and we'll look for the bid price which is the in-built bid variable.

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:13,160
I hope by now that you're relatively comfortable with this type of statement.

87
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,470
And finally on Dean at functionals say Alert.

88
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,950
Expert adviser terminated about that.

89
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,070
All right let's compile that no errors or warnings.

90
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,450
Go to the terminal and see what happens here.

91
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,440
So there's your adult chart

92
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,600
there that's our count and now we usually we looked for scripts in the scripts tab or folder.

93
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,740
Now we're going to look in the expert as well.

94
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,590
Here is my first E.A..

95
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,100
So if we dragged that over right away we all see this Pop-Pop because expert advisors normally have

96
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,050
external variables but ours doesn't at the moment.

97
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,140
So I'll just let let it play.

98
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,820
As you can see expert wise has been launched.

99
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:16,310
Now the program is waiting for a new tech to arrive for it to do something about it.

100
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,030
So let's just hold on hold on patiently.

101
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,610
See what happens when it does arrive.

102
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,480
There we go.

103
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,130
And as you can see Tich has arrived and the price has changed.

104
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,000
Now we'll wait for another take

105
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,170
the.

106
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,450
There you go.

107
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,760
As you can see quite a few tricks have arrived.

108
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:47,230
Every time the expert advises telling us what the new Price is all right now we will terminate the expert

109
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,700
adviser and see if we get a message.

110
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:57,220
So we right click on the chart and we look at expert advisors and we will remove our expert advice and

111
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,740
expert advice removed.

112
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,680
And as you can see we have a message here expert adviser terminated.

113
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,770
So there you go.

114
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:13,510
That's what expert advisers are in a nutshell and how they're structured internally.

115
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,060
And we will be building up on that structure going forward.

116
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:27,120
And in this is coming towards will create our very first standalone trading robot.

117
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,720
And thank you very much for watching and have a play around with that.

118
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,400
I hope to see you on the next tutorial.

119
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,740
Until then happy coding.
