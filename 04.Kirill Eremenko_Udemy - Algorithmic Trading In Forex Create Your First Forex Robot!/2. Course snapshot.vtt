Hello this is Carol from frigs dot com.

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.670
And welcome to this course and algorithmic trading and Emco for complete beginners.

3
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.950
I'm really excited to have you on board.

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.290
And in this short video I'm going to outline the highlights of the score so that you know what to expect.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.500
We will start off by installing a trade or four and then we will learn how to open a free demo account

6
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.670
which we'll use for testing.

7
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.200
There we will create a very first program which will say Hello World.

8
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.890
We'll learn how to launch that program and a traitor for next will learn the fundamentals of met kill

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.390
for any programming language study loops and so on.

10
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.050
In parallel we'll be discussing training system design and we will also be working with prices very

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.970
quickly will understand how we can use inputs from the trader in our systems and very soon we'll open

12
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.590
our very first order and empty for.

13
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.430
We will also learn how to close orders and establish failsafe mechanisms so programs always work correctly.

14
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.360
Finally together we will come up with a trading strategy idea for the British LBJ's doll which will

15
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.980
then put into a schematic diagram which I call it training such blueprint because it makes a logic very

16
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.790
clear.

17
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.000
I will also teach you how to create these diagrams for free on line and how to make them look awesome

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.780
in case you're presenting them to somebody else in this course you will also learn how to use the meditator

19
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.780
for strategy tester and how to run back tests for your algorithmic trading system.

20
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.260
We will also learn how to improve the trading system by adding filters after the code has already been

21
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.480
finalized and tested.

22
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.140
And the best part is that at the end of the course we learn how to optimize our trading strategy which

23
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.560
will allow us to turn off forex robot into a fully functional standalone profitable arrhythmic trading

24
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.730
system.

25
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.120
I hope you found this brief overview useful and that you're as excited about the source as I am and

26
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.510
I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

27
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.900
Until then happy coding.
