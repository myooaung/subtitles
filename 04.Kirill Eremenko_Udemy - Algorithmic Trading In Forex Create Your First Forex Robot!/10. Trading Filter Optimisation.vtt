00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.940
Hello this is Kiril from for Expo dotcom and welcome to the 30 of tutorial on algorithmic trading for

2
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.110
beginners.

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.090
Wow 30 to.

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.740
It feels like an anniversary to be honest and I'm really excited.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:30.010
Thanks a lot for sticking around for 30 tutorials this has been great fun and we're needed there.

6
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.450
This we're ending.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.280
We're nearing the completion of the course and we just got a few more tutorials to go.

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.610
So in the previous tutorial we learned how to add a filter to our algorithmic trading system.

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.330
And in this tutorial we'll be comparing the performance of our system before we added a filter and after

10
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.230
we added a filter.

11
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:04.280
So here in front of you on your screen you can see the results of our very first test of the new system

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.810
version.

13
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.180
A simple system version 2.0 where the filter has already been added and as you can see the filters work

14
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.630
well there are only cell orders.

15
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:23.370
The red ones above the white line and they're only by orders being created below the white line which

16
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.420
which means everything is fine.

17
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.950
So now let's go ahead and compare performance before and after and what we will start with is we'll

18
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.470
go back to simple system.

19
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.350
The original one and here I still have the optimization results for simple system.

20
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.150
This is an optimization chart which you've seen before and what it will do is we'll take the first the

21
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.220
most profitable set of parameters set them as inputs and we'll run a test.

22
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.650
So we run that.

23
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.330
And as you can see there's this graph which we've seen before with the rapid increase at the start.

24
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.720
This will go to the report tab will right click and we'll save as report and this will allow us to save

25
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.200
this report to let it compare with what happens after we had the filter.

26
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.640
So we'll call it simple system version 1 Set 1 and we'll save that.

27
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.940
And what this gives us is a file which is automatically open in your browser and it's got the summary

28
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.690
of the test.

29
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.230
Up here it's got a chart and go to all the trades down here which don't really concern us.

30
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.340
What we're looking at is the chart of the summary at this stage.

31
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.680
So that's the very first result.

32
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.800
And as you remember tutorials ago we looked at the fourth result as well so how about we said Have a

33
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.920
look at Darren as well now so will set input parameters run the test.

34
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.240
There's that chart that we're used to report the same report as.

35
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.690
And we'll say simple system version 1 and is going to be set for we'll save that and they go there our

36
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.370
gradually increasing.

37
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.470
So two different sets of parameters with two different results both results are good.

38
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.830
Let's see if we can improve these with a filter.

39
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:27.200
So in order to do that we're going to go to a simple system version 2.0 and now we're going to go into

40
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.830
expert properties and to start with.

41
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.980
We're going to set the result set the parameters which which yielded this result.

42
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.850
So let's have a look at this lineup here.

43
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.830
It has a list of parameters and I'll just zoom in a bit so you can see better.

44
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.150
So there they are.

45
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.750
The hour was eight take profit 40 plus 60.

46
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.660
So let's set that our 8 take profit 40 plus 60.

47
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.880
So what we've done is we've said exactly the same parameters as in simple system but now we have this

48
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.160
Amay period.

49
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.040
And listen you parameters so let's leave it at 100 for now click OK.

50
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.440
I'll just zoom out of that for now.

51
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:22.820
It will click OK and now we'll run this test and let's see what happens what has happened.

52
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.110
I will say this as a report and this one will call simple system version 2 set.

53
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.080
Save that and now let's compare them side by side.

54
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.000
So that's the new result and that is the old result in the old result.

55
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.110
Total net profit was eight thousand three hundred twenty seven dollars and the near result the total

56
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.490
net profit is only 4600 $18.

57
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.910
So you can't even tell from the chart that the result is a much better and there's less trade.

58
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.010
And also the total net profit is much lower.

59
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.520
So in this case the filter is not doing a good job at improving the system.

60
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.050
Let's have a look at this set of parameters.

61
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.140
So this is a simple system but the fourth set.

62
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.300
Now we're going to try and prove this we're fulfilled to start our STEM take profit or 100 star plus

63
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.090
40.

64
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.420
Let's set those start our turn take Prof.

65
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.370
So Saro term take profit a hundred plus 40 and moving arge period we'll still leave it at a hundred

66
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.640
at this stage.

67
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.150
Will click OK.

68
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.230
Run the test.

69
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.870
Look at the report save the report as we will say it.

70
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:55.210
A simple system version version 2 set for save that I'll just zoom out of this report.

71
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.400
And now we can compare compare them side by side so this is what we had.

72
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.320
That's what we have now.

73
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.920
As you can see right away from the chart system the performance has deteriorated and moreover the profit

74
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.750
was seven thousand eight hundred.

75
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.470
Now it's only three thousand four hundred dollars.

76
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.710
So once again we can say that the filter is not doing a good job at improving the system.

77
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.290
However this does not mean a yet that we should discard the filter.

78
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:35.060
This is because we have always in both cases we've used the value of 100 as the period of the moving

79
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.910
average.

80
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.790
And what does that mean.

81
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:44.480
That means that we've somehow come up with this value and we think it is the best value and it will

82
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.460
do the job.

83
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.340
But that may not necessarily be the case and we've automated trading.

84
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.510
We can actually check that.

85
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.640
And this is why I actually love algorithmic trading systems.

86
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:07.850
We can do tests which we would which would take very long periods of time to do by hand.

87
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.220
And I'll show you an example right now.

88
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:18.100
So now we are looking at this fourth set of 10 140 and we said the M.A. period to 100.

89
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:26.270
So how about we take a period by itself and we optimize it will click this we'll check the box on the

90
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:33.350
left and we'll optimize it to see what in reality is the optimum value of this period.

91
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:39.180
So we'll optimize it starting from 10 with a step of ten and we'll stop at 100.

92
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.850
And this is very similar to what we discussed in testing and optimization to Torro.

93
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.370
But in this case we're only optimizing one parameter of the M8 period.

94
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.440
We're going to leave these as they were click OK.

95
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.960
Now we have to click optimization checkbox here will until Brazil is visual mode.

96
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:06.950
So optimization is ticked and will click start and as you can see there was only 10 tests that terminal

97
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.940
had to do.

98
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:14.960
We go into optimization graph you can see these faint dots here and from them you can tell that the

99
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.110
most profitable was the very first iteration.

100
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:27.440
And if we go to optimization results the most profitable was iteration number one where the M-A period

101
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.060
was equal to 10.

102
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.910
So we'll Right-Click said as in prepared prepare.

103
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.230
We'll just quickly check them.

104
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.270
So 10 140 those haven't changed.

105
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.210
But the M-ID period is now 10.

106
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.980
So now let's have a look at what this will give us.

107
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.660
Can switch a visual mode back on make sure optimization is off.

108
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:53.580
And now let's look at the report let's say of this report as simple system version to set for.

109
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.540
And now we'll call this one optimized safe.

110
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.710
And now let's see this is what we had originally.

111
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.540
This is what we got with a filter of MFL to have a period of 100.

112
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.160
And this is what we got off to we optimized it.

113
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.140
So now I'm just going to put this one.

114
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.650
We're going to get rid of this one.

115
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.830
The one that's not good.

116
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.620
Now we can compare side by side what we had before and what we have now after.

117
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.890
As you can see the chart has improved the the balance chart has improved and also the Tollner proffer

118
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.640
was sound thousand eight hundred.

119
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.690
Now it is eight thousand seven hundred dollars.

120
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.210
And so that means that our system is actually performing better with the filter.

121
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:48.800
And also you can notice that the total trades went down from 129 to 113 and that I'll resume in here

122
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.960
a little bit so that the results of the first first test original test and that's the new test.

123
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:04.100
So you can see as well that the total trials have gone down and that means that our system is doing

124
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:12.340
the filters doing a good job at cutting out some of those negative traits that have been creating losses

125
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.600
on our account.

126
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.460
And yeah so that means we have essentially been able to improve our trading strategy by adding this

127
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.790
moving average filter and that's that's great news that means we should keep the filter and just use

128
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.240
it in this in this setting.

129
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:41.680
And that completes our tutorials on creating algorithmic algorithmic trading system.

130
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:48.130
I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial in the next one we're going to recap on this whole section of putting

131
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.820
everything together.

132
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:58.600
If you would like to download the source code you can go you can visit me at w w w dot for export dot

133
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:06.060
com where I post all of the source codes that we create and hope to see at the next tutorial.

134
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.420
Until then happy coding.
