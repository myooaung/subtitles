Hello and welcome back to the course on algorithmic training for beginners in this quick tutorial I

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.900
would like to show you where you can download the source codes for these tutorials.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.100
So in this course of what we'll be doing is coding quite a bit for the foreign exchange market.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.440
And when we're coding you can always refer to the materials which show you know to download the source

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.310
codes and basically copy them off my web site.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.470
If you are running into any difficulties or if you need them to compare something or you know just play

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.150
around with them.

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.180
So here's the Web site and to get the source code you need to go to w w w dot for Expo dot com slash

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.860
source so s o u r c.

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.880
And here if you scroll down you'll find.

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.060
First of all of course as a disclaimer so make sure you agree to this disclaimer before proceeding and

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.410
that you agree that all of these are source codes and any other materials that you're downloading with

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.900
this course are exclusively for educational purposes.

14
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.290
And once or if you agree to the disclaimer if you scroll down you will see the links to the source code.

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.770
So here is a table and it's broken down into sections just like in the course and you can select the

16
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.040
tutorial that you're going through and just proceed to that tutorial by clicking the link.

17
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.520
So once you click the link the page and your page will pop up.

18
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.430
And here you have a code for this tutorial so you can just click here.

19
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.260
And in this mini You can just select this button and now you can just control C and control V and you'll

20
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.200
have the source code you can paste it wherever you like.

21
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.470
So that's the source code that's an example.

22
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.970
Another thing I wanted to show you is that as you proceed through the course and you move onto the more

23
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.700
advanced sections you will find that for some tutorials there are actually two source codes and that

24
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.070
is because there is one for the four digit broker.

25
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.310
So if you're using a four digit broker then this is the source code.

26
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.190
If using a five digit broker then this is the source code.

27
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.200
And in the tutorials you will find that we're using a four digit account.

28
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
But at the same time you might be using a 5 digit account.

29
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.110
Most likely are because since I've recorded these tutorials most brokers have now moved on to five digit

30
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.360
accounts.

31
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.100
So if something is not exactly working out then just make sure to check the source code.

32
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
And if you see that there's a code for five digit brokers then you'll be able to download it here and

33
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
has the required Corrections they're not complicated at all and they are comments in the code explaining

34
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.190
those corrections.

35
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.310
Also finally you'll see that in some of the source codes there's actually a video so the same video

36
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.610
you'll see in the tutorial it's also present on this Web site.

37
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330
Well these are just preview videos of the course.

38
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.530
So not every single video is available like this on the web site only a couple and that is just for

39
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.590
students who are considering taking this course so they can have a preview of the course the full course

40
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.750
and all of the videos that are present in the course are only available to those of you who have actually

41
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.840
enrolled in this course and hence you are watching this video right now.

42
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.380
OK so that's where you get the source codes.

43
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.660
One more thing I wanted to mention before we conclude this tutorial is that make sure to watch these

44
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.550
tutorials in HD so on your player there is a button to switch to HD mode because we will be coding and

45
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.920
the code can be a bit small sometimes in order to increase the visibility.

46
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.370
And for you to see things much clearer just make sure you're watching in the highest resolution possible.

47
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.570
And that's all for today.

48
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.380
I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

49
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.120
And until then happy coding.
