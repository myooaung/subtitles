00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.680
Hello this is Carol from Foxborough dot com.

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.020
And first of all congratulations if you've gotten this far doing great job you've just successfully

3
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.010
completed the first section of this course on programming in four.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.200
And today I just wanted to quickly recap what we and what we've been through what we've learned so far

5
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.060
and give you a short overview of my website.

6
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.550
The website I'm building for export dot com.

7
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.860
And so let's let's get straight into it.

8
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.350
So first bomb dot com is the site where you can find these tutorials and it's kind of a blog it's it's

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.550
my first blog and I'm just posting these videos here with brief descriptions.

10
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.910
As you can see the last one I posted here was about the switch Pereira tutorial part of Lebanon.

11
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.260
And so when you click more here you can go into the actual editorial page.

12
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.560
And here is a quick description of what we'll be talking about in the tutorial then he's got a link

13
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:24.000
to this free tutorial on YouTube so you can watch it right on the Web site and at the bottom.

14
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.470
It has a source code which I think is pretty important because sometimes you you might want to have

15
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.570
a look at it or copy it and fiddle around with it in your own editor.

16
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.010
It might not be as crucial in these initial chores that we've just been through because the code is

17
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.070
quite short but going forward we're going to be looking at a bit more complex programs and we're going

18
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.470
to have multiple modules within each program so it's always good to have the code in front of your eyes

19
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.320
if you do need to compare.

20
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.420
Here I have a few pages that not many at the moment just because I'm still building the web site but

21
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.820
you're welcome to come visit the main one.

22
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.310
That would probably be of interest to you is the courses page and here I'm going to publish all the

23
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.520
free courses that you're welcome to take and watch either on the Web site or Nuccio bar and any other

24
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.880
platform where you can find them.

25
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.940
And we're just going to use this today too quickly.

26
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.140
Like as a guide to see what we've studied so far.

27
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:50.080
So in the first tutorial we looked at a whole hello world program and that that was an exciting start

28
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.900
especially for for you if you've no program before.

29
00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:05.620
So I'm happy that we went through this hello world program and am kill for then into tural to look at

30
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.970
types of variables.

31
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.910
And here we discussed integer boolean double string color date time and other variables available variable

32
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.140
types variable.

33
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.740
Available in kill for.

34
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.310
That's an important and that is important to Tauriel for all foundation using variables.

35
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.690
Here we quickly understood how we can add subtract multiply variables how we can even add or concatenate

36
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.150
strings together and output all of these results.

37
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.650
Boolean operations and variables.

38
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.830
This is an important Tauriel.

39
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.440
I specifically decided to take boolean variables and look at them separately because they're important

40
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.650
in decision making processes and that's what that's going to be doing a lot of that on when trading

41
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.580
on the forex market.

42
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.640
And like for example when I say if the price is above a certain level then we'll do something if the

43
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.400
price below we'll do something else.

44
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.080
And all of that involves logical comparisons logical operations which are boolean operations and boolean

45
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.900
bear variables.

46
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.520
So next was the wild loop where we looked at our first method of creating an iterative process.

47
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.600
So the while loop allows you to execute a certain block of code many times and possibly modifying it

48
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.430
in the process so basically execute multiple iterations or a block of code to achieve certain results

49
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:57.130
or outputs multiline comments was a quick brief short lecture to introduce a convenient way of hiding

50
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.920
separate blocks of code that you don't need and having to delete them.

51
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.280
And that I think that's an important step because it makes your programming life more convenient.

52
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.400
Because if he just common something that's like a whole block of code and then you should decide that

53
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.440
you want it back you don't have to recode it again.

54
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:28.420
The for loop is similar to the While loop but it's more Haddadi and more easy to use because it aggregates

55
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.520
all of the administrative function within its header and it's basically up to you whether you want to

56
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520
use the wild for a look.

57
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.540
Personally I prefer the for loop.

58
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:52.840
The if statement is it actually this part of our course is represented by three lectures if statement

59
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.440
else don't.

60
00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.040
Else if statement that will come in hand-in-hand and we gradually went through it from the IF statement

61
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.080
to the else and then to the else statement.

62
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.330
Just building up on the same bit of code.

63
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:16.030
And this is a very important part of kill for because it actually this if statement if else and else

64
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.310
if statements they facilitate the branching out of your code.

65
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.040
So basically you can isolate blocks of code and only execute them when certain conditions are met.

66
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:35.470
And as you can imagine trading the Forex market or any other market for a matter of fact it's a very

67
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.930
important part because you are going to be looking for certain conditions try to enter or exit or modify

68
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.990
your positions.

69
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.980
And finally the switch operator which also allows you to branch higher chip program but in a bit of

70
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:56.320
a in a bit more and a bit different way and this was this is not a compulsive liar or compulsory lecture

71
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.160
because I would encourage you to just use the if else else.

72
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.370
It's because they're a bit easier to understand and modify.

73
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.970
So that's that.

74
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.720
Hope you're enjoying the course so far.

75
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:22.850
I've prepared a short quiz for you which is just under this lecture and it's basically just 10 questions

76
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:30.090
from these first 10 Tarheels and hopefully you'll get them all right or most of them right.

77
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:38.370
And that will help you recap on your knowledge and I'll see you going in the next section of this course.

78
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.290
And so please feel free to visit for exposure and browse around here.

79
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.330
Thank you.

80
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.680
See.
