00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,950
Hello this is Carol from for example dot com.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,210
And welcome to the 20:8 tutorial on algorithmic trading for beginners.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,110
And in this tutorial we're going to be testing our very own algorithmic trading system.

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,520
So as you can see in front of you on your screen here we have already started testing our system a little

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,220
bit in the previous tutorial.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,370
And these are the results that we've got so far.

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:39,580
So from January to July the system was tested from January to July 2000 14 and there is as you can see

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,240
there's lots and lots of trades based simply put there's a one trade per day because it just opens an

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,330
order at 9 o'clock every day at this stage.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:59,120
And this is the result that we got there was like over 127 trades and from 10000 It went up to 11000

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,500
$435.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,970
So that's that's a very good result.

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:11,170
There's lots of elements to this testing those results graph report Journal settings and so on.

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:20,410
So that's what we're going to be discussing today how to use this strategy tester but we will we will

15
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:28,330
only have a brief overview of the strategy testor because it's such a complicated beast that you need

16
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:35,560
much more than just one to Tauriel to understand it properly and how to use it to its full extent but

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:44,890
will cover all the basics today just so that you can also quickly understand if your strategy is were

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,380
working on or not.

19
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,810
So I'm just going to bring up the magnifying glass and this should help you see better what's going

20
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,650
on so if you look at the bottom part of my screen you can see what I'm showing like it's it's magnifying

21
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,780
it a little bit so you can actually read text.

22
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,460
So this is a strategy tester and the way to bring it up.

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:17,200
There's a button over here up in Ameritrade or for which toggles the strategy tester here and the first

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,320
line you need to select your system.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,980
Now for your expert advisor for us it's going to be system simple system.

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,940
Next you need to select the currency pair and which you want to trade for us is going to be British

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,590
pound or what you can select any other currency if you like model.

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:45,630
No we're not going to go into too much detail about this but just probably stick to either every ticker

29
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,940
and control points control points that foster every tick has more quality modeling.

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,810
So we'll stick it will go of control points for now.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,960
Then on the right here we have a period is which period of the charge you want to use and this is important

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,200
because we were developing our system for the one hour chart.

33
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,670
We're going to be using the H1 period spread current well.

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,530
Check check with your broker what their average spread is and you can set it here if you want or you

35
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,880
can just use the current spread that they have on the market optimization.

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:28,060
For now we'll just keep that off use date is if you want to sort of specify a range of dates within

37
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,590
which you want to run the test visual mode.

38
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,760
I recommend keeping it on because that way you will see some charts similar to this so you won't just

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,800
see the results but you will actually see where the trades were conducted on the chart.

40
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,550
Skip to don't worry about that if that's that's rarely used That's if you want to skip part of your

41
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,490
testing and view a certain day is somewhere in the middle of your test.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:05,470
So then you need to also remember about these buttons or here so modify expert that opens I'm kill for

43
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,430
open chart.

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,580
I never use that button actually.

45
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,150
Simple properties.

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,740
It tells you the properties of symbols.

47
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:20,950
Same thing I don't often use as an expert property is very important but if we click export properties

48
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,640
here we can set certain rules around the testing.

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,730
Probably you're more

50
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,530
your by default your expert Eliza has this checkbox ticked.

51
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,810
So I'd like to ask you to take that please because this is a genetic algorithm we won't go into detail

52
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:51,370
what it is now we just need to know that we won't be using a genetic algorithm in this for X tutorials

53
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:00,490
for beginners of course because it is a bit more complex and we'll talk about it in a more advanced

54
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,060
course so we can check that.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,670
Probably leave the settings at 34.

56
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:14,510
Initial deposit and the currency and lower and short and balance just.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,460
That's that's all fine optimization.

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,060
Also we won't worry about this in this beginner's course.

59
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,090
And these are just more

60
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:37,270
lie they're just a bit more complicated parameters or parameters that allow you to enhance your optimization

61
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,590
expert advisers so inputs.

62
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:49,010
This is the main screen that you you need to work for this is where you change in preprograming as an

63
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,840
expert advisor for testing.

64
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,010
So start hour is nine at the moment.

65
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,880
That's what we think is the best.

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,820
Our take profits stop loss that's what we have chosen for our expanded rise.

67
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,390
Those are the defaults and lots as one.

68
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:10,090
So I'm just going to click OK here and I'm going to run the test as we did last time just by clicking

69
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,150
Start.

70
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,340
As you can see up here what happened is the test has run and we were going to.

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,610
This gives us pretty much the same result as previously if we're going to Graaff here we can see how

72
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:32,860
the balance changed with time results results tabel just show you details on every order was open and

73
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,110
how it was closed but there was a stop loss on the right side of results.

74
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,710
You can see how the balance is increasing with time which is good.

75
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,510
That means the system is making profit.

76
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,410
The report will tell you a lot of details about what happened.

77
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,070
So if you look at the bottom where the screen is magnified I'll try not to move my mouse so that you

78
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,910
can read some bars and test tells you how many bars there were in this we won't go through in detail

79
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,500
through this report we'll just go through to the main point so an initial deposit is how much money

80
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,970
you had originally.

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,870
Total net profit.

82
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:16,060
How much money was earned and absolute drawdown is what the maximum drawdown was and total trades how

83
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,770
many trades were conducted.

84
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,610
So there's more details on this report which you can look up on the Internet or you're welcome to look

85
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,270
into my other courses where we discussed this in detail.

86
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,510
We won't be using these at this stage.

87
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:39,230
Journal is a trading Journal of the expert and the terminal and tells us what's happening in real time.

88
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,250
So what we're going to do now and why we have this tutorial and this course is because I would like

89
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:53,100
to actually use the strategy tester to validate our system and how how are we going to do that.

90
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,150
Well let's have a look quickly if we look at the chart now the way we conduct trades.

91
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,440
All right well let's go back to the original chart the way we conduct trades is we always look at a

92
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,980
certain hour we look at 9:00 right.

93
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,490
We try to enter at nine o'clock and that that is something we came up with by ourselves.

94
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,460
But now that we have an expert adviser created we can actually use it to validate and check if that

95
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,980
is indeed the right time to enter.

96
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,280
Maybe maybe it's it's not the right time.

97
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,330
Maybe 10 o'clock or maybe 15 or 3:00 o'clock in the evening is the right time.

98
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,400
So how are we going to do that.

99
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,190
We're going to go into expert properties and we're going to set some optimization parameters.

100
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:49,330
So we're going to optimize start our then we're going to optimize take profit and we're going to optimize

101
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:58,360
Stop-Loss that means we're going to ask the terminal to run through a lot like many many many iterations

102
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,560
of this or the system and run them on the British pound dollar.

103
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,130
All on the same time for all on the same period of time and see which ones are best.

104
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:21,120
So we're going to optimize toward our in the period between 0 between 0 and 23 with a step of 1.

105
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,870
That means that we all started 0 then would go to 1 2 2 to 3 and so on into 23.

106
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,350
And so we'll check all those hours.

107
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,890
Also we'll check the take profits so we'll start with 10.

108
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,560
We'll go for step of 10 and we'll go up to 120.

109
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,300
And same thing for Stop-Loss 10 10 and 120.

110
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,530
So basically this gives a massive combination of parameters so there's 24 here.

111
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,850
There's quite quite a few.

112
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,760
Here is what 10 12 12 here and 12 here right.

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,710
So if you multiply multiply all of those then you'll get a massive combination of parameters and the

114
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,390
tester will actually check all of them for us and tell us which is the best one.

115
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,020
And that way we'll know which is the best our take profit and plus to say that we're not optimizing

116
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:18,870
was because lots just depends on our initial deposit and we're just going to keep it at one lot.

117
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:28,740
So I click OK then we'll take this optimization box here and then we'll just start and as you can see

118
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,710
something's happening there's a total of three thousand four hundred fifty six parameters looked Mazowsze

119
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,910
results some results.

120
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,310
But the most important is the optimization graph.

121
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,580
So and this victimization graph it's telling us on the right you can see the profit and at the bottom

122
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,980
is the iteration that it's gone.

123
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,610
It's going through.

124
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:57,950
And so yeah we just have to wait and see which is going to be the most profitable.

125
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,720
Let's go back to settings and we're already halfway through or nearly nearly halfway through.

126
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:13,200
And these are the results so far and as you can see this there were originally negative and there some

127
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,510
very negative results.

128
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,610
If you look on the right here I'll try not to move again so that she can fall on the magnifier.

129
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,780
The hour is increasing take profit and Stop-Loss a fix and then take profit increases by one and then

130
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,830
our increases again.

131
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,320
So basically just running through all possible combinations of those parameters as we set them.

132
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,470
And this is going to get to 120 and then Stop-Loss are going to go up to 20 and and starts again.

133
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,180
So that's exactly what you're seeing on the chart.

134
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,020
And these blue dots are every single result that of those combinations.

135
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,970
All right so we're nearly finished.

136
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,750
There we go.

137
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:04,510
So we go optimization Grof and we sort by profit we can see that the most profitable combination yielded

138
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:12,280
eight thousand dollars in six months that's nearly double of our initial $10000.

139
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,430
So let's set those parameters and let's see what that is.

140
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,790
Or we can go back here.

141
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,820
As you can see here on the right start hours 8 type profit is 40 and Stop-Loss is 60.

142
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,100
So the actual best hour was actually 8 9.

143
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,320
And let's see how this goes.

144
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,750
Right click click said input parameters.

145
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,540
The optimization automatically comes off.

146
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,020
You switch original mode back on and then you click start and there you go.

147
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,490
So that is your best set of parameters.

148
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,900
You can't really tell much from here but you can see that trades are being opened at.

149
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,110
I'll go down on the magnifier you can see the trades are being opened at 8:00 which is correct.

150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:02,830
And if we go to the graph you can see a wall that is very impressive that went from 10000 to $18000

151
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,670
in six months.

152
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:12,050
And that that not only not only validates our system we thought it was 09:00 but it's actually 10:00.

153
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,780
So it's actually 8:00.

154
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,130
So not that big a difference so we were very close and that means that what we saw visually and we thought

155
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,660
was right is actually a valid pattern on the market and it can yield results on the fact that it can

156
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,700
really results is backed by this amazing chart.

157
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,470
So that's simply how you test systems here we can choose another set of parameters.

158
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,650
Let's take this take this one for example.

159
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:51,810
And we set parameters here and if we run it again and we look at the result the graph you see now we

160
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,700
have a different chart.

161
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:59,850
And this one is more gradually increasing so it doesn't have that very rapid increase at the start but

162
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,960
it's gradually increasing throughout the year which is great.

163
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,940
So that's simply how that's how you optimize your expert advises in a nutshell.

164
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,640
And they are more Colma.

165
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,010
There are there is much more to optimization.

166
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:25,530
For example like we can change this to to the surface and change the axis around and see different results

167
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,150
here.

168
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:33,510
And like look at look at colors and up optimize that way we can export these results to excel.

169
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:40,070
We can go here and use the genetic algorithm we can play around with these optimization parameters.

170
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,710
So optimization is a really fun and interesting part of algorithmic trading systems and it is actually

171
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:55,380
very important because it allows you to make the maximum of your training system and also you don't

172
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,180
only or you can not only optimize your own system which you can optimize commercial systems which you

173
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,450
buy.

174
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:12,000
So having said that I would like to encourage you to have a look at my optimization course and you can

175
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,070
find the Course on w w w dot for explode dot com and have a look and think if it is relevant to you

176
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:26,160
and if optimization is something that you will be using going forward and if so then I do encourage

177
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,860
you to consider participating in that course.

178
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:36,060
So that's all for this tutorial in the next one we will finally complete our trading system by adding

179
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,590
an m a moving average filter.

180
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,060
Until then happy coding.
