00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,540
Hello this is Carol from Foxborough dot com.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:17,570
And this is the 11th tutorial in our series of kill for tutorials for beginners and today we're going

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:25,100
to talk about the switch operator just before we move on I wanted to say that today's topic is not really

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:36,380
essential for you to progress further down further in the course and feel free to skip today's tutorial

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,900
and move on to more on number 12.

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:48,290
You can always come back and listen about the switch OPERATOR When you feel that you need to use it

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,490
in your code.

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,130
All right so moving on as you can see here I've prepared a little bit of code already.

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:05,180
And here we're introducing a new variable called today which is an integer variable and we're assigning

10
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,940
it a value.

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,340
Now I know that we have not talked about functions yet.

12
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,780
And that's definitely a topic that will visit further down the track in this course.

13
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:26,480
But we're going to need to use one today and I'll just give a quick overview of what this specific function

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,260
does.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,500
So this function is called day of week and this is how we call it or execute it.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,110
We type in its name and then just a pair of normal brackets afterwards.

17
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:51,160
And so what it will do is it will look at the chart and will tell us what day of the week it is today.

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:59,150
And then for every day of the week it will return a value and integer value which will then be which

19
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:09,470
will then or will be substituted here and it will be assigned to the today variable and the values that

20
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,400
this function can return are as follows.

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:20,230
0 means Sunday 1 means Monday to means Tuesday 3 is Wednesday for Friday 5 is Saturday.

22
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,900
US Thursday 5 6 is Saturday.

23
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:36,240
So now what we want to do with this today variable we want to branch out our code and execute certain

24
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,260
certain different operations on different days of the week.

25
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:52,060
So let's imagine for for example that we have a trading strategy that tells us that we can only buy

26
00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:00,610
on Mondays by a certain currency pair on Mondays and then we can only sell that currency pair on Tuesdays

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,470
and on any other day of the week we should not perform any actions at all.

28
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,350
So that's what we're going to try to do.

29
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,810
We're going to try to split our code to do different things on different days of the week.

30
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,950
So for that we'll use a switch operator.

31
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:28,780
And the way to use a switch is typing this keyword which is followed by normal brackets and within these

32
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,740
brackets you need to put the expression or variable that you are evaluating.

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:44,820
And then in the switches followed by curly brackets within which you need to put several case statements.

34
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,400
So the switch operator has a very unique

35
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,250
structure and it looks as follows.

36
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,250
So case one colon and then alert.

37
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,530
This is the operation we want to reform and break.

38
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,870
So here we want to say today is Monday

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,440
and then what you say is by on Monday.

40
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,770
So basically what the switch does is it compares this value that you have or this variable that you

41
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,000
have in the normal brackets.

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,430
That compares to each of the cases that you have in the body of the switch.

43
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:39,760
And in case in the condition that this variable equals or this value equals to this value so if today

44
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,350
equals to 1 then this block of code will be executed.

45
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,030
Otherwise the next case will be checked.

46
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,340
Case 2 we wanted to say Alert.

47
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:03,410
Today is Tuesday and on Tuesdays our strategy tells us to sell then we put a break.

48
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,670
So basically if today is one then we'll see this message.

49
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:17,140
And then the switch will stop working because all finalize its work because the break operator will

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,470
tell it to stop.

51
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:26,230
Otherwise if today is a two then we'll see this message and which will tell us to sell.

52
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,830
And then the break operator will tell the switch stop again.

53
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:41,950
And in the final case of any other day we need to use the default operator or the default keyword and

54
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,540
we want to say other day to not

55
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,070
create orders them for a

56
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,580
so let's compile that and have a quick look at what we've seen.

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,210
A trader for Scripps tutorial Lemmon run.

58
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,060
And there we can see today is Monday by and that is correct because today is Monday.

59
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:32,550
And so what happened is that today was assign a value of one by this function then this value was checked

60
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:40,800
by switch and it turned out to be equal to this value which is 1 and therefore we saw this message.

61
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
So this block of code was executed.

62
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:51,660
And so this message is Monday by and then break stop the switch and the script finished at its exit

63
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,880
its execution.

64
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:06,770
So one so that basically switch allows you to branch out your code similarly to how if LCF and statements

65
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,060
did.

66
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,000
There are two main disadvantages of switch.

67
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:23,310
And the first one is that you cannot use any dummy variables of the type double here for example.

68
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:31,140
So you can only use integer variables or logical expressions and that kind of limits you from doing

69
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:39,940
things like we did last time with the prices because prices are actually doubles and also switch and

70
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:48,540
them call for is implemented a bit differently to other programming languages and meaning that you have

71
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,020
to have this break at every k at the end of every case statement because if you don't have this break

72
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,000
what'll happen is the switch will continue moving on through your blocks of code.

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,300
So for example if I comment that out and I compile that what you will see is that it says Today is Monday

74
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,880
and then says today's Choose the which is obviously not correct.

75
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:21,870
This is useful in some circumstances but most of the time you do need to put this break so that every

76
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:29,330
case is separate does not get executed with the cases above it.

77
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,910
So that's basically it.

78
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,090
You might find a switch a useful operator especially if you're working with integers such as day of

79
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,310
week.

80
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,170
And hopefully that will help you branch out your code even more.

81
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,630
And that's all for today.

82
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,510
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you on the next one more editorials and

83
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,400
information or parable on phonics but com come until next time.

84
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:01,810
