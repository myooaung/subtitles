00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
Components. Components are reusable elements across your design.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.605
The basic rule is, if you use it more than once,

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.100
make it into a component.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.930
Components are essential to design and code.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.990
It works exactly the same as in your design,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.540
you have all your little components and then you are constructing your page out of that,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.885
or your app or whatever.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.220
It's the same for code,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.590
it's basically like a little Lego System and you're

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.785
putting it altogether to create your product.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.360
You surely heard about a thing called design systems,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.520
one part of that is what we've already covered: the styles,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.290
the typography, the icon styles,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.610
the colors, all of that.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.320
The other huge part is components.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.210
You can actually look at those design systems online.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.160
The most famous one is probably

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.190
Google Material Design that I also used for bits and bobs here in my project.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.285
So let's have a look at this together.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.645
This is the Material Design website.

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:53.300
On the design, you find colors,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.270
typography, and all of those styles we also already setup.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.935
If you click on "Components",

00:00:57.935 --> 00:00:59.525
you see the component library.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.820
Let's pick one out to see what that looks like.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.775
Let's go for cards.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:06.385
Here you see the general card.

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:10.615
If you go further down, you see all the description in detail.

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:17.225
Then here we go to behavior so you can see how this behaves if I click on it,

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:18.800
how do it slide.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.275
You can see actions.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.125
You can see what they look next to one another.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.765
You can see different themes they can have.

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:29.675
This is probably the one you're right now most interested in.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.805
For handoff, handoffs will be programmed

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:35.910
all the details with all the different dimensions.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.790
Now, the amount of detail that you will need on

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.170
your component handoff depends very much on the project you're working on.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.450
If you're walking on a one-off website,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.100
which you might add some detail to,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.300
and the developer is sitting next to you in your office, then yes,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.590
you need a solid handoff,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.105
but you're obviously not going to spend

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.060
huge amounts of time setting up an online library.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.850
Now, if you're working on an app and you have a huge team that is spread

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.610
globally and you're planning on growing and adding features here and there,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.070
then definitely, invest the time to really,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.170
really get that component library in order.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.495
Now, saying that, a component library,

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:15.800
it sounds really easy,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.020
but it's actually something that needs a lot of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.280
attention to detail and a lot of attention in maintaining it properly.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.340
But if you're planning on scaling your project, definitely worth it.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.890
I will show you today how I set up my components for,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.590
what I would say, a medium to large-sized project.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.295
Here you can see my components overview page that I created.

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.550
On the left-hand side here, you can see that I have different pages,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.020
and one is for components.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.435
In sketch components are cool symbols.

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:43.220
As soon as you create a symbol,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.250
it creates this symbol page automatically for you.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.935
That is actually the only time I really prepare a sketch over Figma.

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.500
In Figma, if you create a component,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.400
then makes sure that you send your master component

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.790
by right-clicking and send it to that component page.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.190
Also make sure your master components are here so you can

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.870
keep an overview of all your components.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.155
Your components are also saved up here in your assets library,

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.090
so you see here is my components page.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.560
By the way, it is really nice in Figma,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.085
it sorts them for impinges.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.350
This little symbol, by the way,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.675
I put there myself.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:21.125
I can see here, for example,

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:23.210
if I want to see all my buttons then

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.450
all my buttons are here and I can just drag them out anywhere I wish.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.250
Just as styles, all of those components will later be

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.010
shared with your development team automatically,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.245
if you're using a handoff tool.

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:41.380
However, I create those little frames here,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.170
those little overview sheets as well.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.800
I'm going to show you those in a little more detail. Let me zoom.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.420
Let's look into forms here I have,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.115
for example, my input boxes.

00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:54.010
You can see here that first I will show the master,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.810
so this will be my master element.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.570
Then I'm showing the different states that this can have.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.670
It can be, this is a default state,

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.095
it can have a drop-down,

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.480
it can have a harvest state.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.780
Then active is once I clicked on it and start typing.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.215
Then with an input arrow.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:12.480
This shows that I can actually stretch this,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.105
so it would behave, it would sit in the grid and then it will stretch with the grid.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.930
Then down here, I have my info,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.310
so this will be my specs,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.590
actually my developers can use the inspect tool here on the master,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.640
but I am just giving a little more detail here just to be sure.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.370
You can see I am using my spacing blocks that I set up before.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.500
It also means I am not going to show

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.650
my spacing blocks on every little element on my website.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.230
I'm just going to show them here once in my components and that, once and for all,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.320
sets the rules, distances to the next one,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.690
inner distances, and so on.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.480
The font size is explained in detail, again.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.430
Then I can add all my description here on the right.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.235
I'm having that description for every component that I create.

00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.810
Even here, you can see,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.510
this is for my hero image,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.645
you could argue that this is only text and I only have a text style.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.790
But it's just going to behave the same on every page,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.770
so it's always going to sit in these first three columns,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.770
it always has the same distance to its sublime,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.940
and it's subsurface clickable, some isn't.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.670
I'm just going to fix all the rules here and then everything is pretty clear.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.400
Also really important for your menus, the behavior.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.410
Here, for example, this is my desktop menu,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.880
and then there's my mobile menu.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.060
I'm having these little red icons, you might have noticed.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.599
This means refer to my prototype,

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.060
and then they can see the animations that I'm having here.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.520
For example, how this list is going to slide down.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.005
This is going to slide up.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:43.460
Prototyping is also coming at a later stage in more detail.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.860
Also remember you don't need to invent the wheel every time,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.820
so you can go back here on the community section and,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.815
for example, type in "material design".

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:57.440
Then you're getting all of these files that people have already set up.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.300
You can duplicate them.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.250
Then you're getting this library here.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.760
Let's give it a second to download.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.840
Here you can see you have,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.910
for example, all your components already set up.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.930
You can zoom in here,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.930
you can see what they did with forms,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.100
what they did with cards,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.545
and then you can use it as a base to set up your own system as well.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:21.830
There's also other libraries out there you can actually use, you can buy.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.980
Definitely, talk to development team because maybe they're already using

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.710
a component library and they would like you to use the equivalent for the design.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.570
Now we've done our colors, typography.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.905
We have all our style set,

00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:36.050
and we also have our components sorted out.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.060
Now we can have a look at the next step,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.130
which is how to export our assets.
