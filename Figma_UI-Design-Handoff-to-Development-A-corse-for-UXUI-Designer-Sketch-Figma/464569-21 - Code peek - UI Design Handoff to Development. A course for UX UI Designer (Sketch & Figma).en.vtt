00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
As a UI designer,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.060
you're not really expected to code your own websites or even understand code.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.040
However, I find it really useful to

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.850
understand a little bit of what's happening on the code side.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.880
I just want to give you this brief overview of some very basic things

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.339
which will give you better overall understanding

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.820
about what's happening with your designs.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.670
This is the website we've just been looking at,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.950
coded in React JS,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.750
this is a JavaScript framework.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.480
I just want to give you a super brief overview of what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.545
the elements we've just been looking at look like in code.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:36.830
Here for example, you see this is the colors and all the colors are variables.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.990
I only have to change this color and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.350
all my text color will be changed on the whole website.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.540
Or here my highlight color, which is this red,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.875
if I want to go for yellow,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.705
I only need to change it here.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.300
Then you can also see the general distances that I am using.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.895
I'm also using a variable,

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.830
so this is my available distances.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.060
In the layout file,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.365
you can see that I imported a Google Font here,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.480
and then I set it the same rule for my whole website.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.330
So the whole website uses the same font.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.210
This is something don't worry about this too much,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.085
this is a four responsive fonts,

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.950
so it means the smallest it can ever get is 16 ,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.880
and the largest is 35 pixels.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.340
I set a general line height to 1.7.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.399
Now for my different headlines, for example, H1,

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.850
H2, primary headline, secondary headline, and so on.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.865
I set different font weights and different line heights just as I want them to be.

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:37.295
The card, which is a component like I'm showing you.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:40.985
The developer will also just create a component called card.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.640
You can see here he can export this component.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.090
He can create 100 cards and he can always fill

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.920
in a different image and different text here.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.680
Because this one here is basically a little text holder for

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.960
an image and this one is a text holder for

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.555
the description of the project we want to put in here.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:06.490
Here you can see the whole list of all the components the website is made up of.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.725
Then the images which we will be exporting,

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:11.830
they will be exported and then put into this file,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.220
and so you can see all the images in here.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.785
This one, for example,

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.080
is a little burger menu as an SVG.
