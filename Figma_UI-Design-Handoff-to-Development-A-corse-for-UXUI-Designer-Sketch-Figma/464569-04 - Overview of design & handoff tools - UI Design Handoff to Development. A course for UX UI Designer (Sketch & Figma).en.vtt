00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's talk about design and handoff tools for a minute.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.875
There are many, many out there,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.755
and here's a few that you might have come across.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.380
The main design tools are Sketch,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.780
Figma, and XD, you might have seen.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.015
Then there is stuff like Abstract which is really good for version control and handoffs.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:24.150
There's Zeplin, make classic handoff tool for Sketch, Apple Code, InVision,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.765
which also has its own InVision Studio design tool, Sketch Measure,

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.150
which is a plug-in for handoff

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.075
that's very special but sometimes can also work quite well.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.010
There are things like Marvel and Framer which are very popular for prototyping.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.920
So especially Framer, it's very much on the code side.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.190
I'm sure there are many more tools out there even still.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.615
All of them are great tools and it really depends a bit on what you're trying to achieve.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.350
I won't go into depth on each and every single one of them,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.115
but what I'd like to do is to show you the two,

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:57.955
as I believe, most popular and up-to-date tools for design and handoff.

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:00.180
The obvious choice is Sketch.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.190
Sketch is an amazing tool, I love it.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.730
It has a huge community,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.235
thousands of plugins and it works pretty much with any handoff tool.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:10.250
They're working on having their own handoff.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.590
However, you're most likely to combine it with any of those popular handoff tools.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.245
That can be an advantage or disadvantage.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.260
It's sometimes for very complex projects,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.695
it might even be better to have an own handoff tool and keep things separate,

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.740
depends very much on your team.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.535
On the other hand,

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:29.750
for very small projects,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.660
it's sometimes nice to just have one tool and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.130
my personal favorite comes in here, which is Figma.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.965
I have to say Figma, that was just recently launched end of 2016,

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.810
that's quite young for software,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.730
is I think it's fantastic because it solves a lot of problems.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.310
Not really problems, but a few issues that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.145
Sketch had that made the handoff a bit complicated,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.600
it's a total all-rounder.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.220
You can prototype in here,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.725
you can handoff, you have version control,

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.000
and if you wanted,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.115
you could still combine it with some of the most popular handoff tools.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:06.330
What I'd like to do is before handing the last chapter,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.960
we made this list of things that we need to handoff.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.660
Let's see how each of them performs in those sections.
