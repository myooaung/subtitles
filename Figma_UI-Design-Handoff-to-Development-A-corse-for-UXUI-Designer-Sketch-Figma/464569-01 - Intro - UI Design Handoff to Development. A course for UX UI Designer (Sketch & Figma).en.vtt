00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.215
Hi, I'm Christine, a UX/UI designer.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:09.180
I remember handing off my first website for development and I was super-excited

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.950
and spent hours getting everything

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.475
perfect and then sending it off and thought I was done.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.785
Then I saw it in the browser.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:21.210
I did not understand why the real thing looked so different from my design.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.860
I did not know why my images were blurry on some screen and crisp on others.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.550
I did not understand why my typography stuck together like chewing

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.990
gum and I did not understand why everything was just a bit all over the place.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.640
I don't even want to mention what happened on different screen sizes.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.465
When I asked for advice and how to fix this,

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.420
I was completely lost in translation.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.620
So I started reading and researching and I talked to other designers and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.900
developers and I tried out different tools and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.360
techniques that I would like to share with you today.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.050
This course is aimed at beginners in web design or advanced UI designers that

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.025
really thrive to improve their handoff experience between design and development.

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:10.280
In this class, we will learn about all the elements the development team needs from you,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.955
different design and handoff tools on the market to help you,

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:16.550
setting up style sheets the best way,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.805
exporting [inaudible] in the right form and size,

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.640
setting up component libraries and specs,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.000
really understanding responsive grids and typography to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.585
make the right decisions early on in your design process.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.480
To sum it up, we will also look into how to share

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.350
your Figma or Sketch designs with the development team in a professional manner.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.860
In short, at the end of this class,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.230
you will have the perfect setup for your design

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.870
to get coded the way you imagine it to be,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.350
and your developers will probably love you just a little bit more.
