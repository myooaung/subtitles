00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Typography. What basically exactly the same and colors.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.435
You need to set up an overview sheet and tell the development team

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.750
exactly at what screen size they need to use,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.505
what font in which way.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.150
It sounds pretty straightforward,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.100
but you might have noticed that in reality this is where things tend to get wrong.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.290
I'm going to run you through this sheet in detail.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.285
Let's see what we've got here.

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:27.990
First of all, I need to tell my team what font I am using and where they can find it.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.390
I'm using Raleway, and this is a Google Font and I am adding a little link here,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.350
so they get straight to the page where they can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.880
find all the information on how to embed it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.165
You can theoretically use as many fonts in your project as you wish,

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:45.130
however, I strongly recommend that you keep it down to one or two.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.175
If you're having your own font like a web font that you bought,

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.340
just make sure that your development team has access to it and also

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.150
make sure that you actually bought it and that you have the right to use it.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.360
If you're a bit new to typography, checkout Google Fonts,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.220
there's a lot of possibilities and I'm

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.225
sure you'll find something that suits your project.

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.980
Let's see over here in our first column.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.240
In the first column, I'm just naming the different styles that I am using.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000
I name them headline 1, headline 2,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.710
sublimed H_3, copy text link, etc.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.700
I am naming them as the programmer would later name the HTML tags.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.005
You don't need to do that.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.865
You can also name them, for example,

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:29.380
as Font M, Font L, XL, etc.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.600
Just stay generic and don't name them something like,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.255
Raleway 30 pixel headline bold,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:39.155
because this will probably change during the course of your design,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:41.255
and then you need to rename everything.

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:44.095
Stay generic and you're going to be fine.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:48.680
Let's zoom in so we can have a better view of what's happening in the second column.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.720
Here you see my font,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.110
and you see that I am giving you the size of 30 pixels,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.599
I'm defining the size for each of these fonts,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.900
and defining the line-height.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.320
I'm going to switch on my tools and I'm going

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.470
to give you a little preview in the inspect tool.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.210
Again, if you're using Sketch and Zeplin this will be visible in Zeplin.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.360
Here you can see that the developer can see what font I am using,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.405
font-weight, font size, line height, etc.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:18.335
This is basically all for me to double check and have a good overview.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:22.995
Besides that information, I just want to mention that back here,

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:26.450
let me just get rid of this style for a moment.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.870
Here you have all the properties that your text could have.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.570
You can set up the type of text,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.240
you can set up the weight of the text, and then the weight,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.815
for example, I chose bold,

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:41.090
and then the developers will see automatically that this is a weight of 700.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.280
That this is same as bold is just how this will be written in CSS.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.120
Then we will talk much more about line-height.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.580
This is something super important.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.440
I'll get to that in more detail.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040
Here you can have some letter spacing, paragraph spacing.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.390
You can set all of that.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
I didn't put that in my style sheet because it's not very relevant for my design.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.175
But if this is the big aspect and should really be

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:08.470
something to be looked at then definitely you can add that.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.480
Here you can just set how the text behaves,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.250
that's not relevant in our style sheet,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.540
and here can text align left, center, and right.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.535
In Figma that's also not relevant,

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.830
in Sketch it might already be updated,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.670
but it used to be that you would have to set up a style for left,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.140
center, and right, which was really annoying.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.100
This one here is just how your text is aligned.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.265
I would generally align it in the middle,

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:37.400
which is the best setting for getting coded,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.445
but if there's a reason why you send it on a top or the bottom,

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:45.360
also do that and this will all be visible in your specs.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.315
Now up here you see something called Mobile first. That is very common.

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:51.500
What that means is,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.360
that my development team told me,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.550
take on a start setting up all my font sizes and everything for Mobile first.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.540
Mobile is the initial screen and then anything that changes,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.620
like you can see that here,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.060
here I have my breakpoints.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.930
Anything that changes I have to define for larger screens.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.250
You could also start at a larger screen and work your way downwards.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.720
But it's not so common.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.540
It's usually best practice to start with Mobile first.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.170
All my other fonts are probably going to stay the same

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.360
because they're at a larger size of 16.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.280
This is also good and large screens,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.535
but made headline is definitely going to be too small.

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.540
I set up a size for L,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.480
this is my breakpoint.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.750
Later we talk about grid systems and breakpoints and

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.290
you will learn more about that and why this number is so odd.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.470
I have a screen for L and I think I'm going to need it even larger one for XL.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.640
However, I am still not so sure about it so I put a little difficult sticker up here,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.770
and here, I put my post-it and I said still defining breakpoints.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.510
That means that I think I probably need a larger screen,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.060
and from my experience,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.420
I think that's probably going to be something around that size,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.835
but I need to want to do my responsive testing,

00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:09.275
and there's a whole chapter on that.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:13.685
I will check if that size actually looks good on that breakpoint.

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:17.635
Let's get a better overview again.

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.930
Here you can see an overview again of my style sheet.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.655
Here I have my Mobile first,

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.410
everything I define here,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.400
and then any changes I have for larger screens for my size L and my XL,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.805
in my case, you might even have more break points.

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:34.250
I'm defining here. In my example,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
this is only the headline that any larger,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.320
and probably for very large screens,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.800
I need to change the H2 as well for my design to look good.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.135
Now I want to have a quick word about line-height,

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:49.250
because if your designs tend to come

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.755
back from development and they're all a bit squashed together,

00:05:51.755 --> 00:05:55.160
is probably that you didn't set your line-height right.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.910
Here you see my copy font that has a size of 16 and align height of 1.7.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.350
So 1.7 is the same as 27.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.250
In Sketch and in Figma,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.510
this is given in pixels.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.390
I would definitely recommend that you're using that one point of

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.380
ratio because then it also stays clean if you're sizing up your font.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.035
For example, let's have 27.

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.840
If you wanted to change your line-height to 1.5,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.035
it will be 16 times 1.5,

00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:26.730
and this is how you get your line-height.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.890
If you're coming from Print,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.485
you might be used to something called baseline.

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:34.500
But online that works very differently.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.575
Let me show why a good line height,

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:42.065
even if you're not having a paragraph but just a single line is very important.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:46.010
Here's a little example to understand line-height online better.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.620
Here's my font, 20 pixel of font size,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.345
and my line height is set to auto.

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.610
Now Figma and Sketch do that alike,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.010
they give you a little bit of added line-height automatically if you haven't set it.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.705
My box is not 20 pixels height,

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:03.010
but actually 23 pixels because of this added line height.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.625
What you might be tempted to do is especially if you're having a one-line headline,

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:08.925
you go and you say, "No,

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:11.110
I'm making the line height the same as my font,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.305
now my box is 20 pixels high and everything is nice and clean."

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:18.350
I don't do that because what happens is if

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.020
you're having a second line and this happens quite quickly.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.505
If your screen gets smaller,

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.740
your font is going to be all pushed into one

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.085
another and it's all going to start to look pretty ugly.

00:07:27.085 --> 00:07:29.510
What you should do is just be aware of

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.340
your line-height and that your boxes are

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.215
just going to be a little bigger and that's fine,

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:36.110
and it's going to be exactly the same as CSS later.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.280
For example, here, I'm having 20 pixels of font size,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.435
line height I want 1.5.

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:46.950
That means that my box is going to be 30 pixels high.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.600
Now, if I'm having more lines,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.010
that will just add up.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.950
Two lines in that case will be 60 pixels high.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.140
This is how line-height works online,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.120
and it's quite important to understand that if

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.130
you want to have good results with your designs.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.550
Now all our styles are decided.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.810
The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.995
my styles and add them here in my styles in Figma,

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:15.020
in Sketch that actually is the same,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.400
but just add them to your styles,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.210
give them the names you decided on,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.210
and then you can reuse them across your whole project and you're ready to go.
