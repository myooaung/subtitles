00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Before you go, I obviously want to say thank you very

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.685
much for taking this course and well done in completing it.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:08.340
I really hope it was useful to you.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.670
I hope this course gives you a solid base for your hand-off,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.680
your documentation, and most important,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.560
your communication with your development team to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.725
improve this quite tricky bottleneck in most projects.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.410
As I mentioned a few times during this course,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.780
it's super important that design is not something that happens behind closed doors,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.390
and then you just throw everything at your development team.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.595
No matter how well you presented your files,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:37.200
it's super important that you always talk with your other team members before you start,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.020
while you're working on a project, and after handoff.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.035
You're probably going to have a few rounds back and forth until things are perfect.

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:47.470
Web design and development is a rapidly changing world,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.365
so I'll try to keep this course as much as possible up to date for you.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:55.890
Yesterday, for example, Figma just released Variants and there is more to come,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.310
so always make sure that you have the latest updates of your software.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.760
If you have any comments or anything you're missing or did not quite understand,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.985
please send me an email through the channel you booked this course with

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:12.155
so I can really understand student's needs and thoughts about this topic.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.180
If you can spare a minute and write a review,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.560
that would be obviously of great,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.570
great help and very much appreciated.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.770
Also, if you liked the course,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.260
make sure to visit moonlearning.io.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.570
You can sign up for the newsletter there to receive

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
general information about UX UI design,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.280
and there are more courses underway,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.290
so stay tuned and I hope I see you soon.
