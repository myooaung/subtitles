00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
Let's start with colors. That's pretty straightforward.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.520
What you need to do is you need to make an overview of

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.550
all the colors you're using or planning to use on your project.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.475
Here you see an overview of my brand colors.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:15.000
Color values are given in something called hex.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.700
Hex stands for hexadecimal values.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.715
If we draw and you want to add a new color here,

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.950
let's draw a square.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.800
We want a gray background.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.970
You can see here that it opens the hexadecimal for you,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.850
and we can just put in a new one and save that for

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.955
lighter background or we can use the color picker here and choose another color.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.999
If you were given RGB,

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.970
that's literally the same in hex.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.880
You can just open here and type in your RGB value,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.020
it's exactly the same.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.010
If we have our color here,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.265
we would want to probably add it to our styles.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.140
This is the overview of our colors,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.430
but then we add it to styles,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.380
which means we can reuse this color everywhere in our project.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.930
In code, this is done the same.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.370
Your color values will be stored in a variable and then reused.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.110
If you're changing later,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.280
if you're changing, for example,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.685
the background color to a lighter gray or something,

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.085
your whole project, all the backgrounds will be changed.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:14.900
We do this in Figma here,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.105
which is pressed with this little square,

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.745
and then we can add it to our styles.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:22.530
The important thing is when naming,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.580
don't call this gray background because later you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.165
might want to change it to white or to blue or to whatever color.

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:35.640
We're just going to name this background light.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.445
What you can also do in Figma,

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:40.230
you can add a slash.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.685
So this is under my base colors.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.205
If I now create the style,

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:52.290
you can see that it was added right here to my base colors and can now reuse this.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.985
A little tip, you might have noticed up here,

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:57.890
I have my CMYK link.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.100
This is just linking to my brand colors for printing,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.380
you cannot use CMYK online,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.550
but sometimes you're given CMYK or Pantone colors by your client.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.945
Then you need to find the right hexadecimal or RGB values.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:16.420
If you go to pantone.com/color-finder,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.940
there's really great tool where you convert colors.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.505
That's pretty much it, color handoff done.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.820
If you're wondering what a programmer will see,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.935
we can have a little preview.

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.660
In Figma, you have an Inspect tap here.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.930
If you're using Sketch and Zeplin,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.560
you will have the same inspect mode in Zeplin.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.710
Here you can see

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.745
the background color and you can see that

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.445
how we named this is actually giving as a comment.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:45.505
If we swap here,

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.675
I gave it this name and this is commented in.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:53.000
Then the programmer can see that's the color we're using.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.400
That's it. You're done with your colors.
