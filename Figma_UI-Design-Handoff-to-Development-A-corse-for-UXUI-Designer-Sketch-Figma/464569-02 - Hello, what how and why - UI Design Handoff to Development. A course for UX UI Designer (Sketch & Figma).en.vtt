00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
Hello. I'm Christine, and I will be leading you through this course.

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.655
A very, very quick intro.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.380
What are we going to do?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.150
Well, you probably watched the trailer,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.565
and if you didn't, then definitely do so.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:15.780
We are here today to learn more about how to improve a very,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.275
very tricky part where design meets development.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:23.880
This is where a lot of the time both parties end up a little frustrated.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.350
How are we going to do that?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.740
I will run you through an old project of mine and I will show you in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.835
a lot of detail on how I set up everything for best results.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.900
Ideally, you already have a project at hand that you would like to improve

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.775
for handoff or one in mind so that you can work along.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.745
Don't worry, there'll be a lot of screencast and action,

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.700
and it's not only slides.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.535
Who is this course for?

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:51.470
Well, basically for anyone who would like to improve the process of handoff.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.670
If you just started working with web design or if you're an experienced designer,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.570
but this topic still gives you a headache, also,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.745
if you're a graphic designer,

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:02.905
moving into UI, this course should be of help.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:06.590
I will be using Figma for most of my examples,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.930
but this is almost identical to Sketch except

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.230
a few minor things and I'll make sure I mention them wherever important.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.590
The final chapter, I will have one chapter in handoff for

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.005
Figma and handoff for Sketch to make sure that you can really use either.

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.999
As this is more about a general understanding

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.570
on how to handoff different aspects of design,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.550
you should also be able to use any other software if you really want to.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.990
I'm going to have a whole chapter on Figma and Sketch and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.020
all the different handoff tools so you can really decide what you would like to use.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.870
Let's go and get started,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.505
and the first thing we want to do is we want to get a general overview of

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:49.080
all the aspects we actually need to hand over and then dive into detail in each of them.
