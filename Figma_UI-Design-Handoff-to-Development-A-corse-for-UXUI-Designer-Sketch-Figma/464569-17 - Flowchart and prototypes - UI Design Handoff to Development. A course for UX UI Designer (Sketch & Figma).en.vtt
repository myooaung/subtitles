00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
By now, everything is pretty much set up,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.875
and as you have been working on this file for a while,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.515
all the connections will seem pretty clear to you.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.760
You probably started your project with a wireframe that might look something like this,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.805
or like this, or maybe just some scribbles.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:17.670
In the best case, you also discussed this wireframe at

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.340
the very beginning with your development team,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.515
and then started designing on top of it.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.480
To hand us off successfully,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.135
just as in the beginning with our wireframes,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:31.605
you now need to show an overview of all connections and interactions.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.460
Now my project here is pretty small;

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.235
it seems quite logic,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.320
but as soon as it gets a little larger,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.370
you will also notice that this is important for yourself.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.710
You might actually do this while working,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.320
and then also use this for frequent testing.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.850
Testing is super important,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.600
but that would be a whole separate course.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.635
I'm going to set up two things now.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.185
First of all, a page as an overview.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.290
Basically, it's like my wireframe but with the real thing

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.745
showing all the pages I have and how everything links.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.030
Secondly, I'm going to set up a prototype so I can really

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.930
click through my website and see all the animations.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.690
You're going to wonder probably,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.250
why do I have to do both of those?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.130
I generally like doing both because the page gives me general overview and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.585
a prototype gives me more of a feel and also I can test.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.015
I could do more user testing there.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.550
Now, to create an overview page,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.310
I created here on the side a page called Flow.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.985
You can just call that overview, anything you wish.

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:34.550
Here, I'm currently on my screens and prototype page.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.855
This is like my master page.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:37.205
All my design happens here.

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.500
Anything I work on, this is my master.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.810
I personally don't like adding the flow in here.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.955
I could also put arrows and description in here,

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:45.620
but I just find it gets a bit messy.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.035
That's why I really like to keep it separate.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:50.370
A little trick I'm going to show you;

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.600
just select all of your frames and you can also do that in Sketch, the same.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.430
Then you just create component,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.780
so in Sketch that will be symbols,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.995
out of your actual pages.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.335
I'm going to create here multiple components.

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:06.255
Now, I copy those.

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:09.960
I go over to my Flow page, and I add it here.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.730
So now, whenever I change something on my master page,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.510
it's also going to be updated automatically on my overview page,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.705
and there will be no confusion.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.600
Then what I like doing,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.620
I like to take another frame here,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.190
and here I use an A4 paper size.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.150
I'm going to make that a little larger,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.340
but I quite like using that dimension just in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.280
case someone wants to print it on A3 or something.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.200
Select it, scale it all down so it fits.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.420
A little bit closer.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.055
Then what I do to make it really clear that this is the wireframe,

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.875
I give this some opacity,

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.635
and now I can add all my arrows and description on it.

00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:08.000
When I add a description,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.275
this is what it looks like.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:12.960
Let me get a little closer and show you.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.255
Here you can see that I'm having those arrows.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:21.820
Again, those arrows, you can go to your community section or with Sketch,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.510
look at Sketch App resources and just get some ready-made flowchart arrows.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.565
Just type in flowchart and you'll find a lot.

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:30.490
Then I'm putting in here like how this links,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.430
some information they might need.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.660
All of these red little dots,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.090
that's actions like, if I need to swipe,

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.400
if I need to click, and those will be,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.320
it says, they refer to the prototype.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.040
So therefore, the development team could refer to the prototype and then see what I mean,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.990
how this animation is really working.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.065
For my prototype, I'm going back on my screens and prototype overview.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.160
I like having it here.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.510
Again, you can have it anyway you want,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.230
but I like having all my master elements here in prototyping.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.840
On the right-hand Properties panel,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.665
up on the top, you see prototype.

00:04:04.665 --> 00:04:09.170
If I click on it, you see those connections and that I already set up a prototype.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.200
Setting up a prototype in Figma is super easy.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.510
Let's say you have this element and you want to connect it to a screen,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.030
you just click on it in the prototype menu,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.550
you connect it with your screen,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.430
and then you get this little box here with all the properties you can choose on hover,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.680
on mouse, on to click, whatever you want.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.340
Then you can choose here whether it moves in, pushes up, etc.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.140
All of those are like pretty standard ways to behave.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.395
Something else that is quite important here or the handiest I find is this smart animate.

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:46.170
If you don't know that, then read a little bit about that one.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.645
Because here you can really make

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:50.735
animations as long as the layers are called the same name,

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:52.670
things we like to dissolve into one another.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.550
I can show you that in a second with my menu.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.680
I set up the prototype.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.720
I want to actually show you my mobile prototype.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.860
I have one for the desktop,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.090
one for the mobile.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.655
I go here on prototype,

00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:11.670
I want to set a device.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.890
Let's use this one here in Space Gray,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.410
and then I just press on present.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.595
Then here you can see the prototype.

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.530
For example, here I added a little red button to show that there's an interaction so

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.525
you can see that this swipes horizontally on my mobile view.

00:05:31.525 --> 00:05:35.450
Now, also what happens here is for example, if I click on here,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.000
notice it pushes down,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.500
and there's a little animation.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.450
So I also have a button to show this.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.530
If you go back here,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.020
you can also show the same prototyping

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.510
for the website because some things might be different.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.485
Just make sure you switch off your device.

00:05:56.485 --> 00:06:01.055
Then for example, I can show here on contacts,

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:04.190
for example, what happens to link when I hover.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.170
Now, you can do the same in Sketch.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.640
The only thing is in Sketch you would upload your prototype on your Sketch Cloud,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.000
and then you would have to give that link separately.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.465
Or in Zeplin, if you're using Zeplin,

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:17.820
you have something called flow,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.850
so you will see where there's something to click,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.310
but it won't be a real prototype.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.275
You might still want to add the actual prototype somewhere.

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:27.260
If you're using InVision, there's some really great prototype in there.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.250
If that's something important to you and you don't want to use Figma,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.880
then definitely check out using InVision or InVision Studio as well.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.280
If you're using Figma just like I do,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.020
then all of that you don't need to worry about because you will

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.950
hand off this whole file to your development team.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.790
Your prototype will be included,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.815
your overview will be included.

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:52.460
Here on the right, you can see the inspect mode so you can always double check,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.665
and that's also what your development will see.

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.300
That's what we're going to do. In the next step,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.430
we're going to see how we actually share all of

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.860
those files that we prepared so carefully now.
