00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.940
A question I get frequently is,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.395
can I use Photoshop,

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:08.955
Illustrator, or InDesign to design my website and hand it off?

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.555
Well, theoretically yes, you can design a website in those.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.775
But should you really do it?

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.115
Well, I strongly advise you not to.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.200
Don't get me wrong, I very like those programs.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.030
I use Photoshop for photo editing,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.715
I'll use Illustrator for vector graphics,

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:26.055
and I use InDesign to create print materials.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:29.414
But that's what they're for, they are not for designing websites,

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:33.720
and I'd also like to show you why. Let's look at our list.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.450
Overview and inspect not really happening here.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.280
Yes, you could export apex and then put them back into, for example,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.650
InDesign or Illustrator make your own overview

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.410
or you could upload them in Zeplin as well but,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.975
it's not going to be the same.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.980
Prototyping the same, you could export jpegs

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670
and then make your own prototype in a program like Envision,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.870
but it's just not an automatic prototype within it.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.990
Styles, yes.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.070
People argue there are styles especially now in Illustrator,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.450
there's some elements of that,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.050
but if you ever use Sketch or Figma where you're going to notice it's not the same.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.290
The same with grids, you can't set up grids.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.290
You can't set up like rulers,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.660
but it's just not going to behave like

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.755
responsive and not as well as in Figma and in Sketch.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.050
Components, the same.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.830
Theoretically, if you really need to use one of those programs,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.780
I also recommend you use Illustrator,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.495
there is something to add component and to export components.

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.730
Again, you could export assets but

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.140
just going to be this little bit more tedious and you're going

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.015
to save yourself a lot of time using a real program for web and app design.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.930
No responsive testing.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.385
You have no version control.

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:43.950
It's running on Mac and PC, that's true.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.900
But it also comes with quite a hefty price tag. Don't get me wrong.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.190
These prices are really justified.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
Those are amazing programs for what they were made for,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.840
just not for web design.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.745
In a nutshell, could you used those programs for web design?

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:01.200
Well yes, in an emergency,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.670
you could, but why would you.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.450
I definitely don't recommend it.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.535
If you would really like to use Adobe,

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:11.150
you should check out Adobe XD that is made for web design,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.210
and also if you're experienced with Adobe,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.510
especially with Illustrator and InDesign,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.940
you will find it quite easy to adapt to Figma and Sketch in no time.
