00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
Let's start with images.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.960
What I generally like doing is to give an overview of

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.415
all the different kind of images and their behavior that I am using in my projects.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.860
Let me run you through that page.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.320
Let's get a little closer to see more details,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.500
the first one you're seeing here is my thumbnail image,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.055
the little intro image on my homepage.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:24.675
Here you can see that I made this into component

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.530
and I'm saying for more information look to components.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.600
Let's just have a little preview what's happening there.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.345
Now we're in my component page,

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.075
and in my component page you see that this,

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:39.775
for example, it's not really an image it's a component that has behavior.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:42.455
I'm telling you what happens when you hover over it.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:43.715
The different states.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:49.325
I'm telling you a little bit how the titles are in relation to this image.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.970
Theoretically, you could make all your images into components,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.090
like the deplete all the free images into components but you don't have to.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.760
Whatever you set it up,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.910
just make sure you give the information in a consistent way.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.990
Let's jump back to our overview.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250
In my overview, I'm telling the development team more

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.940
about how does generally sits within a website, within my screen.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.110
So you can see here that it sits within two columns,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.940
and on mobile it will sit in one column.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.000
The next one on my portfolio images,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.990
this is once you actually click on one of those you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.435
get into the project and you see more information.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.980
Those are like my large images I want to display while am showing my work.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.750
They run through the whole screen so they're not sitting anywhere in these grids.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.050
They have 100 percent of screen and they can take

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.225
any height I need them to have because it doesn't really matter the height here.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:46.045
Then a mobile they're behaving exactly the same.

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:49.505
The last ones for my project here is content images.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:53.045
That is like if I am having some writing or any other information,

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.250
I can just add an image to go with it.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.130
That again sits within two columns and can have any height I wish it has.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.695
It behaves exactly the same on mobile.

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:05.370
It just takes up the whole grid,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.365
and then any writing just goes below it.

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:12.540
That's all I need here because that's all the images I'm using.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.655
Let's go over to icons and have a look at the information I'm giving here.

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:20.300
As icons I am using google material icons so I didn't draw them

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.470
myself I'm using a library and I'm giving the link to the library here.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.805
I'm still giving the icons and you could click on them,

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.655
let me switch on my tools for you.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:37.430
So you can see here that all of those icons are components so I can export to them.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.050
I could reuse them in my project.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.245
For the programming I probably think they're just going to go here to

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.630
where there's documentation about

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.750
Google material icons and it probably going to use an icon font,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.250
bet them, but I don't need to worry more about it.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.690
I'm just giving all the information I have about the library I'm using.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.690
If you're drawing your icons yourself definitely give all

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.400
of them here as an overview because then you need to export them.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.850
Here I am giving the information that all my icons are going to be used in

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.290
48 by 48 pixels and this is two different colors they can be used in.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.950
But I am mainly using this highlight color.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.210
So that's all the information they need to have about images and icons.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.940
In the next step we're going to look on how to export or

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.575
prepare all of those assets for exporting.

00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:30.230
So here we have a design with some imagery and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.490
some vector graphics that we need to make exploitable for our development team.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.455
My first question is probably will,

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:38.285
who does all of that exporting?

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:42.080
Is that me as a designer or is that the development team?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.410
Now, there are two ways in Figma it works super well.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.550
You don't need to do anything,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.620
you just need to give a link through to inspect mode,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.685
and then they can just download in any file size in any way they wish.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:55.460
However, it's still good practice to prepare

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.624
your images and all your assets a little bit for downloading,

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:01.805
especially if you're using something like a hand of tool with sketch,

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:03.380
like if you're using Zeplin,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.440
then everything is prepared and they just need to click "Download".

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.500
You Might also be asked to hand over

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.660
an actual folder with all the assets already prepared in it. That's no problem.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.750
You do exactly the same setup as we're going to run through and then you're

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.080
just going to click "Download" and then hand over that folder.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.745
To prepare the exporting,

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:26.570
you simply click, for example,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.770
on this image here,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.970
then on your right-hand properties panel you see down here the Export settings.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.575
You click on that by the way,

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:35.285
exactly the same and sketch.

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:38.600
Then you see here, you can change that to a JPEG or

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.050
whatever file you want or retina as well.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.650
By the way, I'm going to run through all of those different kinds of

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.370
files that you can export and sizes in detail in a second.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.720
So bear with me.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.720
So I'm setting everything I want here and any can,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.090
I can either click here and download it

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.495
myself or it'll set up and then later in the inspect boat,

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.155
they will see all my setup and can just download it.

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:03.800
The same as here for example,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.150
for this vector graphic,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.890
I can see my icon here.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.780
I add, and I will choose an SVG. That's pretty much it.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.930
By the way, a handy little trick.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.735
Casey that my-delay off my icons is all named icon/ and then the name of the icon.

00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:22.870
If you doing this, for example, this same here.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.470
If I'm calling this image/about,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.240
then if I'm now exploiting this is automatically going to generate a folder called image.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.420
It's going to put all my images in there and the same for icons,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.550
so all icons are going to automatically be

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.365
saved in a folder called icons. This is super handy.

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:46.610
One around us up and giving you an overview of when you would export what kind of file.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.020
So JPEG you would use if you have just rectangular images and

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.150
photos without any opacity to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.880
should always be your first choice because it's quite small.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.310
Then if that doesn't work, use a PNG.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.710
If you have any transparency in your image,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.860
like for example, transparent background.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.115
SVGs use for any vector files such as logos and icon's,

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:11.285
SVGs are really great because they're really tiny and you can scale them to any size.

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:13.600
So you will always have the best quality.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.430
A PDF you would use, for example,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.440
someone asked you to export a whole page,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.905
you could include that in a presentation or to email it.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:23.540
This is really good quality,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.420
but it's quite large.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.330
Here's some last little bits to remember and then you're ready to go.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.995
So if you're exploiting,

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:32.435
you might have seen this.

00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:34.850
You need to export not only one image,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.190
1x is the actual sides you're exporting,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.555
but you also need to export it in 2x and 3x.

00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:45.140
This is for higher density screens and you don't need to do anything except set

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.330
those exports and then leave on that little suffix and it'll add 2x and 3x,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.040
because this is for the code,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.885
it will automatically pick the right image for the right display.

00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:57.830
Fallback images.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.410
If you using SVG is just for

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.545
the rear occasion does your SVGs can't be displayed by the browser.

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:06.810
Make sure you add fallback image.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.910
Width and height.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.830
This is a little trick just in case you need an image to be exported

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.925
at exactly 2,000 width and you don't want to change around the whole design.

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:20.165
Then you can just type in 2,000w and it will

00:07:20.165 --> 00:07:24.075
export it at that specific width that you were giving.

00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:26.565
I find it really handy at times.

00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:29.030
That's it. Once you've done all of that,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.290
everything is ready to go.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.880
Here you see my inspect tap,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.745
this is actually the view my development team would have in Figma,

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:40.010
I'm an Inspect, I go on Export and then they'll see all the presets are set up for them.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.155
Or in case they just need something else,

00:07:42.155 --> 00:07:47.500
they can just have presets and download it at any resolution sides or file they need.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.350
That's all you need and you're ready to go with all your images and icons.
