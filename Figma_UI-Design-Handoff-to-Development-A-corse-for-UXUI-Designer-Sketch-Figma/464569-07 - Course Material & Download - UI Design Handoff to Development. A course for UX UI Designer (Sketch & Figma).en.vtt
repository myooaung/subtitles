00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
You may want to work alongside me,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.280
so I prepared some files for you to download.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.580
In the course you're taking,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.295
simply navigate to project and resources,

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:12.885
and there you'll find all the information and the link we can download the material.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:15.450
Or you can navigate to my profile where you'll

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.220
also find a direct link to the download page.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.460
In this page you'll find a variety of downloads.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.500
You can simply pick the course that you're currently

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.440
taking and then just click ''Download'',

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.350
and it will automatically download the file for you.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.700
To open a Figma file to download it,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.025
it's important that you have a Figma account.

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:39.405
Inside your account, navigate to ''New'' and press ''Import''.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.075
You can then choose a file that you would like to open.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.465
It might take a moment as they're quite large,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:45.845
but once you imported them,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.775
they will be on your account and you do not need to repeat this process.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.830
I am working with Google Fonts for most of my designs.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.425
If you're working with the Figma app,

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:55.850
then you don't need to do anything,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.705
all Google Fonts are preloaded automatically.

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.100
If you want to work with Figma in the browser,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.570
then you just need to search the font that it's showing you as missing, for example,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.980
Poppins, I use a lot,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.715
and then you can directly download this font,

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.995
install it on your computer and you're ready to go.

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:15.620
All resources are free for existing students and you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.655
do not need to enter any additional information.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:22.780
You can of course also download any of the other files in case you're interested,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.020
so under general I always add anything that I think might be useful,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.610
so there is, for example,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.120
a Bootstrap template and then a list with links for

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.370
inspiration books and blocks that are really great for UX UI design.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.450
This list of downloads is steadily growing,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.120
so make sure you come back and have a look from time to time.
