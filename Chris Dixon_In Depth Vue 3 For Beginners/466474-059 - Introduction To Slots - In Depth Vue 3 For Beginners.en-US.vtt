00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.360
Previous videos have focused on passing data between components,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.535
using props and emitting custom events.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:14.025
This upcoming videos are going to show you how slots work in Vue.js,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:18.715
which is a really flexible way of passing around data in our apps.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:23.234
This example we looked at in the last video included a page component,

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:25.620
which was the account.view.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.875
We reuse the components nested inside,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.565
we pass information into these components using props,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.730
just like we see here for the user's name.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.810
Another way of outputting our components is to use an opening

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.675
and closing tag in place of the self-closing style from before.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.340
This style also works exactly the same too.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.230
For this style also now leaves us with the option

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.020
to add things between our components tags.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.645
It would pass in a level 3 heading,

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.835
but what exactly happens with this heading between our tags?

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:02.900
Well, this is completely up to us.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.050
If we do nothing, the content is ignored or we

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.060
can use slots to use this data in our user components.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.520
Looking at our user components template on the right,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.730
we have another element which contains a free list items,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.925
and this is all pretty standard.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:20.820
Take a look above this nav,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.205
and we have what is called a slot.

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:26.870
Slot acts like an holder for the content we pass into

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.455
it between the components opening and closing tags,

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:33.460
and in our case it was a level 3 heading.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.860
This slot element is very flexible and it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.385
can be placed anywhere inside of our component's template.

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:43.580
This approach may help you think in why do we even have

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.275
slots available when we can simply pass down props?

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:51.590
Well, this is a very valid question and one which is very understandable,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.610
looking at a simple example like this.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.790
But it is also a lot more to slots and a lot more use cases,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.460
and we'll take a look at these in the upcoming videos.
