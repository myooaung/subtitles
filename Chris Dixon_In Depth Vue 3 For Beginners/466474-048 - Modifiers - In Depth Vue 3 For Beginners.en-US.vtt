00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.510
In our form, we touched on modifiers a little earlier on when we use the prevent keyword,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.570
which is going to prevent the browser's default behavior,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.780
which is to refresh when submitting a form.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.940
There are other modifiers too,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.780
which we'll see during the course along with the key modifiers.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.360
Key modifiers will allow us to do certain things when a keyboard key is pressed.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.830
You could use case would be to maybe allow the user to hit "Enter",

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.970
to submit the form,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.985
rather than always having to use this "Add" button.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:39.210
But this we can copy this click event and then paste it into our Form Wrapper.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.155
Copy all of this, click "Section",

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:48.630
and then scroll up to the opening form tag, paste this in.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.330
Now instead of listening out for a click,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.145
we're going to listen out for a key up.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.540
This is something which we already know,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.520
but the difference is we are going to use

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.650
a modifier to say exactly which key we want to listen for.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.250
Over in the view documentation,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.585
have a list of common key aliases which we can use,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.205
such as delete, escape,

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:13.345
space, but we are going to make use of enter.

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:17.465
Of course, this doesn't cover all of the keys which is available on the keyboard,

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.665
these are just some of the aliases to the most common ones.

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:24.380
If we did want to use a key button which is not listed here,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.710
we could instead use any valid key names,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.305
and we can see a list just here.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:33.020
We can reference any of these keys,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.255
such as page down, which we see here.

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.865
But instead of typing it just like this,

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:42.205
we need to make this all lowercase and separate it by dashes.

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:45.110
For our example, we're just going to use the "Enter" key,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.850
[inaudible] this just after key up.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.725
Let's give it a try over to our application and refresh out new events.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.200
Now for this to work, we need to interact with all forms

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.935
since we've added this to the form element.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:02.025
So click on any of these inputs,

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:04.185
and from here we can press "Enter",

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.060
which will then submit our form.
