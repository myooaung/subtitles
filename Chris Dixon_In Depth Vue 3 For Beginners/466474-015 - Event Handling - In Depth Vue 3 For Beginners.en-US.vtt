00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.110
In addition to the directives which we have looked at so far,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.930
which include V4 and V bind.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.445
We're now going to look at another useful directive called V-on,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.775
which will allow us to react to certain events.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:18.690
This V-on directive is also passed to our elements,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.570
inside of the opening tag as an attribute,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.455
and we're going to use it to change between the light and the dark mode.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.645
When the user clicks on a button,

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:30.590
bringing us back in our index.html.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.390
Down inside of our blog section,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.430
we're going to add a HTML button.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.490
We can then include inside of the open side of the V-on the directive,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.315
which is going to listen for a click events.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.145
We can also listen for over events too,

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.154
just like in regular JavaScript,

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:51.095
such as on-submit, on-mouseover,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.035
on-cube, and so on.

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:56.210
The only difference is we remove the on-prefix,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.045
meaning not in events such as on-mouseover would simply change to mouseover.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:03.890
We however, on this occasion,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.500
want to listen for a click on this button,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.330
and then inside of the quotations,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.905
we want to actually do something when this button has been clicked.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.290
In this case we want to toggle between the dark mode,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.730
and we have this set as a data property called dark mode set.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.445
Inside here we're going to toggle list by setting

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:29.580
dark mode set to be equal to the opposite.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.190
The exclamation mark means that if dark mode set is currently true,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.960
this will toggle it to be false,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.495
and also the opposite applies too.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:42.780
Let's try this, in fact,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930
we need to add some text in between our button too.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.995
Click on this, and this will now toggle our dark mode.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.935
We can see the output of dark mode set,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:56.435
if we grab this,

00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:00.070
and then we can output this in between the curly braces.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.470
To see this more clear, this is currently set to false.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.225
Like this, it'll be true,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.530
false, and so on.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.140
As well as this V-on syntax,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.210
it is also a shorthand too,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.620
just like when we shortened the bind to use a colon,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.470
we can shorten V-on to use the at symbol,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.005
and this will work exactly the same.

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.460
This toggle button is not the best looking,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.530
so instead, we're going to replace this with a HTML entity.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.560
We can then toggle between a son and a moon icon,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.960
depending on our toggle state.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.245
The two icons which we're going to display are going to replace this toggle text.

00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:44.060
First of all, let's output our two icons.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.325
The first one is the ampersand,

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:52.350
the harsh, and then 9788 followed by the semicolon.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.755
The second one is the ampersand,

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:59.255
the harsh, and this is 9789.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:02.495
This will give us our two icons which we need,

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:05.675
but we only want to show one of these at a time.

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:11.185
We can use the JavaScript ternary operator to switch between these two icons.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:17.060
Open up the double curly braces and we can check if dark mode set is currently true.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.480
If it is, we're going to output as a string,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.905
the first icon, which is the sun.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:28.650
If not, we use the colon and then pass in the moon.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.690
Reload. We're currently in the light mode, so we see the moon.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.660
Click on this and this will switch to the sun.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.440
As we mentioned before alongside listening for our click events,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.370
we can also listen for over events too,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.655
such as mouseover, and this should now

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:54.190
toggle our state each time we hover over this particular button.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.135
However, for this example,

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.520
a click event makes more sense.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.620
I didn't award JavaScript expressions directly into the click event like this,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.839
is okay for small examples,

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.680
but is generally considered better to extract this out

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.415
of our HTML and places into a function or a method,

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:16.380
and this is what we're going to discover next.
