00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.695
I'm going to kick this off with the Orders page.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:08.745
If we scroll up to the commented section in the App.vue,

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:11.580
let's begin with this order section.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.870
I'm going to uncomment this out,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.665
so it's a little bit more clear what we are doing.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:23.130
Inside of here, the first section or the first slot we have is this total section.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.490
This contains the sales total component.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.080
What we need to do is to cut this out,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.640
and then go over to the Orders page,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.930
and place this in place of our total slot.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.980
The Orders.vue, this is the slot with the name of Total.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.215
Paste in our components.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.580
Now, we are making use of a component.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.975
What we need to do is to also import this into this file too.

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:55.150
Let's create a script section. I'll just blow this.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.120
Create our scripts section and just above the export default,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.695
we'll import this single component which was sales total.

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:08.250
The file path is../components,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.325
and then into the sales total.

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.860
Set up our component subject.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.625
Passing in this sales total.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:19.609
Next, over to the App.vue,

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.680
we still have this default section.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.760
If I highlight this,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.085
we could now grab all of the div,

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.405
which is nested inside with the class of order wrapper.

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:30.840
Put this out, I'm going to go clean up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.910
this orders components and then paste this into our slot.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.540
From here we consider this section that needs access to all of

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.710
the orders so we can now pass this down using it provides and inject.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.030
First, our provider, which is in the App.vue,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.720
set up the orders, which is equal to this two orders which lives on our data property.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.870
Over to the Orders.vue,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.750
we can now inject this into our script.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.270
This is an array with the single value of orders.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.295
This now places our orders back into this section.

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:17.809
We'll still see this because we have over in App.vue,

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.840
we still are putting in these orders components.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.805
I'm going to comment this out and click on the Orders link.

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:28.015
Everything is working fine.

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:31.025
Next to our bestsellers page,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.620
again, let's uncomment this out so it's more clear.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.080
This one's a little bit more straightforward.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.935
We only have this table.

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:43.145
Code this out. Over to the Bestsellers.vue page,

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:47.070
and we can replace the slot contents with our table,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.315
this also needs access to our computer property which is sorted items.

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:56.550
Let's pass this down in our provider.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.930
Sorted items, which is going to be equal to this got sorted items,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.874
which is a computer property over to our component,

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:11.565
which is bestsellers Set up a script.

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:15.050
All we need to do for this is to setup our injector array,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.570
which is going to accept the salted items.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.995
There's our table and we can clean up our App.vue by removing any of the old components,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.980
leaving this dynamic section.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.770
We don't need the bestsellers, we don't need the orders,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.640
and we don't need the overview section either.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.870
It was a test, we have the overview of the orders and also the best sellers too.
