00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.350
Along with use provide and inject to pass down data,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.425
we may also need a way to change from state in a parent components from within a child.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:13.890
We know about how to do this by emitting a custom events.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.110
But when using provides and inject,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.400
the way to approach this is to have a method in the same file as the provider,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.044
and then we pass down to the child components,

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.270
a reference to this method which you can then trigger.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.365
We are essentially creating a method in a parent components

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:35.280
and then calling it from a child who see an action.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040
We're going to figure the switching of our pages

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.810
from HR components inside of the app.view.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.490
Let's clean up this sidebar section and remove all of the slot contents.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.060
This will then remove our link and we can now place this back into

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.535
our sidebar.vue file instead of our slots,

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.585
since we now not receiving any slot data,

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.195
we can replace this with a link.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.685
This link will simply output the page from our loop,

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.910
and we now need to setup a method in the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.265
app.view which is triggered when we click on any of these links.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:14.520
Down to our scripts will setup the method section,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.350
and this method is going to be called changePage.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.910
This will also need to take in the page which you want to switch to,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.240
and then all we're going to do is to change

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.140
the dates property of selectedPage to be equal to this value.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.885
We can now pass down a reference to this method inside of our provider.

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:42.515
I'm going to keep these consistent and also call this changePage,

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.250
which is equal to our method of the same name.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.975
We want to toggle this change page down inside of the sidebar,

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:53.780
and just like we would pass down any data or state,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.780
we can also add this into an inject array.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.690
Now this page has access to all changePage method.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.735
We are now going to use our link inside of the template

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:09.260
to listening for a click and activate this method,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.355
so this now for a click,

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:14.250
that's now a method name of changePage.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.530
Remember, this also needs to take in the page which you want to navigate to,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.910
and we'll have access to this with this page variable.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.285
Let's try this out over to the browser, have the overview,

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:29.150
the orders, and also the best-sellers which

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.455
has now been triggered from this child component.

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.420
You finishes off we can change the cursor to be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.040
a pointer and we hover over any one of these links.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.850
A li styling is already setup and all I

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.720
need to do is to add at the cursor to be a pointer.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.155
Now this all works great, but there is something to be aware of,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:52.865
which is by default provides and inject is not reactive.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:56.735
This means if any of all provided values change,

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.994
the child components will not be updated.

00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:04.175
There is couple of ways we can view this if we do on reactivity,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.910
and our app has a component structure which is not too deep.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.345
We could just use props and emit.

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.650
We could also use provides and inject,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.510
set the initial values for child components once the upload,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.055
or alternatively, if we really wanted to use provides and inject,

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:24.435
but reactivity was important.

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:29.600
There is a way to do this when we combine this with the view free composition API,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.000
and this is something which we're going to discover soon.
