00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
These upcoming sections are going to focus on creating a new project,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.575
which is an event countdown application.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.635
We're going to be using the most sophisticated Vue CLI setup,

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:15.690
and also learning about how to pass data between components,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
and also a lot more techniques which Vue has to offer,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.375
such as watchers, computed properties,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.220
and so much more.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.440
Let's jump in to the next video,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.315
where we're going to download the starter,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:31.120
and then we can begin to build our project.
