00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.850
To kick off your Vue learning journey,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.430
we're going to apply lots of knowledge which we'll

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.610
learn during this section into a project.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.250
This project will be relatively straightforward.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.430
We will download a HTML, start a file,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.250
and then we will begin the process of converting this file over to use Vue.js.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.280
We'll learn all the fundamentals you'll need to know,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.640
such as events we'll take a look at the Vue lifecycle,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.655
finding data, we'll also look at lists,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.995
methods, and so much more.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:36.100
Let's jump in and I will see you in the next video.
