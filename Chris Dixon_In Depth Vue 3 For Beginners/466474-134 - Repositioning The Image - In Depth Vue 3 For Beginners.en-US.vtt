00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.490
Inside of our imageUpload component earlier on when we setup the template,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.625
we placed in three buttons to reposition the image,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.080
the top, the middle,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.960
or the bottom of the selected page.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.550
For these buttons to work,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.870
we need to [inaudible] click on any of these and then run a function.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.725
The function we haven't set up yet,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.680
but this will be called repositionImage,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.275
which will take in either the top,

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:30.510
the middle, or the bottom.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.050
Let's grab this, copy this,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.855
and place this into our second button,

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.610
as in this string of middle,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.530
the third one is called the bottom.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.115
Over to the useCurrentCard composable,

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:50.200
we can now set this up down on the bottom.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.950
This was repositionImage, as in the position.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.615
This will be very similar to our function just above.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.420
But this time rather than updating our background,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.610
we're going to update the backgroundPosition

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.600
and set this equal to our position,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.875
which is passed to all function.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:22.070
Also, if we wanted to just above in this updateImage function,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.060
we could also pass this into and setup a default position for this image,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.710
such as the center and then return our function.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.145
So this back over to the image-upload,

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.260
we're already importing our composable.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.400
We also need the function which was repositionImage,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.305
and then return this function back from our setup.

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:53.525
This matches the function name which we are calling each time we click

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:58.270
on these three buttons. Let's try this out.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.480
Currently, for correctly sized images which we have just here,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.655
the buttons won't work for this particular case because we have a full sized image.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:12.270
But if we go to choose "File" and insert a small image,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.200
which doesn't cover the full height of the card,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.365
we can now try all these buttons.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:22.220
We see straight away that the position is in the center,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.950
at the top, and the middle one isn't working.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.215
This just needs to be center.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:35.790
Let's try this. We have to reupload the file.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.600
We try this again.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.775
[inaudible] the top, the center,

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:44.870
and also the bottom, and this fixes our issue.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.340
The reason this works because over in the cardPreview components,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.165
we set this up as a style property.

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:57.300
Open this up and in the template early on when we set the background,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.790
we also added the backgroundPosition property and since everything is reactive,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.530
this is also being updated with the new position each time the data changes.
