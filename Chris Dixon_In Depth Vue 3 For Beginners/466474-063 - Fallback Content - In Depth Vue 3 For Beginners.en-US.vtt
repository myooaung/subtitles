00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.860
Here here, we have this slot outlive the content which were passed down,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.090
but what if we add something in between these two tags too?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.295
Well, we do this if we want to provide

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:16.080
some fallback content to show if nothing is passed to the slot.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.415
We can maybe add a message which has no data available.

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:25.005
Over to the browser, we don't see this message just yet,

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.850
but if we go over to the parents,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.455
which is the overview,

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:33.675
and then it temporarily remove the span elements which we pass in at to item sold.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:38.250
This is now replaced with this message of no data available.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.870
This is used for any fallback content if we don't

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.605
provide any slot data to our child components,

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.350
I want to undo this and save this file,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.050
but this is useful for a number of situations.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.485
For example, we may not always have some slot data to pass down to the child components,

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.960
especially if we are reusing the components multiple

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.940
times or there may be a delay in generating the slot data,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.755
so if this data which we placed inside a he was maybe fetch from a database or an API.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:11.690
While we're waiting on this data coming back,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.460
we may want to display some loading spinner or a placeholder message.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.995
Also, if we are using a component,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.785
let's say five times over in our project,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:24.785
if the data is going to be the same for four of them,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.170
we could make use of the fallback content

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.020
to provide the default for these four components.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.150
Then it changed the fifth components by passing slot data.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.235
This is really simple but really useful too.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:40.310
Next, we'll keep on subjective slots and discover

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.280
how to place multiple slots in our components.
