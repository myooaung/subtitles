00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.675
Using what we've learned so far,

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:07.080
have a mini challenge to try things out yourself.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.120
What I would like you to do is to go over to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.695
the header section which contains our free navigation links.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.020
Currently, each one of these links has

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.535
an href attribute which is pointing to the forward slash.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.815
Rather than having this hard-coded,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.605
we could create this as a dynamic attribute,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.850
and set the href value inside of our data property.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.040
If we go to our scripts,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.279
a good starting point would be to replace this links array with a array of objects,

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:42.824
just like above where we created our blog posts as an array of objects,

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:47.035
and it can use this array as a good starting point of your links.

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.775
This is number 1 covered.

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:53.000
Then next, the object should have URL property with a link.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.140
Instead of the ID, the title,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.850
and the body which we have in our blog post,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.085
we can maybe changes to be the ID,

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:02.165
the name, and the URL.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.140
The URL can be made up,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.675
it can be an external link,

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:10.950
or an internal link to a fictional page such as forward slash portfolio.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.205
But now, don't worry if the page which we link into is being created or not.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:18.440
All we are worried about is creating a dynamic link.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.685
Then just as with the blog posts,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:27.300
number 3 is to loop through this array using v-for and set a unique key.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.390
Finally, using the <a> element,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.270
we're going to create a link to each page.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.930
As a hint, we can use the v-bind directive which we

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.500
learned about in the last video for the href attribute 2.
