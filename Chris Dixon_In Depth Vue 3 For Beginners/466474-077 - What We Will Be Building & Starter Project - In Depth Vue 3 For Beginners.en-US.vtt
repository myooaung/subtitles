00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.755
Welcome back to this brand new section.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:06.120
For the upcoming sections,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.885
we're also going to have a new project called Creative Cards.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.305
This is going to be a card editing application

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.350
and we can see from the start screen here we have the header section,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.855
we have some links to popular categories.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.375
Then we have all of our available categories listed below.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:27.945
This is all generated dynamically from the data which we have in our application.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:32.310
We can click on any of these categories and see all of the available cards,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.875
which match this current category.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:39.075
If we select all, we see a link for all of the available cards,

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:41.715
which we can now select to edit.

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.115
If we click on any of these,

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:46.525
we are then taken to the edit view.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.260
We can select all the pages.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.765
We have the front, the inside left,

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.915
inside right, and also the back too.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:57.950
From any of these views we have the intersection of on the right.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.840
We can select new images which you want to use for all backgrounds.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.210
We can interchange the position of this image.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.050
We can also remove the image too if we don't want to have one for this particular page.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.990
We can also edit this text and any changes which we make

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.260
are reflected in the preview over on the left.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.830
Over and over this we also have some access to all options.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.555
We can change the font type,

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:22.550
we can change the font style.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.200
We can change the color and also make it bold, italic.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.905
We can increase the size of the section.

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.575
We can set the horizontal and vertical alignment too.

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.700
This is the exact same for any one of our pages.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580
These are all fully editable.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.730
We're not stuck with the defaults which are provided on the first click on this card.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.375
This will also be linked to a database too so we want to be happy.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.865
We can then click on the Place Order button

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:53.065
and it will send this order through to a database.

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:57.755
Along with a database, we'll also explore some new features in the upcoming sections,

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:59.780
such as serverless functions,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.120
we'll take a look at the vue router,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.085
the vue composition API,

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.025
and so much more.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.330
As with the rest of the project,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.919
if you download the creative card starter from the GitHub repository,

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.025
if you already have the folder from the start of the course,

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.805
you can head into there and open up the creative card starter.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.015
I've already navigated to this inside the terminal

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:27.025
and opened this up inside of visual studio code.

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:31.280
To begin, we have a pretty basic view CLI setter.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.250
But we'll just stay few additions for this project inside of the index dot HTML.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.965
I've added a link to Google Fonts.

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:42.395
The source directly contains inside of the assets folder,

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:46.840
some icons and also some images which we're going to use as a starting point.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.105
We will have a router folder and we'll take a look at this next.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:54.815
But probably the most important part is this data dot js.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:57.650
This is an array of different cards which we're

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.595
going to use as a starting point for this project.

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:03.845
These are the sections which are all fully editable.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.905
When we change these sections inside of here,

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:11.320
this is an array which contains objects for each one of our cards.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.000
I have the ID, the name,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.780
and also the categories which this card belongs to and these are all

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.435
used to generate the categories which you see on the homepage just here.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.665
After this, an array of pages,

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:28.200
we have the front, the inside left,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.035
the inside right, and also the back,

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:34.125
a default background image position.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.445
Then we jump into the card sections,

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:40.630
this is the tech sections with all of the data.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.535
We have the height, the color,

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.110
and also the font family,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.430
along with all of the other options which are all editable from our menu.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.940
The only thing we need to do now is to head over to the terminal and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.050
run NPM install using the NPM I command.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.730
This will install all of the node packages which we need for this project.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.230
And once this is done,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.730
we'll now move on to the next video where we'll install the vue router.
