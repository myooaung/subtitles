00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.390
Moving on with this drop-down menu section,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.230
we still have the middle section and also the bottom section too into our text input.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.050
Then if we go to this menu in the middle section,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.680
this is going to contain a up and a down arrow.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.455
But now they're just going to be a set of icons,

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.545
but later on, these would trigger a function.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.520
To change the height of the section,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.120
wrap these in a button,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.310
and the icon is also in the assets folder, into the icons.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.650
This one is the arrow up.svg, the alt text too.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.770
Then the second button is for the arrow down.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.865
Save. There we go.

00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:59.865
Then finally, we have this Menu button.

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.790
This Menu button is going to be mainly alignment,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.935
so we can move the text up and down,

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.100
and from left to right too.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.150
These are going to be two sets of radio buttons,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.990
one for the vertical alignment and one of the horizontal alignment.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.215
So I'll pass in a label,

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:23.020
which will wrap our input with the type of radio,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.170
the model, which is going to model to current section.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.710
Then justify content.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.280
Justify content will control the positioning across the page from left to right.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.645
Then we pass in a value.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.945
The value will be the text we passed to our card object

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:48.905
and this needs to be one of justify content's CSS values.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:51.125
So this one will be flex-start.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:53.999
Then the name of horizontal.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.770
This name of horizontal will be used to link

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.395
together all three of our horizontal buttons.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:04.135
Then we'll have some vertical bonds for the vertical alignment.

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.839
Just as we did above with the checkbox,

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:11.930
we're also going to hide this radio input too and replace this with an icon.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.140
The icon goes in the image elements and the path is in the assets.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.674
Into the icons.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:26.410
The left icon.svg and the alt text too.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.840
So this one is controlling the left alignment and we're going

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.900
to copy this and paste this in two more times,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.285
and the middle one is for the center.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.100
So we're still justify any content,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.470
but the value this time is center.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.060
These three buttons are related,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.535
so we keep the same name of horizontal.

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:47.605
This means the user can only press one of these buttons at a time.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:52.495
The image is the center, the alt text.

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:57.185
Then the third one will set the right alignment or in flex-box language,

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.440
this will be the flex end.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.640
The image has the name of right,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.650
and also the alt text too.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.095
Now, let's see if this works okay in the browser.

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:13.010
We can only select one of these at a time since they all have

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.670
the same name and these are also updating our object at the top.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.725
So the next group is going to be for the vertical alignment.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.295
If we copy one of these,

00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:28.760
paste this just below, we have a couple more changes to make.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.475
Rather than setting it justifyContent,

00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:34.420
we need to change this to be align items.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.950
The first value is for the flex-start,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.750
the name of vertical.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.505
This icon is for the top.

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:48.135
Then it duplicated this one two more times.

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:52.600
The next one is for the center.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.850
The icon has a name of middle.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.275
The final one is for the bottom,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:06.330
which is the flex-box value of flex-end.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.270
The image is bottom.svg.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.065
Finally, the alt text.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:17.630
Over to the menu. It's looking pretty bad now,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.010
but let's try this out.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.860
For each one of these, we see the flex-start,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.415
the sensor, and also the flex-end too.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:30.495
Now we have this menu in place and we know it's now linked to our current section.

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:34.090
Next we're going to move on to improving the styling.
