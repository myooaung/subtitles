00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.490
To get started with this course,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.605
there is very little you will need.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.510
If you're watching this video, the chances are,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.975
you already have most of the things you need already setup.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.810
We're going to need a web browser and I'm going to be using

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.670
Google Chrome throughout this course but you can use any other major browser.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.770
Also for editing the code,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.340
we will need a text editor.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.010
I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code and you can find the link just here.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.040
This is also free to use too.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.470
If there's anything we need long way during the course,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.880
we will download it.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.835
There won't be any additional purchases to make,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.510
so all you need is an eagerness to learn Vue 3.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.850
I'm going to begin this in the next video.
