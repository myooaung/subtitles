00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.930
We'll take a look at this create.vue component.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.355
Early on we passed in the CardPreview and also the CardEdit.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.885
We also passed in the selectedPage to both of these components.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.290
In a previous video, we used this selectedPage,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.355
looped through each one of the sections and then I'll put the text in each section.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.480
We're going to do a similar thing for the CardEdit,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.340
which also has the same props.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.325
For this time, it's going to be on the right hand side.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:34.905
The text is going to be placed into a text area which the user can edit.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.535
We can also hover over this section.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:41.585
We'll look at a drop-down menu to edit any of the styles too.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:46.250
But this section, we setup the CardEdit.vue components early on.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.085
Let's get to work on this component by first adding our scripts action.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:54.945
I need to take in the props as an object,

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.760
pass in the selectedPage,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.990
which is the type of object.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.350
But now this template will be pretty straightforward.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.925
We're just contain place in a div,

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:10.970
which is going to contain a v for attributes.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.770
We can live through each one of the sections in our selectedPage.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.900
The key, we all have

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.455
a unique key for each one of these sections which we can see in the data.

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.900
We can access the section.ID.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.265
But I'll pass in the section.userInput just to check this is all working.

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.080
As we just mentioned a bit later on,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.475
this was placed inside of a text area so the user can edit this text,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.860
save this and the single piece of text for

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.405
this card is now displayed all on the edit section.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:54.705
Let's try the inside right.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:57.105
This is all working too.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:59.015
A pretty straightforward video,

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.460
but we now have the text available on the screen.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.350
In the next video, we're going to replace this user inputs with a separate component.
