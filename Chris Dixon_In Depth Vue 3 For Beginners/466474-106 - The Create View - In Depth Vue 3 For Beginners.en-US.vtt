00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.915
Clicking on any of these selected cards will now link us to this Create component.

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.360
This page is what we now want to work on.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.620
We're going to split it into two sections.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.580
The left section will have a card preview,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.825
which will show the initial cards and also any changes which we'll make too.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.020
Then the right section is going to be used to edit this card,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
including the images and also the text sections too.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.670
For these sections, for the preview and the edit section,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.565
we're going to create two new components

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.839
into the components folder to keep these organized,

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.075
a folder called card.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.290
This will group all of our card-related components.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.220
A new file. One is the CardEdit.vue.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.110
Also, the second one, also in the same folder is for the card preview.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.140
Now, both these are just going to have a simple template with a level 1 heading.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.150
This one is the card preview.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.095
Grab this and save. Then we can place this inside of the CardEdit.

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:15.260
As we just mentioned, both these components are going to be

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.145
displayed inside of this Create.vue.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.500
To begin to create a script section,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.995
which is going to be used to import both of these components, the first one,

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:30.705
the CardPreview into the source,

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:36.685
the components, the new card folder, and the CardPreview.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:41.340
Duplicate this. This one is for the CardEdit.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.990
Inside of the export, we'll then register our components.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.445
This is all we need for our script for now.

00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:58.504
I would go up to our template.

00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:02.550
I'm going to create a div with the class of card_wrapper.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.070
This is the main wrapper div for both of the sections.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.415
We'll have the preview on the left and the edit section on the right.

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.915
This just means we could target the section with our styling.

00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:16.515
First, the left section,

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:18.630
and then the right section.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.020
The left is for the CardPreview.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.440
Now, place the CardEdit section on the right.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.365
Let's see if everything is okay.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.950
Refresh. We have the CardPreview and the CardEdit components.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.460
Of course, these are not laid out on the left and right just yet because we need to go

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.240
down to the style section and add some CSS to this card_wrapper.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.050
It's going to also be scoped.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.680
To begin the display type of flex,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.305
and the default flex direction is row,

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:57.460
which will place these two components across the page.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.890
Also, this main wrapper is going to have a background color.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.289
We'll get the simple and go for a light gray color of EEE,

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.290
a box shadow of one pixel,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.615
one pixel, two pixels.

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:15.075
The color of the DDD,

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.940
and the shadow to be inset.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.660
This means the shadow will be placed inside of our section rather than on the outside.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.950
Next, we'll take a look at the finished version and go into one of these cards.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.175
We see that both this section on the left and the section on the right is both equal.

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:36.350
To achieve this, we're going to grab our card_wrapper,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.980
and each one of these was wrapped in a section.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.990
Make them both equal.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.390
We can pass in a flex value of one and also a little padding on the inside of 10 pixels.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.375
Refresh. Now, this flex value of one will apply to both of these sections,

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.430
giving them equal spacing.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.620
Now, we have this layout all setup.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.925
In the next video,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:03.330
we're going to actually display the selected card onto this page.
