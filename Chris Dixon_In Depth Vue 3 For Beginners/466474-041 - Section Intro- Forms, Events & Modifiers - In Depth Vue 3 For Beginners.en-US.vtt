00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
These upcoming videos are going to focus on a really important part of,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.220
not only Vue.js, but web development in general,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.635
and this is handling forms.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:14.325
We'll take a look at lots of things such as emitting data,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.985
backup to a parent component, validating all forms,

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.600
also binding our data with Vue.js,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.490
and also some other things such as

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.820
event propagation and how we can handle this with modifiers.
