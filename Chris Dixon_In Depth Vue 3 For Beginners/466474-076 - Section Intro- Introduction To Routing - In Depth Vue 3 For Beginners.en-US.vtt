00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.970
When building our applications,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.120
we often have the use case to switch between multiple pages.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.970
For this Vue also has us covered by providing a router package.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.310
If you router is created and actively maintained by the Vue.js core

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.865
team so we can be confident that it's going to be compatible with your version of Vue,

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:25.675
and also any updates, too.

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.205
Alongside, if you're switching between our pages,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.690
the relative package also has lots of other great features too,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.120
which we will discover in this upcoming section.
