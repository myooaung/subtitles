00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
So far we've only been working on this Overview page.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.005
Soon we'll make use of dynamic components,

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.420
switch between these three pages.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.800
But first, let's add our content to the Orders and Best-sellers.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.504
The Orders page is going to be made up of two sections.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.245
For the first section we'll place in

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:24.015
the sales total components so we can see the total sales value.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:29.240
Then below this will create a new section which is going to display all of our orders.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.925
Let's go over to our Orders page,

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.349
open up the sidebar,

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.710
and this is in the View section.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.465
Our first section, just below the level three heading.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:45.670
This is going to be a slot which will output the content of our sales total components.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.015
Let's give it a name of total.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.805
We'll pass this down via our template in just a moment.

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:55.640
The second section, is going to be the wrapper for our second slot,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.355
and this will be for the list of orders.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:01.805
Place in our second slot inside here.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:06.400
We don't need to give it a name since this can inherit the default value.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.480
Next over to the App.vue.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.140
We can first begin to work on this Orders page.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.050
We're going to comment out this overview,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.210
and also the registration,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.030
and then replace this with our imports for our orders.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.060
This one is in the Views folder.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.860
Registers this inside of the component section.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.074
Then back up to our templates,

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:35.820
lets comment out overview section,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.745
and replace this with our orders.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:43.620
We will be passing this slot contents so this needs the opening and the closing tag.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.735
We have two slot locations,

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.490
so this needs two templates.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.410
These slot attributes, for the first one,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.625
to be for the total.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.075
The second one is going to be for our default content,

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:01.830
which is going to be our list of orders.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.444
This first template section is going to contain our sales total components,

00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:10.580
just like we used over in the Overview.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.785
If we take a look at this section,

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:15.100
this also contains slots to.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.275
Here we're passing down our icon,

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.225
and also the total sales value.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:25.070
To keep this consistent we can copy this full components section,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.750
then make use of this over in our App.vue. Paste this in.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.250
This will also need to be registered and imported. Let's do this now.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.100
Import our sales total,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.645
dot slash, and this is in the Components.

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:48.610
Then we grab our sales total.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.185
Then finally, register this component.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:55.110
Say there is someone else here inside of his orders page,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.450
will now have the component displaying.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.385
We can see the icon but we have not yet passed down our dynamic content,

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.210
which is the total sales value.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.525
Let's do this now, if we go back to our templates inside of the App.vue.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:11.375
Earlier when we created the Overview page,

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.645
we passed down this total sales value as a prop.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:16.400
This was just some dummy data,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.265
but now we're going to grab our real data,

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.860
which is provided with this project.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.500
To grab this inside of the sidebar,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.565
take a look for the Orders.js file.

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.170
We can now import this,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.030
and loop through all of our orders to extract

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.055
all of the data which we need passed down to this components.

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:39.555
Make use of this, we need to first import this file,

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:42.895
so we can use this inside of our JavaScript.

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:47.210
We can import our orders from our Orders file.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.600
This is a named import inside of these curly braces.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.255
This will allow us to import a single member from our Orders file.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:59.435
A single member we want to import is this orders variable.

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:03.805
We can import this because we've exported this as a constant.

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:07.100
If the Orders file did have other exports we could also

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.240
import them individually inside here to,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.900
but we only have this single orders.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.445
Then what we need to do is to scroll down and create our data section,

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:19.675
so we can make use of this in view JS.

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:22.800
Place in the orders which we've just imported.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.300
Now, we have access to this inside of our template.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.405
To output these correctly inside of our template,

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:32.050
we first need to do two loops.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.290
The first loop is going to loop over each one of our orders and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.915
then for each order we need to loop through all the items inside of this order.

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:45.105
Let's do this now, over in the App.vue, scroll up.

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:46.925
Inside of this order section,

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.525
look out for this second default template.

00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:53.300
It's inside here where we are going to create these two loops.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.770
First, a wrapper div which will have the class of order, underscore, wrapper.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.315
Next, inside of this wrapper,

00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:06.930
a second div which is going to surround each one of our orders.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.210
To loop through these orders,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.940
we'll loop through all of the orders data property.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.270
This will also need a dynamic key which we can grabbed from the unique id,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.485
which is available for each one of these orders.

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:27.400
We can access this with order.id.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.970
Now, to structure these, let's add some text at the very top,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.475
and this is going to display the order number.

00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:39.560
We know we already have access to this order number with order.id.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.345
We can place this inside of the double curly braces,

00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:46.175
and then blow each one of these order numbers.

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.570
Create an unordered list,

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.180
which we are going to look through each one of our sold items.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.960
The wrapper. Then we'll use the list item to

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.815
create a v-for loop for each one of our items.

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:06.500
We can start each one of these in the variable which is item, in order.items.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.210
Finding a dynamic key.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.925
Now, we need to be careful with the key for each one of these.

00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:15.520
If we take a look at each one of our orders,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.725
remember that the items array contain the same product in any one of the orders.

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:25.600
Therefore, we could make use of duplicate ids.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.640
Now, if we're using a database,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.860
we could generate a unique id.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.510
But for demonstration purposes,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.405
since we're not using a database,

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:35.720
and don't have access to a unique id.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.735
What I'm going to do is also to access the index number and combine this with the item.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:45.815
Just after the item, grab the index.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:48.990
Places this in as the key.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.540
If this was a real production site,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.500
this is probably something to avoid.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.735
You should really try to generate a unique id for each one of these products.

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:03.190
For demonstration purposes, this will be just fine.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.825
Inside here will create a P element which is going to output the item.name.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:11.240
Then we can also output the item price,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.590
just afterwards with item.price.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.555
Give this a refresh, you will now see a list of all of our orders,

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.615
and these are now formatted as a unordered list.

00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:25.085
We finish this off over to our Orders.vue file,

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:27.770
where we can add in a little CSS.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.500
First of all, the unordered list [inaudible] bullets with list-style,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.690
lets set this to be non.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.555
The font-style of italic.

00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:43.100
Then the wrapper for each one of our orders,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.320
which hard at the class of order.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.315
I'm padding to give this some spacing of 10 pixels.

00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:52.500
Also, to give this some spacing on the top and bottom we can add

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.460
some margin of 10 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.015
and then zero on the left and right.

00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:03.215
A boarder for each one of our orders of one pixel. A solid line.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.815
I'm going to go for a gray value of DDD,

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:10.380
border-radius of five pixels.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.830
Save this and refresh the browser.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.410
Now, we have all of our orders now in place.
