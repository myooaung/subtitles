00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
When learning a new skill and coding our four projects,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.185
there are probably will be a point when you will get stuck.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.150
Sometimes your code just won't work,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.460
and you can't spot that error.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.300
Now to help with this provided with the course after each one of

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.320
the lectures is the source code at each individual stage,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.390
and you can download this from GitHub.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.320
Inside of GitHub and my profile,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
which is chrisdixon161, and then /vue-3-course.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.155
Here Here where you'll find all the project source code for this course.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.240
It should be pretty easy to navigate.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.265
At the top, we have the first four projects numbered 1-4,

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.900
and these are in the same order which you will take them during the course.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.260
For example, if you stuck on the portfolio project, click into this,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.380
and then we'll see in order all of the lectures which will go through for these projects.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.340
They are numbered, so we have number 2,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.770
which is the section number and video 1,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.420
section 2, video 2,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.370
and then the video name.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.360
You can click into this, and see the final code after this video,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.225
and go into anyone of these files.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:12.380
Along with this, if we go back to the root of our repo,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.270
we also have the starter files for all four of our project.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.345
The starter files are going to ensure we are on the same version numbers

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:24.500
when progressing give you a smooth path throughout this course,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.815
and we'll take a look at how to set these up as we progress.

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:31.210
To access these, we need to click on this green button.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.685
There will be a drop-down,

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.975
and you can download this full repository as a ZIP file.

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:41.500
Then this will give you access to all of these starters and all of the code samples too.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.240
Go ahead and download this,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.610
and place this somewhere convenient such as your desktop,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.920
and we can grab the starter files when needed.
