00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.810
If you've never used a router before,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.150
it is a package we can use to basically switch between our pages or views.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.255
Since we're dealing with single-page applications,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:17.910
we don't have the traditional way of changing pages by requesting them from this server.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.285
Instead, we rely on a router which will map a URL to one of our components.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:29.280
This is a much more flexible and advanced way of navigating our applications,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.085
the only way we looked at in the previous project

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.670
when we set up a dynamic component for this use case.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000
Its not just about switching pages though,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.560
there is a lot more features,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.480
we'll also just go over to.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.510
Also the vue-router package is officially

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.475
supported and maintained by the Core Vue.js team.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:50.760
So it is deeply integrated,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.050
supported, and also kept up-to-date too.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.090
There is a CDN link,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.445
but since we're using the view CLI,

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.085
installation is really simple.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.910
To keep our packages on the same version,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.260
the starter project which we have here,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.010
already has this router installed.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.520
We can see this over in the package.json into the dependencies.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.270
We've the vue-router which is really simple to add,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.140
and if you do want to add this a different project which you are creating on your own,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.860
yo u can go over to the terminal.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.540
Remember, this is already installed,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.590
so don't run this command.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.125
But if you were using this on a different project,

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:30.970
you could install with the vue-router,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.445
with the command of a vue add router.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:38.550
This will add the vue-router as a CLI plug-in,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.545
and also give you the option of setting up a history mode,

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:43.225
which we'll look at later.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.770
For this particular project,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.595
we have not yet set up history mode when include new router.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:52.035
Once the vue add router command has finished running,

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:54.175
if you go into the source directory,

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:56.155
this will add a new folder.

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.435
The new folder is this router just here,

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.700
which contains a Index.js file.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.710
If we take a look at the top,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.735
the first thing we'll do is to import the packages which we need from the vue-router,

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.760
we'll talk about the history modes very soon,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.950
but this is the package which we need to create a new vue-router.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.430
Then below this, we import any component

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.000
which you want to switch between from our router.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.280
Here we have the import from our Home components,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.015
which is been added with the Vue CLI.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:28.880
It's created a views directory with the about,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.780
and also the homepage to get started with the router.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.860
Next, we have a array of routes which we want to use for our application.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.160
Each one of these objects contains a path.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.235
We have the home link and also the about's link just below.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.105
Each one of these links will map to a particular component.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:50.420
This one is linking it to our home components.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.090
If we take a look at the about component,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.045
this is a little different to the one just above.

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:57.875
This one is using code splitting,

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.535
and we'll take a look at how to do this later on.

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:05.030
We then create a router object which contains any configuration which we need,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.370
such as the history which we just mentioned before.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.355
We also pass in our route array too.

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.470
Finally, we export our router file,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.535
so this can be used in our application of to the main.js.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:20.915
We then import this exported router just here,

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:25.130
and then add this to our application before this is mounted to the done.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.025
It's an action that goes to the terminal and starts up

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:32.010
our development server would NPM run serve.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.220
Open this up. We now have two links at the top of the page,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.830
about the home, which links to /,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.720
then also the about this page too.
