00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome back. We've now had a little time to play around

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.200
with the Vue Router and see some of its features.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.220
Now, we can take what you've learned and apply it to our new project.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.860
To begin, we'll clean up this follow four-page by removing the message and then

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.830
go to our router file and reinstate this to cover all not found pages.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.200
Then next, we're going to go into the views folder and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
create the four new pages which we need for our project.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.030
We can remove the about,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.440
we don't need this, the account, remove the homepage.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.674
We're going to even need NotFound components,

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:47.590
we can remove the UpdateProfile and also the UserOrders too.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.790
For now, we'll create our four new pages,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.960
and the first file which we're going to be accessing is the Admin.vue.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.090
The next page is going to be for the AppHome.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.130
The third one is for the Category.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.760
This is a page to display all of our cards by the category.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.425
Then finally, the Create.vue,

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:17.120
which will be the vue which we use to edit the card.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.920
Just so we can see these for now,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.605
we'll add in a template and a level 1 heading,

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.470
and the title for this page was create.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.495
We can copy this,

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:29.435
paste this into the other three pages.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:33.690
This one was category, save this,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.530
and the AppHome, and also the Admin too.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.745
We'll also use the router to switch between all four of these vues.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.415
So head out to the routers index page,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.560
I'm going to replace all four of these pages with our new pages.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.860
The first one is for the admin,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.640
the second one is the AppHome,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.410
the third one is for create,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.440
and then also the category too.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.650
The entry points of the home router is going to be this AppHome.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.590
We can amend this,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.080
we don't need the about page,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.755
so we can change this to be the category,

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:32.770
the name of category too,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.970
and then replace this dynamic import with a regular component.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.375
We also don't need the account section so we can replace this to be /create,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:49.845
the name of create, the component.

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:53.785
We can also remove the children array.

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:56.615
We also need to create one more object,

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:59.610
and this one is for our admin route.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.895
Over to our main app.vue file,

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:14.495
inside here, we're going to remove all of the links,

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:17.150
leaving it just in place the router view,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.800
so we can grab this div,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.785
which is the wrapper, remove this.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:27.905
This app is not going to have a traditional style menu to switch between these pages.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:33.005
Instead, we'll navigate when the user clicks on a category or a particular card.

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.405
Once the card has been selected,

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:39.730
we will then use the router to switch between these card pages.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.880
For now, we can test the routes.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.545
All we need to do is to go at the end of our URL and test out the category.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:51.910
Also, create, we also have the admin route.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.365
This is also fine.

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:58.305
Then finally, the homepage.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:03.175
All of these routes are now correctly mapped to our four pages.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.419
We also need a header component,

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.390
so we can place this inside of the components folder.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.025
Open this up and we still have this HelloWorld component.

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:20.630
We can rename this as the AppHeader.vue. Let's clean this up.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.930
I'm going to remove everything for now and place in the template,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.200
which is going to contain the header section and also

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.680
our title inside of a level 1 heading of creative cards.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.990
After this, a navigation section,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.925
which is going to contain three links to popular categories.

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:44.075
So create an unordered list with three list items.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:48.360
The first list item will contain the router link.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.710
Pass in the to prop.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.630
We don't need to make these dynamics since this is just a regular string of /category.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.725
Then we'll navigate to the birthday section.

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.770
Pass in the text of birthday.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.285
We can also copy this list item and use this two more times.

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:12.630
The next one is going to be going to the anniversary route,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.275
the text, and then paste in the third one at the bottom.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:24.119
This will be Christmas.

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:27.400
You can also change these categories if you want to,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.010
much easier if we date different section.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.630
Whatever route we own, we always going to be displaying this main AppHeader,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.715
so we can import this over in the app.vue.

00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:42.220
In the script section, create our import.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.530
We can use the @ symbol to access the source into the components and then the AppHeader.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:01.320
Register this just below, remove the data too.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.925
We also don't need this from the previous videos,

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:05.515
so we can remove this.

00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:07.120
Then up to the template,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.640
we can register this just above the router view,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.875
so this AppHeader will always be displayed at the top.

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:21.875
Then the content from our router view will be placed just below.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.250
Good. So we now see the header,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.490
we can test out these links.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.870
We have the birthday,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.725
the anniversary, Christmas, but this header needs a little styling.

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:35.365
You can place all of the styles into the header component if you wanted to,

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:40.825
but I'm going to place in the general list styles into our app.vue.

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:44.605
Also, the section will not have the scope attribute,

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:48.485
so this will apply to all of the list items in our app.

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:54.250
Removing navigation styles, these were added in automatically from the router,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.360
access the unordered list.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.070
Then inside here, we'll just reset any browser defaults by setting

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.670
the margin to be zero and also the same for the padding too.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.110
After this, I will list items and also our links.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.250
We set the text decoration to be none.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.580
This will remove all of the underlines from our links.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.395
The list style to also be none,

00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:24.860
and to also remove the default link color,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.390
we'll set the color to inherit from the parent.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.900
Okay. These are just general resets and defaults for our list items,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.880
and for the more specific header styles,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.235
we'll go back over to our AppHeader and then create our style section.

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:42.190
This can also be scoped.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.565
First of all, all of this content was wrapped inside of this header.

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:52.580
I'm going to set the font family by using a Google font,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.160
which is inside of our index page.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.235
From the starter files inside of our index page,

00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.520
this is linked just here.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.290
This gives us access to two font styles which we can use in our project.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.540
You can also go over to Google Fonts,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.535
so any different font provider,

00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:12.260
and use a different style if you prefer.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.010
Back to our header section,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.025
a cursive fall back,

00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:22.080
and then also the letter spacing of one pixel.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.770
This will just add a little bit more space in between each one of our letters.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.760
The font size of 18 pixels,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:39.250
a border on the bottom of one pixel, a solid line,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.170
and the color of light gray,

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.830
and pixels all padding also on the bottom which is going

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.165
to separate the content from this line.

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:52.580
Then we can access the flex box to move this title over to

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.410
the left and then our links over to the right.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.140
Display flex, space between would justify

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:10.720
contents and vertical alignment with align items by placing these into the center.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.650
Very soon, this level 1 heading is also going to link to the home route,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.440
so we can add a cursor to our h1.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.795
The cursor of pointer,

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:27.540
and also remove any default margins or the heading.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.800
Over to our links over on the right,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.860
grab the unordered list,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.820
and then we can set the alignments with the display flex.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.955
Since the default flex direction is row when using the flex box,

00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:46.250
these are now placed across the page.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.235
We just need some space in between our list items.

00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:56.110
We can do this with some padding on the left of 0.5 rems,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.040
and now, our header is all complete.
