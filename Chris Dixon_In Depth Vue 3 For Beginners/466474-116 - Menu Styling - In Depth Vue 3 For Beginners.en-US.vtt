00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
This menu now needs some styling and also some layout too,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.905
which we want to do over in the textinput.view,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:12.030
starting with this top row which has the class of menu top.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.805
So I'll jump down to the very bottom,

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.815
create the style section,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.500
and also add in the scoped attribute.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.810
Remember that each one of our icons are surrounded in the image element,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.610
so what we're going to do for this is to set the maximum width to be 30 pixels.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.255
The full menu was surrounded in

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:38.110
this menu class and this was a wrapper for all of our inputs.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.240
First of all, let's set the position to be absolute and by setting this to be absolute,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.285
this will float above all of the rest of the content rather than push this down.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.415
What we mean by this, if you go to a project,

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.170
if you have multiple inputs,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.730
like we do just here,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.105
the icons will appear over any of the content just below,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.035
rather than push this down of the page.

00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:07.410
The background. You can choose any color which suits you,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:16.095
but I'm going to place in a 30 degree linear-gradient and the values of RGB 253,

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:21.285
207, 207, add a comma,

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:24.140
and the second color of red, 140,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.500
green 140 and blue, 236.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.480
This also needs some padding inside and we'll round

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.120
the bottom left and the bottom right corners too.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.560
Padding of 10 pixels and the body radius,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440
we only want to apply this to two outsides,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.420
so the top will be zero,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.515
and then three pixels for our bottom.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:56.180
Okay. Next, we wrapped each one of our roles in the class of menu top, menu, middle,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.730
and many bottom, and we can make use of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.975
the CSS flexbox to set the alignment across the page.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.810
All of these inputs are different heights,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.460
so we won't need to be across the same center-line inside of our style.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.715
Grab our menu-top and also,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:18.810
the menu-bottom, the display type all flex,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.740
and then align items into our center.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.925
Next this middle row, where we have the up and down arrows,

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:29.420
this needs to be over on the left of the menu and we can do

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.545
this by setting the display type to be flex.

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:37.330
Grab the middle section, set this to be flex,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.110
and by setting this to flex,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.890
we'll have the default values of flux row and also appear at the start of the row too.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.500
Now, we also want to remove the border and the background for these two buttons too,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.865
and also change the cursor to be a pointer.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.930
We could also do this inside of this same components,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380
but I'm going to place this over inside of the app.vue,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.755
and therefore, this will also apply to other buttons too.

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:05.360
So let's grab our button.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.335
Remove the background, remove the border with none,

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.990
the cursor of pointer.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.790
The font size of 14 pixels,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.960
and then remove any default paddings with a value of zero.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.990
Refresh. Okay. So this also maybe wants some spacing too,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.570
so back to our text input.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.520
Grab the menu middle,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.845
and we'll select the image.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:46.095
The height of 10 pixels and then some padding.

00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.810
We don't want this padding to push this away from the left edge,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.565
so we're going to apply the padding to the top,

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:53.350
the right, and also the bottom.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.660
There we go. This now gives us a little bit more spacing.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.620
Just to clarify, when we added this button style over in the app,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.875
it's not essential that we place any global styles inside here.

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:09.320
It can just be a convenient place to put

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.760
non-scoped styles if we don't have a huge amount.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.840
If we do have lots of different styles,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.115
this maybe a better idea to maybe outsource this into a different file.

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:23.210
The next thing we're going to do is back over in our text input and we're

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.230
going to hide the check boxes and also the radio buttons too,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.525
even adjust these icons.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:33.530
Remember from earlier, we said we leave these in for accessibility reasons

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.105
and so the user can also make use of the keyboard controls too.

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:41.960
The reason these are still accessible and we can still control these with

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.485
the keyboard is because we're not completely removing them.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.715
Instead, we're simply hiding them with CSS.

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:55.410
So the first step is to select our input with the type of radio,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.780
and then also our checkbox too.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.250
So this is no longer visible.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.225
We'll set the opacity to be equal to zero,

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:08.775
the width of zero too,

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.170
and also the height.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.380
Let's see if this works. Good. These are now removed and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.115
the next thing we're going to do is to select the image and make the cursor a pointer,

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:26.465
and to do this, we'll grab both of these, add these in below.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:28.630
Make use of the adjacent selector,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.580
which is the plus icon,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.540
and this will select all of the image elements which follow this radio.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.220
The same for the checkbox.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.730
The cursor to be a pointer.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.480
This will not change when we hover over our check boxes and our radio buttons.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.200
[inaudible] any original form inputs like this,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.730
we also need to handle the checked state and if we click on any of these,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.315
we don't see the buttons are highlighted.

00:05:58.315 --> 00:06:00.950
So if the user was navigating with a keyboard,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.565
they would have no idea which one is currently active.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:08.705
So to fix this, we also need to account for the checked state.

00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:11.845
So grab our two inputs and the image.

00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:14.595
Then we'll create a new section just below,

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:18.130
but this time, we'll target the check state.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.090
Now, what we're going to do inside of here is to set an outline when

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.040
any of these images has been clicked on so the user knows that this is being selected,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.415
of two pixels, a solid color,

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:36.670
and then a color for this outline.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.260
I'm going to go for the red value of 119,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.080
123, and also 125.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.010
This is getting very close, but it's not quite there just yet.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.530
This is going to place an outline on the button of

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.495
the image when a user clicks on any of them,

00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:56.500
but we also want this outline to appear when the user is using

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.760
the Tab button on the keyboard to cycle through these buttons.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.700
So again, we'll copy both of these,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.830
add a comma, paste these in again,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.840
but this time, the focus state.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.460
Save this file and over to the browser, let's check this out.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.875
Hover over the menu and instantly,

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:23.830
we see our outlines for the first group and also the second group too.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.250
We can select different values and these will also be highlighted too.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.700
Also if we use the Keyboard tab button to cycle through our website,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.150
once we get to the menu,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.800
we have the options, the bold,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.305
italic, our open-down buttons,

00:07:38.305 --> 00:07:40.270
and then if we hit "Tab" once more,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.605
we can use the left and right keyboard buttons for our first group.

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:48.685
Hit "Tab" once again, and the second group becomes active.

00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:50.220
Good. Just to finish this off,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.845
we'll also add some styles to our text area,

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:55.710
and also these select buttons too.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.695
First, the text area.

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.980
Move the default border with none.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.160
A little bored radius of three pixels.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.425
The width of 100 percent.

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:14.680
The font weight of lighter.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.310
Five pixels of padding.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.640
Also for the sizing,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.960
we'll set the box sizing to be equal to border-box.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.530
Then lastly, these select inputs are a little bit bunched

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.500
up and all I'm going to do is to do is to add some margin to the right.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.655
Five pixels should be fine, and there we go.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:44.705
This is the styling now finished for our menu,

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:48.420
and next, we're going to set up the card updates.
