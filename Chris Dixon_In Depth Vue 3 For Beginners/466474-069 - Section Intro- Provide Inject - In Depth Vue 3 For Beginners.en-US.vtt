00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.485
While working with Vue.js and passing around data,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.930
we need to pass down props down to each components.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.090
If we have a child component which is maybe two or more levels deep,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.925
we need to pass all props from our parent and then

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.435
down to each one of the core components on the way.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.095
This is really useful for keeping control of our data,

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.495
but it's not always ideal.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:29.820
This Vue.js has us covered with a technique called provide and inject,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.670
and we'll take a look at this during this section.
