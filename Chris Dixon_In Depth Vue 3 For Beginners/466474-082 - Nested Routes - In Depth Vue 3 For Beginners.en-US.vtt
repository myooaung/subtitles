00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.910
Inside of our App.vue file,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.455
we are handling all of our route changes with these links,

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:10.545
and then displaying the selected page with this router view.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:13.890
This is all good. Well, what if we did not want all

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.115
of our vues to be placed in this location?

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:20.715
For example, what if we had our Account.vue just here.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.025
This also had some related pages,

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:27.975
such as the previous orders and also a section to update the profile.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:33.405
We may want these two new sections to be only shown inside of this account vue.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.840
But if used case, we have what is called nested routes.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.490
To see this in action,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.575
we need to create some new pages inside of our Vue's folder. Create a new file.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:51.430
The first one is update profile and the second one is user orders.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.790
A basic title will be fine for now.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.280
We set-up the template with a level 1 heading which is for the previous orders.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.880
We can save this and copy this over to the user profile.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.195
We, of course, also needs some links to link to our new pages.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.730
So back to the App.vue component,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.210
set up our new two router links to update profile.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.640
Then, the second one is for our previous orders.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.530
As we just mentioned, both of these links are related to our account page,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.765
so may make sense to have these underneath the account path just like this.

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:44.510
We could have forward slash accounts and forward slash updates.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.200
We could also nest inside our profile too.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.610
Let's include these with the to prompt,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.665
parse in our object which includes the path.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.470
This will be dynamic, so we need the backtick.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.215
This will go to forward slash account,

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.605
then into the specific user.id,

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.300
and then to forward slash update.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.350
Grab this. At the same but this one is going to go to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.710
orders until we're done with this head over to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.395
the relative file where we're going to import our two new components.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:25.670
This next one was the update profile,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.960
and the final one was the user orders.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.170
Then, we can set up our router path just below.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.040
One option is to create two new routes.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.430
One which points to our forward slash update

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.705
and one which points to our forward slash orders.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.830
This is not ideal [inaudible] since we still want to display

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.590
this same account components but we want these two new pages to be nested inside.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.265
To deal with this, we can add a children array.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.860
This will declare which components should be

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
nested inside of this top-level account page.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.565
First, we don't need this post section so we can remove this.

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:15.600
Then, separated by a comma,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.610
we can add in our children array.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.450
Inside here, we're going to parse in a new object,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.770
which is a new route,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.350
but the difference is the new route which you parse inside

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.185
here will be what goes on the end of this [inaudible] route.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:33.220
For example, if we wanted a forward slash update,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.310
we would just simply parse in the path as update.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.315
Then, once the user visits forward slash account,

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.360
forward slash the userId, forward slash update.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.935
We then declare which components we want to render.

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:54.240
In our case, it's the page which we've just created called update profile.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.210
Next, our second object is going to be for forward slash orders.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.384
This will display the component which we've just imported,

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:06.840
which was user orders.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.400
Let's try this out, refresh the browser.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.310
Now, we see our links up at the top,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.035
click on update profile.

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:17.615
This will only take us to the account components.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:20.170
Still, with the forward slash update section,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.100
we could try the previous orders.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.690
Again, we have the correct URL and still it's showing me account components.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.770
As you can see, we still see this main account component.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.220
But what about the two nested components inside?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.535
Well, for this, we need to tell a Vue js exactly where we want

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:41.595
these two components to be displayed inside of our parents.

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:44.425
Over to the Account.vue.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:48.530
Well, for this, we can also pass in a router view component.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.740
Now, when we switch between our two child links,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.350
we also see the contents of these components too.
