00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.800
When we created the menu when we hover over this text area,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.185
we also added a few buttons to increase or decrease the height of the section.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:14.565
We can now use this and create the function to make this change.

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:19.500
This is going to make each one of these text areas even smaller or larger.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
This [inaudible] to our menu,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.355
which is inside of the text input,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.555
and then I'm going to do a search for the menu middle.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:29.460
This is the section we need,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.475
just here, we have our up and down buttons.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.130
The button that needs to [inaudible] for a click,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.355
which is going to trigger a function when you haven't yet created called change height.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:45.770
This function is going to take in the number of pixels we

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160
want to increase or decrease the height by.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.055
I'm going to place it in at 100 though

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:55.135
this button will increase the height of this section.

00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:59.180
Over this, the place is into our second button but this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.455
time we'll decrease the height by 100 down to the setup.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.735
Let's create this function.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:11.360
This is at the bottom. This was change height,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.255
which will accept the value and this will be either a positive or a negative 100 pixels.

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:20.930
The first thing we want to do is to store the current height of

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.700
the section or we can extract this from our current section.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.945
This is [inaudible] so we also need to access the value and then the height property.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.575
Just before we update this section of the high city section,

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.840
we're going to pass in a guard.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.660
We want to guard against the section being either too small or too large.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.570
After this, we'll check if the section is going to be either reduced to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.170
a height of zero or increased above 600 pixels,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.635
which is the height of this card.

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:56.390
To do this, place in the if statements,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.380
we're going to check if the current height we have just above is currently

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.775
equal to 100 pixels and the value is equal to negative 100.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:16.220
So this is checking if the current height of the text area is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.915
100 pixels and also if the user has clicked on the decrease button.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:24.170
This will result in a current height being zero.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.700
We obviously don't want this,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.230
so we need to check against this and also the opposite if we are at the maximum height.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.595
So if the current height is equal to 600 pixels,

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:44.800
and also if the value which is passed to this function is equal to 100,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.305
if it is, we're going to return alter dysfunction without running any code.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.420
This has thrown an error and I think we just need to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.300
wrap all the section inside the brackets.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.900
But if we get to this stage below,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.315
this means we can now update the height.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:06.420
To update this, we're going to update this current section,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.875
we need to access the value,

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.185
and then the height property,

00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:17.970
and we'll set this equal to our current height plus the value,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.620
which will [inaudible] 100 pixels higher or 100 pixels lower.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.740
This is actually all we need to do for this function because if

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.650
we update in it the current section just here,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.139
we already have a watcher placed on this,

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.465
which will then update our composable.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:39.025
This means we just need to return this back from all function,

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.220
then we can test this out.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
For the first one, increase the size,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.965
let's get it bigger, and we can decrease the size too.

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.455
If we keep clicking, we can't reduce this

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:54.425
any lower than 100 pixels and also if we increase this,

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:57.570
it gets to a maximum size too.
