00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.500
Although all of this new code may seem like a lot to take in,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.060
but as with most things,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.115
it just takes a little practice.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.980
This was also confusing to me at first too when

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.740
I started learning all of this new composition code.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.405
But by the end of this project,

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:19.200
we'll get lots more practice starting right now,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.670
where we're also going to move over the code from this category.vue.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.420
What I would like you to do is looking at this setup section,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.100
we're going to remove all of

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.830
the category-related code and move this over to our useCategory composable.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.450
The related code which we need is this constant.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.150
We'll also need the cards by category.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.910
You will also need to import the computed section and move all this code over,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.555
just like we did in the last video with AppHome.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:53.990
Then you need to clean up this component to remove any unused code,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.570
and also import our composition file,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.050
just like we did in the last video.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.475
So give this a go, and if you get stuck,

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.650
I will run through this in the next video.
