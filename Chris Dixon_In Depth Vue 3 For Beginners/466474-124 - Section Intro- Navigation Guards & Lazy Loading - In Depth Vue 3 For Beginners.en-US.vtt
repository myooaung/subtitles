Sometimes in our project,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.170
we don't want the user to visit every location we have or we sometimes also want

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.855
to provide some checks to see if the user is actually allowed on any given route.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.650
In this upcoming section, we'll take a look at navigation guards,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.200
which is provided with the Vue router.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.540
We'll also look at a never really useful technique called lazy loading,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.270
which will allow us to split up our application into

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.390
smaller pieces to improve the page load time.
