00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.350
When working on our three pages up to now,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.495
we have been commenting out each one of these and then adding a new one to work on.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.350
Large apps will often switch between pages using a router.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.110
I will do this for our work final project.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.260
For this simple case, we're going to setup a dynamic components to handle this,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.335
open up the Vue.

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:26.280
We're going to comment out our final component,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.710
which is the bestsellers,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.950
then replace this with the component elements.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.320
To declare which page or which components we're going to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.975
display in this component location,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.110
we can then bind the is property and set

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.305
this equal to a date property called selectedPage.

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.600
Just going to call it anything you want as long as it matches up with

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.915
a date property which we're going to create now.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:57.350
At this end, we can initially set this to our first page,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.665
which is the overview.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:05.510
The selected page is going to be updated when we click on any of the sidebar links.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.810
One thing to know when using the dynamic components is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.670
Vue does not know which component we're going to be using,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.570
so it will not throw an error if we have any imports,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.045
which we're not using.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.480
As we can see here, we still have the import, the bestsellers.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.975
We're not currently using this in the template.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.720
To make all of these components available,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.165
we're going to uncomment out the overview,

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.480
the orders, and also the sales total,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.800
and the same when we register our components too.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.980
Since we've set the selectedPage,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.285
the overview, we now see this inside the browser.

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:46.615
Now, update this page we can list now for a click on any one of these sidebar links,

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:50.555
up to the sidebar section and inside of our link,

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.910
list now for a click on any one of these three pages,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.500
we will set the selected page to be equal to

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.055
the page which is stored inside of this variable just here.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:05.785
We can have the same side of the back ticks as a template string.

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:08.295
Let's give this go in the browser.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.800
Refresh. As you can see,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.510
the overview is working fine,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.130
but we don't have any of the data passed down just yet.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.290
The orders, again, we just see the title because we

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.305
have not passed down any dynamic data just yet.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:26.105
The bestsellers, we don't see anything when we click on this page.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.585
Let's go into the developer tools and see what's going on.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:36.745
Into the console, it says the tag name provided of bestsellers is not a valid name.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:42.775
Remember, we are trying to load any one of our components based off this page name.

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:48.265
Try to pause and take a moment to think about what could be causing this error.

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:50.520
If you have not figured out yet,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.780
the answer is the space between these two words.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.745
We are trying to link to a page,

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.685
which is best, and a space, and then sellers.

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:01.730
But if we take a look at our page name,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.510
this has no space in between.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.380
The fix is, we need to remove any white space when calling these components.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.315
We can set this will be inside of our dynamic components.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:17.555
One way of doing this is by using a JavaScript string replace method.

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:21.200
This will take our existence string which is selectedPage.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.215
We can then modify it to remove any white space and then return a new one.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.860
Call the replace method.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.435
Then we can place in a JavaScript regular expression

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.210
in between these two forward slashes.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.820
When regular expressions, the way we can match

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.130
any white space is by using the backslash and the S,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.830
separated by a comma,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.135
we'll then replace this white space with a empty string containing no space at all.

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:51.345
Let's save this and try this out.

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:53.880
The overview, the orders,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.345
and when also the bestsellers page is appearing too.

00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.300
Great. We can now switch pages,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.095
but a lot of the content is missing.

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:07.550
This is because we have not passed any props or slot content to these three pages.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.740
Dynamic components can also accept both props and slot content if we wanted to.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.075
But remember, each components has different data.

00:04:16.075 --> 00:04:19.610
For props, we would need to pass all the props we

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.620
may ever need inside of this one single component.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.375
Also, if passing a slot content,

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:31.060
it is also difficult too since each component has different data.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.300
Although in the next section,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.870
we will solve these problems by using a technique called provide and inject.
