00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.130
But over to this create.vue components and inside here,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.755
we're displaying the selectedPage.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.145
Instead of showing this just like this as a object,

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:16.440
we're now going to move this and pass the page down as props to our two components,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.175
which was the card preview and also the card edit.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.440
First, remove this, pass this down first to the card preview,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.480
the proper name of selectedPage,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.265
which is equal to selectedPage.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:34.260
The same just below for the current edit.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.780
This prop will give the card preview all the information it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.870
needs to display the card and over on the right,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.300
the card edit section will use this prop as

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.125
the initial value for all of our input fields.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:51.770
If we wanted to, instead of setting this up here and passing this down as props,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.475
We could also import these directly into our two components too.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.610
But for this, I'm going to stick to props.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.325
Into the card preview.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:04.570
This needs a script section to accept these props,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.740
pass these into our object.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.145
The type, this objects,

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.350
and also, this is required too.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.025
Up to the template, we don't need this level 1 heading.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:29.245
Instead, replace this with a div and this div is going to be the wrapper for our card.

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:31.555
We need to add the background image,

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:35.650
just like we see if we go to the final version, into these cards.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.230
This will be the wrapper for our preview,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.470
and this will have the style attribute to set the background image.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.650
First, a class of card preview wrapper and then bind a dynamic style,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.145
which will take in an object,

00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:57.335
and it's inside of the style object where we're going to pass in

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:01.300
the background URL inside of the bactics.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.250
Just like we could with regular CSS,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.930
we can set the background URL.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.940
But because this will be dynamic,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.385
we also need to set this inside of the bactics,

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.325
place in our variable,

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:16.955
which is the selectedPage of our props.

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:20.035
Select the background property.

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:22.150
Next the background size,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.980
which will be a regular string of 100 percent.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.480
Next, the background repeat.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.164
Also, remember, since we're doing this inside of JavaScript,

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:36.705
we need to make each one of these camelCase.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.014
If this was regular CSS,

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:41.750
we would do it just like this with the hyphen.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.720
But since we're using JavaScript,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.355
we need to make each one of these camelCase.

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:49.900
The value for this will be no repeat.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.710
Then finally, the background position.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.055
This will be also dynamic since we have this set inside of our data.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.785
Go down to the data file.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.960
We grabbed the background as before,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.165
but now we're going to grab this background position.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:11.930
This is also extracted from all props.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.445
Now, inside of this div,

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:21.130
we need to loop through each one of our sections.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.640
In this selectedPage, we're going to go and see this inside of our data.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.720
This front page has this array of sections.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.415
Most of the information in each one of these sections is for styling and CSS.

00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:35.440
But the one which we're going to use to display

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.530
the actual text from a section is this user input.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.580
I'll place inside of here a div with a v-for,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.240
pass in in the section in selectedPage.sections.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.640
Each one of these sections has a unique ID.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.500
So the key will be section.id.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.975
To check this is working,

00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:04.650
I'll put the full section, refresh.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.899
We can just about see a background image and our text overlays.

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:12.760
But we do also need to give this background image a width and a height.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.180
Back to the components,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.685
we can access the card preview wrapper.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:19.430
Then set a style section at the bottom.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.070
This can also be scoped. First, the width

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.870
for this image is going to be fixed at 450 pixels,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.600
and then a height of 600.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.370
Good. We can now see the full size of the image.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.800
The final thing to do is to set the overflow property for this section and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.640
this will help us out later on if the user increases the height

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.255
of any of these sections to be higher than the card.

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:54.830
Great. Now, this is all working.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.890
We see also that the front of the card is the only one with

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.630
an image and that some of these sections don't have any text at all.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.670
All of these text sections,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.355
we don't want to show the full object like this.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.540
Instead we just want to output the user input,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.750
which you can do it like this, section.userInput.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.960
Okay, great. This text which we overlay will be soon placed into

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.750
a separate component and we'll also apply

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.705
to it all of this extra data such as the styling,

00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:29.160
and also the layout.
