00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.595
In the previous video,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:05.115
this App.vue file, amongst others,

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.200
had some nice color-coded syntax highlighting inside of our text editor.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.465
But your version may be pretty plain,

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:13.950
just like we see here.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.965
The syntax highlighting, amongst other features,

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:21.690
was created inside of Visual Studio Code by a new extension.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.090
If you are using Visual Studio Code,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.970
I would recommend you also install this too.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.930
To do this, go into the Extensions tab.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.860
Then we can search for an extension called Vetur.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.910
Select this, and you will need to install this and enable.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.575
I already have this installed,

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.750
so I'm going to click on the Enable button.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.760
Then we can go back into our App.vue.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.130
Vetur now gives us this nice syntax highlighting to make our code much more readable,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.110
along with some formatting and auto-completion too.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.805
If you are using Visual Studio Code,

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:04.144
I would recommend you install this extension,

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:07.500
but much better developer experience.
