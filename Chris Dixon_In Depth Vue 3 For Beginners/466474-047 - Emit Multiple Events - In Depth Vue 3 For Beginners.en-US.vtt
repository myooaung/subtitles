00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.135
We're not restricted to only emit it in one single event from our components.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:08.970
We can emit as many as we want to.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.445
Over in the add update form,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.410
down in the emit section,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.710
we will have access to multiple custom events,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.545
and we can use them at the same time too.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.560
For example, in the update view,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.185
when we add this new event just here,

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.110
rather than closing the form using this method,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.905
we could instead to make use of the closed-form custom event.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.785
Then to do this, all we need to do is to go up to our template,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:41.230
and then all we need to do is to add a comma and pass in our second custom event.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.440
If we were to use multiple events like this,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.900
it may also be cleaner to extract these out of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.100
the template and move them to separate methods.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.355
As for this, remember we have commented out this dot show form.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.490
So now if this closes the form after we submit,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.760
would now know this is emitting multiple custom events.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.510
Again, the event information does matter,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330
we can add in any data.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.740
Click on "Add". The event is now showing,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.850
and also our form has been closed,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.150
but this time, from our custom events.
