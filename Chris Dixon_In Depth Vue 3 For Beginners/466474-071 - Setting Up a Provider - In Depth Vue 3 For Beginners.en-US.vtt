00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.350
Let's now take a look at how we can setup a provider.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.970
In this App.vue file,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.435
we have this dynamic component which we recently setup,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:13.860
and this is going to be responsible for rendering one of our free pages,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.535
and each one of these pages requires different data.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:22.200
Rather than passing down all of the props to cover all of these situations,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.230
we can instead use provide and inject,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.535
place the correct data directly into our chart components.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:32.130
First, let's start with our overview page,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.410
which is our top one, just here.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.710
Inside here, this is rendering our free components,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.630
we have the items sold,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.640
the sales total, and the bestseller.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.050
Remember this is using slots and we're using

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930
this data which is passed down as props, so instead,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.320
what we're going to do is to move this data directly over to

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.440
the components and then we'll access the data we need using provide and inject.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.535
Let's begin with this item sold.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:04.325
We grab the slot content from in-between the template,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.030
as well as go for the icon,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.159
and then into the items sold components,

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.840
we can replace our slot,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.130
where this is output.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.890
In the overview, we have the second piece of slot content,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.265
which is for the default,

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.065
and then replace our second slot.

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:28.840
We can now clean up this items sold component,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.520
and we have our templates and then we can do the same for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.290
the sales total, without the icon,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.865
places into the icon slot,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.305
and then same for our total sales value,

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:48.674
paste this into our default slot and of the components,

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.815
and exactly the same for our third component too,

00:01:51.815 --> 00:02:00.910
the icon for the bestseller [inaudible] and also the content too.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.840
Then clean up our bestseller component.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.530
Now, this leaves us with our free chart components with dynamic data,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.675
which we now need to pass down.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.810
This we can add a provider into any one of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.520
the paren components and still isn't going to go over to the App.vue file,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.035
and then into the script section.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.620
The provide option is pretty straightforward.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.830
All we need to do is to provide an object.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.040
This is another place where we can provide any data which you want to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.800
be available in any of the chart components.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.775
We already know which data we need.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.660
We need the quantity of items sold,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.035
we need the total sales value,

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:46.920
and also the bestseller too. Let's set these up.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.240
First of all, the quantity of items sold.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.210
We can place in any value inside of here for now and very soon we

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.780
will obtain this value using our orders file.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.240
Next, we need total sales value.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.005
This is going to be any value again,

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:12.185
and the third one for the bestseller, which is a string,

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:18.060
you want to go for the Vue hoodie in medium,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.880
and this is our provided data.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.070
Next we'll look at how we can access this data in our chart components.
