00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.120
In the previous video, we gave each one of

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.245
these dynamic import a name by putting in a comment.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:10.080
Each one of these import is called a chunk,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.875
and along with using this comment to name our imported files,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.220
we can also use it to group together chunks to.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.699
An example may be if we had a navbar,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.130
we could group together all of the pages in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.640
navbar links too and download them all together.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.070
The way to do this is to give each component we want to group the same chunk name.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.710
Currently, even though we prefetching the chunks,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.285
the category on the create components still download it separately.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:41.140
If we wanted to group them,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.570
all you need to do is to give these the same group name.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.150
For example, a card-group.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.800
The same for the category.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.615
Then back over to your network tab and refresh.

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:56.300
We see just like before,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.595
we have the Apphome which is lazy loaded,

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:04.630
but above this, we no longer see our separate imports or create and also our category.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.860
Instead we have this card-group which contains the contents of our two chunks.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.440
The use is for grouping together chunks like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.280
this will vary depending on the structure of your project,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.740
but this can be really useful for grouping together

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.115
components which you needed at the same time.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.490
This technique really gives us a lot of flexibility to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.390
control which components are downloaded at any given time.
