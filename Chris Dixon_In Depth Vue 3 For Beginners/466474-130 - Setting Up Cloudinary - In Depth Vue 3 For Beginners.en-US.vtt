00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
We now need a safe place to upload and store our images.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.985
A popular service I use for many of my own site is Cloudinary,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.435
which you can find here at cloudinary.com.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.604
Cloudinary is a hosting service for videos and images,

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:20.580
and it also has lots of great features to such as the ability to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.125
transform our images and also serving the correct size images,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.305
and also formats for the user device.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.840
I've already got an account says about Cloudinary,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.565
but if you've never used this,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.305
go ahead and create a free account.

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.370
It's free to sign up, and also gives us

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.350
a huge free allowance of about 20,000 free image uploads.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.205
Once you're signed in, you'll be taken to the dashboard area,

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.485
which will look something like this.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.669
Well, before we upload any images to Cloudinary,

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:54.605
we first need to setup a preset.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.010
A preset is a set of defaults with images which we

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.490
upload to transform the size and the format.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.160
We can set this from our settings.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
The settings can be accessed from this button just here,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250
and then go into the upload section. Go down.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.130
In here, we're going to set up and upload preset.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.110
At the very top, we have this upload preset name,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.819
which is going to be important.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.120
I'm going to copy this with Command or Control C,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.810
and then go to our image, upload components.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.880
Let's just create a script section for now,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.000
and then place this in at the very top as a comment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.150
The first option we have is the Signing Mode.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.055
Have the option of Signed and also Unsigned uploads.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.720
The Signed option involves using a web server,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.585
design the images with our Cloudinary secret,

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:53.500
which we seen just before in the dashboard.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.620
Or we have the Unsigned version,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.600
which we're going to use, which means,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.910
we can directly upload from the browser without needing the secret.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.860
If we wanted to, we can also create

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.685
a dedicated folder where we are going to place in these images.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:09.300
Let's go for the cards.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880
The rest of it,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.110
we're going to leave us default,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.005
and then head over to the media analysis section.

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:19.030
This section is if we want to upload our images with any tags.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.520
If we want to add any kind of AI such as face detection,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000
if we want to extract any text from the images,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.825
and lots more advanced features,

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:28.795
which we don't currently need.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:31.865
Below this, we have the image manipulations.

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:36.860
This will give us the chance to set up any default image sizes and also formats,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.250
and even add some rotation or corner radius to as we upload this image.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.340
Let's leave all these as default,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.680
and then save these presets.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.630
Make sure you've taken note of this preset name and added this to your project.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.660
Next, we will take our first steps towards uploading

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.830
this image by reading the contents of the file uploader.
