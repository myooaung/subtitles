00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.615
This section is going to be focused on something called

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:07.770
slots and also dynamic components.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.330
To work with both of these,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.820
we first need some content to work with.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.880
Remember, earlier, we said that components can be placed

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.030
anywhere inside of our source folder.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.775
We don't just have to restrict them to a components folder.

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.770
With this in mind, I'm going to create a new folder,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.930
again inside of this source directory,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.700
and this is going to be called views.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.460
This also contains components or.vue files,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.510
but it is common to have a views or a pages folder to better

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.415
organize our components which we are going to be using for our main pages.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:47.045
So just like we're seeing when we had a look at the final version,

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:51.229
the pages which we have inside of our application was the overview.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.330
We had the sales page and also the bestsellers too.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.490
This views folder generally contains these types of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.205
files which we're going to use to switch between four different URLs.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:06.790
Considering this file structure we have in the source folder

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.080
and then inside a components on a views folder.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.870
Both contain the.vue single file components.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.720
This approach means we can organize them so

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.375
the pages which we're going to be switching between are all grouped together.

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:25.500
Here the three pages we have for home, contact,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.425
and account are also links inside of our header.

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:32.765
Meaning if we click on the account, for example,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.515
the account.vue file will then be displayed.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:41.404
These page components do not have to contain all of the pages contents.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:46.260
They too can also be broken down and contain multiple components.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.965
This example next to user components onto the page

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:54.950
and this component can also be reused on as many pages as required.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.270
Over to our application where we can start to set up

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.555
our pages and our reusable components.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.630
So first of all, in the components folder,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.930
create a new file and this is going to be for our BestSeller.vue.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.240
Also alongside this, we'll also have the ItemsSold.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.930
So remember, these are just the single components

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.960
which we're going to place into our pages.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.710
After this, the third one is going to be for the SalesTotal,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.350
and finally, the last component which we need is for our Sidebar.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.015
Okay, close this.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.680
Now, inside of our vues,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.500
we're going to create our free pages,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.165
which we've seen before.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.390
So the first one will be for the BestSellers,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.279
and these pages or these vues will also have the.vue extension,

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:03.730
the Orders, and then also our Overview page.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.510
So the.vue files inside of our vues folder and also the ones in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.680
our components folder have no difference at all other

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.420
than the fact that they're organized into different folders.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.275
So let's begin by adding some content into our vues.

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:25.010
Starting with the BestSellers, and all we're going to do inside here is to add

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.895
our template and all this is going to contain for now is a level 3 heading,

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:34.935
a class file styling of page-title,

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:37.990
and this one is going to be Best Sellers.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.430
Select all of this and copy into our Orders,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.305
place this in, paste the title,

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:52.390
and then the same for the Overview.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.280
Then our components. Just to be clear,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.640
the BestSeller component is going to be for the number 1 best-selling products and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.610
the BestSellers page is going to be a list of all

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.260
of the best-seller items from the highest to the lowest.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.965
So the template, again a HTML article tag,

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:20.180
and this will have a class of stats.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.460
We're going to make use of this in the Overview page,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.480
so we'll have this as a component in the left and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.500
then we have the ItemsSold and then the SalesTotal too.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.710
Now, let's give this a level 4 heading of top selling item.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.975
Select all and copy.

00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.530
Down to ItemsSold, we can paste this in.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.945
All you need to do is to change this level 4 heading, the ItemsSold.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:51.470
Next, the SalesTotal, which will be very similar

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.490
too which will have the title of total sales,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.535
and for now, we're going to leave this signed by empty.

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:03.140
Okay, good. Now, we have some content in place.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.280
We have our views,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.860
all the pages, and also some components.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.345
In the next video,

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:14.280
we'll take a look at how we can pass data down to these components using slots.
