00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.790
I would like to quickly suggest several companion courses that can

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.840
enhance your skills and capabilities with Kanban.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.540
This course, Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners, is a

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.840
perfect companion for this course.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.220
It gives you a ton of Kanban foundational information in

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.940
the learning context of Agile/Scrum.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.360
This course, Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans, will give

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.240
you insight into Agile and Sprint planning that you need to help

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.900
better relate and communicate with your Agile dev teams in their

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.340
transition to Kanban.

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.930
This course, Project Management for Software Engineers, will give

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.590
you insight into traditional project management that you need to

13
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.220
help better relate and communicate with your traditional dev teams

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.510
in their transition to Kanban.

15
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.300
Leadership and Communication Skills.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.270
Everything we talked about in this entire course has

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.570
underpinnings and requirements for strong and dynamic

18
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.340
leadership and communication skills,

19
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.600
especially when you are trying to influence management and your

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.040
dev team during your transition to Kanban.

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.090
So check out this course, Leadership and

22
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.000
