1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,610
Here is my point of view, thoughts, and opinions.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,160
There is no perfect way to do anything.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,590
Yes, you should study and learn the academic way to do scrum,

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,050
agile, and Kanban, that is very important, but then the real world hits you.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,170
You've heard of the fog of war to describe the

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,540
uncertainty commanders face in battle.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,030
It is no different for you.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,590
There is the fog of your work environment to describe the

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,860
uncertainty IT leaders, like you, face in a project.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,160
There's turnover, budget, issues, skills needed, delays,

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,070
downtime, bugs, changing requirements, you name it.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,340
I think I will always be a fan of agile/scrum.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,180
It is a powerful tool and I would never hesitate to deploy it.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,840
Kanban is highly flexible and highly adaptable over scrum,

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,280
and I really like it too.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,920
It's a very powerful tool.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,870
I am a planner by nature, so whether agile, scrum or

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,960
Kanban, I think you must do a sufficient amount of planning

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,070
before you embark on any project.

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,930
So I do like the structure of scrum planning at the project and release level.

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,470
I do like the fact scrum has distinct and regular events.

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,550
It sets a good precedence and cadence for your team, and it might even be

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,600
easier to schedule your product owner for those events as well.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
And it might be easier to keep your team organized.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,860
But, again, Kanban is simpler, more flexible,

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,010
more adaptable, and more streamlined. Which is best? Kanban or

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,400
agile/scrum? I knew you were going to ask me that question.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,900
Well, here's the answer.

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,020
Based on the type of organization, culture, business,

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,590
the problem you are solving, and experiences, one

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,120
might work better than the other.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,240
So the answer is, well, it depends.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,290
Here are the key points of this module.

34
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,600
Kanban is superior at managing workflow. If your team's practices are

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,050
a series of steps in a workflow or as conditions of completing steps

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,000
in a workflow, then Kanban is for you.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,990
Kanban is a highly flexible and adaptable framework to allow you

38
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,940
to create context‑specific process solutions.

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,700
So when it comes to creating backlogs,

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,040
they are similar, but Kanban promotes a bit more open and flexible

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,640
approach to who can represent the customer base.

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,060
Backlog organization is similar, so the process by which backlogs

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,340
get populated are similar and the process or practices on how to

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,540
organize a backlog are similar as well.

45
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,110
Backlog planning is very different.

46
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,040
With agile/scrum, you have project planning,

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,890
release planning, and sprint planning, and with Kanban your planning is

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,040
just done every day during your standups based on the needs of the

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,540
business and how to best add value to the business.

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,190
With sprints,

51
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,750
you have fixed time periods and it's a more rigid process structure.

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,790
With Kanban, it is simply a continuous flow of work.

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,060
The notion of bottlenecks is basically the same,

54
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,910
but Kanban provides better visibility in determining the cause and the

55
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,320
remediation. With Kanban, blockers are easier to handle and work

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,590
through, since with scrum the sprints are a bit rigid and it may take

57
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,090
more effort and disruption to handle. The term buffer has a completely

58
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,730
different meaning in each. With Kanban, it is a staging area for work,

59
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,210
you know, the done column, and was scrum it's slack. With unplanned

60
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,620
work,

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,340
Kanban is more agile and flexible, and for both, you must consider the

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,460
following: the number of work items affected, what part of the

63
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,460
workflow or sprint is affected, early or late,

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,110
and the overall holistic implication of the change. For both, you

65
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,310
absolutely need good communication and negotiation skills to build

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,140
trust. Regarding metrics, agile/scrum typically uses the concept of

67
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,910
velocity, and for Kanban we use cumulative flow diagrams as a metric

68
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,920
for measuring work.

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Scrum is feature‑based monitoring,

70
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,550
whereas Kanban is process and task‑based monitoring. Up next is

71
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,000
Implement Continuous Integration to Increase Customer Value. I'll see you there.
