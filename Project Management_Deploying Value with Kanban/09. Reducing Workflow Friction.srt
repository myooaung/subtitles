1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,550
Continuous integration greatly reduces workflow friction,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,740
especially in the Implement and Validate steps relative to our example.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,640
Let's explore.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,240
Here is how version control systems and continuous

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,280
integration affect the implement step,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,080
both the work in progress column and the done column.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,100
So first, the implement step work in progress column.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,190
So our best practices will be to run automated tests,

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,340
do daily commits, and do frequent merging down.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,630
Next, for the done column, done rules are complete,

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,750
merge downs are complete, automated tests are complete,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,910
all code is committed.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,080
So now we're done,

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,750
and we feel much more confident that our code is of

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,840
a much higher quality standard.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,560
Here is how version control systems and continuous

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,370
integration effects the validate step,

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,510
both the work in progress column and the done column.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,440
Our best practices will be to perform feature testing,

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,570
rerun all the automated tests if you've made any changes to daily commits,

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,370
of course, and frequent merging down, if required,

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,340
during the time the work item was in your responsibility.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,490
Next, for the done column, the release is ready,

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,950
that is, if all the work items tied to this release are complete,

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,280
the build is made, running all the automated tests in the process,

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,330
and the build package is ready for delivery.

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,730
And again, now we're done,

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,040
and we should be feeling pretty good about all of our work.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,180
Now, for an important point.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,890
No two best practices of kanban boards are the same.

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,240
No two best practices of version control systems are the same.

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,310
And that's how it should be.

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:41,000
Use your creativity to evolve and shape your board for continuous improvement to enhance the quality outcomes of your workflow.
