1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,200
Now let's look at how Kanban typically tracks work in progress.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,420
In Kanban, there is always a value stream of steps in a workflow,

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,050
so it's important to know how well we are doing in each step along the way.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,600
Hence,

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,820
we want to measure the quantity of work in each step and a

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,840
cumulative flow diagram will help us do just that.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,530
So Kanban measures work in progress for each step.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,640
So what's a cumulative workflow?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,540
Let's find out.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,370
With Kanban,

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,230
we measure work in progress by typically using a cumulative flow diagram.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,080
A cumulative flow diagram is a graph that shows the

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,130
quantity of work in a workflow step over time.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,560
By observing the graph,

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,500
you can see the number of backlog items, work in progress

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,800
items, and delivered work items over time.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,330
Sure, but how does that help us?

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,240
Let's find out.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,670
So let's see why you seeing cumulative flow diagrams are very important,

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,890
or sometimes what I call CFDs. CFDs help you keep

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,760
track of your work in progress.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,550
You always want to know where you're at and what you're

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,750
doing, it helps you identify bottlenecks.

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,500
That's really important to know where things get stuck. Remember, Kanban

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,230
is all about workflow, consistently good workflow,

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,900
and therefore, ultimately, it'll help you increase your team's

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,310
productivity and it's a continuous improvement tool.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,650
And the CFD is typically an area graph that depicts the

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,810
quantity of work in each value stream step, but can also

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,340
be a stack bar chart as well.

31
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,350
Here is an example of a cumulative flow diagram.

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,210
Each colored area represents a workflow step from our sample

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,280
Kanban board. As you can see, the steps in the legend on the

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,740
right backlog, specify, implement,

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,810
validate, and deliver. The horizontal axis on the bottom shows the time

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,440
period and the time periods I have chosen are daily,

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,940
and the vertical axis shows the number of tasks in each step for that day.

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,640
Here is the backlog, specify, implement in the reddish color,

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,770
and validate in the light green, and lastly,

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,120
deliver. The size of the areas indicate how many work

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,240
items are currently in each state for the selected time

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,030
period, and in our case, per day.

43
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,100
By using the CFD, you can measure the amount of work your team has delivered.

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,880
If the area, the purple area of our CFD represents the deliver step,

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,050
then the slope of that line between any two points is your

46
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,670
average throughput between those two points.

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,600
As you can see between April 20th and 22nd,

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,210
the number of tasks per day completed was growing,

49
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,740
and if the top of the purple line was flat or falling,

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,940
then our productivity was also falling.

51
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,440
Then you can inspect and talk about the reasons, maybe you lost a

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,170
resource, someone was on vacation, you added a new tool, or you just

53
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,790
can't quite figure out the reason and it might take a little more

54
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,540
thought, but as you can see,

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,830
this chart can provide a wealth of valuable

56
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,370
information to ensure a smooth workflow.

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,280
I would look at the CFD every single day in every single standup

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,840
to look for any variations or any issues that might be occurring,

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,150
it gives you so much more visibility into the process of what

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,040
you're doing than Scrum does.

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's recap using metrics to measure work in

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,980
progress for Agile Scrum and Kanban.

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,260
Certainly, there are other tools and metrics for each,

64
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,260
but I wanted to show you the two that seem to be the most common.

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,020
Scrum is featureâ€‘based monitoring in that we are tracking story

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,540
points primarily. With Kanban, we are looking at the process and

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,110
looking at the slopes, the buffers, and other indicators to help us

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,280
improve our workflow.

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,890
And we are also looking at the number of tasks moving through the process.

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:39,000
I think this gives Kanban an edge up in that you have more insight into what's going on and can more quickly take action to correct.
