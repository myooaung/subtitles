1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:08,110
Kanban versus Scrum: a deeper look. Here is my approach to a deeper look.

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,530
What I really like about this module is that most of us have had some

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,390
amount of familiarity and experience with Agile Scrum.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,210
That's great.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,450
As I talk through the key points of this module,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,450
I'll be comparing Agile Scrum activities and best practices

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,980
with Kanban's activities and best practices.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,450
I believe this approach will help accelerate your learning. But into this

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,630
module, I'll have provided you a good frame of reference between Agile

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,640
Scrum and Kanban terminology and practices.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,800
Here are the topics of this module that we'll be comparing and contrasting.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,430
We will look at creating backlogs within the context of

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,630
both Kanban and Agile Scrum, next,

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,740
how backlog planning and work selection differ, then

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,540
onto comparing work in progress,

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,150
comparing workflow constraints, and that would be bottlenecks, blockers,

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,330
and buffers, so we'll dive into those three areas. Then handling

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,170
unplanned work and using metrics to manage work.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,360
So for all these topics,

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,000
we will compare and contrast how each approach handles them differently. Okay, let's get started.
