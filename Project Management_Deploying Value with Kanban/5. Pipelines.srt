1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,540
In this next section, we will cover pipelines.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,700
A pipeline is a set of processes that enable a smooth flow of work

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,310
from development through production operations.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,420
Now, for a slightly different definition,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,870
a deployment pipeline is a set of automated processes that enable a smooth flow

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,040
of work from Kanban delivery through production operations.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,380
So in the days past,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,810
you were likely to have a situation where the Kanban

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,550
development team handed off, that is,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,100
delivered their releases to a Kanban deploy team.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,870
So the deployment team pulled the releases forward and began

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,030
installing it in a preproduction environment,

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,320
testing, configuring, and ultimately monitoring the release in production.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Even if the dev team used continuous integration with their version control,

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
automated testing, and the likes, the chances are is that the delivered product,

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,080
the release, that is, was simply a package of artifacts,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,640
as I described earlier, and it was later manually

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,740
deployed by the production operations team.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,330
That's typically how things worked for many, many years.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:05,640
So with DevOps and pipelines, that process becomes automated and connected.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,760
So, we went from the handoff to a connected pipeline.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,880
So using modern tools available today,

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,590
you can now define deployment pipelines and automate

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,620
the entire process after delivery.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,430
So in a sense,

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,570
there's not the same need for using Kanban in the old manor where

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,580
there was a clear separation between dev and operations. Now

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,790
Kanban can and should be used to handle all issues and tickets

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,600
that occur in the pipeline, including endâ€‘user tickets,

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,540
one common Kanban from beginning to end.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,950
So instead of a human pulling forward work from a done area of a step,

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,840
the pipeline automatically pulls work forward, reducing labor needs.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,580
Here are a few common tools. I won't endorse any particular tool,

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,400
but here is a starter list to get you going.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,340
All tools are different and may spread over a wide variety of feature sets.

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,670
So first, figure out your general needs and document them, and then

37
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,240
check out the tool's features against your requirements.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,530
My rule for tools has always been find the fewest number of

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,710
tools that'll do the most work. Remember,

40
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,160
it's a lot of work to learn and integrate several tools together.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,040
Now some tools may be better at Kanban, some better at

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,290
continuous integration, and some of them better with

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,140
pipelines and continuous deployment.

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,100
If you can find the right tool, or I should say maybe the right

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,000
platform of integrated tools, to get the job done, all the better.
