Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.040
I will be presenting the module, Implement Continuous

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.980
Deployment to Increase Customer Value in the course,

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.840
Deploying Value with Kanban.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.410
The outcome of this module is to provide you the knowledge

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.120
and skills to help you implement continuous deployment

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.310
methods with your Kanban value stream.

9
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.350
So deployment is simply the next step in the flow continuing from

10
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.640
continuous integration and now on through to deployment.

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.260
Here are the topics of this module, continuous deployment, or sometimes

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.160
I'll say CD, continuous delivery versus continuous deployment, DevOps â€‘

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.000
bridging the gap, pipelines, continuous everything, and why Kanban is a great fit for CI/CD and the module summary.
