00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,880
If you haven't figured it out already, Kanban is a great fit for

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,130
CI/CD and let's see why. With Kanban, each completed task is

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,200
production ready and thus ready for deployment, that's the whole

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,700
philosophy behind Kanban.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,160
If your Kanban team is deploying yourself, then you can simply move your

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,240
card to the right to a deployed area of the deliver step.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,230
If you are handing it off to operations,

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,190
you could move your card to the done area in the

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,440
delivery step so the workflow is just fine.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,580
Here are the key takeaways of this module.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,720
Continuous deployment means moving builds or releases to production

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,640
automatically conditional on the successful completion of the previous steps

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,530
in the value stream. Delivery versus deployment. With delivery, our value

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,020
stream is complete and we have delivered our product and continuous

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,480
deployment is where the release or build is installed into production and is

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,640
being used immediately by the users.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,070
Remember,

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,820
the industry and literature will have slightly varying

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,020
definitions. I like these since it helps my team understand

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,370
the distinction and expectations of each.

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,900
There are many benefits to employing continuous deployment,

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,810
such as an eliminate manual installation of software and enabling the

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,170
automated monitoring and feedback collection of your applications.

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,040
This is important.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
DevOps is the bridge between development and operations.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,420
We learn that DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development,

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,090
the developers, and IT operations, ops or production.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,860
Its goal is to shorten the system's development lifecycle and provide

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,540
continuous deployment with high software quality.

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,960
A deployment pipeline is a set of automated processes that

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,140
enable a smooth flow of work from Kanban delivery through

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,690
to production operations.

33
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,930
Implementing CD, continuous deployment, will be a reasonable challenge and I

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,590
recommend a strong and disciplined team. Also, expect some additional cost,

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,440
training, and new tools and skills to get the job done.

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,630
Continuous everything. Without a solid continuous integration process,

37
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,870
you really can't have continuous deployment.

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,400
Maybe start with building out your CI process and keep your existing

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,130
deployment manual process in place for a while.

40
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,230
Then, when the CI process matures and you are ready,

41
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,180
extend the continuous flow of value to the customer by

42
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,060
enhancing your deployment pipeline.

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,990
This may take some time, so be patient. Up next,

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,790
adapting Kanban within larger organizations.

45
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,000
Lots of great topics in that module. I'll see you there.
