00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.990
So in the coming sections, we will compare measuring work in

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.440
progress between Kanban and Agile Scrum.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.710
Here are the typical techniques that are used to measure work.

4
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.230
First,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.180
Agile Scrum typically uses the concept of velocity. And for Kanban, we will use

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.000
cumulative flow diagrams as the metric for measuring work. Okay, now we'll dig into each one.
