00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello, and welcome to Deploying Value with Kanban.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,630
I'm Michael Krasowski, and I'll be presenting the module Kanban vs.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,040
Scrum: A Deeper Look.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,590
Here's a quick preface.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,420
Now, since this is an intermediate course,

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,110
I will assume that you have some Kanban knowledge and build upon it,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,700
but it's not mandatory.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,190
If you do want to refresh your Kanban knowledge,

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,490
check out my class,

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,370
Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners, and here's a

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,540
little more information on that class.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,010
You might like to consider this companion course,

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,850
Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,010
If you find you want to have a better foundation or understanding

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,480
of Kanban before you embark on this course,

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,680
please check this out.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,040
And if you are relatively new to Kanban,

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,260
this course will give you everything you need to accelerate your

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,230
learning in this course. Here is the course outcome.

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,720
You will learn the knowledge and skills to help you implement

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,510
continuous integration and deployment within the context of the

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,440
Kanban value stream and DevOps.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,560
I will start by telling you what Kanban is not.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,850
It is not a software development lifecycle methodology.

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,700
It is not a project management methodology. Yet, Kanban improves

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,680
developing software and managing projects.

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,440
Intrigued? So, what is it?

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,400
Okay, so just what is Kanban? Kanban is a method to manage workflow.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,090
This is the most basic, simple definition.

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,210
I think about every single system that I ever designed,

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,250
developed, architected, or managed was built following a workflow,

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,940
either formal, informal, or even chaotic.

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,980
So, if your team's practices, such as UI design, coding, quality

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,690
assurance, to name a few, can be thought of as steps in a workflow or as

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,520
conditions of completing steps in your workflow,

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,900
then you'd be well served by using Kanban. Kanban is a Lean practice,

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,440
as is Agile, Scrum, and others.

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,470
Kanban is a highly flexible and adaptable framework to allow you

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,150
to create contactâ€‘specific process solutions, rather than

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,320
strictly following a more rigid software development lifecycle

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,940
process, such as waterfall, and, to some degree,

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,650
even Scrum.

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,740
So Kanban is not a process in and of itself.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,750
Kanban is a method that can be used to create a process which will

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,140
always be unique to the problem and the resources available. And Kanban

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,670
is a practice that symbolizes a principle and is flexible and adaptable

47
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,840
based on the challenge at hand, and the necessary resources.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,740
Here's the course overview. In this module, we'll take a

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,440
deeper look at Kanban versus Scrum.

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,630
So many of you already have a pretty good understanding of Scrum, and

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,980
I think by comparing the two, you will more quickly understand and

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,140
appreciate the differences between the two.

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,590
Next,

54
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,340
we'll explore implementing continuous integration to

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,570
increase customer value, and then, of course,

56
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,640
on implementing continuous deployment to also increase customer value.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
Then, in the next module,

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,770
we'll talk about adapting Kanban within larger organizations.

59
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,940
And what I mean by large is not so much about the size

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,930
of the company or your organization,

61
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,760
but instead, the total number of development teams working

62
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,320
together on the same project with the same goals.

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,650
Now, this is a very interesting module, indeed. And lastly,

64
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:30,000
a nice summary of the key objectives of this course, along with my final words and other resources that might be helpful to you.
