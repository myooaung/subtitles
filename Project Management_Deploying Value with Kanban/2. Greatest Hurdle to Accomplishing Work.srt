00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,180
Here's a tip.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,500
It is in my experience that the greatest hurdles to

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,990
accomplishing our work is not technical,

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,640
but people. We are only human.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,390
We have discussed lots of topics, techniques,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,950
approaches,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,760
tools, and more, but the most important element of all that is

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,000
people. Don't forget that! Care and nurture the people you work with, and success will naturally come.
