1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,440
We will first discuss velocity and how it's used in the Scrum world.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,550
Velocity means the speed of something in a direction,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,250
and in our case, it means the amount of work a team can produce in a

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,940
single sprint. In sprints, it is typically measured in user story points.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,490
User story points are a relative estimate of the amount of work to be

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,040
performed to finish a task or a feature.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,680
Velocity, therefore, equals the total points for a fully completed

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,460
user stories in a sprint. Velocity is used for both sprint planning

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,520
and managing your work in progress.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,750
Velocity‑driven sprint planning is based on the premise that the

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,080
amount of work a team will do in the next sprint is roughly equal

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,200
to what they've done in prior sprints.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,320
So if your velocity is 20 points over a period of 30 sprints,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,550
you have a pretty darn good understanding of what your team can do,

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,360
that's 20 points per sprint. Because we now know what to expect during

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,800
the sprint, we can measure our work in progress.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,600
This will help us track how we are doing for each workday of our sprint.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,850
Let's see how we'll do that. For tracking work in

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,120
progress, you can use the burnup chart.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,210
I am sure you've heard of the term burned down,

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,000
but I like to term burnup instead.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,940
Both forms of the burn chart would be fine to use.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,440
It is just that the burnup sounds more positive to me.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,460
Now why is a burnup chart important?

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,310
It shows a quick and easy way to determine the health of a sprint, that is,

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,380
how well are we doing. A burnup chart provides a quick view

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,390
of the project's progress, or the release's progress, and

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,890
also the sprint's progress.

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,440
Burnup charts show the aggregation of only completed story

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,470
points over time, that is important,

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,420
completed stories only. And the flip side of that is burndown

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,160
shows the remaining story points for a sprint,

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,640
a release, or a project.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,490
Metrics of burnup are tied to the unit of measure for the sprint, and of course,

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,960
they are typically story points. At the end of a sprint, their burnup value is

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,240
the velocity of that sprint only. Now let's see an example.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,540
Okay,

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,820
let's go through a burnup chart. On the left, we have a 2‑week sprint over

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,260
10 work days in the green box. You can see the sprint backlog, 3 user

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,450
stories, 7, 2, and 1, and the estimated story points,

41
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,440
plus the completed or done story points in the third column.

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,620
And below that is our burnup chart showing the completed

43
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,890
story point by week with our goal being 44 points as decided

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,640
in our sprint planning meeting.

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,630
Our velocity is 32 story points for the sprint shown on the left.

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,270
So we can see that our sprint goal was 44 points,

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,520
but our sprint result was only 32 points,

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,130
12 points shy.

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,200
Is that good or bad?

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
And here are some reasons why we may be short of our goal.

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,190
The team may be too aggressive of what they think they can accomplish.

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,750
The business domain may be complicated so it took more

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,210
time to figure things out, the team, may be new to Agile Scrum,

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,110
or just be new to each other, that is the team may be Scrum experienced,

55
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,380
but just still getting to know each other. What to do next? Well,

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,470
you might set your target to 32 points for the next sprint or I would set

57
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,190
your target to the revised average velocity of the release you are in or

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,440
the average over the last couple of releases.

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,590
Do your retrospective, see what improvements can be made as well.

60
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,530
And don't forget, your sprint cadence will vary and it is not perfect,

61
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,600
and that is totally fine and normal.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,590
So our burnup chart helps us understand where we are

63
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,370
relative to are work in progress.

64
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:28,000
We can see for each week how many story points have been consumed and completed, and we can track our progress throughout each sprint.
