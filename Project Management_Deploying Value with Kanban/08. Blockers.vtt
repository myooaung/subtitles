00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.940
Now let's move on to blockers.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.490
A blocker is a blocked or impassable work item that

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.710
is restricting the flow of work.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.720
It is the work item itself that is the blocker.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.370
The reasons that things cause work to stop or slow down are

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.240
really the same for both Kanban and agile/scrum.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.920
One example is company policy change. Since the time you may have

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.230
specified the work and when you actually did the work,

9
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.920
the company policy changed.

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.080
Now you need to discuss the issue back with the product owner,

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.060
the customer or maybe even senior management, so the work

12
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.840
is blocked until you get that clarified.

13
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.770
Also, there may be changes to laws and regulations.

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.850
Things change fast in the health care industry,

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.640
for example,

16
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.740
and you are at an impasse on how to handle a work item, so that is blocked.

17
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.100
Another very common one, of course, is the clarification of requirements.

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.700
You are unclear as to what is really meant in the spec and you

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.820
need it to be clarified and the subject matter expert is not

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
available, so the work is blocked.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.170
The customer or subject matter expert may be unavailable.

22
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.740
This one might be somewhat common, unfortunately,

23
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.190
and you need her guidance before proceeding, or the customer just

24
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.750
doesn't know the answer, and you must do more research to answer your

25
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.330
questions or issues, so the work is blocked.

26
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.220
Now, how about someone on vacation?

27
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.530
Well,

28
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.550
no, that situation is not a blocker. That is just further

29
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.750
limiting your work in progress from, say,

30
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.770
four resources to three. No work item itself is blocked; you

31
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.300
just have fewer resources to perform the work.

32
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.830
Remember, a blocker is the work item that is restricting the flow of work.

33
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.110
And, of course, this is to just name a few.

34
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.280
I am sure you have many more examples of things that can

35
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.390
block work. Identify and document blockers.

36
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.480
You want to easily recognize which work items are blockers, so you can

37
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.900
focus your attention on them and eliminate them.

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.430
Therefore, you should always visually identify your blockers.

39
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.030
So, mark the blocked work item with a special color or other visual cue.

40
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.240
This way, you can easily see the blocked items and discuss them at each standup.

41
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.940
Ensure you track the reason,

42
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.200
status progress, and other pertinent information for each blocked work item.

43
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.930
For example,

44
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.790
reason, the algorithm to determine if multiâ€‘tendered

45
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.790
transactions should be allowed is not clear,

46
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.040
and the subject matter expert, Mary, must be consulted and she is unavailable.

47
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.250
Let's face it, we want to remove blockers as quickly as humanly possible.

48
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.130
Here are some approaches to removing blockers for both Kanban and agile/scrum.

49
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.120
Blockers are discussed at daily standups, discussing the status of the blocker

50
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.620
and any ongoing actions underway to mitigate or solve the blocker. You must

51
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.440
have a strong issue escalation process.

52
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.890
This means you need to know who in management, or which stakeholder,

53
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.940
may need to be consulted for each type of issue.

54
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.130
Escalation policies are clearly defined and documented ahead of time,

55
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.010
and all team members clearly understand them, since not everyone

56
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.650
may be available to initiate the escalation.

57
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
Escalation policies are jointly agreed to by up or downstream

58
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.590
partners and/or other management and stakeholders.

59
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.750
This should go without saying,

60
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.140
but track all your blockers and issues visually, and with clear reasons.

61
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.300
Now let's see how blockers are handled between Kanban and scrum.

62
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.690
Okay,

63
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.700
Kanban first. Work item is tagged as blocked. During standup, all blockers

64
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.940
are discussed to determine the next course of action.

65
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.440
Work is stopped on the blocked work item, of course.

66
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.220
The work item is set aside in the work stream step.

67
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.770
It is tagged and visually identified, and will be discussed at each standup.

68
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.010
And, now that the item is blocked,

69
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.460
the resource is free, so the resource will pull the next work

70
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.180
item forward from the upstream done buffer.

71
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.560
Now,

72
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.440
you might even put the work item in the backlog that's blocked, so

73
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.170
if it has remained blocked for a very long time,

74
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.920
you still leave it tagged as blocked, but move it from the

75
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.910
value stream step to an area of the backlog, maybe a blocked

76
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.400
backlog or aged blocked items.

77
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.370
This might keep your board a little cleaner.

78
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.310
Hopefully you don't have blocked items blocked for that long, but again,

79
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.220
it would be nice to move them off the value stream steps and

80
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.940
put them in the backlog in special areas.

81
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.500
Okay, blocker resolved? Well, when the resource for the value

82
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.380
stream step that had the blocked item is now free, then that

83
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.590
would remove the blocked item tag and the resource would begin

84
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.590
working the item once again.

85
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.500
Now let's discuss agile/scrum.

86
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.560
The user story is tagged as blocked,

87
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.040
the blocker is discussed during every standup,

88
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.540
and work is stopped on the blocked work item.

89
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.290
So, start work on the next priority backlog item for the following sprint

90
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.750
or sprint+1 if you will. Leave the blocked user story in the sprint in

91
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.330
case it becomes unblocked during the sprint,

92
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.800
and you may want to stop the sprint+1 item and go back

93
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.040
to the one now that's unblocked,

94
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.440
or push forward the blocked user story to the next sprint's backlog.

95
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.680
You may even split the user story into two or more parts and

96
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.640
complete a portion of the user story and place the remaining

97
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.810
work in the next sprint's backlog.

98
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.260
Also, put the item back in the backlog if the item has remained

99
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.690
blocked for quite some time. So you'd move the user story from the

100
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.840
sprint and place it in the backlog,

101
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.030
usually in a spot or area called maybe blocked work items

102
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.500
over 15 days or something like that.

103
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.150
If the blocker is resolved during the sprint in which it was blocked,

104
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.530
decide what to do. If the sprint has been completed,

105
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.920
then review the user story that was blocked, or portion of the user

106
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.240
story if it was split, and plan for it in the next sprint, or if

107
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.940
there's still time left in the sprint,

108
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.770
you may decide to resume development of the blocked user

109
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.680
story. Blockers versus bottlenecks.

110
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.080
Blockers are not bottlenecks, and bottlenecks are not blockers.

111
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.790
A blocker is an individual work item that is stuck

112
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.080
and cannot be worked any further, and we previously gave you several examples.

113
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.940
A bottleneck is an issue with capacity,

114
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.900
and you have a buffer filling up with too much completed

115
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.080
work and you can't work it fast enough through the value

116
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.650
stream or through the sprint.

117
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:13.000
What is similar between the two is that they both impede the flow of work, but what each one means is different.
