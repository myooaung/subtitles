00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.550
In this course, Deploying Value with Kanban,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.790
you will learn the knowledge and skills to help you implement

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.900
continuous integration and continuous deployment within the

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.940
context of the Kanban value stream in DevOps.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.480
So,

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.940
if you are using Agile Scrum or the basics of Kanban today

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.950
and are looking for taking a deeper,

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.710
richer examination at how you can further refine and improve your Kanban

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
practice to deliver even more value to your customers,

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740
then this course is for you.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.370
First,

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.840
we will compare Kanban with Scrum so you can leverage your Agile Scrum

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.700
knowledge to better assimilate new Kanban techniques.

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.550
Topics to be contrasted are backlog creation,

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.760
backlog planning, work in progress, workflow constraints,

16
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.640
handling unplanned work, and using metrics.

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.120
Next,

18
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.710
we will discuss how continuous integration can increase

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.420
customer value through applying version control,

20
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.750
branching and merging,

21
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.640
and automated testing within the context of a Kanban value stream,

22
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.560
and employing automation to the build process to improve code quality.

23
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.380
We will examine how DevOps is the bridge between continuous

24
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.570
integration and continuous deployment to enable regular,

25
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.740
automatic production builds.

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.340
This will illustrate how this best practice works hand‑in‑hand with Kanban.

27
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.870
Finally,

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.520
as the popularity of Kanban continues to grow, its

29
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.140
usage is not just in small pockets, but growing throughout organizations.

30
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.820
We will explore the importance of the order of work,

31
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420
estimates, milestones, effective communication,

32
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.630
and how to best deal with late or buggy dependencies.

33
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.450
When you are finished with this course,

34
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:49.000
the student will have the skills and knowledge of how to improve, execute, and deliver a higher‑level quality Kanban management system.
