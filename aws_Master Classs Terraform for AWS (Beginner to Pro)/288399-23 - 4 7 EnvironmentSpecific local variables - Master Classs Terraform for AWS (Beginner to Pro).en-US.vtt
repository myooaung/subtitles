00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.610
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.820
we're going to look at what eyes environment,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.180
specific local variables and how to create them.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.740
Now,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.800
as far as I know,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.870
there is no documentation related to this.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.860
I have tried a lot off enough did.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.440
I've done a lot of trial and error toe figure this out for myself in my use cases,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.100
and I just wanted to share this because this hack will really help you or in,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.630
um,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.650
creating the environment specific local variables.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.870
Now,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.350
let me give you in a use case,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.050
you where you can use this concept.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290
So let's say you have a,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.950
um,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.340
have three different work spaces like Staging Dev and Production,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.600
and you want to launch three different easy to instances with different Am I ID's now?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.180
How do you specify,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.130
um,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.370
which environment will use a specific A My i d.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.190
So that is what we're going to solve here.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.350
So let me,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.170
um,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.030
open up the project and let's get started by solving this problem.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.020
So let's go into our project.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.120
So I'm going to use the same project that we have used in the previous lesson.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.710
We already have staging and production workspaces created for this project.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.130
Now,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.550
let's go ahead and create the local variables which are specific toe those environments now

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.610
here will also be using the concept off the function cord.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.100
What do you call this function?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:57.540
Okay,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.760
so now here we are going to use a concept off using the look up function in your local

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.350
variables,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190
and I'm going to show you how exactly it is done.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.320
So first thing that we're going to do is in our previous project,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.180
which was easy to workspaces project.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.870
I'm going to my main dot Terra form folder and in here in the local variables,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.450
I'm gonna create a variable called a my I d.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.490
Now,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.870
I'm just going to ah,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.570
create these variables,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.360
and I'm just going to output them for this for keeping this example.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.220
Ah,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.300
to the simplest form.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.660
Right.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.860
So the way I'm going to declare the variable is basically I'm saying,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.260
am I I d underscore environment.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.510
And inside this,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.790
I am going toe,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.570
create a map off different variables which are related to different environments.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.260
Now,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.930
if you remember correctly,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.190
there is three environments that are present.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.490
I mean,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.770
three workspaces that are present,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.590
which is default,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.890
staging and production.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.950
So for default,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.980
I'm just going to give a value saying,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.840
Ah,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.650
let's say my i d is some am I idee underscore default.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:22.250
I'm just making things up here and we have staging right equally do You can write a my

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.050
Heidi underscore staging.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:33.270
And we have production he wanted to in my i d underscore production.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.030
Right.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.440
So we have created a map off variables for a my i d underscoring Wightman.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.360
Now we're going to create another variable called letter.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.950
We call it a my I d.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.270
Right.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.600
So you're saying we want a my i D Toby resolved,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.180
right?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.580
So the way we were going toe do it.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.920
What?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.590
We're saying it.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.180
Well,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.550
look up in this particular in my i d environment for the value which matches this

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.240
environment,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.470
right,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.910
So we have our workspace is created with the Senate with this names staging and production

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.910
,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.180
and we want to use the look of function so that we supply saying that Oh,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.620
we want to look up the particular map variable for this particular environment.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:28.950
So the way you'll do is you'll do dollar open close and you have look up function.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.260
And inside this look of function,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:41.680
you're going to say local understood local dot My i d underscore our score environment.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.700
Right,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.780
comma.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.980
And what do you want to look up for?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.090
You wanna look out for the environment itself,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.850
which is going to be local dot environment.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.030
So here we have open and close the braces and everything looks correct.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.530
And let's go ahead and output this particular variable here.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.550
So what we can do is we can say output,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.150
um,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.360
environment specific output variables.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.680
And inside this,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.560
we're going to say value equals local 0.0,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.840
no,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.810
not like this.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.090
Open double coat inside that dollar.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.150
Local guard.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.390
We're going to use a my idea.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.180
Now,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.400
let me explain this to you again.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.640
So what we're doing is there are putting the value off local air.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.920
My i d Now in in.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.310
In the real life example,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.330
you would send this a my i d to a specific ec2.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.880
Instance.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.840
And,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.580
um and depending on which workspace you are the heir.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.780
My I d will be fetched either This this artis right here in your example,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.360
it would be the really my i d and the city.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.240
Instance we will use that plastic.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.680
Am I?

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.930
I d the savior pulling it out.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.210
It's like we're referencing it.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.160
Toe this local variable and this local variable will resolve to one off these based on the

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.740
local environment,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.330
which is our terra form workspace.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.420
So let's go ahead and run this and see what variable will get back here.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.190
Now,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.550
let me open up my power shell again and we are in the same project,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.920
actually.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.270
Here,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.100
let me clear this and let me do terra form workspace.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.750
Select.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.180
Um,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.940
Let's go the staging first.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.470
All right,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.290
so it's switched to staging and we're going to run to the farm.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.350
Ah,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.080
plan.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.150
You should see that there iss Nothing.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.770
Toby changed because we didn't change any off our infrastructure.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.230
There,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.080
terra form.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.990
Apply now.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.660
You should see the output variable that we have printed there once it is done.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.570
All right.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:19.400
So you can see that environment specific output valuable here is returning us the am I I d

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.650
underscore staging now let's safe.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:30.250
We clear this and do terra form workspace select production And let's so tear form apply

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.850
again.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.960
There's no nothing to change here.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.150
It should again show us that the environment specific variable here is pointing to the

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.480
production one.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.570
So you can see here am I I d underscore production.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.690
Now you can apply this concept are toe many different variables.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.990
You can have shared variables shared variable module,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.780
and you can import that more deal in different places.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.430
And you can you start concept toe basically share variables across different,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.380
um,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.710
more guilt and across different environments.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:11.490
So I really hope that you enjoyed this lesson and you apply these tips and tricks in your

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.520
project and let me know if you have any questions so that I can answer them for you.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.190
So that's it for this lesson,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.380
and I'll see in the next one.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.560
Thank you so much for watching
