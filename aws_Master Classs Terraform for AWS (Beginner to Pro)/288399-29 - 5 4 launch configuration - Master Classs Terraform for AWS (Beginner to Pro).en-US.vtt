00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.690
And ah,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.670
in the previous lesson,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.180
we have completed all the application load balance or set up by creating the L B.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.610
We have created the target group and we have also created the listener for extra DP in our

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.670
staging environment.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.400
Now,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.060
in this lesson,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.020
we will create the launch configuration which will be attaching Toe artist Killing group in

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.690
the next lesson.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.500
So let's get started.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.680
So the first thing that we have to do is go ahead and open up our project folder.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.100
And inside this we want to create another model which is going to be a order scaling model

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.100
.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.400
Right?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.500
So I'm going to create a new folder and I'm going to call it auto scaling.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.140
Underscore more deals.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.240
All right,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.940
so inside this model,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.320
we have to create a new terra form file,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.760
which is going to be also auto scaling.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.020
Underscore module dot DF Now,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.480
once this is created,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.680
I'm going to open up the sublime text.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.220
So this was our project file gonna close all these models because we don't need a tow

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.710
moment.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.650
I'm opening the order scaling model.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.630
And the first thing that we want to create is basically a launch configuration,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.570
which we want to use it in our order scaling group.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.050
So let's dive into our uniform documentation and search for the eight a launch

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.400
configuration.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.440
All right,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.270
so we want toe chooses this issue to resource issue under a C to resource is where you have

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.400
to select the AWS on the school lunch on the score configuration.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.370
And here,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.750
uh,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.420
you convey,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.070
basically,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.880
see,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190
third,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.350
there is an example.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.250
All right,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.620
so let's copy this example here,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.050
and let's taste it here.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.250
All right,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.900
so let's change some off the names here.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.440
First.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.830
Thing is,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.820
we need to include the module,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.650
which is our,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.650
uh,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.610
which is our shared underscore bars,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.330
right?

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.190
And supply the source.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.770
So that fetches it.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.580
It's one level up shade underscore wars like this part is done.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.020
We want to configure my ab sample.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.510
Half underscore Elsie and systems for launch conflict and the name that we want to give iss

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.500
sample app The underscore Elsie underscore from the shared wars.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.320
Let's fetch the share more.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.050
Dool dart shared underscore war start environment underscore suffix All right,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.560
so we got Start now.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110
We need the am I I d.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.480
Right.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:28.920
So we can configure thes two inputs in our shared wars and in the shared wars we want toe

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.330
add one more variable,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.730
which is going to be environment specific.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.440
Right?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.620
So let's call this in.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.150
My i d underscore environment in a copy it here.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.620
All right,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.250
So am I.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.610
I d We're going to fetch it from our credibly sec to ah section.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.450
So we're going to go to the AM I thirsty majors?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.860
Yeah.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.150
So,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.920
under images,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.850
there's a Mayes and owned by public Kamajors.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.850
It's a prior it.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.950
No blick Amazon.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.430
It's hard to find from here The easiest way that I will.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.500
I usually find it us.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.740
Go to launch instance and I want toe select this.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.930
Hey,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.350
am I?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.600
I said this in my atrium.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:59.550
Know this We we want this might let me just this guy and let me paste the m o here.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.170
Now,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.080
in our case,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.850
the am I the base a my ideas.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.040
Same for production and staging.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.530
So we're gonna leave it like that,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.550
but for the instance,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.330
type All right,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.680
so we can choose the instants type is,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.850
uh,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:26.350
instance type you can choose score environment,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:41.820
too Dark micro t two dot micro and for production.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:52.150
Let's use t two dot medium So now we have got our instance type and are am I i d and ah,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.650
let's go ahead and input those variables in tow.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.040
This particular the majority here.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.560
So we're gonna say,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.240
before that we have to go to our shared wars and I'll put these very what's right.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.950
So I'm gonna go toe output variables and copy them two copies.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:31.160
And here I'm going to say in my i d local dot here my i d and same this is going to be

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.180
instance that's going to be instance type.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.820
So I'm a quick check if you've got that right.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.750
So instants type should be just this instant stipend and there should be display.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.390
I am why I d should be just in my i d.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.920
This all it's over.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.250
A fixed those small issues there.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.550
Let's go back to order scaling module.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.950
Call it.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:13.220
So now we have are the launch configuration basic parameters.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.950
But I also want to give it Ah,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.230
the security group.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.950
The what do you say the security group,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.210
the,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.450
uh,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:30.590
the CBS volume and so on.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.160
And so far.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.490
So let's see if we have any more example here.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.150
And also,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.800
we want to specify the,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.330
um,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.600
user data here.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:50.220
So So this horse launch config this.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.120
Is there anything here?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.070
Any of us.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.320
So we have the image i d we have the name prefix Instance.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.780
I am role.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.760
I'm not giving any of the old here,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.540
but we need to create the key name,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.830
right?

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.660
So to supply the key name first,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.120
we need to create it beforehand.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.100
So you have to go to our AWS issue to console in our high region.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:22.550
And I am going to create a keeper here beforehand so that it is handy.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.750
I'm not going to use terra form for this,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.450
uh,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.840
key pairs.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.250
Okay,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.250
The key Peirce's here.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.080
We want to create a new keeper.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.770
So eight of yes,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.480
project Terra form keep.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.460
All right.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.950
So I'm gonna create this,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:52.080
and I'm gonna save it in our that saved in our of course,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.350
in our course for order here.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.270
All right.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.870
And we have Donald at that,

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.590
and we just need to give it to keep their name.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.750
Uh,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.950
that's the one thing.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.570
Let's also create hit of yes,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.750
project a terror farm.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:24.850
Keep a staging right and save it here.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.710
Let's did it.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.400
The old one.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.940
Yes.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.210
I didn't do the naming.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.680
Right.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.820
So I'm going to create a new cape Air eight of Yes,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.950
Project TF.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.670
Keep it production.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.840
All right.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.450
And I'm gonna save it here,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.340
showing Fuller.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.740
I want to delete the the one which doesnt have probably.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.480
All right,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.850
so we have docked.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.640
So once that is completed,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.580
what we're going to do is we have to create the shared wars for that.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:12.920
So I'm going to copy one of these blocks and create the keep that name right.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:20.400
Okay.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:29.440
So you know what of these are really not shared variables because it you don't usually use

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.440
.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.090
Am I an instance type and keep your name in the,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.650
uh,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.820
in the what you call it in across the model.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.150
So I'm just gonna cut this out from here,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:50.590
and I'm going to declare them directly within the within the hardest getting model.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.470
So let's create a locals here.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.250
Alright.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.910
And environment.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.950
Equal toe.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.250
Ah,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.920
daughter.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.990
$2 close to farmed are towards space.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:13.390
And here we can't kind of have these variables set.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.540
And the key.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.650
Better name we have to just create here.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.700
All right,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.980
so keep your name.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.860
Oh,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.080
no,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.950
This is underscore N Y Rent.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:45.150
And we have We have the keep in names as staging on and production.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.060
All right,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.900
so this part is no set.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:58.710
The one thing that we have to change here iss we have toe get the environment suffix that

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.050
we can get from,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.550
um,

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.550
either shared wars or you can even do local dot environment.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.250
Right.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.630
And,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.290
uh,

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:21.600
here the image I write the image i d should be local dot my i d and your variables The

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.550
instance types should be local dot uh,

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.170
instance type And also,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.800
you want to specify the key pair.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.700
So let's go back to the Terra form documentation.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.930
So we need the key name.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.300
Right?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:49.250
So we'll give the key name equals dollar local dot key name.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.450
Keep that name,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.530
actually,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.180
keep in,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.850
so keep it name,

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.970
and we also want to supply the user data.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.240
Right,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.650
so we can supply the user data.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.870
Ah,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.150
let's see how this is being so quiet here.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.750
so user on the school data.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.300
All right,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.610
so the user data,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.840
we want to create a file in our project directory,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.810
and we want to basically refer,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.750
um,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.620
opened the file in the terra form barracks.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.410
So I'm going to open up the,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.830
uh what is killing module?

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.650
Go back once level up,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.450
we can create Ah,

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.550
new folder here,

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:43.150
call it user data and are we can call it maybe assets,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.850
because it's one of the asset.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:50.350
And so this asset we can create a Ah,

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.080
you'll text file,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.100
you can call it user data.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.060
Txt.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.320
And inside that,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.810
I'm gonna have a bunch of comments.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.660
All right,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:06.580
so those commands are basically me pulled us up.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.620
I've already written a few commands which we're going to use us,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.450
the user data.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:22.920
So it's going to be just these commands which will have the default Petri site for the

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.230
Times.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.320
Only likes a my page being served at Port 80.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.140
So we're just gonna use this as our use of data.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.530
Now,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.910
the user data is basically it iss.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:40.680
It is the initial bootstrap scripts that you can run whenever you are launching a new

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.180
instance.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.230
So that you don't have to go in and configure it manually.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.260
So my user data is basically set here,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.410
and the next thing that I'm going to do is go back toward our farm file here.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.400
And,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.110
um,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.180
the way you it called this is basically ah,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.740
you're gonna say dollar open close inside this,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.530
you're gonna save file and,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.910
ah,

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.850
files,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.980
you have to open up and you have to give it a final name on the file.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.060
Name is,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.760
um,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.020
basically the user data part.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:16.340
Right.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.660
So the user data part is actually a relevant part here.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.750
So we're gonna go one back level up,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:30.640
and we're going to go to the assets and we have toe give it user data dot txt.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.550
Right.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.770
So once we do this,

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.360
our user data is Nokia dead.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.170
And I think you've got pretty much everything that we need it for.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.030
The launch configuration.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.980
Um,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.750
I think one other thing that is missing is the security group.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.090
Right.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:55.480
So you have to give the security group so security groups ah,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:04.670
and secular groups would be a day off items here so inside that we just need to give the

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:11.420
security group so you have to take a security group as an input no more.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.300
So you have to give a variable private Ah,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.790
private security group,

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.250
our school Rieti.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.900
And this will be output it from our network model.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:32.140
And we have to import it through the main model into this particular hardest killing Mordor

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.140
.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:41.610
So here what we have to do iss Just refer to it as and give it watch dog.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.650
Uh,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.200
what's it called?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.560
Private S t score 80.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.950
Right.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:59.050
So now the year having aws launched conflict sample up so everything is set here.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:07.200
One thing that is left is basically including this hardest getting model in our route model

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.370
and supplying it with input off the private security group I d.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:17.160
So we have to do auto scaling underscore model.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.910
And inside this,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:27.560
we're going to give source equal toe start slash Porto scaling underscore more jewels,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:37.940
and we have to give the private security i d equal toe again.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:43.660
We have to get this as an output from the network.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:50.570
I want you dot private security group fighting.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.550
Right.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.370
So once this is stunt,

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:59.650
the next step is to go to our partial prompt clear in the waiter a form in it.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:17:59.770
Now,

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.640
if you have any others,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.070
it's going toe pointed out here.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.100
So far,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.550
so good.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.400
No errors.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.440
So let's clear this part that do enter a farm plan and let's see what we come back with.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.410
All right,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.660
So there is one error,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.130
actually,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.280
so it's complaining about file opening.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.530
Dot,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:16.820
dot,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.160
slash assets user data dot txt.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.070
The system cannot find the specified,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:35.860
but so we went back One part one file when directory up and it would give it the right name

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:35.860
.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.360
Actually,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:46.200
user data right user data dot txt and assets.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.780
This looks right foot to me.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.080
All right.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.350
I think it might be complaining about the ah slashes here.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.350
Maybe.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:06.260
Let's try this and let's try to run Telephone plan character escape 38.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.410
It's tradable slashes.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:14.370
Uh,

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:25.170
so silken figure out this So asset is S E t s.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.830
Yes,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:37.760
that user data dot txt user data dot txt That's it.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:48.060
Slash We're getting once level up and referencing it.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.310
That's the asset.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.840
Oh,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.070
maybe we just need to give assets Stashes of data dot Txt.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.050
Let's try it out.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.250
Give it this.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.900
All right,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.390
there we go.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.970
So I think what it is doing is,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:07.660
um,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:14.230
taking the conservation from where it is actually running this script so it is related to

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.810
the root.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.290
Oh,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.460
are the main telephone file.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.150
So we just have to give assets slash user later.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.920
Rt extended.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.830
It was taking it.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.260
So let's go back and run Terra form plan again.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.300
We should see that one resource is being created,

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.660
which is our launch configuration Canoe Terra form apply.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:40.540
Oh,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.440
let's quickly make sure that we're giving the name with staging.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.090
Yes,

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.680
so I can see that the name has staging as thesis affix.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.910
So I'm good with it.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:56.110
So let's create it and enter Yes and yeah,

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.330
So the launch configuration has now been created.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.050
And now we can go back to our,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:09.370
um he Cito console and go to the launch configuration section and you should see a new

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.930
launch configuration which was created by the terra form so you can see that sample app

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.240
Elsie underscore stating has been created.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.730
Let's quickly verify for user data was executed properly.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.080
Yes,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.040
So the user data has mean read properly from the text file,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.120
and everything is created properly,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.190
So that's pretty much it for this lesson of you have completed our launch conflict creation

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.400
and I will see in the next one.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.090
So in the next one,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.650
we're going to create the artist killing group.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.440
Ah,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.780
and let's see how it goes.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.150
So that's it for this L C in the next one.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:42.730
Bye bye.
