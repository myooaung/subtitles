00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.710
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.320
And,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.880
um,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.890
in this lesson,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.440
we're going to go ahead and create our first telephone file and ah,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.340
let's get started.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.640
So first thing,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.620
what you have to do is you have to create a folder or a directory,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.500
depending on,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.680
like,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.250
no.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.180
Which operating system you're choosing?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.250
Um,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm in my course folder,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:38.270
and I'm going to just create a new folder saying First tear a farm file and inside this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.780
folder,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.480
I'm going to create a new file.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.020
So the extension that you're going to use is dot the F.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.170
So I'm going to create a new file,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.310
which is going to be it,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:58.850
so I can just call it Hello word RTF now.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.710
Hello.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.120
World really doesn't make any sense in this particular piece off example.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.180
But it is a way off learning anything new in computer world.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.430
So I'm just going to use hello world as the name.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.460
So I'm using hell award dot TF as my,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.700
um what do you call this terra form file?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.240
So inside,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.980
Once you have this,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.780
all you have to do it's like open up your command,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.930
prompt or power shell.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.170
And inside this,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.020
whenever you create a new telephone file or you want to run anything you have tow

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.910
initialized this particular telephone fight to do that,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.850
you have the command off that'll form in it.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.240
So this is the first thing that you have to do whenever you're creating a uniform file.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
So once you do it in it,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.080
you can see that there are former successfully initialized.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.300
So basically,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.230
what this does is lets say,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.610
right now you don't have anything in your terra form supplied.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910
But if you have anything like,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.040
let's say in the next lessons will be doing this anyway.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.170
So what we're going to do,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.260
it's like we're going to still like Okay,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.810
I'm going to use AWS as my provider and,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.370
ah,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.460
I'm going to include some module or I'm going to include this particular file or that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.170
particular file,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.880
whatever it is.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.760
So in order for terra form toe like ah,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.420
like,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.440
get that information saying that,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.680
Okay,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
I'm going to use this pretty waiting for that particular in for before I run anything.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.510
This initialization step will go ahead and figure out those details and it will kind off

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.560
download the dependencies are add.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.510
The dependence is that this particular terra form file eat.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.220
Now,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.930
In our case,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.240
this is a very blank terra form file and it doesn't have any information in there.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.330
So that's why it's just saying like,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.550
OK,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.300
their former successfully initialized and it doesn't have anything in there.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.190
So So this is our basically blacked out a farm file,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.450
and we have initialized it.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.330
Now there are some of the some of the important commands that you're going toe run in this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.560
particular course are terra form plan.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.360
Now,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.200
telephone plan is something like a dry run off your off your script,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.950
saying that when you run this terra form planets going to actually check Ward,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.060
all it is going to create and it's going to list out the things that it will create saying

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.300
that.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.780
Okay,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.920
let's say you have listed out,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.210
then the sources that you want to create in your telephone file and Iran Terra form plan.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.530
It is going to show you by verifying with the console AWS console or like whichever cloud

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.160
provider that you're using and it will tell us like,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.540
Okay,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.150
I'm going to create so into resource,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970
and I'm going to delete.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.870
So in so resource and I'm going to update,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.710
so interest soars.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.400
So those are the kind off Brighton information that it's going to provide,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.170
and it is always the best practice to run terra form plan.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.330
Before you said anything before you apply those changes because you have to know,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.090
um,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.840
what changes you're making.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.200
And you should be sure that,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.050
uh,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.840
if before you delete something or before you operate something so that you don't mess up

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.390
the current state off your infrastructure,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.780
so that is for telephone plan is going to help you with.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.550
So we're Esther.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.550
A farm plan.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.970
So right now,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.050
you can see that there is no infrastructure change and infrastructure is up to date.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.040
Um,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.270
and there's no changes that not going to get applied.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.650
The second thing is uniform a play.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.740
Now when you do there from apply all it is going to do,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.950
it's like it's going to check.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.780
Is there anything toe apply?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.680
It's going toe again.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.530
Do a plan,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.740
ah thing.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.790
And then it's going to list to you all the resources that it is going to touch,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.520
whether it's going to create whether it's going to delete or whether it's going to update

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.860
stuff so you can see terra form apply.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.670
There's nothing in this file again,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.180
so that's why there's there's nothing you'll see here,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.530
and the third important command is terra form.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.950
Destroy No,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:20.100
a terror farm Destroy is a is a really scary comment because it is going toe nail down the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.770
infrastructure that you have specified in the state of farm file.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.690
So it is.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.520
It is like basically deleting everything that you have created using this particular

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.250
telephone file.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.810
So before running this,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.350
you have to be always careful about,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.950
um,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.800
running this command as it's really scary to take down the entire infrastructure.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.730
So whenever you run this command,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.390
Terra Form is going to ask you for a confirmation.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.690
It is also going to ask you for a telephone,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.870
apply conformation.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.620
Right now,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.670
we don't have any resources.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.220
That's why he didn't ask for apply.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.360
But for destroy.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.180
It is always going to ask you for a confirmation whether you really want to run this

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.860
command or not.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.050
So I'm going to say yes and it is going to destroy whatever it is there,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:10.930
so really These are the most important commands that you're going toe work with initially.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.350
And,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.710
ah,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.150
in the advanced lesson,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.690
I'm going to show you more commands.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.670
But for now,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.320
you have to just remember three commands,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.460
which is telephone plan.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.170
Oh,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.280
I'm I'm sorry.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.610
You have to remember four comets with this terra form in it there.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.390
Form plant,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.670
terra form apply,

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.980
and terra form destroyed.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.400
So these are the only four commands that you need to by heart.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.210
And,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.830
uh,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.890
that's pretty much it for your first terra form file.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.690
And in the next lesson,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.330
let's go ahead and talk about their from state files and their farm.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.960
Yeah,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.560
basically there from state violence.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.560
What is it and why is it so important?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.030
All right,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.480
so that's it for this lesson.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.830
And I will see in the next one.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.650
Thank you for watching
