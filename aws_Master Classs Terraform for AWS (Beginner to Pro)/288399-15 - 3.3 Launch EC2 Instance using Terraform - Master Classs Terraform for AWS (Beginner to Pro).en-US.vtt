00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.590
And in tourist lesson.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.660
We're going to see how to launch an easy two instance using the Terra Form script.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.910
Now in this lesson off to launch a new easy to instance,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.200
we have two requirements.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.850
Oneness to create an easy to pair keeper and to create a security group.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.860
No,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.070
these two resources can be created using their A farm or it can also be created with the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.670
console.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.890
I'm just going to walk you through how this can be created using the terra form.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.050
And then I'm going to use the console toe the AWS console to create these requirements.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.350
And then we'll see how to launch the easy to instance using the terra form.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.050
So let's get started.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.460
So the first thing that I'm going to show you,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.340
it's like how to create the key pair using the terra form.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.580
So to rule that first,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.980
let's go to the terra form documentation,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.110
which is going to be in the terra form that I a website and toe go to the documentation go

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.690
to the dark section providers go to the AWS and the one that you are looking for is aws

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.860
Underscore key.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.850
Underscore Pair.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.990
Now,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.160
if you select this now,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.640
we should see that,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.750
um you can be for you to create the AWS keeper using the three terra form stripped.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.580
You need to create a public key beforehand and you have to supply that to AWS to register

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.340
your keeper.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.470
So to do that,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.940
what you need to do is you need tohave.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.590
Ah,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.750
there are different ways you can create and these formats that are supported our ah,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.680
basically open us a such public key format and waste 64 in corded dear format and excessive

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.070
public e format specified in RFC 4716 Now,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.900
one way you can create it's like if you're using windows,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.130
you can use party Jen and inside party Jen,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.760
What you need to do is you just have to say generate and you have to just rotate your mouth

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.630
here to create some randomness and that's going to create the public key.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.300
I mean,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.320
public e and you you just have to click save public e and ah,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.770
and you can just give it a extension off dark PPK and copy the text that this here.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.420
And ah,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.210
used this block off uniform court,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.050
which is resource aws keeper.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.640
And give the name that you want to give and give it a name.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.590
Ah,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.720
which you want the aws to recognize and just supply the generator.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.620
Uh,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.350
public key here.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.910
And then all you have to do is basically,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.090
um,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.820
their form planning apply.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.280
And that should be it.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.490
And to create this using the console,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460
I'm just going to walk you through that in a minute.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.650
And for creating the,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.770
uh,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.860
security groups.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.500
All you can do is go to eight of yes,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.450
security group an entire security group.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.250
Or you just have to say,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.080
uh,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.270
no,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.280
this is the data source.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.850
I'm sorry.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.010
So inside Ah,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.610
you have to create a resource eight of the security group.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.290
You know what?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.710
Let's go ahead and do this using the terra form so that you will be having one more example

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.540
to play around with.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.750
So firstly,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.000
I'll go to the AWS console and create my keeper.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.350
To do that,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.350
you have to go to the AWS console Goto aceto section and inside this,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.220
you have to go toe the key pair section.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.780
If you see inside the network and security.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.140
You should see the key pairs.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.500
Now select keepers and create Keeper and just give it a name.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.150
Let's call it terra form.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.780
Uh,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.520
terra form,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.300
of course.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.440
All right,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.060
that sounds Ah,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.500
pretty good.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.320
And,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.940
ah,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.050
in Satara farm course we can say that.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.750
A form course.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.090
Start them off.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.710
Yeah,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.930
we can save it here.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.530
Oh,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.950
you will need toe have this handy because you need that to basically connect to a easy to

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.430
instant.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.300
So that's why you need this particular key before you launch an easy two instance.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.500
So Okay,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.480
so now all of our first requirement is done.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:39.230
The second thing that we're going to do is go back to our Terra Form course folder open.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.870
Of course,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.340
Fuller.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.540
And inside that we're going to start off it are easy to ah 10 a farm folder.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.490
So we have to go and create a new folder,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.530
call it E C.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.350
A C two on a farm,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.460
and inside this,

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.210
we're going to create it terra form file,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.500
which is going to be main dot DF.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.310
All right.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.640
Yes.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.460
We want to change the extension to Dottie Effigy starter from fight.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.410
Now,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.050
as usual,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:18.480
I'm going toe open this file inside my sublime and we have toe do some basic stuff,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.460
so I'm going to go back toe RST bucket opened this guy up and copy the block off.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.990
Court off provider Close.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.520
This based because we need the provider here.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.550
And the form course,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.870
our profile name for the AWS taxes.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.670
Okay,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.420
So,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.280
like I said,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.340
we were going to create our security group using our terra form.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.550
So let's get started.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.480
So first thing that I'll put in here is go back to my,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.040
uh,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.870
aws documentation for terra form and search for eight of us security groups.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.140
Okay,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.450
so we are already in here and in this Ah,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.050
to let's copy this block.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.470
All right,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.970
so now if you are completely unfamiliar with security groups in AWS,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.470
basically,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.950
security groups are like,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.400
firewall that you can place in front off your instance,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.900
and you can control who can access,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.570
like toe.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:29.850
The instance who can have inborn axis and what out born access that particularly see two

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.180
instance has and all that network traffic gets filtered using this security groups.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.160
So it is really essential for any ec2 instance to have ah very good of security group Rules

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.980
Place so that you don't have any unauthorized access coming to your easy two instances.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.490
Okay,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.860
so let's go ahead and create one.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:56.370
So let's create the security group name as a terra form form.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.550
Easy to ah security group.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:07.640
I just called SG as a security group and I usually place the resource name same as the

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.200
actual the resource that we're creating.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:17.980
And let's give this description as Terra Form course security group for easy to instance.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.320
I'm just making that up.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.950
And one thing you're need is basically the VPC idea.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.170
No,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.880
for this lesson What?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.740
I'm going to do this.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.650
I'm going to use a default VPC Now the default VPC you can find out by going toe your VPC

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:45.610
in aws console and inside that you should see a default vpc So if you go toe your VP sees

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:55.160
you should probably see a default Vpc Now this is your the fault vpc and you can copy this

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.310
vpc i d here and you need to create a variable.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:08.070
So like you have like in the previous lessons we have covered how to use the variables.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.120
Now we're actually using that in our scenario.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.500
So how to create a variable?

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.650
You just have to do variable give the variable name as we P c i d.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:28.880
And inside that so type e quarto string and you can give the fault for to your vpc 80.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.490
All right,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.260
now we need to specify that v p c i d.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.060
Here so we can say it is where dart d c i d.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.360
Now to use the variable solely of traduced dollar inside double coach after the dollar open

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.440
calibrates viaduct vpc I d and you should be able to access this particular resource from

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.720
here.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.160
Now you have a ingress and egress.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.910
Ingress is basically inbound,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.900
and egress is basically out born.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:07.210
Now you can have ah many rules by specifying many ingress rules and you can have many

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.020
egress rules.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.020
Now there are again a different ways to specify rules.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.000
Now you can in your security groups,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.590
you can have multiple cider blocks and you can have Let's say you can allow rules to a

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.670
different security groups and s so on and so forth.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.180
You can choose from different protocols.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:35.200
Now what we can do is we can say Ah for Port 22 which is our ssh.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.580
Uh,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.050
we're just going to say,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.170
uh,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.860
from Porter near Newport 22 was just basically saying like,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.110
OK,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.390
I just want for 20 to open and protocol ISS we want TCP,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.760
right?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.150
We want TCP Or if you go here and see what are the available poorer protocols.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.210
It's such for protocol.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.850
You can see Ah,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.360
so you can see vertical.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.770
If not my sympathies,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.820
you'd be minus one use particle.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.150
So you have to use TCP because we want TCP port.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.460
Ah,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.950
trainee do Because we want a succession to that instance.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:24.100
So we're saying allow for 20 toe open from everywhere Now you can specify your own I p

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.730
address for this example.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.750
I'm just leaving it to all open.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.660
It is not a good practice,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.220
by the way.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.390
You should never use this kind of thing in your production.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.830
But for this example,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.300
I'm just gonna leave it open because we're gonna tear down that environment anyway,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.460
that the end of the lessons.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.080
So that's one thing.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.470
And in the egress,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.720
one other thing is for in your security groups.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.110
If you have something open?

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.200
Ah,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.790
inbound.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.550
Then for that specific thing,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.160
you always have that out.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.020
Born but open by default if you have something inborn open.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.750
But we just specify,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.250
uh,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:10.220
out born rule as well just so that we can play around with this And you can say in the side

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.000
of blocks that Yes,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.160
I want open everything,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.950
and I'm just going to get it off this.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.870
All right,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.920
So now you have,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.350
Ah,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.280
security group,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.790
which is there?

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.030
A pharmacy to SG should be created.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.520
Now,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.720
let's go ahead and run this terra form script now to do to run that all.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.420
You have to do this.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.220
Open your power.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.400
Shell and I have a partial open here.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.070
Now,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.900
inside this,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.380
we want to go to our Ford.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:35.800
Right?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.610
So inside this,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.350
we want to go to our e C to tear a farm.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.880
Two year.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.580
Let's do there a farm in it because you have.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.090
This is our new telephone file.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.440
We have to do initialized first.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.170
So let's talk terra form in it.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.650
Uh,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.990
it's taking a bit.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:01.020
All right,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.460
so we have our uniform initialized.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.350
I'm just going to clear the screen again.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.770
we're going to do terra form plan now and see what it comes up with.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.860
All right,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.180
We don't have any errors.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.610
It's saying basically,

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.280
we are creating a We're adding one resource zero to change the law to destroy.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.550
And we have a security group that we're creating.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:32.940
And we're specifying one egress ruling one ingress rule so you can see egress Number one,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.020
um,

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.120
in dress number one and you're adding those resources.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.390
So now you can clear again.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.440
You can say terra form apply,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.950
and it will ask you for the confirmation.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.180
And once you're type in,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.810
yes,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:54.600
your new resource should be created and we can go back toe the AWS console once it is

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.250
created to verify if that new security group has been created or not.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:06.620
Now let's go back to our AWS console now Goto our ah security groups,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.080
right,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.350
fig or the secretary groups search for terra form.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.980
All right,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.910
so you have security group named at a pharmacy to SG their form course SG for Restitution

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.680
Center 40 of created and inside the inborn rule.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:28.080
You can see that you're opening a society for 22 in TCP Protocol and from everywhere.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.290
And you also have the same out born rule specified here.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:31.920
All right,

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.270
so the first part off the easy to instance,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.140
is completed.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.530
Now,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.480
let's go ahead and actually launch.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.640
Easy to instance Now,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.240
to do that,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.740
I'm again going back to my,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.810
um Terra form documentation.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.630
Now I'm going to search for aws Underscore e c to underscore.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.350
Ah,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.260
actually,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.570
yeah.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.670
Aws underscore Instance.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.250
So if I go here now,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.620
I'll be seeing an example for how to launch an easy two instance.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.100
Now,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:10.920
if you see Resource Aws instance Vap and you need any am I OK?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.760
So there's one more dependency here.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:21.920
We need any of my Soto get the am I We can use the latest whatever the easy toe the next

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.390
heir my,

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.910
which aws offers in In your case,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.720
if you have a specific am I that you have created,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.740
you can copy that Am I I d from images section But in this case,

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:43.480
I'm just going toe am eyes You can search in it in a couple of face weaken goto owned by We

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.750
can actually go to this.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:56.370
Begin search for aws Lennox and be one render as Amazon Web services,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:08.550
and you can see Amazon the next AM I am just going to choose start and to get the to get

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.960
the am I I d.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.790
Let's go ahead and search for the my I d you know what?

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.320
The easier way to find out.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.280
This would be just going to,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.930
ah,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.560
instances launch Easy to incident.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.540
And this is going to show us the Am I i d from here now.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.090
I'm just going to choose.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.040
Ah,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.490
this am I I d Copy it.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.850
Come back off.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.740
Come on,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.850
off this page.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.590
Now go to my telephone file again.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:51.720
And inside this I'm just going to specify another where but just variable in my i d am I i

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.580
d And inside this there's only to specify string for the string.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.650
Something's going to leave it Us the vault equal.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.880
Do the sprinkler Am my idea.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.450
All right,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.040
so now we have the am I i d.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.630
And then we let's go back to the documentation again and see what else we need.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.670
So all right.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.420
So we can just copy this block,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.870
which is saying a resource aws instance,

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.460
and we can name that instant something can go here.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.380
Copy that.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.750
So we're saying aws instance we can call it Terra Form,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.210
is it,

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.670
though?

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.400
Instance.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.830
And we can specify this as dark in my idea.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.450
All right.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.830
We can choose the instance.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.990
Type did a lot Micro.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.640
You can specify one over the incidents type you require,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.670
uh,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:48.320
and we can say name as these are the tags that were specifying so we can say tags name.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.500
It will toe terra from you See two instance All right.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.740
And you can also specify many other attributes.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.780
Let's go ahead and check it out so we can specify which availability zone this is optional

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:02.780
.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.470
If you specify a specific availability zone,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.120
it's going to create in that if not it,

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.010
it's going to randomly choose one.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.380
If you want placement group,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.220
you can choose that default tendency is basically shared if you want.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.730
Ah,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.920
or did he get it?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.680
Holds Jurgen,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.520
choose the tenancy.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.380
Asked the single tenant.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.170
Ah,

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.190
you can you conspiracy if I number off CPU core counts.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:26.850
Ah,

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.270
these all and you can specify EBS optimized.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.510
Um,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:39.880
you have many other inputs that you can give one other input that we want to give is

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.900
basically the key name because we have created one key and we're going to use that key name

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:44.900
.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.420
And also we're going to specify the security group for this.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:54.260
So let's choose the key name option here and in here.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.160
Let's go ahead and check out.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.390
Specify the key name.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.330
If I remember correctly,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:15.340
let's go ahead and go to our see to Let's go to the Keeper and select this.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.690
Keepers were just form course.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.550
Copy that Basted here.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.180
Now let's go back to our terra form documentation.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.290
Now,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.150
inside this,

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:32.270
we're going to say the list off security groups are Sicily did of it.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.080
Ah,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.890
before the PC,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.980
only a list of security group names are these All right,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.260
So we can say we want security groups because we're using the default here.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:54.810
And you can specify I am instant profile if you were If you are passing in the I am role

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.350
and there are many other things that you can specify year like EBS,

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.890
block devices and so on and so forth.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.210
So for now,

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.550
we're just going to say,

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.850
Ah,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.470
we're choosing all the defaults.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.590
So in security groups,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.170
it's a list off security groups because you can have multiple security groups assigned to a

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.090
specific instance.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.920
So I'm going toe specified as honorary,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.270
and inside this,

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:24.080
we're going to specify dollar and we're going to say,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.240
uh,

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.350
you're going to say a lovely A security group,

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:41.480
right dot This resource name it is easy to s G.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:47.430
And I think it is I d Let's go back and verify it.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.030
How?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.730
Ah,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.490
the security group is out putting its variable s.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.740
So I'm going to duplicate my documentation here,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.800
going back to the AWS security group.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.220
Now we have to check the data,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:00.880
right?

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.080
So because data sources,

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.340
we want to see how the security groups are putting the data.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.150
Now you can see Ah,

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.120
so if you see okay,

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.750
the idea of the specific group to retrieve.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.260
So that's what it is going toe output.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.970
So we can just say go here.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.640
I mean,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.440
go back here and say I d and that should be pretty much it.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:30.770
Now,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.400
if you go ahead and run your terra form script now,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.200
you should see one resource to add.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.200
Let's clear this out and run the terra form on.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.930
All right,

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:46.940
so there are no error,

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.370
saying it is basically telling us start it's launching an a C.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:55.010
Two instance with most off the deformed values and the values that we have specified.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.840
Let's go ahead and apply it so clear.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.160
Terra form apply.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:10.280
All right,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.170
so it's asking for a conformation.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:12.800
Just type.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.360
Yes.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.750
And once you typed,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.260
Yes.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:15.800
Oh,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.140
okay.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.050
So possible mismatch.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.810
Security group ID's and names.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.350
See aws Instance docks here.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.210
Ah,

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.970
value paramilitary group.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.150
The ideas in invalid.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.650
All right,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.140
Something is wrong here.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.630
Let's go back and check what's happening here.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:39.320
So you're saying security groups equal to ah,

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.160
we need to specify list off security groups that that's what we're saying here,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.160
let's go back and check.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.360
So secretary groups equal toe specifying list.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.390
Uh,

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:05.310
let's go back and double check this.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.450
We have to go here.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.770
Check for security groups.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:19.230
Okay.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.050
The associate security groups.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:30.840
All right,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.180
we have security groups.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.940
We have it open.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.890
Close.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.470
All right,

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.940
so maybe this is because it isn't already for particularly group.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:48.050
Let's check for VPC security group Pioli's and let's see how this works.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.710
All right,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.500
so let's go back indoors.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.490
Terra form,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.550
form Plan again.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.310
Uh,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.350
39.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.260
Okay,

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.000
I'm accidentally deleted this.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.430
Oh,

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.850
I think this is because the land tolerate.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.880
So let's save this.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.260
Go back here to terra form.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.170
Oh,

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.990
I Mr Double court here.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:29.550
Let's hear this terra form sign again.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.970
All right.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.450
Fleshing state,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.540
therefore apply.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.290
Hit.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.230
Select.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.910
Yes.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:59.590
All right.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.140
It is now creating the actually Aws instance.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.550
Ah,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.760
and once that is created,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.900
you should get back the instant society and let's see.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.840
All right,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.880
so you have won.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.650
The source added.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:15.820
Now,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.750
if we go back to our aws console,

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.950
you should see a new instance being launched.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.690
They go to instances.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.480
All right,

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.500
you can see that there are pharmacy to instance has been launched and its incidence i e it

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.770
has the teacher on micro that were specified it choose the random available disown us one b

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:39.080
and it has choosing the key name Terra form Dash course.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.630
If you would have specified user data,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.360
it would have front some bootstraps trips.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.520
But we haven't specified and it has applied the pharmacy to security group.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.320
And the reason why the previous ah attempt failed is because we we use the block off

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.260
security groups,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.660
which is basically the default one.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.860
We need to use VPC security group ideas because we have created a non default security

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:10.300
group in it if articulate in a default BBC so that's pretty much it.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.040
Ah,

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.730
you can see that now you have launched an easy two instance your also seen how to use the

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:24.840
variables properly and how toe kind off get hold off those off variables in a specific AWS

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.480
resources.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.450
So that's it for this lesson on.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.180
And ah,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.010
this is a really long listen and I really hope that you enjoyed it.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.210
And if you have any questions,

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.440
you can ping me in the course and I'll be happy to answer.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.670
And thank you so much for watching and I will see in the next one.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.540
Bye bye.
