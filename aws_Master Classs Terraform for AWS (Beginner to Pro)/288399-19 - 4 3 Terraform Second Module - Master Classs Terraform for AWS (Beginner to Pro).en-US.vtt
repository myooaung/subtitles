00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.280
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.240
we're going to continue off from our previous lesson where we have created our first terror

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.980
for module.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.850
And we have created an easy two instance using a model.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.430
Right.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.230
So in this in this lesson,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.250
what we're going to do is create ah,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.590
modify our existing telephone project and refine it more so that we can supply some input

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.370
variables to that particular model.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.480
And we can also separate out the security group out off that,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.460
um that easy to model so that we can have more control over what security groups gets

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.640
created and how we can pass in that security group variable that was created in a separate

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.790
model and input it as an input variable toe the PC to model.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.260
So let's go ahead and see how it is done.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up my project folder and I'm going to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.950
duplicate this project for her because I don't want to create in the same one.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.600
So I've duplicated it,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.010
and I'm calling it as part two,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.550
right,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.410
So inside this we had,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.860
um all this state files which we don't need,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.450
you don't need all this right.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.760
So now we have a clean ah,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.560
copy off our previous project.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.550
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to create other model,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.010
which is going to be my,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.350
um,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.240
security group model.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
Right.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.180
So this is our security group Mardell.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.050
And inside this we need another terra form file.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.660
So we're going to call it s g underscore Mardell dot t f All right.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.290
So again,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.780
I'm going back to my course trucked off course.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.000
Fuller and I am opening my,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.010
um,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.550
sublime edit.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.460
And inside this Now we're working in this,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.040
but to project ah,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.580
folder.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.560
So let me go ahead and clean up some off this model so that we have to separate models and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.980
we have to add an import statement for that model in the main Dottie a fight.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.600
Right?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.150
So the stuff that I want to separate this like,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.050
if you go to the easy to dot Martin issue to underscore model rtf,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.220
you can see that we have a resource called security group which ah which needs this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.100
dependency off vpc I d.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.670
Okay,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.990
so we can see that v p c i.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.230
D.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.230
Is an input to this particular resource which is security group.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.950
And also it is a input to our Ah Did they give input as V p c i t here?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.460
I was trying to see OK,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.250
so this guy doesn't need that 50 c i d.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.310
All right.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.890
So what we can do is we can separate this part out,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.830
right?

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.550
I'm do you cut from here and you can see that.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.600
Ah,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.580
this has been separated and we'll put that in the security group model and we can save it.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.060
Right?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.050
So we're not supplying any input.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.010
So this particular security group model,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.680
but we have to do with output.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.300
Ah,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.160
variable from this particular model.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.470
Right?

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.620
So the they you will do an output variable is basically you can say ah,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.260
like in your previous lessons.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.950
If we go and ah,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.250
you can just say output,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:21.060
you can call it Ah,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.150
security group.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:31.430
I d underscore output and you can say Ah,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.190
the value iss.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.390
Basically,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.200
you have to do dollar open close and you're getting the value from terra form.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.990
If you go to your east to model Lincoln.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.250
Get the value?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.160
Yes,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.650
this guy.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.010
Right.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:57.650
So this is the well you that we going to export.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.700
So basically,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.910
what we're doing is we were suffering toe referencing to this Arabia security group and

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.810
inside that we're giving referencing our module name.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.950
And if you're calling the I d from it,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.630
let's do it this way so that it is visible everything in the same line.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:33.380
So here what we have achieved so far is we have a security group module which takes which

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.490
doesn't take any input,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.070
but it's going to create the output variable.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.860
First,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.200
it's going to create a security group,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.960
and it's going to create an output variable.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.500
Now,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.750
we have created the security group in the previous ah example.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.770
So I'm just going to change the name so that we can say security group module creation.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.700
Right?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.350
And I'm going toe rename it here,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.450
and we are going to change the name here.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.750
So now we have our security group being created as SG module creation,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.060
and it is being output a nasty S G i d output.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.870
All right,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.810
so now what we have to do is go back to our main rtf and basically import the specific

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.180
model.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.940
Now we have to import this model before we import the easy to model.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.030
Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to create the security group in a separate

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.540
module,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.850
get the output off dart and supply that are put variable as an input variable to the easy

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.190
to model so that it knows what security group it has to attach to.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.860
Right?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.560
So we're going to import more do,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.250
and we're going to call it s G underscore module and will give the source,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.140
which is source equal do dot,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.610
slash SG underscore Mardi.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.510
Like.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.160
Okay,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.250
so now we have imported Ah,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.810
the,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.830
um the I mean,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:10.380
we have included this as Jim model as a as a dependency in this main dot TF.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.220
Now,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.180
once we do that,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.310
we can go ahead and reference this particular module and read all the output variables from

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.540
it.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.720
All right,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.990
so the way we'll read this particular,

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.640
um,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.320
output variable and supplied in tow.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:33.070
This guy is we have to create a variable first inside our model so that it knows that it

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.330
needs it is expecting an input.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.970
So the way you will do it is basically go to your easy to underscore modeled rtf here and

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.990
you'll create a variable,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.350
right,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.270
So you'll create a variable saying,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.490
SG I d.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.530
Okay,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.660
let's call it s g underscore Rieti,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.050
and you'll just give open and close.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.240
That means you don't have any default variables here,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.340
But your ah,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.530
this particular model expects this as an input.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.950
And you can What you can simply do is instead off.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.050
Um,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.350
using this,

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:13.950
we'll just call that dot SG underscored.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.100
All right.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.550
Right.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.860
So now you're saying I'm expecting this input,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.300
and I'm supplying that input.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.790
So this particular easy to instance And also,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.320
let's,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.490
um,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.790
change the name,

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.520
uh,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.580
and supplied as an in portrait.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.800
This is just to do more practice on imports,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.050
right?

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.760
You see,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.150
to underscore name.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.490
And these are the two variables that will be supplying.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.590
Then put us and we'll have to change the name here.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.750
Well,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:54.950
say dollar will say easy to wear dot GC to underscore name.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.950
All right,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.620
so this part is now complete.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.760
All you have to do is go to the main Dr Jeff and,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.320
uh,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.030
supply our input variables to this particular model.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.810
So the way you will do it,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:18.150
iss um um the variable names are SG underscore i d So you'll just say SG underscore idee

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.960
equal to now this is being output it from this model.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.850
So you have to do is under inside double quotes dollar open,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:33.220
close and inside This will say more dool dart and you'll reference the model that you are

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.190
importing it from.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:40.540
So model SJ underscore Model Dart and whatever the output name off that particular variable

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:40.880
list.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.900
So this is the output name.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.120
And,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.770
uh,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:51.210
we'll just have to do this so we have more your dot as the module and as the underscore

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.010
idea output.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.590
So that's the I.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.740
D.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.850
That's being created in the previous step.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:02.450
So and the other one that we have toe include it's the PC to name right?

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.520
So we'll copy that and paste it here,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:14.100
and we'll give it saying that Ah e c toe instance from marginals.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.870
Right.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.740
So this will be the name Ah,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.550
tag that will give you are easy to instance and let's go ahead and see whether this works

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.880
or not.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.220
So the thing that we have to do is go to our project.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.760
Ah,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.460
and open up terror farm the,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:32.730
uh,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.680
the partial,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.160
um,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.900
council there and go to the project folder,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.950
which is our part to project.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.780
You can see that you have to models there.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:53.820
Now you have to do is do terra form in it so that it includes two modules,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.200
which is your issue module and easy to model.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:02.050
And it's also going to install the provider plug ins of it is essential for this product.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:02.560
Okay,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.070
so the product has been successfully initialized.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.850
That's clear here and do a terror farm plan.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.100
Now we should against C to resource is being created Oneness,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.430
thesis,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.850
acuity group and the other is the easy to instance.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.960
And,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.670
um,

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.940
you can basically see ah oh,

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:28.150
that we're creating to Resource is here.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:37.890
Let's clear here and we do terra form apply and type in.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.470
Yes.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.960
Okay,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.650
so I'm going to pause here because it's going to take a few minutes for it to complete.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.350
Oh,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.970
so there's something wrong here.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.370
So we're saying Ah,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.830
easy to instance,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:01.680
Other launching instance Invalid keeper not found easy to instance from model does not

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.240
exist.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.870
Alright,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.200
so let's go back and check what?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.050
Ah,

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.740
and are we did here.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:13.110
So did I remove something wrong from here?

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.750
Oh,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.620
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.370
So I have I've changed the wrong variable here.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.920
So this is terra form.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.500
Courses are key name with just the ah,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.180
which is the keeper of that which will use to retrieve the passwords and,

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.030
um,

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.570
s ascension to the instance.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.020
So we have toe apply it here in the tag variable.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.270
Right.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.910
So we have to go and do.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.590
Oh,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.650
we have to call it war start E C to underscore name.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.120
Now,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.950
if I save it,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.050
clear this do terra form plan again.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:03.630
Now you can see that there is only one resource Toby created because we already have

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.070
created the ah security group in the previous step.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.000
So there is only one resource which is spending so it can weaken.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.290
Do terra form apply,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:19.450
and you can just do yes here.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.120
And you should see that the instance will be created.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.600
So I'm going to just pause it here.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.080
And once the instances created,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.160
I'm just going toe come back and show you in the council.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.210
All right,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.280
So are easy to instances now.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.860
created.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.590
Let's go back to our console and do it quickly fresh,

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.690
and you should be seeing a new instance being launched,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.440
which is easy to instance from model.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.450
Now we have supplied this as an input your model and we have created a new security group.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:58.710
It is ah which is basically SG underscore model creation.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.350
And if you click on this,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.550
you can see that all the rules that you have supplied here,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:13.010
our apply to this and that's pretty much it.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:18.900
Now you basically have learned how to create multiple modules and give inputs.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:25.100
So those models and how to output unspecific variable that from a specific model and

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.990
supplied as an input to other model.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.350
Now,

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:33.030
this is a really important concept because you can extend this particular concepto manage

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:39.190
very large infrastructure where you have so many components and they are all dependent on

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.660
each other and you don't want to write the same court again and again are hard court the

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:51.250
variable so that so that it is very hard for you to manage when you're updating any

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.580
specific competent off your infrastructure.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.560
So I'm going to stop this lesson here.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.400
I really hope that you guys learned a lot from this particular lesson.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.750
And in the next lesson,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:08.420
what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how doe reuse this particular model in the

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.380
same project and create multiple Ah,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.500
easy to instance,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.030
by calling the same model with different inputs,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.750
like giving it different names.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.060
Right.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.360
So let's go ahead.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.910
And,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.580
um,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.360
close this lesson now,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.260
and I'm going to see you in the next one.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.500
Thank you so much for watching.
