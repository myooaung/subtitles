00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.170
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag learning courses.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.190
In this lesson,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.130
we're going toe do our first part off the project where we're going to first set up the

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.150
fuller structure for our project and the base mortals that we needed.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.560
And you're going to create our security groups.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.300
And also we're going to set up our first workspace.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.840
We're just going to be our staging environment.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.320
So let's get started.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.050
So the first thing that I want to do is go to my course folder and create another project

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.310
here.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.560
Right?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.500
So I'm going to name that project as AWS going to call it a double yes course project.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.170
Right?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.020
And inside this I want a main doctor TF Terra form fight.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.940
Now,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.640
like we have seen in the previous lessons,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.430
this is going to be our main terra form fight.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.860
Right?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.910
So once this has created,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.770
then I want to create a module called ah Shared wars.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.610
And this is just like what we have used in the previous section.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.410
So I'm going to create shared underscore Let's use Dash's revue stash,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.780
or did we use Ah,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.160
um under underscore in the workspace project shared underscore war.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.180
So we're gonna use the same thing here just to be consistent with what we've done so far.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.790
So shared underscore wars and inside the shared underscore wars we're going to create on

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.710
the telephone file,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.130
which is going to be shared.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.570
Underscore wars dot Now the shared underscore uars will hold the variables like the regions

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.130
or submit i ds or the VPC i d and A my i d and so on and so forth.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.580
So we'll just create a shared wars here.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.670
So the next thing that we want to create is basically a networking model trite.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.970
So inside the networking,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.270
Marty,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.830
let's go ahead and create the security groups that are required for this particular for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.780
this particular project.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.450
So I'm just going to call it network underscore Mardell.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.560
Inside this,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.050
we're going to create another terra form file,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.600
which I'm going to call it network underscore Margie,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.750
right?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.870
How the extension should be not DF.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.350
And so the next thing that we are going to create here is basically a Ah,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.310
Okay,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.310
So let's create the other models when we get to that point.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.440
So for now,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.440
I think we should be good enough because we have the share of ours and we have the network

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.870
model,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.110
and we can actually get started.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.920
So I'm just gonna open up this particular folder inside the sublime text.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.490
So let me pull this up here.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.680
File open,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.350
not file.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.350
We won't open the project.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.880
Ford er,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.700
opening this project.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.770
Okay,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.470
so now,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.920
dark,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.050
this is open.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.900
Now,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.400
what we're going to do is inside our main dot Theophile We're going to basically create a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.090
provider.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.330
So the provider,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.480
how do you provide it?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.130
Basically,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.630
you call it provider,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.740
and you open close this place,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.010
and you're going to say the,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.380
um you have to give the provider name with this AWS,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.240
and I'm just going to use the same profiling that I've used so far,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.950
so I'm going to give a profile equal toe.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.450
It's rotten dash terra form course,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.590
And I'm going toe.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.950
Specify the region as,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.080
um I think it is us west toe a.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.790
But let me just double check real quick.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.190
The region that we're working is Ohio,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.950
so we'll have to quickly recheck,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.150
uh,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.110
we checked the region.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.300
So it's us East.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:29.070
Dash us east to Holly.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.150
So that's going to be our region for this particular project.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.700
All right,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.680
so now that we have supplied the project Ah,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.050
I mean,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.310
the AWS provider profile and region.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.790
Let's go ahead and keen Some shared bar so that we can use for this particular product.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.690
So the first thing that we want is ah,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.080
the V p c i d.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.470
So to do that,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.720
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up the local variables here,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.180
right?

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.950
So like we have seen in the previous example So we're gonna call it locals and we'll have

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.140
environment variable as Terra formed art work space.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.630
Right.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.120
So that's what we're going to fetch from the workspaces.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.310
And here we're going to say vpc Ah vpc I d underscore environment equal to,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.410
uh,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.950
this is going to be a map.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.830
Right?

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.490
So inside this map,

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:35.900
we're going to have ah default equal toe something staging equal to something and we have

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.740
production equal to something,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.390
right?

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.120
So let's fill in those values from are easy to console now.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.650
Like I said,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.650
every default environment will have.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.390
Ah,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.200
I mean,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.830
every default vpc would have been already created in every AWS region only after do it's

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.480
like goto services and VPC section and under three pieces.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.350
You should see your default VPC which is created for you now what I'm going to do,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.460
it's like I'm just going toe copy this week P c I d.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:19.130
And I am going toe based it here now for the purpose off this project we're going toe host

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.330
are staging and production environment in in the same BBC.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.990
In your case,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.750
it might be different because usually they separated out.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.040
But I don't want a war complicate by creating all the network competent here.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.900
And it was really not the scope of this particular project.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.180
So I'm just going to leave it aside.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.950
So we have this local environment and the next thing that we have to do is we have toe,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.380
have a look up function declared.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.650
So this is going to be the look up.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.190
So the look up is goingto be basically under double courts.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:02.580
We have toe open up this and we have to do look up in inside this we have to specify local

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.590
dot vpc i d underscore environment.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.460
And inside this Oh,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.250
there shouldn't be any uh,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.530
equals So they're so local dot vpc i the environment and we want to find the local that

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.140
environment and map it to him.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.980
So that's one thing.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.940
And we want to also ill put this variable as output.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.400
We want our output.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.220
This has vpc i d right.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.070
And we want to give the value equal to ah,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.860
double coats.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.600
Give this ass three pc local dot vpc idea.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.370
All right,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.600
so we have our first environment.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.940
I mean,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.800
first local variable created here.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.980
Similarly,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.960
we need to create Ah,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.340
the sub net submit ID's right.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.070
So you want to choose the sub net?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:33.630
Holy.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:41.450
So here we need public sub net.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:48.690
Let's call it the BMC Public sub Net I d.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.270
And let's give the same thing here.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.760
This is going to be public summit I d.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.040
And this is going to be public.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.810
Some notoriety.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.210
And here we have toe get the public submit.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.490
I t.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:02.770
So,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.770
basically what I'm going to do is like by default.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.290
There are three subjects are created.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.460
I'm just gonna choose,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.770
like,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.670
ah nb as my public submit and the private submarine,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.730
so I'm just gonna call copied this.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.190
I D,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:26.750
which is to a Toby the public's of net and so copied this guy,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.750
this two tier street Here,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.900
save it.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.830
And I'm gonna call this as private sub Net I d.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:45.750
And I'm going to use the disputable here,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.350
here and here.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.450
Right.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.620
Okay,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.150
so we have to copy the sub net to Toby.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.570
I d.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.450
From here,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:09.640
and I'm going to paste it here year and here all it.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.650
So now we have ah BBC i d public submit idea in private subject i t.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.960
And the next thing that we would probably need is ah,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.100
let me think about it.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.540
So we have vpc we have public some night.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.980
We have private some night I d And what else do we need for the security group?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.450
Ah,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.700
I think that's pretty much it.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.640
So what we're going to do now is go to our network module,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.320
right?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.270
And we have to create two security groups oneness for Public Security group and another

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.670
restive private security groups.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.080
So what we're going to do is now,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.850
ah,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.760
go to our previous project and I'm going to copy paste the security group model that we

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.450
have created in the previous part,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:02.940
and I am going to copy this here based it,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.660
and I'm going to replicate it,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.020
right?

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.470
So we have No,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:14.840
it'll be a security group being created and we have the the name should basically I mean,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.790
this is the reference name,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.440
so we're going to give it public SG,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.980
and we're going to call this five.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.120
It s G and,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.470
uh,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.340
ingress.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.490
We're going to say from port,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.250
we just accept traffic on port 80.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.340
We're gonna try.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:36.950
Ah,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.850
except the traffic.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.240
Ah,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.270
yeah.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.160
TCP port.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.390
Right.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:45.650
So,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.700
TC people 80 and we want toe.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.410
This is basically Public Security Group,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.050
so it's gonna take in from everywhere,

00:11:53.050 --> 00:12:00.830
and egress is basically again for 84 80 and TCP toe everywhere.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:11.150
So this is going to be our public security group and waken give the name ass,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.850
uh,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:19.440
public s g o.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.760
We have toe into our environment.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.800
The sharing of are smart,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.470
you'll hear first.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.790
So the way you'll do its module shared ah,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.590
underscore wars.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.990
And inside this,

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.070
you're going to give source equal,

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.770
too dark,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.490
slash,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.330
dot,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:36.530
dot,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.040
Slash Because you have to go one step about ah and fetch the shared underscore bars from

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.450
here,

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.050
and you can actually get the ah,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:13:00.070
you can actually get the That's also output the oh,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.290
in the oh,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.220
In the previous step,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.190
we forgot to output the public and private SG.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.860
Uh,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.900
well,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.500
use not the STS.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.150
I'm in the sub net while you're so we're gonna go give it,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.190
um,

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.770
public sub net.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.260
I need.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:27.480
And we can give here that this is going to be a private sub net.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.350
I d.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:34.340
Okay.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:40.670
And we want I'll put the environment variable to right so we can call it,

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.550
uh,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.750
environment suffix.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.150
And we can call it local dot environment.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.570
Right.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.990
So we have all these things being output from here.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.590
Now,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:05.590
let me go to my ING network module and here I should be able to get model share,

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.460
wars and environment suffix.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:07.700
Right.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.470
So that would be created here.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.810
Description is public security group for load balancers.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.350
All right,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.960
in,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.530
uh,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.450
we can give the environment suffix again.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:20.920
Here,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.960
we can call p this guy,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.270
and I'm going to paste it in here.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:33.670
You can take Public Ministry for l B.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.930
All right,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.400
so the vpc idea.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.630
Right?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.540
So we have to get the VPC idea again from the shared wars.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.160
So again,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.210
I'm going to copy this particular part,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.990
which is more The Lord share worse.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:52.050
And the BBC I d Let me just quickly check from shared wards of this week.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.700
P c i d.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.390
So,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:53.590
Yeah,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.150
so it's going to fetch it from there,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.320
and this should be now created a public issue.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.220
So enough for private SG.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.710
What we want to do is we want to accept the traffic from just this security group.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:16.160
So egress would be outside to everyone on port 80 port 80 TCP to everyone and egress.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.810
Port 80 80 and the,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.390
uh,

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.970
instead off cider blocks.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.600
I think this will be security.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.880
Uh,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.660
groups,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.040
security group.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.050
Let me quickly double check in the telephone documentation.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:54.260
What the uh what the So being open up the from ill.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.420
Let's look at the darks.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:10.950
Go to the providers terribly us and look for the security groups security group and we have

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:15.980
toe search for P C.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.080
I.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.330
D.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:22.250
Name value on this is the data sources we want.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:39.750
So you want this hate earliest security group rule and inside that we want to be resource

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.560
security group.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:48.360
Yep.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:58.410
So you want copied this security group I D And we want to congrats from there.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.650
So here we will supply saying that.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.850
Ah dollars.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:15.090
So dollar aws security underscored,

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:23.110
group dot This is going to be public s chief dot idea.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.090
Now,

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.560
let me explain you what I did here.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.400
So basically,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.620
what we're doing is for private SD that which is going to be attached to the load balancer

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:31.620
.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.930
What we're going to do is we're going toe,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.680
create the security.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.950
Uh,

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.420
we want to just allow the traffic,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.400
which is coming from the public.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.240
Esteve it is going to be our load balancer,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.530
and we want toe all Put it for everyone else.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.430
So this is just like a security measure.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.230
And,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.750
um,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.600
the name would be again.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:56.660
I'm just copying this part so that you can easily replace this part.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.790
So I'm going to call it Private SG.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.300
This is going to prive.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.660
It s G for E c two and this is going to be the same,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.950
uh,

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.080
resource here.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:21.130
So I think we are pretty much in good shape with the security groups part long.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:26.530
Let's go ahead and execute this right so to do that First meaning to include this module

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.230
inside our main rtf.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.100
To do that,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.110
what we have to do is more do,

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:36.500
um we want to include network 100 score model,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.540
and inside that we're going to give the source equal to dot,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.500
slash network underscore more like.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.700
So now we have everything being set here.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.920
The next thing that we have to do is open up our power shell.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.950
Ah,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.850
let me open it up.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:09.870
So all it's over here on the scores directory.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.490
We need to go to Seedy AWS Fraud.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.070
Yes.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.300
Project that what we call eight of yes,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.940
course project.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.330
All right,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.350
so I'm gonna clear from here.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.890
So the first thing that we want to do it's like she did the terra form workspace.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.110
Right?

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.820
So I'm going to do terra form workspace new.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.390
I'm gonna call it staging.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.200
Right.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.680
And I am going to create their form workspace.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.390
Ah,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.020
no,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.950
I'm just gonna do a telephone in it.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.450
It's going to initialize.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.080
All the models that are that are included here,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.110
and it's going to dull,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.420
nor the AWS plug in,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.310
which is required for this particular project.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.800
Okay,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.660
so another data form is initialized.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.980
All we have to do is do telephone plan.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.310
Now,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.560
you should see that the two resource is being created.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.560
Ah,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.600
Private SG Invalid known key security group.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.220
Underscore Idee.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.640
All right,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.570
so let's go back and fix that particular piece.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.480
So this is going to be ah,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.650
in the network model.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.550
I think we did something wrong here.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.270
Security group I d.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.860
Right.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.110
So lets me go back to the documentation here.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:38.790
A security group I d toe allow our access from on the type cannot be specified.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.660
Okay.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.990
Source.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.330
Security group idea.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:42.760
Right.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:52.550
So when we see if there's an example here So what is this kitty group rule?

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.000
Oh,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.440
we're not getting security group.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.390
We didn't security group rule here.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.720
No,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.130
this is just a security group,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.810
so I think we copied from the wrong direction.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.660
Wrong place.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.590
Okay,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.760
this security group,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.590
this is the data source.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:27.520
So we have to select this guy and inside this ah,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.990
cider rocks prefixed list.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:38.180
ID's should also have protocol security groups.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:38.500
Right.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.840
So this should be inside the list.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.060
My bad.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.420
Sorry,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:42.890
guys.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:50.380
So this should be a a day off security groups that you can allow right?

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.430
And now let's go back and do the Terra form fine again.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.240
Hopefully there shouldn't be any enters.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.170
All right,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.550
so we're now creating two security groups.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.370
And let's go ahead and do terra form.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:09.530
Apply and type in.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:09.980
Yes,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:17.330
all right.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.740
So now our security groups are created in our sick staging environment.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.520
Let's go back to our AWS console and just verify that if our security groups appear here or

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:27.750
not,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:35.970
so I can go to the easy toe service and under the under the network and security issued.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.390
See security groups like that.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:42.510
And you should see that we have created a private security groups staging and public

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.580
Security group stating,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:50.480
and you should see that the public security group has rules 80 inbound and 80 our bond,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.620
and we have the private staging private security groups staging with this,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.170
just taking the inbound connections from this public security group staging and it's going

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.640
toe allow all the traffic out born from this particular instance.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.230
So I think we have covered a lot of ground in this particular project.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.010
Um,

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.060
we have completed our network model now,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.710
as and when we the required more information.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.240
We'll be adding to this project in the next lesson.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.730
So that's it for this lesson.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.620
In the next lesson,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.900
we'll go ahead and work on creation off the load balancer and target groups.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.080
So I will see you there.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.960
Thank you for watching.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.290
Now,

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.340
if you have any questions,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:35.090
you can always send a message to me on the course.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.850
And I will be happy to answer all those questions.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.400
Now I'll see in the next one.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.870
Thanks.
