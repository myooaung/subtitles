00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.500
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.160
we're going to give you a quick introduction off what we're going to cover in this

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.110
particular section.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.190
So in the previous section,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.080
we have covered the basics off uniform like terra form variables,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.140
inputs and outputs.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.850
And in this in this section,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.590
we're going toe cover the basic AWS confidence that you will be creating using the Terra

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.950
form.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.740
Now,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.650
here are some of the competence that you'll be creating.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.890
So the first we're going to start off by creating an extra bucket and we'll upload the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.430
files.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.090
And during this process,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.930
we'll also see how to use terra form destroy toe.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.640
Actually,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.600
delete the resources that you have created followed by you'll create a new ah,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.770
easy to instance,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.250
we'll also look in tow,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.980
how to create application load balancers and target groups.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.110
And we'll also see an example from Cloudwatch and will treat an S and S topic in this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.900
particular section.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.820
You'll also experience,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.150
like,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.820
how to use variables in this how to use input.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.210
And I'm going to cover our all the basic stuff that I've,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.150
uh,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.250
that I start in the previous section.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310
It will be using all those things in this particular section.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.110
So I'm really excited to start this particular section.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.830
Let's go ahead and start with the creating office to Bucket and I will see in the next one

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.830
.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.050
Thank you so much for watching.
