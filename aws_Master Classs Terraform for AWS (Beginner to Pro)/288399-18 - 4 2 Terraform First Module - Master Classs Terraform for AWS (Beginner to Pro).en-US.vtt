00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.540
In the previous lesson,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.240
we have briefly discussed what terra form modules are and why it is important for us to use

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.350
that,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.690
therefore,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.330
models in this lesson,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.250
let's go ahead and actually create our first era for model.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.400
And let's go ahead and see how to import,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.660
especially model and run out of form script.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.310
Now,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.210
before we go ahead and create a project,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.800
I just want toe give you a quick walk through off like what the documentation looks like,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.820
and then we'll go ahead and create our project so you can basically go toe telephone dot io

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.270
site,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.430
and you can go to the dark section and to the left hand side.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.060
You should see the models part here,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.190
and ah,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.870
you can basically go ahead and read more if you would want more information and you can see

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.570
the sources different sources where you can store your more jewels and then reimport them

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.770
again in your different uniform projects,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.070
you can have registries and so on and so forth.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
You can read more about it if you if you are really interested in how to do the model

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.750
center on.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.980
So let's go back and create our first model.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.030
Now,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.900
the object off this module would be basically first off will create a model,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.240
and in that model,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.450
we're going toe create a easy to instance.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.130
Now,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.050
in our previous section,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.460
we have created an easy to instant using the terra form.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.210
Now,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.780
in this lesson,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.330
what we're going to do is we're going to do the same.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.100
Um,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.280
creation off,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.200
easy to instance,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.760
but instead off writing everything in the same main doctor,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.890
Theophile we're going to create a model to create that easy to instance,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.260
and we're going to import that model in our main dark TF and,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.850
uh,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.860
recreate this same easy to instance.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.020
So to do that,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.520
let's go ahead and get started.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.420
So the first thing that we have to do is we have to create our Project folder.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.940
I'm going to use the same directory where I've been working for the previous lessons.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.860
Some create.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.350
I'll create a new folder here,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.000
and I'll call it easy to modules module Ah,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.670
project.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.050
Right.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.910
So inside this,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.670
we have to create a new a terror farm files,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.490
which is going to be our main dot TF instead off txt.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.060
Okay,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.520
so now what I'm going to do is basically,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.110
um,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.540
to create a model.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.930
Right?

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.790
So the module is another terror from project.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.050
It could be within the same project that you're working,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.430
or it could be anywhere else to like we have seen in the documentation,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.940
you can clearly see that different sources are local parts transform terra form registry,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.900
Get her but bucket or http Urals wherever that special more the Alexis.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.280
So in our case,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.740
what we're going to do is create the module in the local directory and within the same

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.280
project.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create a new Ford er right inside this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.600
.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.700
What I'm going to do is e C two underscore more.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.760
Let's keep it simple.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.460
Now,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.300
inside this easy to underscore model,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.130
I'm going to create another file,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.060
which is going to be easy to underscore.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.350
More dool dot TF.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.720
Right.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.840
Okay,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.150
So now our project directory is all set up and ready.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.080
I'm going to just go ahead and open this folder inside the,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.020
um sublime.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.650
Hit it.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.880
Oh,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.900
I think we already have it open,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.350
but let me just be sure about it,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.100
okay?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.150
Open folder.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.130
We don't open this Ford er,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.020
open it.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.540
Right.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.450
So this is the project that we're working on right now,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.850
and Ah,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.350
the first thing what we have to do is basically go ahead and create our provider.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.890
Now,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.190
how do we create a provider?

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.580
We have done so many times the previous lesson.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.450
So I'm just going to copy this provider part from our previous project and basting it here

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.450
.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:41.690
So let's go ahead and initialize are initialize our telephone projects.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.130
Um,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.250
need this part.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.620
So now I'm in the course directory.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.550
I'm going to go into the seed EEC too.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.310
Model project.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.820
Right.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.560
So these are the contents that we have.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.950
It's clear out of fear and do it on our farm in it.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.120
When we do the terra form in it,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.870
it actually creates the I mean,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.180
don't know.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.790
It's all the plug in start are required,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.070
and once a plug ins are downloaded and ready to be used,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.690
it gives us the success for message so we can just clear out from here and let's go ahead

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.880
and write our court,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.950
which is required in our model.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.920
So the goal is toe recreate the C two instance.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.490
So I'm going to go back to my easy to terra form project and from maine dot TF.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.610
I'm just going to grab everything from this cord,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.420
right?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.950
I'm just I just left the provider and have copied everything that is their required for the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.390
creation.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.570
Off are easy to instance,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.130
and I'm going to go back to my issue two model project.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.940
Right inside This you'll go too easy to underscore module and easy to underscore model

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.260
Doctor A farm here.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.250
I'm just going to paste everything right.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:04.470
So now if you know this already had waas separated our cord from our main rtf and put into

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.720
a separate module file Right now,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.680
the next thing that you're going to do is go to maine dot TF and you have to import this

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.520
particular model.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.670
Now how do you import this model?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.880
It's really simple.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.270
All you have to do est right more do and you have to give that module a reference name,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.570
right?

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.180
You have to give it a reference name as more do right.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.650
And you're calling it ass Ah,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.620
and you have to give it a source.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.020
No source equal to now as it is in the same folder directly.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.650
You can just say dot slash EEC to underscore model.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.500
Right.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.910
So you're in the same directory and you have included this.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.160
Now.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.770
Now,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.360
if you go ahead and run Terra form plan now,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.690
this command is going to fail because now you have added a module and you have not

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.520
initialized it,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.240
right?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.720
So whenever you add a specific model toe your terra form project,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.560
you should always do it on our farm in it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.480
So to do that,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.900
I'm going to run there for a minute.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.560
And now it is going to import that particular model.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.750
You can see that it is getting the source from start slash easy to module and it has

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.680
applied toe a particular project.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.220
Now,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.190
if I clear out from here and do terra form plan now,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:31.290
it's going to tell me that we will be creating a ah to resource is oneness basically the

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.580
security group and the easy to instance,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.870
right,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.250
The security group and the easy to instance.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.860
Now let's go ahead and run this farm,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.100
apply all right.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.150
So when I do a telephone apply,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.340
it's going to asked me for the confirmation.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.570
I just say yes.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.220
And once I type in,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.710
yes,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.040
it's going to create.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.150
Ah,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.210
All right.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.000
So the problem here is basically in the previous example,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.580
as we have created this easy to underscore SG security group there for Mr Two SD security

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:08.940
group.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.110
We cannot recreate the same resource because it is it is already existing there.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.060
I haven't deleted it.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.610
So what we can do is go back here and,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.360
uh,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.670
give another name saying s g underscore model.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.170
Right?

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.790
So it makes sense to give it a module.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.900
And then what?

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.150
We're going to do this terror farm plan?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.350
Uh,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.090
okay,

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.800
let me go ahead and fixed us.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.950
So we have to give the same name here.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.350
Right?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.260
So we This is our reference name.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.840
And this is the resource name,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.280
and we're calling this in the easy to section here,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.290
so we'll have toe ah,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.210
replaced this name here and then save it.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.970
All right,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.210
So now if I go back and do terra form plan Okay.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.850
So we have to re sources that we're creating terra form.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:15.360
Apply and we're going to say yes.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.470
Okay,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.960
so our security group is now being created,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:30.550
and we can see that we have our new easy to instance also being created in just a bit.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.730
So he said to instances being created,

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.210
this might take a couple of minutes.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.880
I'm gonna pass it here and they come back.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.790
Want to this ready?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.360
And I'll show you are in the AWS council.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.030
All right,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.470
here we go.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.310
So are easy to instance,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.980
has must have been created.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.200
Now,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.490
let me go back to my earliest council,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.480
and let's verify if that new easy to instance has been created or not.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.440
All right,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.310
so you can see that the new easy to instance has been created,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.010
which is being launched here.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.760
And ah,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.610
I think I haven't destroyed my previous instance.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.390
I'm just going toe the old one.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.450
This is the new one that you have created.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.590
Ah,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.890
and yeah.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.790
So basically,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.510
this is how you can use and create a model,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.320
and,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.050
um,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.170
in the next lessons were goingto go ahead and experiment more on,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.390
like,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.300
how Toe give imports.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.540
And how can you have multiple modules?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.200
And how can you import the same models over and over again.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.940
So that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.190
And I am going to see you in the next one.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.160
Thank you for watching.
