00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.070
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.910
we're going to do a quick recap off what we have covered in this particular section.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.140
So in the section off terra form course,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.690
we have covered a lot of ground on advanced topics.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.750
We have started with ah,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.920
looking at like what more jewels are.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.940
And then we have created our first module and we have then created multiple more jewels.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.960
And then we had seen how to provide inputs to the models and how toe share the values that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.000
are created in one module and exported toe.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.840
Ah,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.750
the person who is calling I'm in the their form script which is calling it and passing that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.260
information along into another model to kind off create the dependencies.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.470
And after that,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.890
we have covered what works basis are how you can create different environments using the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.060
workspace concept.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.100
And also we have covered a lot of ground on how you can create environment specific local

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.610
variables and how you can create a shared variables concept and so on and so forth.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.350
I really hope that you enjoyed ah,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.910
this particular section because most off this is all,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.590
um it's not covered in in the actual there from documentation,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.370
and I cannot figure out a lot of these topics by kind of trial and error.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.310
Wei and I really enjoy sharing this information with you all because I'm really excited

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.410
that you'll be using this in your workloads.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.000
And,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.540
uh,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.370
let me know if you have any questions related toe these particular section and I'll be

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.440
ableto answer them through the course of So that's pretty much it for this particular

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.680
section in the next,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.020
Less in the next section we're going toe Ah ah Create the whole production in production

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.230
level infrastructure using terra form,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.970
I'm going to show you step by step,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.670
how to create,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.120
like we're going to create the network.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.880
We're going to create the to tear our texture,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.790
and I will give you more details in the next sections introduction part.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.790
So that's it for this lesson.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.310
And thank you so much for watching and I will see in the next one.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.050
