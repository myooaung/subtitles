00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.650
Hello and welcome to hashtag learning courses.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.030
My name is Sai and this is the telephone masterclass for AWS Beginner to pro Now,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.550
first of all,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.360
I want to thank you all for taking your time toe.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.830
Check this course out and I want to begin by giving a brief introduction about myself.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.740
And then I will go on and walk you through what this course offers and what you'll get by

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.750
the end of this course.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.420
Now I like I said,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.240
I'm science and I'm a cloud solutions architect.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.270
And I've bean are detecting in the cloud for a long time now.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.020
And I am an AWS certified professional and I hold all the 58 of your certifications.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.090
And,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.790
um,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.540
let's begin by discussing about water for Mrs and why you need toe learn terra form as a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.610
cloud practitioner.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.180
Right?

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.130
So terra form is one off the very critical skills because it is a platform for you to off

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.770
right your infrastructure as code and easily manage.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.270
And one main important advantage off the reform is that it is cross platform and you can

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.010
have several cloud providers integrated into your single code,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.680
meaning if you have multiple workloads which are provisioned and multiple cloud providers.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.020
Then terra form is one way for you to unified them all and bring it in 100 1 particular

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990
script or one particular project.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.450
And you can save them all in in your source control and use it to manage your

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.270
infrastructure.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.190
Now,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.820
why should you take this course?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.830
Because I have put in a lot off information in this course which I have gathered in my

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.700
journey off cloud architect ing.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.950
And I thought you all the skills that are really important and some of them you even might

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.960
have not found it in the in the Internet by searching it because I've found few days off

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.740
using things in terra form which are really useful when you're having multi environment

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.820
workloads.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.910
So I've put in all those information in this.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.470
Now,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.460
let me give you a brief introduction off like what this course curriculum would look like.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.120
So we'll start off by giving a basic introduction off what terra form is.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.330
I'm going to walk you through how to install terra form,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.150
how toe,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.550
uh,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.980
create your project structure.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.520
And like what other different components that go along when you create a telephone project

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.520
.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.970
Once we go through that,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.980
then we go ahead and create some of the basic things like variables and inputs and outputs

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.980
.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.980
Once we finished that part,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.760
we'll go ahead and provisions some off.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.970
The AWS resource is right.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.610
So we experimented with s tree and easy to And once we get hold off how you work with the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.160
AWS provider and how you can create some of the resources,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.240
we'll go ahead and learn the some off the advanced topics off the telephone.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.080
Like more jewels and workspaces.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.940
I will show you their how toe create variables which are specific toe environment across

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.650
different work spaces.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.380
And I will also teach you how to use shared variables concept across multiple models that

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.170
you can leverage in your infrastructure.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.050
Then,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.670
um,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.090
once we cover all those basic advanced topics in there,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.010
I will go ahead and teach you how to create a two tier application in AWS,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.510
and that would be a complete project off creating multiple environments creating,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.400
um,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.850
security groups.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.180
Launch configurations are scaling group lord balance or center on and so forth it is have

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.370
have covered most of the stuff in a hands on way.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.790
So if you guys follow along with me,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.480
when When I'm when I'm going through different parts off the course,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.170
you really benefit from practicing it along with me and this this particular knowledge off

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.320
terra form and how to do things in the cloud will really take your career to the next level

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.320
.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.030
Because in every interviewer in every company that you go,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.650
the first thing they check if you are a cloud practitioner is like how you're managing your

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.760
infrastructure as a cold.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.370
And when you say that you know,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.990
telephone,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.580
then you really have edge in getting that job.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.460
Are If you're already in a cloud practicing job than it,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.080
it will really take your carrier to a next level because it will really help you.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.260
How help you to manage your infrastructure in l very,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.660
very efficient way than just going ahead and provisioning things manually.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.440
So I'm really looking forward for you tojoin my course,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.950
and I will,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.820
um,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.560
I will be here to help you out with any questions that you might have.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.260
And I really do think that you will not face your money your time by going through this

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.690
course.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.880
So I'm really hoping that you'll continue and come along and join the course.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.380
And I will see you there.
