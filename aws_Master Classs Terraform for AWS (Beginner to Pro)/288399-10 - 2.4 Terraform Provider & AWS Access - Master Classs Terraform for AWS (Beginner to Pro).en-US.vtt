00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson with ah hashtag landing courses.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.290
And in this lesson,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.870
we're going to cover ah,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.670
different ways to give access to terra form to go ahead and,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.330
um,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.920
access.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.800
The AWS resource is using your credentials.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.930
So let's get started.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.590
So the first thing that we're going to do is like,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
we'll go back to our first hello world,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.050
ah dot Theophile that we've created in our previous lesson.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.800
And,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.380
uh,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.260
let me just clarify one thing if if you were having any questions in your previous,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.880
um example And if you're,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.120
like,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.590
kind of or burn don't worry at all about it because we are going toe do so many examples

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.480
that you clearly understand by what I mean with terra form state files and,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.940
like water,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.900
the different comments.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.760
You'll just get used to it once you see like ah,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.420
sufficient number off examples.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.160
All right,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.760
so let's get back to this.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.150
So how are you going to give access to your AWS console to your telephone fight?

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210
So first you need to specify that.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.720
Okay,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.180
I'm going to use AWS as my provider,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.600
right?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.180
I mean,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.590
like I mentioned in the introduction classes.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.200
That terra form is a multi cloud of compatible infrastructure.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.550
As a court to meaning like you can,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.390
you can create resources or you can manage infrastructure in many clouds.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.270
Like it could be a sure it could be AWS.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.900
Or it could be any other provider which which terra form support.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.940
So the first thing that you need to do is basically still terra form that Okay,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.240
I am going to be using the AWS as my provider.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.190
So how do we specify that?

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.400
Let's check it out.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.690
So first thing you need to do,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.400
it's like open up your hello world rtf.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:19.270
I'm going to open it up with my sublime Let me bring up my sublime and I'm going to open up

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.950
this particular file here.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.240
All right,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.770
so in my Terra form file,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.220
what we need to do is basically we need to select our provider,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.680
right?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.470
So the provider you're going toe specify it by saying,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.840
Okay,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.280
I need a provider and you need to open this calibration close curly brace.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.570
And ah,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.690
you need to specify here aws because AWS is my provider,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.390
right?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.260
So provider provide a name which in court and then you're just going toe.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.080
Save it here.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.250
Now this provider would take inputs like access,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.590
key,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.780
secret access key or a profile name or region.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.780
Whatever the properties that you supplied,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.620
when you're setting up your AWS providing your see like lesson,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.260
those are the some of the properties that this is going to take.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.490
But for now,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.270
what we're going to do is we're just going to save this as it is just saying that.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.760
Okay,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.780
I'm going to use AWS provider and let's see what happens if we run Ah,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.640
uniform.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.840
If you run the terra form plant on,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.010
I mean terra form in it because we're adding a new provider.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.850
We have to re initialize it because it needs to add the provider details.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.720
Let's see what it's going to do.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.090
So we're going to do terra form in it,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.690
right?

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.950
So first thing it did was it checked?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.880
Okay,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.010
this is a provider that he's going to use,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.350
and what it is saying is it's downloading the plug ins for that provider.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.520
So this plug in will have all the information off,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.200
like how the AWS is going to interact with this particular terra form file.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.140
It is going toe like use.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.350
This plug into kind of creative resource is like issue commands to a rate of your system.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.200
All right,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.740
so you can see that we have downloaded our provider plug in,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.350
which is AWS and it this off version 1.39 Now,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.520
telephone has active contribution contributors and get up.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.840
And,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.050
like,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.950
there are there.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.160
They're solving issues and box every single day.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.820
And they're like and they keep on updating the versions here,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.670
which is a good thing,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.740
because the more the contributors,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.250
the more the issues get solved.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.880
Right,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.370
So coming back to this.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.680
Okay,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.310
so now we have the AWS Ah,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.120
provider.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.760
Um,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.710
what do you call this?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.700
Blufgan is installed for this particular ah telephone file.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.950
Now,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.220
if you go back to your folder,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.760
you can see there is dot terra farm for low created,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.680
and within this,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.690
you can see that.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.190
Okay,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.430
I am using this particular ah telephone provider.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.510
And this it is going to use this particular executable toe.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.790
Execute the comments coming back to here.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.460
Now,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.250
let's open up the Terra form file uniform website itself,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.260
and I want to just quickly show you how the documentation looks like and how you can help

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.450
yourself by going into the guides or the documentations to figure out stuff.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.340
Now we have created the provider block,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.720
and we want to see what properties this particular provider will be able to take.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.330
Now,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.560
if you if you want to check that,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.210
you have to go here and then go to Doc's and you can see providers.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.090
And like I said,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.310
terra form is a multi cloud thing.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.520
You can see that there are so many providers that terra form support now the one which

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.870
we're interested in is basically AWS.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.030
Now,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.910
if you go here,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.410
you can see that these are the properties that it is going to stake in,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.980
and this is an example off it.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.880
So provider AWS and it's going to take access,

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.100
key,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.770
Secret Access,

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.560
key region and,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.150
um,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.830
you can create resources like Aws instance Web.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.620
We're going to come back to this particular part later,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.320
but all we're interested in this seeing how we can supply our credit chills.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.970
Like I said,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.460
there's like,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.840
multiple ways to supply.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.860
Ah,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.320
one way is toe supply the credentials directly saying that.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.680
Okay,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.530
this is taxes key.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.440
This is a secret access key The other way is ah,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.120
saying that.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.750
Okay,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.660
um,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.780
I have my profile in my shared credentials file.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.700
Um,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.850
I'm going to say Okay,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.280
this is my credentials file.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.220
And ah,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.670
this is the profile that I want to use now it you can if you If you're using just the

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.490
default credential file and you have a profile set in there,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.210
you don't have to specify share the credential file.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.770
Now,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.640
in our example,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.430
we have used the default rate and she'll file so we don't have toe specify the path so that

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.030
ah,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.610
and you can directly usedto profile.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.870
So that is how you're going to basically use T um,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.050
shared credit shall file or the profiler you've created and the other ways to use the

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.730
assume roll,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.350
like if you're basically using STS was just session.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.070
I mean,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.810
it's a way to issue temporary credentials to a user,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.600
and those credentials usually expire after a certain ah,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.230
certain period of time.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.300
In those circumstances,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.300
you're going toe,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.210
specify the session,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.030
name and session,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.280
the role they are an extra for this course.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.190
We're not going to use that particular way off accessing date of this credentials.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.280
So let's go and try to weighs one s to,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:17.460
um run this with the with the access key and secret access key.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.650
And the other way is to use the shared credentials file.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.670
So let's go back to our,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.850
um,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.220
sublime.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.810
And then we'll just take We're going to save region.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.730
We're going to say region equal to us.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.870
You West one.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.920
And we're going to say access key equality.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.260
Oh,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.690
I think I have it.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:58.090
Open access key is this guy and secret key ISS this guy.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:05.250
Now I can go and do a terror farm.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.330
If I'm you can see that.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:09.850
Ah,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:17.210
the It has refreshed and there is no infrastructure change because you are not creating.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.200
You haven't created anything yet,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.350
but it gave us a It gave us no errors.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.980
That means that we have confiscated properly.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:32.040
So this is one way off supplying the credit chills and the other way is I can just comment

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.650
this out.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.750
Ah,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:46.040
not sure why they come in Keystone working anyway,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.850
so we can just get it off thes two and we can say profile equal to,

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:57.150
and we quickly double check so you can see Yeah,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.420
profile equal.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.390
Do one of the profile.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.650
So my profile is Esther on Dash Ted A farm?

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.460
Uh,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.700
of course.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.850
So this is my profile name.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:13.750
And if I just go back and run that a form plan again,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.810
it's going toe run it and then it's not throwing any others,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.640
which means it has been configured properly.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.540
So now you have two options,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:23.780
right?

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.400
You have either specifying the access key,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.360
secret access key and the other ways to specify profile.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.020
Now,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.510
which one do you need to choose?

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.370
The answer is simple.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:41.600
Always choose to profile because it is always a good practice not to check in your seek

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.130
access key and secret access key and also you when you when you're working as a team,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.440
there are multiple people who are actually modifying stuff to your infrastructure,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.780
right?

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.710
In that case,

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.600
you want to be able to track like who ran these particular,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.660
um,

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.960
changes are who added this particular resources.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.730
And if you have a shared credit,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.640
chills and say OK,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.080
I'm just going to check in a credentials for terra form,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.060
and I'm just going to allow everyone in my team.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.400
Then if someone deletes something or if someone does anything bad to your infrastructure,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.000
how are you going to figure out who is the person that ran that particular script,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.590
right?

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.090
So in order to do that,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:31.450
you need your profiles and every developer can have his own local profile set.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.200
And when he's ran some stuff,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.570
I mean,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.250
when he creates something in the AWS will record as saying that.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:39.540
Okay,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.060
so and so person has created toe into resource.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.720
So that's how you can keep track off who created the resources as less you can keep track

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.140
off.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.590
I mean,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.250
you can keep your access key,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.420
sent secret access key in a secure in a secure place without sharing them or exposing them

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.980
in your version controlling.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.980
So I hope you understood,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.490
like how to create a provider in terra form and supply your credentials.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.470
Do it so that you can go ahead and create the resources.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.290
So that's it for this lesson,

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.510
and I am going to see you in the next one.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.510
Thank you for watching
