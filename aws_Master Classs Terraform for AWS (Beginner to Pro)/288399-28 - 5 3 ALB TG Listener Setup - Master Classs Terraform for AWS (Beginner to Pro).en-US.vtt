00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.530
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing course is now in the previous

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.840
lesson.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
We have covered a lot of ground in our AWS project.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.190
We have set up our fuller structure.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.470
We have created our workspace and also we have created our shared groups model.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.520
And we completed the security groups part where we have created two different security

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.260
groups for public Security group and,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.730
um,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.770
private security group and one is for you'll be and the other is for the easy to instances

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.380
Now,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.770
.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.270
in this model,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.640
we are goingto go ahead and create a model for our load balancer and we're going to create

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.750
all its dependencies.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.290
So the list of components briefly are basically the AWS application load balancer followed

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.350
by AWS Extra DP Listener.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.550
And then we're going to create a oh,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.810
you're going to create a target along with that.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.660
So let's get started.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.350
So the first thing that I'm going to do is go ahead and create a model to create a model

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
that's like what we have done in the previous examples.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.950
Go ahead and create a new folder within the same ah project folder and I'm going to call it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.630
as,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.240
um load,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.900
balancer.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.260
Underscore Model.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.850
You can call it whatever you want.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.650
Which fits You are Ah,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.390
use case.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.870
I'm goingto make another telephone file here is gonna call it load balancer.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.120
Underscore Model,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.180
right?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.820
Oh,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580
I missed the extension here.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.960
It's going to be dot t f Now I'm going to go back to my sublime a sublime text here,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.140
and I'm going to open up this particular fight.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.330
So let's go ahead and check out the terra form dot io site toe.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.990
Get all the information that we need for building an application load balancer.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.560
So here's my A terror farm site.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.150
I'm going to go to the document provider AWS.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.520
And let's search for the A l B.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.880
Right,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.500
So it's going to be easy to resource.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.050
A l B.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.890
Right.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.980
So let me open this up in new tab inside that here's an example Off.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.880
Right.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.790
So let's just copy this spot from here.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.480
All right?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.800
And let's go ahead and paste it in here.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.110
So So this is the eight of this.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.650
L B hiss is an application or banter.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.360
Aws a l b.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.900
Did we open up the same one 18 of Yes,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.180
that will be okay.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.350
Suppose it's called.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.480
It'll be here.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.830
Okay,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.550
so it says here it's application load balancers.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.410
So let's go ahead and headed this particular part.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.090
So that data,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.820
it fits our needs.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.100
Right?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:27.500
So we're gonna call reference this as our sample app underscore L b right and the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.160
environment specific name.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.480
So even before right starting to include the environment specific names,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.170
what we're going to do is include our shared worse model,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.010
which we have treated,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.100
So I'm going to do more.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.650
Do shared underscore wars.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.460
Give it in double coat.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.760
I'm gonna call it shared underscore wars.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.210
And inside this,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.150
we're going toe.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.450
Give the source equal to again that that slash Because you have to go toe one level up,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.680
right?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.850
Once you have that,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.980
we can give the name as sample up underscore they'll be underscore.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.280
Give the environments effects.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.710
So it's going to be shared.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.210
Underscore war start.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.190
Oh,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.790
no.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.960
This is going to be module dart shared wars dark and why I went underscores suffix.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.610
So they re called it and wildman suffix.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.760
Yeah,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.780
environment suffix.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.430
Right.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.200
So we're saying internal is false.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.170
This just which means It's not an internal load,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.640
balancer.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.870
It is exposed outside and up.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.430
Load balancer type is application load balancer,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.510
and we need to specify the security groups here.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.920
Right.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.980
So to get the security group I D.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.730
What we need to do is we have created a security group in the network model,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.550
so we have to output that security group.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.450
Um,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.990
we have to output that of Heidi from the network model,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.690
and we have to supply it as an input from our main model.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.070
So let's go ahead and edit our network model toe,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.290
actually output them.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.600
Right.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.110
So we are going toe,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.320
um,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.430
output,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.400
the let's all put both private and public because we might need it in the next part.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.990
And we're doing our skating group.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.240
Right?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.450
So let's do output.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.340
Ah,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.770
public SG underscore,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.490
Heidi.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.930
Right.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.720
And we're going to give it value equal to ah dollar.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.070
This is going to be eight of us security.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.350
Underscore group dot Um,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.900
public SG dot id.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.040
Right.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:50.460
So let's copy the same thing from here and paste it here and rename.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.850
This s private as G i d.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.650
And I'm going to copy this here and paste it here.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.270
Right.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.190
So we have these two output variables now it's going to call public SG i d.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.250
And Private s reality.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.720
So in the load balancer model,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.940
we basically need the public s tree because it is the external facing.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.450
So I'm just gonna call this guy as I mean.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.940
Well taken input as price public s g underscore.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.150
I d and open close.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.610
When you when you supply a blank here,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.840
it's going toe.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.480
Treat it like an input variable.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.050
Let's put it to the top so that it's well formatted.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.000
Call it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.420
So we're going to get this as the input.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.720
Right?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.850
So here,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.060
um,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.360
the security groups,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.740
we need to just give this ass oir dot public SG underscore idea.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.360
Right?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.740
And the sub knit ID's.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.330
That's what we want from the shared group.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.710
Right?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.500
Fare wars.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.510
So shared wars.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.670
We want the public submit idea,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.740
which is our public sobriety.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.450
So we can copy this.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.940
We can go back to our model.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.450
We can say,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.340
Ah,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.690
this is basically module dot shared underscore bars,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.020
Dr.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.140
Public Separate Idea.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.590
So we got the sub net i d.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.360
From here and we got the security groups idee here,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.350
and we want to enable the deletion production.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.370
This is like to prevent from accidental termination.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.580
It's going toe.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.970
Delete any application,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.540
Orban answer.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.470
You have to go back and disable this production and then go and daily just to be sure

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.050
before you're deleting anything.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.450
Now,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.990
for the sake off this example,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.720
we're not doing the access lock.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.250
So I'm just deleting that part.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:01.250
And I am going toe have a environment specified here as attack.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.180
Um,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.080
and we can call this nasty,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.610
whatever the environment suffix that we have,

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.080
right?

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.550
So it would be either staging or it would be a production environment.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.160
All right,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.900
so I think we have Ah,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.530
a good,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.730
um I mean,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.290
good starting point as our application load balancer.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.720
So the next thing that we need for this application load balancer,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.030
let's go ahead and run this before we go on and confirm like everything is working.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.370
Fine.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.290
So the next thing that we have to do is go to the main dot TF and here.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.490
What we have to do is include the module.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.450
Uh,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.670
what's that?

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.930
Lord Valentyn load well and,

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:44.390
sir,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.150
underscore model and source.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.890
He called to start slash Load,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.840
balancer.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.990
Underscore Model.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.780
All right,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.980
so we have this part ready.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.820
Ah,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.060
and we need to supply input.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.350
Right?

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.910
So the input that it is expecting ISS the public S G i d.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.690
So go back to Maine Public.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.450
Esche Idee.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.640
You'll be getting it from the,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.540
uh so here you have.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.150
Ah,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:29.110
the Mahdi old dot network Underscore module dart public SG underscore.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.810
Right.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.090
So you got the public s reality from this network module.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.920
Supplied it as an input in this.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.260
Ah load Balancer.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.810
Martin takes it as an input here and everything is set here.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.100
So let's go ahead and execute our turf form.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.900
Cord.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.040
Clear.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.390
This first thing that we have to do is initialized or project.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.080
OK,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.190
Something is wrong here.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.920
So it's saying unknown root level key public sthe OK,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.570
so I think.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.400
Yeah,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.970
so we didn't specify that it's a variable,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.360
so we need to specified variable and clear terra form in it.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.250
All right,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.650
so our model is now initialized clear from here.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.230
Do it tell from,

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.350
uh,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.170
workspace Select staging.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.940
I think it's were already in stating right.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.650
So let's do a telephone plan.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.930
Okay,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.940
Lord Balancer module overly Alfa.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.470
Numerous example app underscore.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:38.560
A l B sample happens call only all from in the name right.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.380
I think it's not,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.110
uh,

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.810
liking the underscores.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.750
Let's give the hyphens and see if that accept it.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.570
All right,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.020
there we go.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.510
It's actually,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.480
um,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.470
accepting that hyphens instead off underscores eso We have a low default and come off,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.920
the important we have supplied.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.370
And now let's go ahead and apply these changes.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.590
So we going to do to form apply,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:20.450
and we're going to say yes and confirm it.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.100
Holic.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.550
So at least two sub nets in two different availability zones must be specified.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.620
Telephone.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.330
That's not automatic legal back.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.090
All right,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.490
so I think we've got a problem here.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.350
At least two sub nets in two different availability zones once we submit.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.450
Okay,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.620
so Mm.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.450
All right.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.790
So let's use the another subject,

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.640
which is one.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.180
See Right.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.410
So we'll use one see,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.100
as our,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.970
um,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.600
sub net to right.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.250
So let's go to our network model and not network.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.700
My deal.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.110
I mean,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.040
the shared wash and Publix.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.680
Let's call this public seven.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.490
It I d one.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:14.870
And let's also create the Heidi two.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.430
We need to supply it here as well.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.530
One to.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.630
And we need to Ah,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:32.840
public sub net I d to make this as one one i d.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.730
One.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.010
And we need another public,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.820
some notoriety,

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.350
which is going to be a public something tidy too,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.250
uh,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.810
to public some great idea too.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.550
Right?

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.260
And we can fetched thes from the,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.550
uh,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.890
three pc model.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.830
Go to your sub net.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.840
Now.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.550
We've already used one A as our ah,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.610
I mean,

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.370
to a as our public security group one on.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.250
And we've used to be for our private ah,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:20.990
security group.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:27.140
So let's use to see for our ah public sub net.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.150
Do right.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:43.250
So let's go ahead and give the public submit value s this guy and maybe place this here.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.680
All right,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.650
so now we have these things created.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.340
Now,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.410
the next thing that we have to do is,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:14:13.890
uh but did we use public submit itis anywhere in our next Mardell public?

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.050
Submit I d.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:23.520
Because she be had a All right,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.320
So this is a vpc level things,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.480
so we don't need to worry about it so we can go to our shared wash.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.210
I mean,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.290
the load balancer.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.750
And here Ah,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.590
in the sub nets,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.350
we can give one more summit here and have probably submit one.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.560
And we'll have a only submit to All right,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:53.050
so now if you go ahead and run our farm plan again,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:59.350
enter parsing load balancer A 12 1 seed of five.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.940
So 12 I wanted to fight off.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.960
Missed this.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.260
That will coat there.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:23.520
Now you should see the advance of being created Clear from apply some play?

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.080
Yes.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:35.430
Oh,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.810
it's so it's taking a couple of minutes to create it.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:45.610
Meanwhile,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:50.230
let's go to our console back and see if something is getting provisions.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.840
So if I go to my,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.600
uh,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:59.840
see too service and go to the load balancers,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.650
I should see something coming up.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.080
All right,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:11.130
so my sample app will be staging is being provisioned now.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.090
That's why it's taking Ah,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:19.700
a minute toe actually create the load balancer because it is still in provisional state.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.180
So now that this is being created,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.470
let's go ahead and start writing up the other dependencies that we have,

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.240
Ah,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.340
that we need to create for ah project work properly.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.550
So the next thing that we need is basically the listeners.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.700
Now,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.570
if you see here,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.010
we don't have any listener.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.340
Right?

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.740
So we have to create a listener for this particular application load,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.250
balancer.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.080
So let's go to our telephone documentation,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.100
and you can see that there is something called oblivious.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.050
Underscore LB,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.960
underscore Listener.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.090
Let's open up that documentation and see how to create a specific listener.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.050
Right,

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.850
So So we have some example here.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.150
Um all right.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:11.990
So let's just grab one off the examples here and modify it to fit to our needs.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.290
All right,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.660
so I'm going to copy it,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.550
and I'm gonna call it.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.860
Ah,

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:27.070
I'm gonna call it TDP listener eight.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:27.560
Right,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.360
accent,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.420
because we were listening on Port 80.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.410
So the load balancer Aaron here would be a lovely asunder core lb dart.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.540
Uh,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.430
this name,

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.890
right?

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.600
This is an email,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.060
Far Lord balance of reference.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:50.950
And the Aaron and the port would be STD p iss on 80 and the protocol would be scdp.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.960
And,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.550
uh,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:18:00.350
we're just going toe keeping one of the security SSL policy is just leave it there.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.550
We don't need a certificate,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:01.920
Aaron,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.450
because we're not doing extra DPS.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.690
If you're doing it through GPS you can go to certificate manager,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.670
create a,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.200
uh,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.980
ACM cert for your specific domain name.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.130
And once you have that sort ready,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.420
you can key in your Aaron into this particular block here.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.320
If you're doing extra DPS now,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.730
we're not doing https Soviet.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.310
Just doing that part and the next what we're doing,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.050
it's like we have a default action.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.330
Oh,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.460
which we need to supply Target group.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.300
Oh,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.730
actually,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.170
my back.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.050
So first we need to create the target group.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.560
Then we have to create the listener.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.750
This is completely my bad.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.930
Don't get confused.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.790
This is not that off a big deal.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.610
All we have to do is now commend this out.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.660
So I'm gonna comment,

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.350
comment all of this out,

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.680
and we can go ahead and create our target route first.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.920
Now,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.380
before that,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.400
let's go and see if it's completed.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.130
You can see that the socials are successfully created here.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.640
And now let's go ahead and check out the target group.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.360
Ah Oh,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.190
Target two documentation in telephone.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.560
So there we go.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.160
So here's the target group.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:29.850
All we need ISS to specify this particular guy Copy this example based in our model right

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.780
and I'm going to call it STP.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.660
Sample up.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:44.850
That should be target Target two.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.080
All right.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.880
And I'm gonna call the same thing here,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.750
but I'm gonna call it sample app Bash.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.800
That's 30 p dash target group.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.640
And we needed a port 80 and it's GDP,

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.130
and we need the VPC,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.550
right?

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.350
So where do we get the VPC already from?

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:09.550
We have it from one you'll dot shed worse shared.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.730
Underscore wars dot the PC idea.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.270
Right?

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.660
So we have that.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:23.600
And let's go ahead and run this and see if we got our sample target.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.430
Who created or not?

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.790
Meanwhile,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:31.530
you can also go ahead and check the other properties that you can specify.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:31.910
I mean,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.510
the health check stuff like this.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.170
Ah,

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.870
or we can just leave it as default.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.510
The before health check is anyways,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.180
the root level.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.840
So I'm just gonna leave it as is.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.740
If you want to specify anything specific to your target group,

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.290
you can go to the Terra form documentation and figure it out from here.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:53.890
All right,

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.680
so for this example,

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.930
I'm just gonna leave legacies,

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.880
and I'm going to go to the power shell,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.440
clear it from here,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.400
do it at a farm.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.290
In it again.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.370
Clear it.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.250
Reform plan.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.770
Now I should see that you are creating a,

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.950
um,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.880
target group.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.250
And it is being attached to our of application load balancer that fear.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.360
Davey,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.950
attach it?

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.680
Yeah,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.060
we are attaching.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.970
Ah,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:27.580
no,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.580
we're not attaching it to any load balance here.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.420
We're going to attach it through the http listener,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:32.720
Right?

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.160
So we can just do terra form apply,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.290
and I'm gonna supply.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:42.770
Yes,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.350
here,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.740
all it.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.290
So the target group is now created.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:51.230
Let's go back to our AWS console and see if that target Group s created.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.250
So if you see any C two under load balancing,

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.460
you should see target groups,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.890
and you should see our new target group has been created.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.970
And you can see that there's nothing registered to this target.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.250
And the default health checks are fruit level,

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.960
and we have some basic monitoring being provided here.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.920
All right,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:19.710
so the next thing that we want to do is go toe this farm and a NCAA meant this listener

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.110
that we wanted toe,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:29.470
Actually,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:39.350
I should have used the We have to a form here as she carb.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:47.620
Oh,

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.680
Maybe you can just leave it like this anyway.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.760
So inside the,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.350
um,

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.630
inside our floor balance of mortal,

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.170
we created our lister model.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:57.820
I mean,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.080
listener actually be,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.660
um,

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.530
listener Haiti in were attacked.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.800
Streeto are simple.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.790
Sample up here in and we're using bunch of default.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:16.000
And here default action is basically were far wording the all the request to this

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.950
particular security,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.400
this particular target group.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.030
Now,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:27.680
the baby reference to this is we just call this guy from here and call this guy not Aaron.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.720
Right.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:36.530
So once this is done while we have to do is go toe are former again clear from here to

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.670
reform plan,

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:46.860
I should see that a new load balancers listener is being added to this particular load

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.440
balancer.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.610
And we can just do terra form.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.680
Apply here in supply.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.280
Yes.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:58.880
Okay,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.860
so there's some problem with this,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.310
So Yeah,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.140
So we're just doing http listener,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.500
so we don't need to specify the SSL policy because it's not.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.780
That's true.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.260
TPS my bad.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.400
I've taken it out.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.900
Clear it reform plan again.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:23.850
And let's do the terra form play again.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:32.060
Okay,

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.370
so now the,

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.180
um listener has been created.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.590
Let's go back to our AWS console and see Ah and verify forestry PS.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.300
It's ridiculous.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:43.990
Investment created.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.900
So yes.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.380
So my sample app will be staging in this,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:49.960
um,

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.200
sample up will be staging.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.710
And listener,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.620
it's actually be 80.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:02.350
And we have the target group as sample habits.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.660
You tip it.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.710
Okay,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:10.450
so the one mistake that I think we've made iss not giving the name of it the environment

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:10.980
specifics.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.230
So let's go back and fix it because it is really important for us to manage the naming

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.260
convention here so that we not messing up the,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.440
uh,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.190
the maintenance off this particular product.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.940
So I'm gonna supply it fit,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.960
dollar open,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:39.010
close and more dual dark shared underscore bars on dot environment suffix.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:39.560
Right.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:45.050
So we're gonna head the name here.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.990
I think when we did the name off a target group,

00:25:47.990 --> 00:26:00.800
it's going to recreate the target group and and call it So I think we can go and do it on a

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:08.770
phone plan again from apply.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.800
So we're seeing that there's one being changed,

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.190
one being added and one being destroyed because we have to update if you destroy and

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.030
recreate the target group and we have to operate our load.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.840
Balancer,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.310
Scdp listener with the new target group that we're creating.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.700
So I'm just gonna do terra form,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.420
apply and supply.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:30.890
Yes,

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.680
um,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.660
it already leading a target room because he's currently being used by the listener.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:48.220
So how late the baby you need to fix this problem is were the first remove the listener,

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.700
right?

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.850
So we can do that by committing this out.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:27:03.660
Because this is a dependency on this.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.010
It cannot delete it because it's already being used here.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.130
So it has to deliver this and recreate that.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:16.590
So now if we go in front form plan,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:26.550
it's going to know delete to resource is and had one new resource.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:35.100
Now,

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:53.160
what we can do is now un commend this again and after farm plan,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.220
and I should see the new listener being created.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.850
And you can do terra form.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:11.260
Apply the reason we have taken the pain to go ahead and fix the name here.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.450
Because it is really important to maintain the naming convention right when we're doing it

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.210
in the beginning phase itself.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.370
Because later on,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.550
if you go ahead and change the name off something to make it all consistent.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.260
When your production lords are running,

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.730
it will be really difficult for you to oh,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:33.980
change them because you'll be disturbing the current production environment and it's really

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:34.590
messaging.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.140
I've bean there in that situation,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.020
and I will never,

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:43.190
ever repeat the same mistake again off like bad naming convention and then regretting in

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.890
the later point.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.690
So always make sure that you have your naming convention right in the first place.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.740
So now let's go back to the AWS console and look at our target roof.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.000
We have now staging specified here.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.050
Sample up its GDP target troop staging.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.050
And,

00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.690
um,

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.350
we have our Lord.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.910
Bands are created and ready.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.120
So we have all the confidence that are required in the Lord balancing model,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.930
and that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.700
I I understand that this is really long.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.260
Listen what it is really what it to go through the entire part off this,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.440
and I'll highly recommend that you create these resources along with me to be able to

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.020
practice.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.350
So if you have any questions,

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.390
you can pick me in the course,

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.720
and I'll be happy to answer.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.080
So that's it for this lesson,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.260
and I will see in the next one.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.020
Thank you for watching
