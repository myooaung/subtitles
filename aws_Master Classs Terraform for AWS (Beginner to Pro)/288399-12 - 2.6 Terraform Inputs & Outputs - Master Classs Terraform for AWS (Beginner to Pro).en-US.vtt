00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.720
And in two days listen,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.900
we're going to learn about input and output variables in our terra form course.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.980
So basically,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.510
ah,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.410
in the previous lessons,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.770
we have seen how to use variables.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.410
And what are the different types of variables that you can create in terra form?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.020
Now,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.770
in this lesson,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.970
we're going to see how you can utilize the feature off in putting the variables toe ah,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.530
terra form script so that you can pass in some dynamic variables and how you can utilize

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.750
output toe kind off,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.110
see those variables and also ill talk about,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.480
like where else you can use the output variables.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.980
So let's get started.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.650
So the first thing that we're going to do is like to see how we're going to take the input

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.380
to a specific variable.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.020
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up my same ah telephone file that we have used

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.900
in the previous lesson.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.410
Now,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.850
in this,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.290
I'm going to say variable input.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.010
My input variable name really doesn't matter.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.490
Here.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.230
All it matters is what type we're going to use.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.450
So I'm going to say type equals the string.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.720
Now,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.390
here.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.010
What I'm just going to do is inside this.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.020
Uh,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.040
I'm not going to specify a default value.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.030
I'm just going to leave it like this now.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.430
What I'm going to do is I'm going toe output this variable,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.040
just like I did in the previous lessons.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.590
So my output variable.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.440
And inside this I'm just going to say value equals.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.350
Ah,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.190
and I'm going to refer to the variable that I'm going to input from the console.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.180
I mean,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.450
the power shell.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.440
And let's see how it outputs it now to reference to this I all have to do is var dot my

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.160
input variable.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.360
And that's pretty much it.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.910
Now,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.370
if I run my terra form using terra form planned Ah,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.730
invalid key value.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.850
Ah,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.070
yes.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.400
So this is not a valuable this.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.110
This should be output.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.470
Right?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.930
So we're all putting that value,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.420
so that shouldn't be a variable.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.810
So let me clear this.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.070
I'm going to do terra form plan.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.770
Now.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.260
You see,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.490
it's asking me to input the variable,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.930
which is ah which is going to take in the value that I'm going to specify here and store it

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.680
in tow that variable and it is going to output back again because we're specified in output

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.790
variable to put that information out.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.750
So I'm going to say this is my test input and hit enter.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.780
And now when you do terra form Oh,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.100
no.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.400
So in telephone plan it doesn't do anything because it's not actually out putting stuff.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.910
It's just a test plan.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.730
But if you do terra form apply,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.110
it's gonna ask you for the same input again.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.480
So in this time it is going toe outward.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.500
So this is my test input.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.150
Now,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.050
if you see,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.700
you should see my output valuable equal do.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.720
This is my test input Now.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.750
You might have observed one thing that the output here is not in a specific order off what

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.250
we have written in our script,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.400
because terra form of not follow the order in which that you have specified here it it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.460
follows always the dependency model,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.730
wherein you can say a certain resource depends on ah,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.730
specifically source.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.690
Then it will wait.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.170
Then it will create the resource in the order off the dependencies,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.860
Let's say is dependent on B and B is dependent on sea.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.790
Then it will create,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.780
see first and then it will create.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.580
Be then followed by a because is dependent on B and B is dependent on sea.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.850
So that's how it follows the order.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.170
But it doesn't follow the same order that you have specified in the script,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.960
so always keep that in mind.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.070
So So you know,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.250
you have seen the input variables.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.190
I mean taking an input.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.840
And also you have seen how do output this now another important thing about output is

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.690
basically,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.420
let's say you are putting out some sensitive data,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.970
right?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.490
So let's say you're creating some secret keys are stuff like that and you are are putting

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.390
it and you don't want it to be visible toe the person who is executing those commands.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.120
Then,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.960
in that case,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.950
what you can do is you can supply a perimeter called sensitive equal toe true.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.630
And when you do this,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.480
you will see you not see the output.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.710
But you'll just see that this is a sensitive piece off information,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.540
and it will not show you that piece off information getting out in the country so we can

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.630
clear out from here and we can say terra form.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:18.930
Apply again and this is my test in port and you should see that my output variable equal to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.670
sense toe,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.170
which means the output variable has that information,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.830
but it is not showing us here.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.790
But if you use the output variables when you're when you're when you're dealing with models

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.790
,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.950
I'll come to the models part when when we're living with that section.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.270
So basically you can.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.750
The reason why you have all put variables is one to show it to the user who is running and

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.810
to if you want toe share your variables across different models when you are when you're

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.260
when you're when you're you re using some off the telephone competent in another terra form

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.640
scripts,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.370
that's when you kind of fused the output variables.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.070
So that's pretty much about the important output variables.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.390
And if you need more info,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.070
you can always go to terra form dot io website and you can check out the docks about

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.840
different types off in ports and airports and also the different types off Variables are

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.550
supported there,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.140
so that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.100
If you have more questions,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.160
you can always being me through the course,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.580
and I will be happy to respond to those questions.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.950
So that's it for this lesson,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.450
and I will see in the next one.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.450
Thank you for watching.
