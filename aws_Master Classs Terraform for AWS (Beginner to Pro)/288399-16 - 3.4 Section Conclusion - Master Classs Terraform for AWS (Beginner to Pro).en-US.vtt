00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Hello and welcome back to the conclusion lesson off this section.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.650
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm just going to give you a quick walk through off what we've done in this particular

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.560
section.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.940
And I'm just going to give you an introduction to what we're going to cover in the next

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.420
section.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.550
So let's get started.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.220
So in this section we have seen how to use the bay.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.560
I mean,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.100
how they create the basic AWS resource is using terra form like creating industry bucket,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.230
uploading a file toe s three bucket.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.940
And also we have created in easy to instance,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.200
and along with that,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.710
we also created the security groups.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.350
Now this Ah,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.420
the whole goal off.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.880
This particular section wants to just get you an understanding off how to create AWS

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.920
resources using terra form and also how toe implement some off the concepts that we have

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.200
learned in the previous sections.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.980
Like using the variables extra.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.250
And also we have seen how toe go through the terra form documentation to figure out what

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.010
are the required properties that you need toe supply to create your resources.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.190
Now you will basically apply the same concept to create any type off resource in ah AWS

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.020
using terra form,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
and it's pretty much straightforward now that you know how to create.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.330
The resource is let's go ahead and learn in the next section the proper ways off using

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.900
terra form.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.150
I mean advanced concepts in which I will teach you how to use models.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.030
How toe have,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.370
ah good folder structure for your enterprise level infrastructure and different concepts

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.350
that are really important toe have a very good,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.460
manageable terra form.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950
And ah,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.780
and I really hope that you enjoyed the section.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.140
And I'm really excited for the next section because there's a lot off good stuff that is

Because the ultimate goal of this course is to make you a better user after a form.
