00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660
Hello and welcome back to hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.790
And today,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.510
in this lesson,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.010
we're going to see how toe do it'll be a seal I set up.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.530
Now they're a couple of things.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.060
So first thing that you're going to do is basically download the AWS Eli from Amazon site

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.250
and you're going to install the program.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.330
And once you're done installing that program,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.780
you're going to go back to your AWS console.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.710
Um,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.960
like I said in my earlier videos,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.940
for this course,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.710
you would need a AWS account eso that Ah,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.340
you can create your user.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.720
You can download your access keys and secret access keys,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.730
and also you can follow along the lab so that you can create the resources which I am

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.130
creating now.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.930
Ah,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.470
So,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.980
like I said,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.240
we're going to download the AWS Eli,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.470
first install it,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.970
then we're going to go back to AWS console,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.390
create user if you don't have already,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.100
if you already have a user,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.680
then we can just go to the user,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.020
created the im Ah,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.890
credentials,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.230
thesis,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.860
acuity,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.210
access key and secret access key.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.820
And we're going to configure it has a profile using your head of your Seelye,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.470
Because for using it Ah,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.010
for forgiving terra form the access to go ahead and create resources or delete resources or

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.130
whatever you want to do.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.720
Your terra form needs to be authenticated with,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.270
Ah,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.080
the AWS system.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.450
So ah,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.160
creating a profile using CLI is one off the ways in doing it.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.590
And you can also give your access keys and secret access keys directly to your terra form,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.720
which is not a good practice.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.540
But I'm still going to show you the different approaches that you can take toe.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.940
Give access to your AWS system from your telephone.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.340
So let's get started.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.710
So the first thing that will do is down or d a wc like so to do that first,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.950
just go to any browser and just type down.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.400
Lord,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.650
have you see live already searched for it.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.200
I think the last time eso basically can just go to any first link that you see.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.290
Ah,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.370
if you're using alien X version,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.970
you can you can follow the instructions here.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.110
Now I'm going to show you how to install for a windows,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.510
so I'm just going toe select the one install AWS Eli on windows and there is an M Asai

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.180
installer.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.700
If you want to choose another part,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.390
you can choose.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.390
I'm just going to download the installer,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.950
which is a lot more easy to work with.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.000
So I'm just going to download in this folder.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.210
We copy the pot so that I can go there,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.210
so I don't need the Seelye wants to see allies downloaded.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:49.050
What I'm going to do is open it so I'm just waiting till the download complete?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.130
Yep.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.720
So it is known ordered here.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.050
So all you got to do,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.590
it's like,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.180
ah,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.370
double click it and then select next,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.540
accept the license next and then installed.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.250
Uh,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:21.150
just give it a couple of minutes,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.260
and it should be done.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.720
And Okay,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.640
so the aws eli set up this complete.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.300
Now,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.410
we can open up a power shell or command prompt whatever you prefer.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.110
And you can just do,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.850
uh,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.750
get command hated.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.350
Yes.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.240
In lieu Mexican do which aws in partial you can do get command aws,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.060
and you can see the it is resolving to something.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.070
So we know AWS see allies installed.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.140
You can do AWS health and it's going to show you a bunch of different options that you can

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.080
use with the Seelye and Ah,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080
well,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.850
let's not go deep into this because this is not,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.430
ah,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.720
the topic that we're going to discuss here.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.380
But,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.950
um,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.880
that's want to the next step.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.670
So the next step that we have is to go to AWS,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.080
Eli.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.990
I mean,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.030
AWS console and create a user.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.610
And if you already have a user,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.930
you're going to go ahead and create access keys and ticket access keys.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.770
Now,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.310
I already have a user.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.600
Eso I'm just going to go ahead and create new access,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.850
key and tickle access key in your case if you don't.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.850
Ah,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.180
it's always best practice to create a user and use it instead off using a root account.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.550
So I would suggest you toe use a,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.150
um,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.870
use a I am user instant off the truth account.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.880
So I already have the user.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.030
So I'm just going to go to my I am console here,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.760
search for it.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.340
And once you're here,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.880
all you got to do is go to your users,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.230
select search for your user,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.640
and inside that user,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.050
you're going to go to the security credential.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.010
Step no.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.170
Inside the stab you should see Ah,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.090
part here now.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.290
I already have a access key and secret access key theater.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.070
In your case,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.220
you wouldn't see anything if you're new to this.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.590
If you already have access key and Secret Access key,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.110
you can completely skipped the step and use the ones which you have already.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.050
And ah,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.550
even though I have it here,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.850
I'm just going to create a new one for this lessons purpose so that I can go ahead and do

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.200
it after this lesson.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.570
And ah,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.060
you guys can even though if it is visible,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.150
you technically have no access.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.930
So,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.750
um,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.850
let me just copy these in tow.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.060
The my I copied in a note pad just for now,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.860
because one thing to remember,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.660
it's like you can only see the secret access key once,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.450
and you have to copy it or download the CSE file here.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.750
Uh,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:14.680
and you can always see that get the access key from logging into do your I am council,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.790
and you should be.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.980
It should be visible,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.940
but secret access key.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.810
Make sure no one gets hold off it because they can technically do anything that that your

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.530
user has access to.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.540
So just be careful with er.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.370
Do not share it with anyone and save it in a secure place.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.470
All right,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.920
so the next thing that you're going to do is now that we have this Ah,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.680
the next thing that you have to make sure it's like you have appropriate permissions snow.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.920
For this examples that I'm going to choose.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.730
I just gave my user the administrator access just so that you know,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.300
I can do anything that I want with dark access keys.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.180
Now,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.620
if you are touching a few resources which your which you don't have permission toe if you

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.450
want toe experimented with,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.800
just give access to yourself temporarily.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.030
And once you're done with the lessons,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.390
you can just get your offered.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.560
All right,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.170
so now that we have our AWS access key sensical access keys,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.520
now let's plug them into our AWS Eli and create a profile.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.660
So to do that,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.570
the first thing that you were going to do is aws ah,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.580
profile.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.490
And you have to give the profiling name so that you can use that profile name in your

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.350
telephone script.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.580
So I'm just going to say aws profile.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.250
Ah,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.440
dust,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.630
Ash profile and have to give it a name.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.190
So I'm just going to say a Stratton Dash data form,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.100
of course.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.900
All right.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.680
And,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.210
uh,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.500
once they go into this Oh,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.720
my bad.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.450
So you have to do AWS configure,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.140
configure,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.830
dash,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.790
dash profile and Xstrata national reform courses.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.210
Mind profiling.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.260
You can give it whatever you want.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.540
So once you do that,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.550
it's going to ask you for the access key and,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.210
uh,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:12.090
dusky and the access key that you have created earlier and the secret access key goes in

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.050
here.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.940
Okay,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.370
Now you can choose the default region.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.700
I'm going toe for this course.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.860
I'm going to use you Best one.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.510
Ah,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.550
you can choose whatever the region called that you would like to use.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.080
Ah,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.780
it's completely up to.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.530
It's just setting a default region,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.290
meaning if you don't specify a region in your AWS comment,

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.960
you're going to end up using this particular region.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.310
So it really doesn't matter if you're specifying it anyways.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.570
But it's always handy when you have the default region said so that you don't have to

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.970
supplied every time you run a specific it of this command All right.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.440
So I'm going to choose the you vest one here.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.070
And once it is done,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.430
you can choose the default output format,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.000
whatever the default is,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.700
and we're pretty much done.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.030
So let's go ahead and see or test Like what,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.870
exactly?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.500
I mean,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.680
if this if this particular profile configuration worked or not,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.060
and do the AWS help again?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.820
I think everything should be fixed.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.200
Yes.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.250
So,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.190
no,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.910
let's try to run.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.650
I am.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.550
Ah,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:28.680
let's I just want to see if my configuration worked or not.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.430
So I just I'm trying to retrieve the users from here,

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.540
So retrieve users is like,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.570
uh,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:41.350
I want to use list list users.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.700
Yeah,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.820
I can choose this.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.810
Lets users can come out off this command.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.360
Klier aws I am list users.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.640
Oh,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.230
I have toe supply the profile,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.480
right.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.920
We have created a profile for it.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.410
So profile,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.140
um,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.740
Hazrat on dash,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.810
uh,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.350
uniform course.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.910
And like Like I said,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.980
you can see all the users that are there in my account,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.480
and ah,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.540
this confirms that we have our aws eli set up properly.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.170
Okay,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.930
so that's it for this lesson.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:28.410
It's bean really long lesson and um we have successfully installed our AWS alive.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.830
We have created our AWS I am user.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:37.420
We have created our access key secret access keys And then we have configured in our aws

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.920
Eli a za profile with a profile name set.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.280
And then we have tested that our set of books.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.720
So that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.830
And I will see in the next lessons.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.050
Thank you so much for watching.
