00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.330
So this is another lesson from hashtag landing courses and ah,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.010
in this lesson,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.130
we're going to give a quick introduction to what we're going to cover in this particular

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.220
section off terra form basics.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.670
And we're going to cover the first part off the start from basic scores.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.510
So let me just walk you through the,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.940
um,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.130
different lessons that we're going to cover in this particular section.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.010
So we're going to start off by creating our first uniform file and ah,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.130
we're going toe initialize our telephone file and I'm just going to show you what is the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.900
extension and what are the file studied create?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.920
And once we're done with that,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580
we're going toe talk about the state file,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.590
and it's important.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.390
Ah,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.130
missing the state file is something which gets created when you run your stuff.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.270
It keeps track off the resources that you've created.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.960
Ah,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.370
In the third lesson,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.000
we're going toe cover like,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
how are we going to give access to our eight of your system?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.470
Like,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.130
how do we supply credentials,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.590
toe?

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.370
Um,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.610
our terra form file And what are the different ways to do it in the next thing that we're

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.660
going to cover is the most important one,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.270
which is the terra form variables.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.190
Now you're going to play around a large off.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.580
I mean,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.170
you're going to use the variables a lot in your in your in your infrastructure building

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.670
because I mean,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.950
like,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.380
it's one of the core competence that you need to learn in terra form.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.460
And ah,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.360
second thing is,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.170
the next thing would be their form input variables like,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.540
how are you going to give input to your particular terra form script from external command

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.880
line?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.960
And the next important thing is like,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.540
How are you going?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.920
Toe output specific variable if you are.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.150
If you have created something,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.550
If you have created a resource,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.570
how are you going?

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.560
Toe output a specific value so that you can use in Ah,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.050
in some other case are like if you want to view it as an output in your in your council

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.780
itself.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.330
So these are the pretty much basics that we're going to cover in this particular section.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.040
And,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.790
um,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.370
I'm just going to quickly stop this.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.530
Listen and I'll create.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.240
I mean,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.000
I'll start a new ah lesson just in a bit.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.560
And then we will cover the first uniform file there.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.320
So that's it for this lesson.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.260
Thank you for watching.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.570
And I hope you enjoy this particular part off the scores.
