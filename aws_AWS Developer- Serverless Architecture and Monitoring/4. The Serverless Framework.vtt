00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.160
One key aspect of serverless architecture is that it usually relies on

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.740
the interaction between many different cloud resources.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.030
This can be difficult to manage on your own.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.700
So for this course, we'll use one of my favorite technologies,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.440
the Serverless Framework.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.660
The Serverless Framework lets you configure,

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.670
test, develop,

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.970
and deploy entire serverless applications from a single configuration file.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.660
This takes the headache away from deployment,

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.380
ensures that you have reproducible architecture,

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.560
and makes it significantly easier to test lambda code by running it locally.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.150
In order to allow us to focus on more important things,

13
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.370
I've done a lot of the work to create a working application

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.740
with the Serverless Framework already.

15
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.240
If you want to learn more about the Serverless Framework,

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.900
you can check out the course Using the Serverless

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.170
Framework with Node on AWS here, on Pluralsight.

18
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.040
This will explain a lot of the things that we will gloss over in this course.

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.230
One thing to note here.

20
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.850
The Serverless Framework won't be on the AWS

21
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.440
Developer Associate Certification exam.

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.920
We're only using it here because it's going to simplify a lot

23
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.000
of pieces and allow us to get to more interesting parts of serverless architecture quicker.
