00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.360
There are two types of events sources that all

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.790
applicable AWS services fall into, push and pull.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.870
In this video,

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.340
I wanted to explain how each type works and what the differences are.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.340
Push event sources describe events that are pushed

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.920
to your lambda from a resource, thus invoking it.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.460
Push event sources require you give them permission to invoke your lambda,

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.740
which is what we had to do when we set up the API Gateway method.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.220
Examples of push event sources in AWS are API Gateway,

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.640
S3, CloudWatch Events and Logs, and a few others.

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.330
Pull event sources describe events that your lambda

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.140
receive as a result of polling a resource.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
AWS will poll the target event source periodically,

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.420
the period of time depending on the service,

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.880
and invoke your lambda with an event if one exists.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.780
In this case, your lambda would need permissions to access the event source,

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.870
which is the opposite of a push event source.

18
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.260
You give permissions for this via the IAM role the lambda executes under.

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.020
There are currently only three pull event sources, DynamoDB Streams,

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.120
Kinesis Streams, and SQS Queues. As I mentioned,

21
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.800
the Lambda service polls each periodically. For DynamoDB Streams,

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.780
it will poll the stream four times per second. For Kinesis Streams,

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.820
it will poll once per second. And for SQA Queues,

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.570
it will poll based on the visibility timeout and time to wait configured on

25
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.000
the queue. In the rest of this module, let's configure a pull event source by setting up Kinesis Streams to invoke a lambda.
