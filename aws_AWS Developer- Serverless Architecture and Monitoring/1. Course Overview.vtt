00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.447
Hi everyone, my name is Ryan Lewis, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:12.086
AWS Developer: Serverless Architecture and Monitoring.

3
00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:16.237
I've been architecting and creating serverless applications in AWS for many

4
00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:20.469
years in my work for large enterprises as a senior engineer.

5
00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.369
Amazon Web Services started the serverless revolution

6
00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.455
after launching Lambda in 2014,

7
00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:30.099
and it's still the best place to create distributed serverless applications.

8
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.097
AWS continues to innovate in the field of serverless and has

9
00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:38.540
also introduced some incredibly powerful services for

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.107
monitoring any kind of web application.

11
00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.950
As improved tooling and support services for

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.032
applications continue to be introduced,

13
00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:51.993
AWS is cementing itself as the platform of choice for most enterprise companies.

14
00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:55.829
In this course, we are going to go deep into both of those topics,

15
00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.292
serverless architecture and monitoring.

16
00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:02.387
We'll architect an application using many of AWS's most

17
00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:05.609
popular services and then configure monitoring to be able

18
00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:07.590
to keep an eye on everything.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.697
Some of the major topics that we will cover include improving performance,

20
00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:12.317
stability,

21
00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:18.941
and security with AWS Lambda; configuring serverless event sources, such as API

22
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:24.539
Gateway and Kinesis; monitoring applications with AWS Xâ€‘Ray; and creating

23
00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.275
CloudWatch alarms to monitor serverless applications.

24
00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:29.576
By the end of this course,

25
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:33.526
you'll have a new understanding of how to build and deploy serverless

26
00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.405
applications and monitor any application in AWS.

27
00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:38.489
Before beginning the course,

28
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:41.317
you should have a good understanding of AWS services

29
00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:44.111
and have some experience using them.

30
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:48.751
I hope you'll join me on this journey to master Amazon Web Services with the

31
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:58.000
AWS Developer: Serverless Architecture and Monitoring course, at Pluralsight.
