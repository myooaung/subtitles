00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,570
The power of serverless architecture in AWS is mostly due to the many

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,260
number of events sources and what you can do with them. With things

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,560
like S3 events, Streams, API Gateway,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,350
CloudWatch Events, and even just invoking lambdas directly via the AWS

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,320
SDK, you can create fully functioning applications without managing

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,540
any servers and with minimal infrastructure. I think we have yet to

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,410
see how far the industry will push this pattern, and the future is

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,810
only looking brighter.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,440
Let's review what we learned in this module.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,100
We started out the module looking at how VPCs work with serverless architecture

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,440
and created a VPC endpoint to connect to Kinesis Streams.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,690
Next, we looked at all the different types of events sources in

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,000
AWS and set one up by configuring an endpoint in API Gateway.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,710
Security is essential for any application.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,630
So, I also showed you how to configure a custom authorizer for API Gateway

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,610
endpoints. And since API Gateway is an example of a push event source, we then

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,630
configured a lambda to consume Kinesis Stream events,

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,330
which is an example of a pull event source. And that's all of the

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,840
serverless architecture‑specific content in this course.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,790
In the next module, we're going to look at tools and best

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,590
practices for monitoring your applications,

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:31,000
including setting up X‑Ray for tracing requests and CloudWatch alarms for monitoring application health. See you in the next module.
