00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.570
Monitoring is important for any application,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.970
but AWS gives you some powerful tools that give you insight

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.660
into how your serverless applications work.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.880
Without X‑Ray,

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.960
it would be difficult to properly troubleshoot many of the

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.540
issues inherent in a distributed application.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.100
Indeed,

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.960
the creation of the X‑Ray service makes it even more practical to

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.580
invest in microservice architecture in AWS.

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.440
Let's take a look at what we covered in this module.

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.000
We started with a high‑level explanation of the X‑Ray service before

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.400
moving on to the specifics of tracing. With that knowledge under our

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.060
belt, we configured X‑Ray tracing for API Gateway and a lambda

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.240
function. Once that was complete, we created a CloudWatch alarm to

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.830
watch for errors on our lambdas and took a look at what other alarms

16
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.140
were possible.

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.790
Finally,

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.000
we removed all the demo resources to avoid a costly AWS

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.520
bill. And that's it for this course, AWS Developers:

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.870
Serverless Architecture and Monitoring.

21
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.290
If you've watched the entire AWS Developer path here, at Pluralsight, then

22
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.430
you certainly deserve a reward for reaching the end.

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.650
At this point, you should have all the knowledge to try your hand at

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.940
the AWS Developer Associate Certification exam.

25
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.860
It would be useful to go back through some of the content to study and take a

26
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.270
look at some of the study materials provided by AWS as well.

27
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.000
Best of luck if you're going to take the exam, and I hope to see you again. Thanks so much for watching.
