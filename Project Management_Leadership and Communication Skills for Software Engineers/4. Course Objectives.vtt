00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:05.059
As we depend more and more on technology in our lives

2
00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:06.638
and in our professional environment,

3
00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:09.232
we're tempted to think that technical advantages

4
00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:11.703
are solving all of our problems,

5
00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:15.985
but in everything from plane crashes to everyday business we conduct,

6
00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:20.885
the human side of things is a key factor for our success or failure,

7
00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:25.403
so the course objectives are: to improve your basic

8
00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:27.585
leadership and communication skills,

9
00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.585
to help you be more effective leading and managing people,

10
00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:39.000
and to enhance your career potential and opportunities. Now let's go over the course modules.
