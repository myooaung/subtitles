00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:07.561
What is the most critical skill a leader can possess when working with others?

2
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.032
What do you think it is?

3
00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:13.326
The ability to communicate appropriately is an essential

4
00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.294
component for effective leadership.

5
00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:17.494
In this study,

6
00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:25.561
43% of respondents identified communication skills as the most critical set.

7
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.032
Now when that question was flipped around,

8
00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:29.090
in other words,

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.749
when employees were asked what mistake leaders made when working with others,

10
00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.561
41% (not shown on this chart) identified the inappropriate use of

11
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:43.561
communication as the number one mistake leaders make.

12
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.253
The inappropriate use of communication as the number

13
00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:49.561
one mistake leaders could make.

14
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:55.061
So the data, I will suggest to you,

15
00:00:55.061 --> 00:01:00.561
that communication is essential to leadership is overwhelming.

16
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.288
Let me tell you a secret.

17
00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:05.561
The secret to successful leadership.

18
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:07.661
You hear it all the time,

19
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:11.511
aspiring team leaders or managers want to know the most important

20
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.275
key to an esteemed business leader's success.

21
00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:18.561
I'm thinking the answer must be something like inspiring leadership,

22
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.561
technological innovation, savvy marketing,

23
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:25.061
financial planning, all of which are important of course,

24
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:30.561
but their jaws drop, their eyes pop when they learn the secret.

25
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:30.914
Generally,

26
00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:34.443
the leader success is directly tied to his or her

27
00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:36.561
ability to focus on business fundamentals.

28
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:42.288
Certainly, strong and effective leaders stress fundamentals like discipline,

29
00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:45.099
accountability, strategic alignment to the business,

30
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.561
managing to his or her values and empowering employees.

31
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:53.561
All great skills, certainly.

32
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.894
Could the secret be the ability to have mastered the

33
00:01:56.894 --> 00:01:58.561
six basic functions of management?

34
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:04.561
Leading, planning, organizing, staffing, controlling, and communicating?

35
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:05.311
By the way,

36
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:08.311
if you want to learn more about these basic project management skills,

37
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:12.561
please check out my class titled, Project Management for Software Engineers.

38
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.561
It's a great companion class for this class.

39
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.106
Well, the secret to successful leadership is,

40
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.561
of course, effective communication.

41
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:22.561
I mean, think about it.

42
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.561
How do the best leaders motivate and inspire their people?

43
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.176
Through clear communication.

44
00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:31.946
How do the best organizations promote discipline,

45
00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:34.161
accountability, and strategic alignment?

46
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.561
Well, with clear communication.

47
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:42.275
In real estate, you've heard the old clichÃ© many times.

48
00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:44.561
It's location, location, location.

49
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:55.561
Well, in business leadership, it is communication, communication, communication.

50
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.715
What makes a great leader?

51
00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.561
What makes you stand out from the crowd?

52
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.418
Let me tell you.

53
00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:03.561
It's effective communications.

54
00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:08.111
A big part of your job now as the new team leader is

55
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.561
communicating with others; your team, your customers,

56
00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:14.561
and your management in a different and much more influential way than

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.361
in your previous assignment as a software engineer.

58
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.561
You're going to have to amp it up.

59
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.186
Leaders need to be great communicators.

60
00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:27.561
One of your most important skills will need improvement on.

61
00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:32.561
It is hard to imagine a successful leader who is not a good communicator.

62
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.208
As a software engineer,

63
00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:38.737
you may not have considered how important communicating with others is,

64
00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:45.561
and as software engineers, we may not have had much of a need but now you do.

65
00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:49.561
You will need to lead and manage business outcomes.

66
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.561
You will now be the rainmaker and therefore the influencer.

67
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:54.761
Managing customer expectations.

68
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.561
The customer and stakeholder should never be

69
00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:00.361
wondering about how the project is going.

70
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:01.961
Managing the project team.

71
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.761
Your team should not be wondering on what to do next and

72
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:12.407
your direct report manager should not be in the dark about

73
00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:14.561
your project's progress either.

74
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.811
Communicating with your management.

75
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:18.624
You will need to provide regular and consistent feedback

76
00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:21.894
to your manager about your team's activities and any

77
00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.617
issues you may have and of course,

78
00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:28.961
listen and receive guidance and direction from your manager that you

79
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.561
will then need to later communicate to your team.

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.161
Lastly,

81
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.361
effective communication may enhance your professionalism and

82
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.561
the perceived success of your new team.

83
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:49.000
Okay, how do you think you can best connect with your new team? Well, let's see.
