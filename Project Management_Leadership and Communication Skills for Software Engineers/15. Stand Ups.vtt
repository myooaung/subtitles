00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.891
This section will be on stand-ups.

2
00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:06.781
You mean, I can't sit down?

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.899
Stand-ups are an extremely effective way to gauge the pulse

4
00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.781
of your team's daily tasks and progress.

5
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:16.281
So now you are a team leader.

6
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.781
You are responsible for your team's productivity.

7
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.781
So how do you know how they are doing?

8
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.781
Let's see how stand-ups will help you accomplish your need to know

9
00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:30.781
what's going on in a simple and team-oriented approach.

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.503
Oh, and yes, I want everyone standing,

11
00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:37.392
unless of course for health reasons someone needs to sit,

12
00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:37.781
certainly.

13
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:43.031
So what exactly is a stand-up?

14
00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:44.781
Let's see.

15
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:46.381
So what's a stand-up?

16
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.781
Stand-ups are pretty much all verbal.

17
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.481
There may be some note taking by the participants,

18
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.131
but no notes are usually brought to the stand-up unlike a meeting.

19
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:59.681
Certainly there are exceptions and do what you need to do to make

20
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:02.886
stand-ups work the best for you and your team.

21
00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:06.202
A definition: A stand-up is really just a quick

22
00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.781
discussion with a small team or group.

23
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:11.981
Quick means 5 to 10 minutes, 15 tops.

24
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.981
It shouldn't be any longer; otherwise it is a real

25
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.114
meeting and stand-up means just that.

26
00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:19.448
Stand up, no sitting.

27
00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:23.114
We do this to keep it short and as I mentioned,

28
00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:26.114
of course, if someone has a hardship in standing,

29
00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:27.781
we certainly let them sit.

30
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.114
Stand-ups can be planned or spontaneous.

31
00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:37.000
I do both. Okay, now let's look at the benefits.
