00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.716
This quote is just perfect.

2
00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:10.480
"The palest ink is better than the best memory, " an old Chinese proverb.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.533
If you don't capture the discussions and put it into a

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.112
form that can be easily retrieved, read,

5
00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:22.813
and understood later, the outcomes and the agreements can be lost,

6
00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:25.480
hence losing valuable project time.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.245
You know, you're really documenting history,

8
00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:32.258
what really happened, and you're doing it as you see and interpret it and again,

9
00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:34.480
that is very, very powerful.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.432
But you always document it in an honest and ethical way and your

11
00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:47.480
projects will stay on track and move forward successfully.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.147
Here is how you manage the meeting outcome.

13
00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:51.480
Basically, you're taking notes.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.528
Okay, here is what you've got to do.

15
00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:58.337
So you will take notes, period, always good clear notes,

16
00:00:58.337 --> 00:01:01.355
or you'll have someone in there supporting you,

17
00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.480
taking those notes.

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.480
Use paper, pen, or laptop or whatever works for you.

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.480
Use your agenda as a template and fill in the blanks with your notes.

20
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
In other words, you're going to have an agenda item.

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.662
Someone is going to speak or talk about at topic and take notes in

22
00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:17.753
that gap between that and the next list item.

23
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.844
So sometimes I have an agenda that gets sent out and then I take the

24
00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:24.585
agenda and that extra space after each list item,

25
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:30.480
so I have room to either write in pencil or on the laptop to take notes.

26
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
Document action items for each topic on the agenda.

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.813
Who, what needs to be done, and the due date,

28
00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:39.480
or no action if there is no action.

29
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.591
Document agreements.

30
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.480
Document all decisions made and their rationale.

31
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.623
Sometimes we make decisions and we kind of forget,

32
00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:52.480
why did we do that, and then you have to have another meeting to rehash.

33
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.147
Document issues.

34
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:55.480
What are the issues facing the team?

35
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.954
Some will get assigned as action items and some may just

36
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:01.480
be on the list for the next meeting.

37
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.194
And then you want to validate the next meeting.

38
00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:05.480
Make sure the date and time and location are good for the

39
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.080
team so you can maximize attendance.

40
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.480
Okay, here's a tip.

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.480
Famous last words: I don't need to write that down, I will remember it.

42
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.480
So you as a meeting leader always need to write everything down.

43
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.833
Hopefully other attendees are also writing things down,

44
00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:27.480
but you are responsible to write everything down as I have listed above.

45
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.480
Okay, now let's send out the meeting minutes.

46
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.480
Okay, now let's send out those meeting notes.

47
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.435
It is critical that you send out meeting notes as soon as possible,

48
00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:44.147
within a few hours if you can, and no more than the next day,

49
00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.813
while things are still fresh,

50
00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:49.480
not only in your mind but the attendees' minds as well.

51
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.116
Use your agenda as the template and fill in the blank so it is easy to

52
00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:55.147
add the notes to an existing electronic template.

53
00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:59.480
You can send out as a text in the body of the email,

54
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.844
your notes, and that would be fine,

55
00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:05.480
or send out as an attached document if you want.

56
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.718
Also,

57
00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.575
you may have other documents that came up in the meeting and

58
00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:11.413
you'll want to attach those to the email as well.

59
00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:17.480
And then if there is another meeting, send out the next meeting request.

60
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.753
Okay, here's a tip.

61
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:23.525
I think it's more likely for people to read your meeting notes if they are

62
00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.813
in the body of the email rather than the attachment.

63
00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:28.147
If it's an attachment,

64
00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:34.006
then there is one more thing to look at and click on and open up and it might

65
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.480
be just that one extra step they don't feel like taking.

66
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.298
So I typically like my meeting notes to be actually in the

67
00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:46.355
body of the email and then I attach any more details to the

68
00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:49.480
email as just simple attachments.

69
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.480
Okay, here is one final quote for this section.

70
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.480
So before I jump right into this quote, let's do a really quick recap.

71
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.715
We've planned, we've prepared, we've built the agenda,

72
00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:10.180
we sent a meeting notice out, we conducted the meeting,

73
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.480
we took meeting notes, we sent out meeting notes.

74
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.480
We've done a lot of work and why have done all that work?

75
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.245
Meetings at work present great opportunities to showcase

76
00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:28.480
your talent; do not let them go to waste.

77
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.844
So often we are cracking away at our office or cube and may not have had

78
00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:35.743
much exposure to other employees in the office or business.

79
00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:40.480
Now that you are the leader of your team and responsible for your team members,

80
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.369
it is your job to showcase your team, its accomplishments,

81
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.091
its ability to contribute to meeting agendas,

82
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:48.427
and their action items.

83
00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:51.585
It's important to show that your team makes a difference

84
00:04:51.585 --> 00:05:02.000
to the company and its bottom line. Okay, now let's move on to the next section on status reports.
