1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,577
So to this point in the module,

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:07,627
we have covered general tips and guidance for improving your verbal,

3
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:09,307
speech, and interpersonal skills.

4
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:13,682
Remember, you are now leading a team, working with customers,

5
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,195
spending more time with your management,

6
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:20,995
so I see that you need to have a set of rock-solid,

7
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:25,995
let's-talk skills in the following areas or scenarios.

8
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:34,995
The first is presentations, meetings, stand-ups, walk-arounds, and interviews.

9
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:39,722
These are the five key areas that I think are vital and important

10
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:42,995
to your success in your new role as leader.

11
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:46,995
Okay, and of course, they're all supported by my 5 C's.

12
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:52,995
Okay, now let's dive into presentations.

13
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,206
Here is the section on effective presentations.

14
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:59,918
Now what you don't want to hear from your audience after you present is,

15
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:04,995
can I bring a pillow and blanket to your next presentation?

16
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:10,051
And what you do want to hear when you complete your presentation is,

17
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,995
wow, that was really great!

18
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:13,995
Can you tell me more about?

19
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:14,662
For me,

20
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:18,995
it took a few years to get from attendees bringing pillows to my

21
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:32,000
presentations to where attendees felt that their time was well spent, so be patient and follow these simple guidelines that will speed you to success.
