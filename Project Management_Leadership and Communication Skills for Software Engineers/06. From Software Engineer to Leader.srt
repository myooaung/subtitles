1
00:00:01,506 --> 00:00:06,173
Are you ready to put down some of your technical skills and tools and

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:10,190
delegate that work to other and manage and lead your team?

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,980
Moving from technical duties to leadership activities can be

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,506
scary and as I've said in the overview module,

5
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:19,506
it was definitely scary for me.

6
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,597
Early in my career,

7
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:23,597
even the notion of delegation alone was foreign to me and

8
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:26,682
it took me a while to get through it.

9
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:35,506
This section will further help you face your fears and help you take that leap.

10
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:39,506
Your journey ahead of you is to move from software engineer to leader.

11
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,506
As a software engineer, you are an individual.

12
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:46,395
Your success was all about growing yourself,

13
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:52,506
but as a leader, success will now be about growing others.

14
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:57,506
I suggest to you to constantly and regularly think about how to grow your team.

15
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:00,506
I would put a reminder on your calendar for once a quarter,

16
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:00,756
say,

17
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,673
to review the activities you have underway to grow the

18
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:09,506
skills and qualities of your team, and what new ideas you have yet to implement.

19
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:12,506
Now part of growing your team is for you to let go.

20
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,822
Let go of those tasks you used to perform as a software engineer.

21
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:21,506
Maybe not all of them, but maybe quite a few of them and how do you let go?

22
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:22,756
Through delegation.

23
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:31,506
Now let's take a look at how best to implement delegation in your team.

24
00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:36,756
If you master the art of delegation, you will also be building trust big time,

25
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:41,453
because they will say to themselves, you trust me to do this?

26
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:46,506
This instills trust back to you and a deeper sense of responsibility

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,506
and motivation with the person you just delegated to.

28
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:53,583
Okay, determine the tasks or work to delegate.

29
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,506
Look at your entire workload.

30
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,717
Determine which tasks you might delegate,

31
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,769
place a team member's name or two next to each task,

32
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,506
call a meeting, discuss your plans, consider their feedback,

33
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,506
and then delegate the tasks you identified.

34
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:12,506
If you don't delegate enough, you will not have time to lead.

35
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:14,106
Provide clear instructions.

36
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:18,906
The key to successful delegation is being absolutely clear

37
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,506
about what you're expecting for the output,

38
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,506
for the finished product.

39
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:29,279
How much direction you provide to get from point A to point B will depend

40
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,980
on the level of expertise of the person doing the task,

41
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,453
but in all cases,

42
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:39,439
you need to be absolutely clear about what your expectations and goals are.

43
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,306
Next, empower your team.

44
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:44,106
Delegating provides an opportunity for employees,

45
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:47,792
team members, to develop their own skills,

46
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,506
knowledge and abilities.

47
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:52,318
By allowing your workers to make their own decisions,

48
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,006
you'll ultimately have employees who can work independently

49
00:02:55,006 --> 00:03:01,006
and deliver even more value to you and to the other team

50
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,506
members and to your company.

51
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,271
Avoid the need to micro manage.

52
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:08,212
That's always very tempting as you're moving from a software

53
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:10,381
engineering role to a leadership role.

54
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:14,506
Step away and give them room that it will be done.

55
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:18,035
Your door is always open and encourage them to ask

56
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,506
questions to you that they may have.

57
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:24,506
Remember, by delegating, you are also displaying trust.

58
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:27,306
Keep the task broader, more high level.

59
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:32,106
Allow members of the team plenty of room to develop their own

60
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:35,839
task or subtask which will work toward the general goal of

61
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,506
the project or the assignment.

62
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:43,506
Spend more time overseeing functions and tasks rather than creating them.

63
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:47,927
Your new role will be to oversee the tasks you are delegating,

64
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,769
review progress, review the status,

65
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,589
keep clear of any roadblocks for the team members,

66
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:57,506
and reiterate the expected outcomes.

67
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:01,784
Also, what I like to call as delegate up or out,

68
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,506
rather than say down, in this case.

69
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:07,506
Some bigger issues will not be delegated to the team.

70
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:12,506
You may in fact work them or in some cases, sit with your boss and delegate up.

71
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,401
Have your boss handle some tasks.

72
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,348
Like, for example,

73
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:19,233
you may need some help with funding your project and you know

74
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,506
your boss has a great relationship with the CFO.

75
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:26,741
Now delegating out means you may want to bring in outside resources,

76
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,728
contractors, or maybe consultants to help you get things done.

77
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,506
Okay, here's a tip.

78
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:38,506
Of course, in order to empower others, you need to delegate, but not dump.

79
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:42,006
Effective delegation is not about dumping the dirty work off

80
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:46,006
your desk or asking someone to jump in and fix something that

81
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,506
you let fall through the cracks.

82
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:59,000
These tactics will ultimately lead to a breakdown in employee satisfaction. Alright, let's do a little leadership sanity check.
