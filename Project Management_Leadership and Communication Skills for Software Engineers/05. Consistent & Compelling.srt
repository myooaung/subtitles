1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,142
Consistent.

2
00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:05,565
Able to maintain a particular standard or repeat a particular

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,276
activity or artifact with minimal variation.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:13,776
Okay, here is an example of what not to do, okay?

5
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Each status email you send out say on project X, is a different format.

6
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:22,109
It may even have a different subject, there may be different headings,

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,443
etc., and not easily recognizable by the recipient or the reader,

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,776
and here is what I want you to do, okay?

9
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:33,576
Each status email sent out to the team is a consistent and

10
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:37,776
standard format so the reader knows exactly what to expect and

11
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,776
it's easy to read and comprehend.

12
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:40,070
Okay,

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,011
we're going to go into great detail on email format

14
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:44,776
and structure later in this module.

15
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:49,776
Okay, let's go on to the last one, compelling.

16
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:53,776
The last of Michael's 5 C's is compelling.

17
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:56,693
That's attracting strong interest and attention in

18
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:58,776
the material that you've written.

19
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:02,776
Okay, here is an example of what not to do.

20
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:05,776
I have a couple subject lines, say, for an email for example.

21
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,109
One is status report.

22
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,776
Well, what does that mean?

23
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:09,776
Whose status report?

24
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,109
What is it about?

25
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,776
What project?

26
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:14,776
Unclear, not compelling, I might delete it.

27
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,443
Next example, OMS.

28
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,665
What does that mean?

29
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:19,776
What's OMS?

30
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:23,026
Maybe I'm even on the OMS project, but it is a status report?

31
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:23,776
What is it?

32
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,919
I do not know.

33
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,776
Not clear, not compelling, probably not going to open it.

34
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:30,144
Now here is another example,

35
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:36,776
as a subject in an email: Windows Uplift Project: Status and Actions for 11/21.

36
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,367
It gives me a lot of information.

37
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,092
I know it's the Windows Uplift project, I know it has to do with the status,

38
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,355
oh, and there's actions.

39
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:47,776
I wonder if I have actions, and it's for 11/21; I know the date.

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,717
Much better and I'm sure you can get creative and

41
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,776
write them even better than I can.

42
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:57,776
Now part of writing effective email copy is nailing down that subject line.

43
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:00,776
The subject line is like the gatekeeper of your email.

44
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:04,976
No one gets to read your email if they're not interested or

45
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:08,443
compelled to read and that interest is determined almost wholly

46
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,776
by the subject line of the email.

47
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:13,776
Now of course, the sender name can play a role as well.

48
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,476
For example,

49
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:19,026
if you got an email from the president of your company and the

50
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,867
subject line just had some gobbledygook in it,

51
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,776
my guess is you would still open it.

52
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:28,490
So the sender does have some cache if you will in the compelling

53
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,176
argument here of whether you should open or not,

54
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:35,176
but I'm really focusing on the subject and how important

55
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:38,776
it is to write great subject lines, and again,

56
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:41,776
we'll have a whole section devoted to emails and

57
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:43,776
writing emails later in this module.

58
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:47,776
Now let's summarize Michael's 5 C's.

59
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:48,776
Here's a tip.

60
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:51,776
Make a little post-it, yep, let's go old school.

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,298
You can put it next to you.

62
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,776
I put it on my computer monitor or maybe you put it somewhere on your desk,

63
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,658
so you can easily glance over to it to be sure

64
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,776
you're always following the 5 C's.

65
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:06,109
You will write many emails every day, documents every day,

66
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,140
presentations; all of them should follow the 5 C's.

67
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,776
It's very easy and takes very little time to do.

68
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,276
Remember, you need to be clear, concise,

69
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,776
courteous, consistent, and compelling in your communications.

70
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:32,000
They will lead to enhanced credibility resulting in your success. Now let's see what's in store for the remaining portions of this module.
