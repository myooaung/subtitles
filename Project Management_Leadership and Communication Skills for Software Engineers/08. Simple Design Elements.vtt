00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.699
So we talked about content.

2
00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.455
Now let's move on to simple design elements that I'd like you to use.

3
00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.000
The first, use a clean and simple design.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.819
Try not to get too fancy and keep it easy to read

5
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.805
and comprehend by your audience.

6
00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:20.755
Keep your text simple by using bullet points or short sentences

7
00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.788
and try to keep each one to one line only,

8
00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:26.455
that is without text wrapping.

9
00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:29.929
You can remove articles such as a and the sometimes to

10
00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.455
help reduce the word count on a line.

11
00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:36.244
You want your audience to listen to your presentation of your information

12
00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:39.598
rather than read the screen or read the presentation.

13
00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:46.455
And use a Sans-Serif font for body text, just like this slide.

14
00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:50.455
If you choose a different font, be sure they're easy to read.

15
00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:53.455
Choose a font style that your audience can read from a distance as well.

16
00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:55.955
That's why I'm suggesting Sans-Serif or without Serif

17
00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.455
and you can see with the two arrows.

18
00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:01.955
The yellow arrow on the left shows the little serifs on

19
00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:06.560
there and on the right there are none, so one serif on the left,

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.244
one sans-serif on the right and like this presentation itself,

21
00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:14.205
you'll know that it is Sans-Serif and avoid narrow fonts such

22
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:18.055
as Arial Narrow and avoid fonts that include fancy edges such

23
00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.378
as Times and things like that.

24
00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:23.609
Use dark text on a light background.

25
00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.455
Just like this slide.

26
00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:30.455
Align left or right, just like this slide, and check your spelling.

27
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:34.455
Nothing is more annoying or embarrassing as misspellings.

28
00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:37.455
To earn and maintain the respect of your audience,

29
00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:41.355
always check the spelling and grammar on your presentation and of course,

30
00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:43.155
Power Point has Spell-check in it,

31
00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:47.011
though at times it can be inaccurate so be careful and proofread.

32
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.122
Be creative.

33
00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:51.455
Remember, these are rules of thumb.

34
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.455
There is no one perfect approach to presentations so be creative.

35
00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:02.455
And I have a few more on the next slide.

36
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:07.455
Now here are a few more simple design elements I'd like you to consider.

37
00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:11.455
Make labels for charts and graphs understandable.

38
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:16.455
Use only enough text to make label elements in a chart or graph comprehensible.

39
00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.455
For example, on the left.

40
00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:22.455
I have the chart unnecessary detail, population in China, etc.

41
00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:28.055
A lot of words over there, but on the right it's just a little clearer: China,

42
00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:29.455
India, United States, etc.

43
00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:32.455
So it's a little clearer and easier to read.

44
00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:34.455
Next, make slide background subtle.

45
00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:36.855
For example, on the left again,

46
00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:41.000
I like the subtle contrast on the one on the right

47
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.182
where on the left it has the gray,

48
00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:46.455
a little harder to read and that's the next point as well.

49
00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:47.929
Choose a compelling template.

50
00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.244
A consistent template or theme that is not too

51
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.855
eye-catchy and not too wild or crazy,

52
00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:59.455
and you don't want a background or design to detract from your message either.

53
00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:02.455
And use high contrast between background color and text color.

54
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.663
It just makes your text and graphics so much easier to

55
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:08.288
read and they kind of pop out at you,

56
00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:12.455
such as the text color on this slide and the background being white.

57
00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:14.455
Very clean, very easy to read.

58
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:17.637
And you can also art to help convey your message,

59
00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:21.137
but when you use art in graphics to tell your story,

60
00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:25.122
don't overwhelm your audience by adding too many graphics to the slide,

61
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:25.455
okay?

62
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.771
Use art and graphics to help tell your story.

63
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.087
Don't overwhelm your audience by adding too many graphics to a slide.

64
00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:34.350
Don't make me think!

65
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.455
If the audience has to think too much, they will miss your point.

66
00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:42.455
Keep it simple and to the point.

67
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.455
And lastly, you can use the previous slides as a quick check list.

68
00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.455
After you put together your presentation,

69
00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:51.788
go through each bullet to see if you are following

70
00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:54.598
the guidelines and if you are not, that might be okay.

71
00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:56.979
If you believe what you have done is helping you

72
00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:06.000
deliver your message effectively. Okay, now let's move on to the next session on productive meetings.
