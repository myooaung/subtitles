00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.036
Here is a simple,

2
00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:05.145
but prescriptive checklist of items I would like you to use every

3
00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:08.940
day to better ensure your verbal communications are effective and

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.440
to get your message across even better.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.614
Now we went into the full detail in the module,

6
00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.266
Know Your ABC's,

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:21.440
so I'm just going to touch on it here real quickly with a couple of slides.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.551
For all forms of communication you may do,

9
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:28.440
I would like you to think and plan your communications.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.040
Communication isn't a random happening as it normally is,

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.440
but it's just like building software.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.349
You think, plan, and develop software.

13
00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:40.804
So before you click send or save or print or stand up in front

14
00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:43.875
of a group to present or lead a meeting,

15
00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:47.353
I want you to be clear in what you say,

16
00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:50.773
that's transparent and be able to be easily comprehended,

17
00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:56.551
be concise, use as few words as possible to get the necessary information,

18
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.440
or a compressed information in order to be brief.

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.028
Be courteous always.

20
00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:09.381
Politeness in a way that shows consideration of others and of course,

21
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:10.440
good manners.

22
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.264
Be consistent,

23
00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:15.793
that is able to maintain a particular standard or repeat a

24
00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:19.440
particular activity or artifact with minimal variation.

25
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.808
And of course, be compelling.

26
00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:27.019
You want your readers or audience to listen to your message,

27
00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.440
be attracted to your message,

28
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
and it will encourage strong interest in attention as well.

29
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.154
I mentioned this in the module, Know Your ABC's,

30
00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:38.758
but I'm going to mention it again here; I think it's very helpful.

31
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:42.895
So I have a little post-it on the side of my computer and

32
00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:46.690
that way you can easily glance over and be sure you are

33
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.253
always following the 5 C's.

34
00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.440
It's just a simple little check list.

35
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.583
You're getting ready to send out an email or finish a

36
00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:56.154
presentation and just kind of glance over and go,

37
00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:57.869
yes okay, is this slide clear?

38
00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.726
Is it concise?

39
00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:00.440
Oh, maybe I'll shorten this up.

40
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.607
Is it courteous?

41
00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:04.718
I want to make sure that it is.

42
00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:05.884
Is it consistent?

43
00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.440
And of course, compelling.

44
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.000
Now let's check out and have a quick overview of what's coming in the rest of this module.
