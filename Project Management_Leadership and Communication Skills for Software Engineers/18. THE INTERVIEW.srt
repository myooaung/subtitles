1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,079
The interview.

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,416
Coming to an office near you.

3
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:07,532
So continuing with our theme of this course,

4
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,583
you are now responsible to hire and build your team.

5
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,230
Before you hire anyone,

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,368
you will likely have to interview candidates to join your team.

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:20,701
They may come from other departments or outside your company.

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,701
It is very important to get the right people for the job.

9
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:28,701
So let's see how you can improve your interviewing process.

10
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,519
Let's face it.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,701
Knowing how to interview can be a challenge.

12
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:35,301
Conducting an interview isn't always fun and it doesn't

13
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,701
come all that naturally to people.

14
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:38,156
Why?

15
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:42,701
Well, most interviewers are unprepared with the appropriate interview questions.

16
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:47,701
In fact, unprepared or at least uncomfortable with the entire process.

17
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,005
Actually,

18
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,266
I love it and I look forward to it because I'm prepared and I

19
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,069
can't wait to add new people to my team.

20
00:00:55,069 --> 00:01:00,227
So don't take this lightly because the stakes are high in terms of building

21
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,558
your team and furthering your own and your team's success.

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,701
This section will give you the basics so you can find and keep the best.

23
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:14,995
"Great vision without great people is irrelevant,

24
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:19,701
" by Jim Collins and his book, Good to Great.

25
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,145
You might add this book to your professional improvement reading list,

26
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,701
by the way; it's a great read.

27
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:30,246
After all, a company is only as good as the people it keeps and in your new role,

28
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:41,000
now you have this responsibility on your shoulders. I believe that people and only people is what makes the world go around.
