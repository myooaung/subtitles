Hello.

2
00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.286
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight and welcome to Leadership

3
00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:09.429
and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay, let's see what I'll be covering and presenting in this course.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.263
First, here's a story.

6
00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:24.000
I was about two years out of graduate school and just loved to write software.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I worked for a major aerospace company, heads down, and cranked out code.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.105
Life was grand.

9
00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:34.526
Then after almost one year exactly, after I started with the company,

10
00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.440
my boss' boss' boss came to me and say, hey,

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
I think you've been doing a nice job and I'd like you to lead a team for me,

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.118
maybe about 5 to 8 developers, and work with the customers,

13
00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:49.000
figure out and document requirements, hold meetings,

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
write agendas, status reports, and oh yeah--by the way--you start tomorrow.

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.421
I was 26 and I didn't know squat about leadership or management,

16
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:03.818
so sometime between leaving his office and heading back to my cubicle,

17
00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:06.000
the panic started to set in.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.091
Hire, he said?

19
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:08.182
Build a team?

20
00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:10.000
How do I do that?

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.389
Customers?

22
00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:11.556
Who are they?

23
00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:12.722
Where are they?

24
00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:17.000
You mean, I have to get up and go introduce myself?

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.714
Hold and conduct meetings?

26
00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:23.000
I have to be honest with you; I was overwhelmed.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.667
I had never done anything remotely like that.

28
00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.000
I loved coding software.

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.842
Well, this is what this class is all about.

30
00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:36.571
If you've found yourself in a situation somewhat similar to this,

31
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.000
then this class is for you.

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Okay, let's check out this quote.

33
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.471
Here are the results of a survey.

34
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:51.000
A survey of corporate recruiters conducted by the Graduate Management

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.400
Admission Council reported that 86% of corporate recruiters said

36
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
strong communication skills were a priority.

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
They didn't say they were required.

38
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.000
They said they were a priority.

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.800
So if you weren't sure why you were here or why you were taking this class,

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.000
maybe now you do. Let's check out some more reasons on why you're here.
