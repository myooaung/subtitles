1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.872
Your first day on the job.

2
00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:05.245
So, what do you do first?

3
00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:10.245
Your first day on the job as the new leader of your team.

4
00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:17.245
Well, here is the guidance I promised you in this section.

5
00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.245
You are now the team leader, you have a team of three members.

6
00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.771
You were just promoted to a team leader,

7
00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:26.298
you still will have some software engineering tasks,

8
00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:32.245
but you will likely be spending about 50+% on leadership responsibilities.

9
00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:36.245
Your job as a communicator starts now.

10
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:40.370
So before we dive into the remaining course modules on leadership,

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.063
verbal and written communication, let's continue with our course scenario,

12
00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:46.245
your first day on the job.

13
00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:50.245
So before you rush out and talk to your customers and jump in and

14
00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.912
solve problems you think you know the answers to,

15
00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:57.245
I recommend the following.

16
00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.045
It's critical to devote time and energy to

17
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.845
establishing how you want your team to work,

18
00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:06.967
not just what you want them to work on and achieve.

19
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.856
The first few weeks are critical because people will start

20
00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:14.937
forming opinions pretty quickly and these opinions tend to

21
00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:17.245
be hard to change later.

22
00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:20.745
So if you don't take time up front to figure out

23
00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:25.578
how to get the team working well, problems are always going to come up.

24
00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:28.245
Let's get to know each other.

25
00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:28.721
You know,

26
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.055
one of your first priorities should be to get to know your team members

27
00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:37.245
and to encourage them to get to know each other even.

28
00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:41.245
Resist the urge to immediately start talking about the work and the

29
00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:43.620
tasks and focus instead on fostering solidarity,

30
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.120
harmony, and team work.

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.495
You might consider holding an offsite or some beginning

32
00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.745
meetings with team building exercises.

33
00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:53.745
For virtual teams, people working remotely,

34
00:01:53.745 --> 00:02:00.245
it might mean starting calls by getting updates on how each person is

35
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:03.245
doing or hosting virtual get-to-know-each-other meetings.

36
00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:05.467
Show what you stand for.

37
00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:09.467
Use your initial interactions with team members as an

38
00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.657
opportunity to showcase your values.

39
00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:12.892
Who are you?

40
00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:16.598
Explain what's behind your decisions, what your priorities are,

41
00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:20.245
and how you would evaluate the team's performance,

42
00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:24.245
you know, individually or collectively as a team.

43
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:27.719
Walk them through what metrics you might use to gauge their

44
00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.666
progress so that they understand how they'll be evaluated

45
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.771
and what's expected of them.

46
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:38.666
Team members always want to know how you will define success for the team.

47
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.613
So by communicating your vision and values,

48
00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:47.245
you will show your team that they are committed to an open-door policy,

49
00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:53.245
transparency, and create a positive momentum around yourself and your new role.

50
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:58.245
You will also need to explain in detail how you want the team to work.

51
00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.561
When you have newer team members coming on board,

52
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:05.945
don't assume that veteran team members will explain to the new recruits,

53
00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:06.995
the new hires,

54
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:12.245
how meetings are supposed to be run or the best ways to ask for help.

55
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:18.245
It's your job as a leader to set expectations and explain processes.

56
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:20.892
If you don't make those norms clear for everyone,

57
00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:24.078
you risk creating an environment where people feel excluded,

58
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:28.245
uncertain, or unwilling to contribute.

59
00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.245
Set and clarify your goals.

60
00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:35.045
One of your most important tasks as a team leader is to

61
00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:37.929
set ambitious but achievable goals, stretch people.

62
00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:44.689
Make clear what the team is working toward and how you expect it to get there,

63
00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.801
and by setting these goals early on,

64
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.245
the group's decision making will be clear and more efficient

65
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:56.774
because they'll know what the goals are and you'll lay the

66
00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:59.245
framework for holding team members accountable.

67
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:02.995
I'm a big believer in accountability and don't be afraid

68
00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:05.245
early on here to over communicate.

69
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.774
If there is one thing that new leaders need to remember,

70
00:04:09.774 --> 00:04:12.245
it's that over communication, over communicating,

71
00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:16.245
in the early days is preferable to the alternative.

72
00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:18.467
It's always best to start with a little more structure,

73
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.245
more touch points, more check-ins at the beginning,

74
00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:22.967
how are you doing, what's going on?

75
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:27.634
I've never considered or encountered a situation where a team member says,

76
00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.023
boy,

77
00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:31.912
I wish the boss would stop communicating with me; I'm

78
00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:34.245
really tired of hearing from him.

79
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:38.245
So you shouldn't want to hear that, and look for early wins.

80
00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:42.245
Identifying and solving a business problem that has quick and dramatic impact

81
00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:45.912
early will show that you can listen and get things done.

82
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:51.245
Make sure you do this as a team from listening to the inputs of your team.

83
00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:54.674
Maybe there is a longstanding employee frustration or

84
00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:57.245
issue or an outdated work process.

85
00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:01.034
Maybe there is a project that you can easily fund or prioritize,

86
00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:05.816
so taking quick action demonstrates that you are connecting and learning,

87
00:05:05.816 --> 00:05:12.245
but most importantly, achieving an early win builds team momentum.

88
00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:16.745
It motivates people and you can win good will you might

89
00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:22.192
need later if the going gets tough, but don't do it in a vacuum.

90
00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:24.087
You know, talk and communicate, listen,

91
00:05:24.087 --> 00:05:27.245
and get their ideas and try to implement their ideas.

92
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:34.245
This will build trust and as you'll see later in this course, trust is huge.

93
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:42.245
Okay, there are a few things I want to share as well of what you should not do.

94
00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.912
Here are the don'ts.

95
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.245
Some tips.

96
00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:50.553
Don't try to accomplish the work without first

97
00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:53.245
building relationships with the team.

98
00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:55.982
You've just been promoted, I know you have a lot on your plate,

99
00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:57.598
but be patient, speak with everyone individually,

100
00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:01.127
and as a group, understand the group, understand the issues,

101
00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:07.245
and understand the work that's on the table from their viewpoint.

102
00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:11.245
Don't assume that your team members understand how you or others work.

103
00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:16.245
Take the time to explain processes and your expectations.

104
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:19.322
When they understand your expectations,

105
00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:24.245
that helps drive quality work towards your goals.

106
00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:27.245
Don't be afraid to communicate early on and repeatedly.

107
00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:32.245
You do not want your team to be unsure, lost or confused, or not listened to.

108
00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:36.134
What you don't want to hear from your team is, what is he doing?

109
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:37.245
What does she think?

110
00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:42.456
You want to make sure that that's very clear about who

111
00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:46.245
you are and what you're trying to do.

112
00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:49.620
We covered the interconnection of successful leadership with effective

113
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.495
communication and we see how they go hand in hand.

114
00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:57.245
Now here are the coming attractions of this course.

115
00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.767
Lead and they will follow.

116
00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:03.941
In this module we will discuss what it is to be a leader such as how to

117
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:07.745
build trust in your team and with your customers,

118
00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:10.807
interviewing new team members, building team skills,

119
00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:16.245
motivating your team, focusing the team on priorities and business goals,

120
00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:19.245
and the developing best practices, processes,

121
00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.245
and standards for your team.

122
00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:24.553
Next will be Know your ABC's.

123
00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:27.245
Of course, this is the writing module.

124
00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:30.512
This module covers several written communication settings

125
00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:33.312
such as presentations and their content,

126
00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:36.745
forms of written communication with your customers,

127
00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:39.745
writing meeting agendas, writing meetings notes,

128
00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:43.578
communicating meeting notes, writing professional emails,

129
00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:48.245
writing professional status reports, writing interview questions,

130
00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:54.245
and other settings where leaders need clear and concise writing skills.

131
00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:56.304
The last module, Let's Talk.

132
00:07:56.304 --> 00:08:00.833
This module will focus on the verbal communications and also that

133
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:06.388
interpersonal aspect of verbal communication such as body language,

134
00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:09.602
class, style, finesse, personality, humor,

135
00:08:09.602 --> 00:08:10.245
confidence.

136
00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:20.000
So this module will really be the touchy-feely module if you will. Okay, let's summarize what we've discussed in this module.
