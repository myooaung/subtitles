00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:03.955
So what is your tempo or pace?

2
00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:09.288
If you don't know, think about your own behaviors as we review this slide.

3
00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:11.538
Use language that's distinctly your own.

4
00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:15.844
People will begin to more easily identify and understand your communications.

5
00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:20.288
Let your values come through in your communication.

6
00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:20.700
Often,

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.817
leaders or project managers will opt for the sanitized corporate

8
00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:29.788
voice instead of their own because they think the former is more

9
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:32.288
eloquent and maybe even more appropriate.

10
00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:35.788
That is not to say that correct grammar and the use of language aren't

11
00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:38.888
important; strong leaders know how to string a sentence together,

12
00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:41.288
but don't focus only on eloquence.

13
00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:45.652
Concentrate on being distinct and the real you.

14
00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:47.288
People want real.

15
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:49.788
People respect real.

16
00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:52.288
People follow real.

17
00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:55.152
Here is what I want you not to do.

18
00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:59.288
Every morning you just head straight to your office and close the door.

19
00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:01.538
Here is what I would like you to do.

20
00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:05.732
Every morning you come in and say good morning and get a pulse of your team.

21
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:11.510
Spend those few extra minutes to chat with a couple people; good morning,

22
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.288
how're you doing, etc.

23
00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:15.229
Here's a tip.

24
00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.464
Don't disguise who you are.

25
00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:24.288
Be genuine and people will respect you for it.

26
00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:28.288
Try to be available and visible as much as possible.

27
00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.955
This ability is about letting your teammates and your customers get

28
00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:35.988
a feel for who you are and what you care about.

29
00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:42.288
Be seen interacting with customers, stakeholders, and team members.

30
00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:46.621
It's easy to hide behind a computer today and send email messages to

31
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.177
others without seeing or interacting with them.

32
00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.844
I see this way too much.

33
00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.955
Although electronic communication serves a valuable purpose,

34
00:01:54.955 --> 00:02:02.288
it is no substitute for face-to-face or voice-to-voice communication.

35
00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.551
In today's environment,

36
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:07.341
people need to feel a personal connection to you

37
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.288
and the work that you believe in.

38
00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:11.235
Do a walk-around,

39
00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.341
to make sure you're allocating time regularly to be out on the floor,

40
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.955
in the cubicles, in the call center, in the computer lab,

41
00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.288
or wherever your team or stakeholders reside.

42
00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:27.288
I will talk more about that in the walk-around area later in this module.

43
00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:29.232
Now here is what not to do.

44
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.288
Someone shows up at your door and you turn them away.

45
00:02:32.288 --> 00:02:36.288
I see this a lot and it's not so much intentional per se.

46
00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.288
You're busy, you've got this going on, and it's hard to kind of break away.

47
00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:43.145
Here is what I would like you to do.

48
00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.288
Welcome anyone at any time.

49
00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.418
Yes, that can be tough when you are busy,

50
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:52.245
but if they took the time to come to your office,

51
00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:53.955
on their own, somewhat random,

52
00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:58.288
do not pass up the opportunity to hear what they have to say.

53
00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:02.288
It serves many purposes.

54
00:03:02.288 --> 00:03:06.288
Listening, caring, inclusiveness, etc.

55
00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:07.975
Here's a tip.

56
00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:20.000
Show your people that you're engaged and care about them and their work. This will greatly enhance productivity.
