1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,842
Based on the candidates that passed your phone interview,

2
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:07,000
you can now schedule them to come into your office.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,467
The goal of the in-person interview, of course,

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,858
is do they meet your threshold of requirements that we put

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,525
together in step 1 to join the team?

6
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,858
If so, they would be in the final selection list.

7
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:22,525
So have a prepared list of questions and based on the

8
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:27,358
requirements we wrote in step 1, you can prepare your list of written questions.

9
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:31,858
Here is where your verbal and interpersonal skills will come in handy.

10
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,858
Your job is to ask questions and to get them talking.

11
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:39,858
Involve your team in the interview process and in the decision process.

12
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:40,125
Remember,

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,858
your team members will work with the new hire probably more than you will.

14
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,858
Now you need to decide who on your team will also interview.

15
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:48,525
Is it one or two?

16
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:52,858
Maybe the full team, and if so, what is the form of discussion?

17
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,658
Everyone at once or one on one?

18
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,258
You make the call,

19
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,458
but whoever does the interviewing must always start

20
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,608
with the same list of questions,

21
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:06,458
though not all will be answered and they must always take

22
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,358
notes during and after the interview and you want to

23
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:10,858
review the results with the team.

24
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:15,408
So gather the team up, review all of the notes from each interview,

25
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,429
and have each person who conducted an interview

26
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,858
report out and share their experience.

27
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:26,858
Of course, always keep all documentation and notes.

28
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,858
Now, let's talk more about what you should ask.

29
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:30,191
Remember,

30
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,525
you're relying on your communication and leadership skills to pull

31
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:41,858
out and see what level of those skills they have.

32
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,658
Basically we just want to get them talking.

33
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:45,008
Remember,

34
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:50,287
we had three key areas we wanted to address earlier in the requirements?

35
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:53,858
Business, technical, communication and leadership.

36
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:57,647
And for me and my company, I focus on communication and leadership,

37
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:58,279
of course,

38
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,858
and my technical team will focus on the business and

39
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,858
technical aspects in their interviews.

40
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,767
So what do I like to do?

41
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:06,858
Well, get them talking.

42
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:11,858
So the most common and leading question is, can you tell me about yourself?

43
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:17,016
Now you really don't care too much about the specific answer to this question,

44
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:21,858
but more about the confidence, enthusiasm and passion that they display.

45
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:22,358
Also,

46
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:27,858
you might look at the speed of the response because the

47
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,921
speed of the response is the response.

48
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,858
Are they pausing, stalling or fumbling with the answer?

49
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,858
They may be showing a lack of self-awareness and self-esteem.

50
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,728
Now we're not trying to trip them up or confuse them,

51
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,858
or just want to let them run out and see what happens.

52
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:47,914
Come up with a list of open-ended questions to get them

53
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,858
talking like the one I suggested above.

54
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:52,308
Again, the point of the first interview,

55
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:55,458
if you will, in my case, in my interview,

56
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,058
is I'm looking for leadership and communication.

57
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,458
For the technical and business questions,

58
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,802
you would likely ask more specific and detailed questions and that is just

59
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,858
fine because that is exactly what you may be looking for.

60
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:14,858
Now let's see a more detailed sample question.

61
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:18,858
Here is another broad question, but just a little more focused.

62
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:21,700
Please rank these items in order of importance to

63
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,483
the success of an organization, and here are the items: technology,

64
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,983
customer service, communication, people,

65
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:31,108
and process and of course,

66
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:36,858
why they would rank them in the order they may rank them in.

67
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,608
What I like about a question like this is you will see where they gravitate

68
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,963
and what they might find themselves more comfortable.

69
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:45,911
If they say technology might be number one,

70
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:50,753
I feel they may be not the best, say for maybe a leadership role,

71
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,279
but may be perfect for a technical role,

72
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,108
and while they are answering, you are listening,

73
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,858
watching, learning and maybe thinking about some follow-on questions.

74
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:03,647
So you too can construct questions like this to get them talking,

75
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:09,858
and now that we have our in-person interviews complete or most of them,

76
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:15,858
we move to the next step, the follow-up interviews.

77
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:19,858
Next is the follow-on interview and it's here really more for completeness.

78
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,387
The goal is to further filter the list of in-person

79
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:25,858
interviews down to even a smaller list.

80
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,858
Say you have it narrowed down to two people and they are both just great.

81
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:33,858
Maybe a followup interview for both would be beneficial to really be sure.

82
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,636
Reflect, review,

83
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:38,136
and discuss the results of the in-person interviews with

84
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,191
your team and then do a down- select.

85
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:44,191
That term really just means reduce the list down,

86
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:47,858
I would say to two or three at the very most.

87
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:49,858
So if you've interviewed maybe four or five,

88
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:52,858
down-select down to two or three and then maybe those two or

89
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,858
three come in for the follow-on interviews.

90
00:04:56,858 --> 00:05:00,387
Invite and schedule the next round and then this time,

91
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,858
a little more of a deep dive.

92
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:06,858
Now in this step, you want a very deep dive in your discussions.

93
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,858
Can you find a couple of topics to really do that deep dive on?

94
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,358
Maybe come up with a work scenario they might find

95
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:16,858
themselves in and how they might get out of it.

96
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,858
Also, as always, keep all documentation and notes.

97
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,069
Okay, let's now say you are complete,

98
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:30,000
you have all your feedback and you're ready to finally select the candidate to hire.
