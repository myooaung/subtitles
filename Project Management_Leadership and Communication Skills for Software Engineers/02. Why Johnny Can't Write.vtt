00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:05.124
I suppose since you are taking this class that you believe,

2
00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:06.624
at least to some extent,

3
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:10.157
that writing skills are important or you want to better understand

4
00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:12.824
why everyone else says they should be important.

5
00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.824
Well, I'm here to tell you that they are extremely important.

6
00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:20.456
Now that you have the additional responsibility of your team,

7
00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:23.891
your writing skills and in fact, all of your communication skills,

8
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:24.957
verbal, interpersonal,

9
00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:30.824
etc., are critical and essential for the success of your team,

10
00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:32.670
yourself, and your organization.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.824
Now what does Johnny have to do with this?

12
00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:39.824
Well, Newsweek published the article, "Why Johnny Can't Write,

13
00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:41.491
" claiming that the U.

14
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:41.824
S.

15
00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:46.380
educational system was creating a generation of semi-literates as evidence of

16
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.245
the poor quality of student writing and let me tell you,

17
00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:56.298
in my many, many years of experience in management and leadership roles,

18
00:00:56.298 --> 00:01:01.324
the quality of writing from my beloved software engineers can be

19
00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:05.824
actually quite poor and leave much to be desired.

20
00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:07.324
You see, in a way,

21
00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:10.024
technology has made everyone in the workplace a writer

22
00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:12.213
and writing is a highly visible skill.

23
00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:15.713
When you send an email or other written communication,

24
00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:18.824
it is out there for people to see.

25
00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:20.324
It reflects on you,

26
00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:24.824
it reflects on your team and it also reflects on your management.

27
00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:30.824
So it's essential to get it right, hence, welcome to this module.

28
00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:31.699
Okay, communication.

29
00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:34.324
With emails, notes, letters, texts, tweets,

30
00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:35.636
you name it,

31
00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:40.324
most people spend a fair amount of time at work

32
00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.824
communicating via the written word.

33
00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.546
So whether you are messaging a colleague,

34
00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:48.657
writing to a manager, crafting a meeting agenda,

35
00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:52.046
writing skills can improve or hinder your career.

36
00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:52.491
Basically,

37
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:56.935
writing skills make a difference in how you come across

38
00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:59.253
in your professional environment.

39
00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.824
That's why they're so important.

40
00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.055
Next, credibility.

41
00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:10.824
People with good writing skills are generally seen as more credible.

42
00:02:10.824 --> 00:02:12.883
Credibility is trustworthiness as well.

43
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:17.824
Think to yourself how you would interpret an email from a colleague

44
00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:20.824
that was filled with typos and grammatical errors.

45
00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:21.586
At best,

46
00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:25.395
he was negligent in that he didn't even proofread his

47
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:31.324
message or use Spell-check or worse, he or she comes across as less intelligent,

48
00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:32.824
maybe less capable.

49
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:34.024
Next is success.

50
00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:38.424
Better writers tend to get what they need or are asking

51
00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.978
for and are perceived as more competent and more

52
00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:43.516
intelligent than their counterparts.

53
00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.824
It's just the way it is.

54
00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:46.353
Today,

55
00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:51.118
your reputation and your success in business are increasingly

56
00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:54.824
dependent on your ability to write well.

57
00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:55.213
Okay,

58
00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:58.713
some of the best consulting companies in the world

59
00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:01.824
agree with this; let's see who that is.

60
00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:03.538
Okay, here's the quote.

61
00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:07.824
"By writing well, you can stand out from the crowd.

62
00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:12.439
There is too much poor writing in the business world.

63
00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.666
" -- Pricewaterhousecoopers So for the success of your team,

64
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.824
your customer and yourself, you want to stand out from the crowd.

65
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.557
Be recognized for your team's ideas and accomplishments,

66
00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:25.824
and leverage this to greater career opportunities.

67
00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:27.471
Now what I mean by career opportunities,

68
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:29.824
I don't just mean say, a promotion to a manager.

69
00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:32.982
You may not even want that beyond your leadership role,

70
00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:36.224
but also maybe to other key roles like chief architect,

71
00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:39.024
project manager, maybe a senior business analyst,

72
00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:39.824
for example.

73
00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:44.491
A lot of other career opportunities may be available to you because

74
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:47.657
you are recognized and you're credible by others.

75
00:03:47.657 --> 00:03:56.000
Now let's cover some guiding principles to improve your writing. That is Michael's 5 C's.
