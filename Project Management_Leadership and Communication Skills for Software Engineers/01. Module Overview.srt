00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,921
I will be presenting the module, Know Your A B C's in the course,

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:12,136
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

5
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:19,500
Okay, let's get started with this very insightful quote.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,091
This is a great quote.

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:26,182
"No one really wants to read a document; they just want to know what it says.

8
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:29,833
" I think that's a great quote and that's a great

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,500
challenge to us as communicators.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,455
Let's face it.

11
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:33,409
People are busy.

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,273
They don't want to take the time to read,

13
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:40,750
yet you will still have to write things even if some of your

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,500
audience either won't read it or will barely read it.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,300
Guess what?

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,300
It is your job and your responsibility to write in

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,500
such a way that your audience, you know,

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,346
your customers, your team members, your management and stakeholders,

19
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:59,500
actually do read it.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,955
It is not an easy thing, but this module will give you the tools,

21
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:07,000
techniques and skills to help you on your way.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Okay, now let's see what I'll be covering in this module.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,735
This module focuses on writing communication skills in the

24
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:20,500
context of your new role as team leader.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,682
Okay, first why write?

26
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,500
Why get good at writing at all?

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,833
We will discuss that good writing leads to credibility which

28
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,500
is required for success as a team leader.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,700
Next, I'm going to cover Michael's 5 C's.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,850
This is my checklist and your prescription on your road to better writing.

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,400
The core of this module will cover five of the most important areas

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,000
that you need to grow and improve your writing skills.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,750
The first,

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,125
presentations and how you can effectively deliver the message

35
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:57,500
you need to and get the results that you want.

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,700
Meetings and how you can create effective agendas and

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,500
get the expected outcomes you need.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Status reports and why it is important to communicate progress,

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
plans, and issues regularly and consistently.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,038
Emails.

41
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:17,346
You've heard of structured programming and we will

42
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,500
talk about structured emailing.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,250
Lastly, interviews.

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,500
You will learn how to prepare and select your new hires for your team.

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,833
As a quick reminder, the next module,

46
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,167
Let's Talk will address the verbal communication

47
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:37,000
skills in these and other areas. Okay, let's get started.
