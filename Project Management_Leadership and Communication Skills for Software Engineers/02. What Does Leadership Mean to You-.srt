1
00:00:01,492 --> 00:00:03,048
What does leadership mean?

2
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:08,492
So let's first explore what leadership may mean to you and then compare and

3
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:12,492
contrast that to what leadership means to other leaders.

4
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:17,742
I think that's an interesting approach.

5
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:19,492
Let's see.

6
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:24,492
Okay, I would like you to sit back for a moment,

7
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:29,492
relax, and reflect on the questions I'm about to ask you.

8
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:33,492
What thoughts or images come to your mind when you think of a leader?

9
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,778
Maybe the president of your company or of the United

10
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:42,492
States or a military hero like me, or a social activist.

11
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:46,492
What qualities do you want your leaders to display?

12
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:47,030
Nice?

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,569
Friendly?

14
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,107
Strong?

15
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:51,338
Easy to understand and listen to.

16
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:51,877
Supportive.

17
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,492
Easy to respect.

18
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:54,692
Other qualities?

19
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:59,492
Which emotions do your leaders inspire within you?

20
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:03,610
Do you feel proud to be led by this person?

21
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,492
Do you feel excited, energized, happy, fulfilled?

22
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:10,992
What do you want and need from a leader so you can

23
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:12,492
feel successful and motivated?

24
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:15,825
Do you want them to be intelligent, supportive of others,

25
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,492
a great listener and communicator?

26
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:20,492
Now for me, I want to feel challenged and not disheartened.

27
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:25,021
I want to be able to respect my leader, my boss.

28
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,492
That's a biggie for me, respect.

29
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:28,429
How about you?

30
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:32,492
I think leadership means something different to each of us, as it should.

31
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,492
We each have unique needs of what we want from a leader.

32
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:39,159
We have different hot buttons or characteristics we

33
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,492
want to see displayed by our leaders.

34
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:45,405
So how you want to be treated by your leaders may be insightful as to

35
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,242
how you want to treat others in your leadership role and this

36
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,617
discussion was to help you understand everyone may want something

37
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:59,492
different from their leaders and hence, keep that in mind when leading others.

38
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:03,492
One size or approach to leadership does not fit all.

39
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,188
And also,

40
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:10,101
we have our own beliefs of how we will act or behave as a leader to others,

41
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,270
but in general, the leadership attributes,

42
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,381
qualities that we'll be discussing in this module,

43
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:20,674
for the most of us, are what I believe we are all looking for,

44
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,492
or at least a subset.

45
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:22,792
Okay,

46
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,692
now let's look at a couple of quotes by leaders and see how

47
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:31,492
they answered those questions and described leadership from

48
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:37,492
their perspective as leaders.

49
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,555
Here is what leadership means to David.

50
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:44,492
"Leadership is the collective action of everyone you influence.

51
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:50,492
Your behavior, your actions and your words; these determine how you influence.

52
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:56,030
Our job as leaders is to energize whatever marshals action within others.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,492
" Okay, I like this quote, but let me point out a few key words.

54
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:03,867
One is influence.

55
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:09,492
Another, actions and another, words.

56
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:13,184
Okay, I've called out those three.

57
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:17,492
Let's move on to the next quote.

58
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,387
Here is another quote I like.

59
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,913
"Leadership is the ability to inspire motivation in

60
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,492
others to move toward a desirable vision.

61
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:30,492
While management is focused on tasks, leadership is focused on the person.

62
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:35,075
All in all, the best leadership drives change and long-lasting motivation.

63
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:39,492
" So some key words here I'd like to point out from Josh's quote.

64
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:44,063
The first, inspire motivation.

65
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:47,492
The next, vision.

66
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:52,401
The next, focused on the person.

67
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:54,037
Drives change.

68
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,492
And long-lasting motivation.

69
00:03:56,492 --> 00:04:00,492
So very important key words also in this quote.

70
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:04,310
Now what I'd like to do in the next slide is summarize the key

71
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,492
words from the previous quote and this quote,

72
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:11,492
to make a very good point.

73
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:15,913
So what I did was gather up those key words and boil them down

74
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,492
into three different categories: connect,

75
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:22,492
change, and motivate, and let's see how I arrived at that conclusion.

76
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:26,184
Okay, some of the key words.

77
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:30,492
Focused on the person, influence, and words.

78
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:33,261
These are engaging, personal communicative terms.

79
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:36,492
I tie those to connecting with others.

80
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:40,856
Next are vision, actions, drives change.

81
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:44,492
I tie these to change.

82
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:49,492
Leaders, good ones anyway, are change agents without a doubt.

83
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:55,492
Next, inspire motivation and long-lasting motivation.

84
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,338
It is not just a motivator.

85
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,492
Maybe you get a Starbucks gift card.

86
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,305
That's nice and that could be motivating for what?

87
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,242
Maybe a day?

88
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:04,492
But is it long-lasting?

89
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,397
No, it is not.

90
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:11,159
Long-lasting motivation is a very deep and complex emotion built

91
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,825
up over a period of time and based on trust.

92
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:18,492
Okay, more on that topic later.

93
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,786
Alright, so leaders need to connect with others,

94
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:26,159
set a direction and drive change through inspiring and motivating others.

95
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,159
So as a new leader, during your first week on the job,

96
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,921
I would like you to do the following.

97
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:38,492
Sit down with a piece of paper and start jotting down some notes.

98
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,860
How are you going to connect with your team?

99
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,492
How are you going to implement change according to your

100
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:46,349
organization's requirements and how are you going to

101
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,492
motivate your team to achieve those?

102
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:56,000
That is your assignment. Now on the next few slides, I will help you get there.
