1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,449
Here is my list of leadership qualities,

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,358
but before I go over this list,

3
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:08,453
I want you to think about each item I talked about

4
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,279
and rate yourself on each item,

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,840
say 1 for not very much and 2 for medium and 3 for pretty good.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,340
It's just an informal rating,

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,790
but I'd like to have you think about where you sit in these different qualities.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,290
For those items you rate low,

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,140
that only means you have an area maybe to think about and improve upon.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,140
Okay, first on the list.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,540
Embrace and champion change.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,873
We discussed this in an earlier slide,

13
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,540
that leaders drive change and are change agents.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,318
Do you like change?

15
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:44,540
Change is typically not a natural attribute of most people, but is of leaders.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,207
Earned credibility across an organization.

17
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:51,364
In order for you and your team to be successful, work hard to earn credibility.

18
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,834
That is, you're honest, have integrity,

19
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:57,540
always follow through with what you say and do.

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,364
This will enable your team to be more productive in your organization and

21
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:05,540
enable broader career opportunities within your company as well.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,593
Ability to build trust.

23
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:09,224
We have already devoted a couple of slides on trust,

24
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:13,540
so you'll already know how critical it is as a leadership quality.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,386
Strong negotiation skills.

26
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:21,540
Most business interactions entail discussions and arriving at a consensus.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:21,807
Therefore,

28
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:24,473
leaders must have the ability to communicate clearly and effectively

29
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:27,449
to others during the discussions and negotiations.

30
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:32,540
Case in point, Eisenhower on my leading quote.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,487
Strategic planning skills.

32
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:37,908
This is important since you will need to set a direction for your team,

33
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:39,487
plan it, and execute it.

34
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:44,540
People want to know, where are we going and how are we going to get there?

35
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,415
Project and team management skills.

36
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,665
Yes, leadership is paramount and essential,

37
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:54,540
but you will still need basic and practical project and team management skills.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,540
I am devoting several slides to this topic later in this module.

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,873
Strong communication and marketing skills.

40
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:06,397
Certainly verbal and written skills are essential and I have devoted the next

41
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:10,969
two modules to those skills and what I mean by marketing is that you will need

42
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,873
to ensure that management knows about your team,

43
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:16,207
what it can do, its successes,

44
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:19,599
and how your team's outcome has supported the business.

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,834
This will result in your team receiving better projects to work on,

46
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:28,540
maybe more resources, and certainly better career opportunities.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,487
Strong interpersonal skills.

48
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,961
You want your team to feel that they can approach you,

49
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:36,826
talk to you and share important information with you.

50
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,254
Okay, so how did you do?

51
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:42,540
What is your score?

52
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,683
Now the score itself is not important, but instead,

53
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:48,415
for any items you gave yourself a 1 on, or even maybe a 2,

54
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:54,540
please take a moment, write down your personal plan to improve in those areas.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,246
Alright, lastly,

56
00:02:55,246 --> 00:03:00,540
a key skill that I think can be overlooked but is very important is inclusion.

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,540
That is the ability you have to make others feel included.

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,404
In our busy world of backlogs and time crunches,

59
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:10,222
we may tend to go to our go-to person or persons rather

60
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:14,358
than approach our business challenges with a philosophy

61
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,540
and foundation of inclusiveness.

62
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,440
This is important,

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,740
so I have devoted the next slide to the topic of

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:27,540
inclusiveness that every leader needs to perform.

65
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,873
A key leadership quality is inclusiveness.

66
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:33,373
That is the ability to make people feel included,

67
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,645
part of the team, a contributor.

68
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:39,329
Remember when you were the new kid in school and

69
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,540
realized you weren't in the in-crowd, or conversely,

70
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,540
you noticed the new kid who wasn't in your in-crowd?

71
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,540
There is nothing worse than being ignored, unappreciated, or not listened to.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,540
Now let's fast forward from the schoolyard to the work environment.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,119
It is not just about letting people talk as you go around the room in a meeting,

74
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,540
for example.

75
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,422
Inclusion is about being open to perspectives different from your own

76
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:07,096
and realizing that everyone's voice is important,

77
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:11,540
and making everyone feel their voice is important.

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,540
The minute someone does not feel included, they lose motivation and interest.

79
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,353
In other words, they are not productive or happy.

80
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,540
This is not good as a leader.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,893
You can set a good example by valuing each individual's opinions and making

82
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,873
everyone feel comfortable sharing their points of view.

83
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:30,540
Now again,

84
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,873
you do not have to agree with your view or

85
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,995
incorporate every opinion into a solution,

86
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:40,540
but you must listen, thank them, and appreciate their inputs.

87
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,397
As a leader,

88
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,540
you will have to make hard choices and decisions while at

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,040
the same time making people feel that their ideas are

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,540
appreciated and they feel included.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,040
Okay, that's a tough act.

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,540
Here's a tip.

93
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,873
Believing that certain people are good at only certain things will keep you

94
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:01,873
from fully leveraging your team's intellectual capital.

95
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:04,540
Okay, note to self.

96
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,540
When you feel included, you feel connected and motivated.

97
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,540
That tackles two of our three main tenets we talked about before.

98
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,096
Feeling connected and motivated.

99
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:20,373
And I suggest to you, if you feel connected and motivated,

100
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:26,540
you will likely be inspired to take action more easily and productively.

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Now that covers all three.

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you ready to make the leap? Let's see what I mean.
