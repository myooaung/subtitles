1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,858
Now I'll talk about the verbal and interpersonal side of meetings.

2
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:10,858
In one sense, leading a meeting is a little bit like giving a presentation.

3
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:15,858
That is, all eyes are on you and you are responsible for its success.

4
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:18,258
So, how are you presenting yourself?

5
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:21,858
Have a positive attitude and come ready for work.

6
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:23,380
How do you hold yourself?

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,684
Again,

8
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:27,336
have good posture and try and sit in a spot so you

9
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,358
can see and observe all attendees.

10
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,358
What should you wear?

11
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:35,858
Well, as with presentations, what you wear is important.

12
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,676
Maintain good eye contact.

13
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,858
This creates a connection with your attendees.

14
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,858
Remember, you're the focus when you are leading the meeting.

15
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,191
They are watching and learning from you,

16
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,858
and make a point to actively engage attendees.

17
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:48,608
Be inclusive.

18
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:51,983
They will either participate by being on the agenda,

19
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,691
maybe through discussions, and lastly through questions.

20
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,858
Make sure everyone has had a chance to say something.

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:00:59,911
And leverage their attendance.

22
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,437
I mean,

23
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:04,791
why would you invite them if you didn't want them to participate in some way?

24
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:10,858
Make sure they have all been involved, and how are the attendees feeling?

25
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:14,525
Check for body language and other visual cues to determine how

26
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,858
the meeting is going and make corrections.

27
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:21,858
A correction might mean an impromptu question to someone, things like that.

28
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:22,858
And here's a tip.

29
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,108
No matter how interesting you think your agenda is,

30
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:28,623
they will be watching you because you are the message.

31
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:36,858
Now let's see what I don't want you to do as a meeting leader.

32
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:39,040
So here is the bad and the ugly.

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,858
These are the things I don't want you to do when leading a meeting.

34
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,358
First off, never arrive late.

35
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:47,358
You want everyone to arrive on time and be punctual,

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:51,403
so if you're late, that sets the wrong precedence.

37
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,313
Not introducing everyone.

38
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,858
So always introduce everyone.

39
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:59,740
Everyone wants to feel included and others will know who to

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,858
ask when different questions come up.

41
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,858
Some people avoid eye contact.

42
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:04,258
Boy!

43
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:07,858
I cannot stand that, so always good eye contact.

44
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:09,287
And also not speaking with commitment.

45
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,382
People will pick up on that and think the meeting is kind of

46
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,787
soft and easy and maybe they won't want to stand up and pick

47
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:17,858
up commitments themselves.

48
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,171
Not being courteous.

49
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:24,858
Even if you disagree, be strong, be a leader, and always be courteous.

50
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,048
And focusing on the person.

51
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,429
What I mean by that is, if something goes wrong,

52
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:31,781
focus on the problem and how you're going to solve it,

53
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:34,858
not the person or what they did wrong.

54
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,525
And lastly, not confirming commitments.

55
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:42,858
You always must confirm commitments; they are very, very important.

56
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:43,917
Speaking of commitments,

57
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:52,000
commitments may be one of the most important elements or outcomes of a meeting. Let's see an example.
