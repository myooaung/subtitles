1
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:01,675
Okay,

2
00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:05,564
you are now the leader of your team and taking

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:08,286
responsibility for everything is required of you.

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:09,619
This can be hard.

5
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,953
We have pride and we have egos.

6
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,286
So a parting quote.

7
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:16,486
"Leadership consists of nothing but taking responsibility for

8
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:20,036
everything that goes wrong and giving your subordinates credit

9
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,911
for everything that goes well.

10
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:26,286
" Now this approach is a huge motivator,

11
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:34,000
builds enormous trust, and exemplifies true leadership. Okay, onto my final word.
