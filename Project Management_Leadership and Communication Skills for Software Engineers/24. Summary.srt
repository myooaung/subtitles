1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,813
This module focused on the verbal communications and the interpersonal

2
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:10,324
aspect of verbal communication such as body language,

3
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:16,820
class, style, finesse, personality, humor and other attributes.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,320
And we continued with our theme of the software engineer in

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,820
his or her new role as the leader and the added

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,820
responsibility to lead and build a new team.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,598
Okay, let's review our topics.

8
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,820
First, effective communication tips.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,504
We learned that not only what you say is important,

10
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,820
but how you say it is even more important.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,820
The delivery.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
How you say things is critical.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,445
Then we covered the 5 C's.

14
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:50,820
Again clear, that is to be transparent and easily comprehended.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,743
Be concise.

16
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:56,820
Use as few words as possible to give the necessary information.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,589
Be courteous.

18
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,820
Always be polite in a way that shows consideration of others.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,644
Be consistent.

20
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:07,173
That is able to maintain a particular standard or repeat a

21
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:10,220
particular activity or artifact with minimal variation.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,820
Next we covered presentations and you need to follow four key steps.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,173
Plan, prepare, practice, and present,

24
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:23,820
and this module focused on the practice and present; those are the

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,320
verbal aspects of those four steps and believe me,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,820
practice makes perfect.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,820
Next, meetings and we needed to follow four additional steps for meetings.

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,055
Plan, prepare, lead,

29
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:41,820
and follow up and in this module we focused on lead and follow up.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,153
A key outcome of any meeting is the commitments and

31
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,820
that's not a 1960s band from Britain, either.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,820
It is who will do something, what that worker task is, and when it is due.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,507
Next was stand-ups.

34
00:01:56,507 --> 00:02:03,820
Assemble your team and one by one, talk about progress, plans, and problems.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,925
Next was walk-arounds.

36
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,504
I know you have a busy day,

37
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:13,008
but make your walk-arounds part of your daily routine and you'll be amazed at

38
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:17,820
how you will learn and how your team feels more inclusive.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,420
Interviews.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,220
Get your candidates freely talking, ask open-ended questions,

41
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:37,000
and don't just focus on aptitude, but also on motivation and attitude. Okay, in the next module we will summarize the entire course.
