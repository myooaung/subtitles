00:00:01,064 --> 00:00:01,696
First off,

2
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:04,853
anyone that answered yes to any of the previous slide's

3
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:07,453
question is a great candidate for this course.

4
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:12,120
This course targets software engineers who have reached a point in their

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,372
career when the business is expecting them to begin leading,

6
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,064
managing, and influencing others toward a common goal.

7
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:22,635
Software engineers have great technical skills,

8
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:26,064
but maybe lacking sufficient and essential leadership and

9
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:30,264
communication skills that are required to meet the performance

10
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,597
expectations of their management, company,

11
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,464
and possibly of themselves.

12
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:38,197
So this course is for technical and business

13
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,439
professionals considering a leadership role.

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,814
Technical and business professionals already in the leadership role,

15
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:46,064
but need a little more help.

16
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:46,564
Also,

17
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:50,064
anyone interested in developing and improving their

18
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,064
leadership and communication skills.

19
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:56,953
In my experiences in observing hundreds of people in my career,

20
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:06,000
I am suggesting to you the following. Never stop learning and improving your leadership and communication skills.
