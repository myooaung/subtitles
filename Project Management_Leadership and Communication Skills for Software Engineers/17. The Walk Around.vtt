00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.797
The walk-around.

2
00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:06.576
We have explored many mediums or methods that you'll be using to

3
00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:10.771
communicate with your team or other members of your organization.

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:16.771
Here is another method and it is most informal and adhoc of them all.

5
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.771
This activity supports a more personal level of

6
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.771
interaction with casual dialogues.

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.771
Let's check it out.

8
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:27.104
Now why would we do a walk-around?

9
00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:30.104
To get connected and stay connected you need to

10
00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.628
walk around and talk to your team.

11
00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:37.771
Work alongside them, ask questions, and be there to help when needed.

12
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:42.694
And again, these are very casual drop-in visits.

13
00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:45.771
They are also very impromptu.

14
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:49.771
That is, unplanned with the employee or the team member.

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:54.771
Now sometimes I have them planned in mind as the leader.

16
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:55.247
For example,

17
00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:58.342
I'm going to get some coffee from the kitchen and on the way

18
00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:00.297
back I'm planning to stop at someone's office.

19
00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:01.613
I don't know which one.

20
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:04.771
But I do want to drop in on one or two people.

21
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:09.571
So that is really the extent of my planning and what I'm

22
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.771
calling the walk-around is also known as management by walking

23
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.271
or even management by wandering around, MBWA,

24
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.771
and these refer to a style of business management,

25
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.571
which involves leaders and managers like yourself,

26
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.971
walking around in an unstructured manner,

27
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:31.271
through the workplaces at random to check in with employees about

28
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:39.000
the statuses of their work or how they're doing. Now let's see the benefits and there are many.
