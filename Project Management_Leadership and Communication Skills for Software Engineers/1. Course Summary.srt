00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,250
I will be presenting the summary module in the course,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,214
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

5
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:15,500
Okay, now let's recap this course.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,875
In the module, The Interconnection of Leadership and Communication,

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,611
I shared with you a very illustrative quote: "Communication

8
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:25,944
is where leadership lives and breathes.

9
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:30,500
" It is really a very poetic way to represent the

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
interconnection of leadership and communication.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,625
This module covered the fundamentals of why leadership and communication

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,389
skills are so critical to your professional growth,

13
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:41,500
to your employer, and to your customers.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,833
We also dug deeper into the linkage between leadership and

15
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,375
communication and that you cannot have one without the other.

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:53,625
And lastly, we emphasized the importance of improving both of these skills,

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,900
leadership and communication, to improve your career opportunities,

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,700
your personal growth, your ability to mentor,

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,324
and grow your team.

20
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:04,618
In the module, Lead and They Will Follow,

21
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,071
I shared with you another illustrative quote: "Leadership is

22
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,500
the art of getting someone else to do something you want done

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,921
because he or she wants to do it.

24
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,868
" This is a more practical quote,

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:21,500
giving you insight that your success is all about growing others.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,682
So what does leadership mean to you now?

27
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:27,885
So you have learned that it is not just leading people to a common goal,

28
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:32,500
which is great, but more importantly it's how you are leading them.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Do they feel like they have accomplished something and do they feel empowered?

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,500
And if so, you have done a good job well.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,813
Connect, change, motivate.

32
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:47,063
We discussed first what you thought leadership meant and then we reviewed

33
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:52,167
two quotes and analyzed the words and discovered that the key action words

34
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:55,833
or phrases boiled down to connecting with people,

35
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:00,500
being change agents, and inspiring long-lasting motivation.

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
So that's a real great cheat sheet for you.

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,625
Follow the leader.

38
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,500
It's not a game anymore.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
We discussed several key attributes of a leader.

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,900
Trust, compassion, stability,

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,500
and hope were essential elements to encourage your team to follow you.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,700
Some leadership qualities.

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,900
In addition to the qualities we've just mentioned,

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,250
you will need credibility, negotiating skills,

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250
planning and management skills, and strong communication skills,

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,563
and I called it a leap of faith because we discussed that your

47
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:35,921
transition from software engineer to leadership roles required you to

48
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:40,974
realize that your success is all about growing others and one method

49
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,500
of doing this is through delegation.

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,938
Because through delegation you are instilling trust and giving your team

51
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:49,833
a greater sense of responsibility and empowerment.

52
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:54,500
These are more complex, long-lasting motivation factors.

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,250
We wanted to align to the business.

54
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,750
That is,

55
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,250
as a leader you will need to understand the broader

56
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,929
business goals and determine how your work and projects

57
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,500
will align to those business goals.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,500
And you want to identify who are your customers and how they would benefit.

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,441
This is your first step in setting the direction for

60
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,500
your team as a new team leader.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,711
We talked about aligning daily work tasks,

62
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,974
so for each project,

63
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:22,700
you want a list of features and tasks required to fulfill

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,500
the project and with each of those, include priority and estimated hours.

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Now this is performed at a reasonably high level of granularity and

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,214
this would allow your team to feel more empowered and give them room to

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,500
be creative as they drill into those tasks.

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,382
Lastly, motivating your team.

69
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:43,088
By allowing them and enabling them to learn new things,

70
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,643
to exercise their creativity, to have a voice in what they do,

71
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,262
and to be recognized for their hard work and that they

72
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:54,500
will build something that truly matters.

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,136
In the module, Know Your ABC's,

74
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,409
I proposed to you that you need to have a set of

75
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,500
rock-solid skills in the following five areas.

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,833
Presentations.

77
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,500
Because you'll be standing up in front of your peers or

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,357
customers or management and they will be listening,

79
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:15,500
watching, measuring, gauging, and critiquing you from the second you stand up.

80
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
So plan and prepare and you will be successful.

81
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:18,944
Meetings.

82
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:19,833
No agenda?

83
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,167
Hey, no meeting!

84
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,389
When you prepare your agenda,

85
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,773
have your expected outcome in mind and don't forget to take good

86
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,500
notes and deliver followup emails quickly.

87
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,433
Status reports.

88
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:36,167
They're going to help you communicate your progress,

89
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,033
plans, and issues regularly and consistently.

90
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:43,300
Keep them short and simple and be specific.

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,500
Write and send status reports regularly.

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,357
Next, emails.

93
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,643
Like structured programming,

94
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:51,643
follow my simple guidelines for structured emailing

95
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:54,100
to produce professional emails.

96
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,500
And lastly, interviews.

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,833
By following the simple interview selection process,

98
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:05,500
you will better find the best and the brightest to join your team.

99
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
In the module, Let's Talk,

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,300
I proposed to you that you need another set of rock-solid

101
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
skills in the following five areas.

102
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Presentations.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,500
You need to follow four key steps.

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,833
Plan, prepare, practice,

105
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,833
and present and in this module we focused on

106
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,885
practice and present and believe me, practice makes perfect.

107
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:26,346
Meetings.

108
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:30,500
And here I gave you another four key steps.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,618
Plan, prepare, lead, and follow up,

110
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:36,500
and in this module we focused on lead and follow up.

111
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,029
A key outcome of any meeting is the commitments and

112
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,500
that's not a 1960s band from Britain.

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It is who will do the something, what is that worker task, and when is it due?

114
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Next, stand-ups.

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,500
So assemble your team and one by one, talk about progress, plans, and problems.

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,800
Walk-arounds.

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,900
I know you have a busy day,

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,200
but make your walk-arounds part of your daily routine and you

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,735
will be amazed about how much you learn about your team and how

120
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,500
your team feels more inclusive.

121
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,357
Lastly, interviews.

122
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:11,500
Get your candidates freely talking.

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Ask open-ended questions and don't just focus on aptitude, but also motivation and attitude.
