00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.863
Here is the module summary.

2
00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:08.390
This module covered the fundamentals of why leadership and communication

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.685
skills are so critical to your professional growth,

4
00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:13.054
to your employer, to your customer, and of course,

5
00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:14.406
to your new team.

6
00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:19.468
We also dug deeper into the linkage and interconnection

7
00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:23.843
between leadership and communication and that you just

8
00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:26.843
cannot have one without the other.

9
00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:30.593
We emphasized the importance of improving both of these skills,

10
00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:33.843
leadership and communication, to improve your career opportunities,

11
00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:39.843
your personal growth, and your ability to mentor and grow your team.

12
00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:40.232
Lastly,

13
00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:44.899
we revisited the course scenario where you've been promoted or assigned as

14
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.054
the new team leader and what your first steps should be.

15
00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:53.106
We set the stage with the remaining modules on leadership and

16
00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.193
written and verbal communication skills.

17
00:00:55.193 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay, now let's see in the next module how if you know how to lead right, they will in fact follow.
