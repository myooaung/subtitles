1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,709
Okay, the first is clear.

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:07,401
Remember, that's transparent and able to see through.

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,401
So here is an example of what I do not want you to do.

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:12,083
You might write,

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,810
"I think last week we talked about adding some things or ideas

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,179
to the agenda that we need to talk about.

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,679
But then Joe brought up something that I don't

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,401
remember about improving the agendaâ€¦, " etc.

9
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:23,901
Too much.

10
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:24,651
Too much chitchat.

11
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,401
What are we really trying to say?

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,601
Here is how it should read: "The purpose of this note is to

13
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,901
define a new process for creating meeting agendas.

14
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,901
" It's that simple.

15
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,401
It's very clear.

16
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,401
Remember, clear communication always has a clear purpose.

17
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,151
So what is the purpose?

18
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,951
Whenever you sit down to write a document,

19
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,901
take a few seconds to ask yourself, why am I writing this?

20
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,401
What do I need from the reader?

21
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,401
Okay, that's the purpose.

22
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:04,401
Okay, let's go on to the next 5 C.

23
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:04,845
Concise.

24
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:09,734
That's using as few words as possible to give the necessary

25
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:13,101
information or compressed in order to be brief.

26
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,901
As you read and review your written documents,

27
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,401
see if there is a way you can shorten them.

28
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,464
Remove words or sentences or even paragraphs.

29
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:26,901
Leave nothing but the essential message you're trying to communicate.

30
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:32,401
Okay, again, here is an example of what not to do.

31
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,901
"We think that by the time the team finishes migrating

32
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,714
to the new version of Bootstrap, and we believe it will be right,

33
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:40,901
it should be November 1st.

34
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,401
" Well, here is how it should read.

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,901
"Bootstrap task target completion date: November 1st.

36
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,201
" That's it.

37
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:53,201
That is the date that we're going to be complete.

38
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,401
Clear and concise.

39
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:54,664
Okay.

40
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,243
So we've covered clear and concise.

41
00:01:56,243 --> 00:02:00,001
Because of the volume of emails and other materials we send and receive,

42
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,601
and because emails are often misinterpreted,

43
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:08,401
it's important to write emails clearly and concisely.

44
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,830
It may take you just as long to write short emails as

45
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,875
it took you to write long emails, quite frankly; however,

46
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:20,085
even if this is the case, you will help your coworkers,

47
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:20,559
clients,

48
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:24,568
or employees to be more productive because you'll be

49
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:26,901
adding less clutter to their inboxes,

50
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:30,401
making it easier for them to respond to you.

51
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:39,401
Okay, now let's see how to be polite and to write diplomatically.

52
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,460
Be courteous.

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,519
That is,

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,401
be polite in a way that shows consideration of others and/or good manners.

55
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,930
Be polite and write diplomatically; even in a declaration of war,

56
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,401
one observes the rules of politeness.

57
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,068
That's a quote by Bismarck, okay?

58
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:00,401
Okay, so here is an example again of what not to do.

59
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,734
"Did you really delete that stuff?

60
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:07,012
That is just not what you should have done at all!

61
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,401
" And here is how it should read.

62
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,026
"I understand that the4 files were removed.

63
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,401
Do we have an options of recovering those files?

64
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,115
Can we meet later?

65
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,401
" There is no blame, there is no your fault,

66
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,115
or whatever; it's very,

67
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:29,401
very diplomatic and very courteous and it also talks about the problem.

68
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,651
They've been removed, but no blame, as well as,

69
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:34,401
can we meet later and figure out how to solve it.

70
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:40,000
Well written. Okay, on to the next.
