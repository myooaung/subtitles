1
00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:03,323
So, why are you here?

2
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:07,558
You might be here because your story is somewhat like my story.

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:11,169
Or you may be here because you do know that companies are looking

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,058
for people with strong communication skills,

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:16,558
regardless of a leadership or non-leadership role.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,558
Or maybe it could be one of the other following reasons right here.

7
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:24,558
Are you afraid of leadership or management responsibilities?

8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:29,558
Are you perplexed or unsure on just how to develop your new team?

9
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:33,558
Have you been asked to be a leader and not a doer?

10
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,558
Are you a software engineering expert yet feel like a fish out

11
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,558
of water when it comes to leading a team?

12
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:41,084
Maybe.

13
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:46,874
Now let's check out the next slide on a few more

14
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:50,558
potential reasons why you might be here.

15
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,558
Here are a few more reasons why you might be taking this course.

16
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:59,558
Is creating and presenting a PowerPoint presentation somewhat daunting?

17
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,308
Is leading a meeting and getting people to accept

18
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,558
assignments somewhat impossible?

19
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,758
Do you need help augmenting or transitioning your technical

20
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:11,558
skills with leadership and communication skills?

21
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:15,558
Or maybe you've been asked to be a project manager on a new project.

22
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:26,000
If any or all of these relate to you and your position in your career presently, stay tuned, sit down, and hang on; we're going to have a great time.
