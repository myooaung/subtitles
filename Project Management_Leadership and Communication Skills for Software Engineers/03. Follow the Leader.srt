1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,407
Are you ready to play follow the leader?

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:05,692
In the game, follow the leader,

3
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:09,938
a leader is chosen first and then everyone lines up behind the leader.

4
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,833
The leader then moves around or does something and all the

5
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,950
people have to mimic the leader's actions.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,359
Any person who fails to follow or do what the leader does is out of the game.

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,359
In the business world, it is actually somewhat similar.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,659
You are typically chosen to be the leader by the senior

9
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,359
management and you might expect people to follow you.

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,959
Well, we certainly hope so, but will they?

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,359
Let's see.

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,570
So why will they follow you?

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,254
Great leadership involves many things that we will talk about,

14
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:49,359
but first, I want to talk about people or your team would even follow you.

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,148
I suggest to you that if you give them what they need

16
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,359
so that they can feel comfortable, confident,

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,470
satisfied, and also that they believe in you,

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,359
that you are there for them, they will follow you.

19
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,359
So what do effective leaders give their teams to get them to follow?

20
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,359
Well, what do followers actually want from their leaders?

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:10,727
Okay,

22
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:15,517
the following four key points of this discussion will provide you the platform

23
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:22,359
you need to build the connection with your team that will enable and support

24
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,359
change and motivate your team in a lasting way.

25
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,904
The first is trust.

26
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:34,359
The basis of all solid, well-functioning relationships.

27
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,065
The ability to trust a leader is essential to cultivate

28
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,915
followers and the one requirement that successful leaders

29
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:47,359
cannot afford to take for granted is trust.

30
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,888
In a high-trust environment, not only is there less organizational chatter,

31
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:58,359
but tasks get done more quickly, with a lot less effort and time.

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,216
So there are three critical factors to consider when

33
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,359
determining how trustworthy someone is.

34
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:11,359
First, a leader needs to deliver results in a quality manner.

35
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,359
They need to follow through on business commitments and hold

36
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,359
others accountable to their commitments.

37
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,859
Second, a leader needs to demonstrate integrity.

38
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:25,359
They need to behave in a consistent, reliable manner,

39
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:33,359
be open with information, and walk the talk when it comes to ethics and values.

40
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:33,830
Third,

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,006
they need to show a concern for others and promote the

42
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,359
wellbeing of their team members.

43
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:47,359
When any one of these factors is missing, the equation may go to zero.

44
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:51,109
How are you delivering on the three factors of trust?

45
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,359
What will your team members say?

46
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,359
Okay, the next point.

47
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:55,859
Compassion.

48
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,359
People want leaders who care about them as people.

49
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,830
According to a Gallup research, when 10,

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,234
000 employees were asked what great leaders contributed to their lives,

51
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:11,609
they said caring, friendship, happiness,

52
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,359
and love.

53
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,692
When people feel as if someone cares,

54
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,359
not only are they more engaged and productive,

55
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,759
they'll stay around longer.

56
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,559
Less turnover.

57
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:23,359
Certainly something you'll want as a leader.

58
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:24,859
Turnover is expensive.

59
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,359
You might hire, train, integrate with the team, etc.

60
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:35,359
What kind of environment are you creating in your company, your organization?

61
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,359
How do you show your business colleagues that you care about them as people?

62
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,109
Next is stability.

63
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:47,359
People want security, strength, support, and peace of mind.

64
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,359
Those are the words that were used on the surveys that Gallup conducted.

65
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,248
People want some sense of stability in their work environment

66
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:59,234
which can be challenging for leaders to provide in tough

67
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:03,609
economic times or tough or challenging times for your company

68
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,359
or organization in particular.

69
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,359
By providing a sense of security,

70
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,359
the team will know you will lead them through and out of

71
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,359
even the most troubling or turbulent times.

72
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,359
Stability provides that foundation element to enable them to follow.

73
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,359
How are you providing the sense of stability in your company or organization?

74
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,692
What information are you sharing to give people confidence about

75
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,859
the business and how often are you sharing it?

76
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:31,859
Next, hope.

77
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:32,359
Finally,

78
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:38,359
followers want to know that there is a future and a direction

79
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:42,581
for how they see themselves in the team,

80
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,359
the organization and the company.

81
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,477
The most engaged employees that Gallup surveyed were the ones

82
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:52,359
that had faith in their leader's vision,

83
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:57,359
generating both optimism as well as a higher level of productivity.

84
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,148
Without hope, uncertainty and paralysis can set in,

85
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:06,359
uneasiness, and if you're only working on the day to day,

86
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,788
there is no time to create a bigger picture for your followers,

87
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:14,047
so set and reset the vision and your action plans for change.

88
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,859
All tehse are important--trust, compassion,

89
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:22,513
stability, and hope, but to me, trust is really a biggie.

90
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:35,000
It is the major foundation for connecting with other people. Now let's explore more ways leaders can instill trust in their team.
