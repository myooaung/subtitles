00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:06.653
Here are a few guidelines to think about so you can plan and

2
00:00:06.653 --> 00:00:09.179
implement building trust with your team.

3
00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.532
Have clear and consistent goals.

4
00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:16.238
Always know where you're going, always know the big vision,

5
00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:18.779
the projects, and the daily tasks.

6
00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.179
I'll have more on that later.

7
00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.679
Be open, fair, and listen.

8
00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.179
This builds trust and shows compassion for your teammates.

9
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.512
Be decisive.

10
00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:32.179
Wishy-washy is poor leadership.

11
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.512
Would you want to see the President of the United

12
00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:38.179
States in a very serious situation say, gee,

13
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.054
I don't know what we should do here?

14
00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:42.179
No, you don't.

15
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:42.979
Admit mistakes.

16
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.379
This shows you are human because you will make mistakes and

17
00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.885
even if it is not your mistake per se, take one for the team.

18
00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.003
They are your team.

19
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.061
Your responsibility.

20
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.179
This really builds trust.

21
00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.322
Respect the opinions of others.

22
00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.179
Always listen.

23
00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:08.179
Now it doesn't mean you have to agree, but you do have to listen.

24
00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:11.779
Then be decisive and make a decision and explain your reasons and

25
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:15.779
why you've chosen your path so that they won't feel like their

26
00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.179
opinion or their voice wasn't heard.

27
00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.804
Create a climate that allows empowerment.

28
00:01:20.804 --> 00:01:23.867
Give your team enough tools and decision-making

29
00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.179
freedom so they can feel empowered.

30
00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.846
When you don't feel empowered,

31
00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:31.641
you really don't feel like doing much or trying that hard,

32
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:32.102
typically.

33
00:01:32.102 --> 00:01:37.179
When you feel empowered, you feel like you can do anything.

34
00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.617
Now you can't be robotic or stiff or just go through

35
00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:42.179
the motions of this checklist.

36
00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.179
You must be sincere, truly and genuinely sincere.

37
00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.179
Now, that's how leaders can build trust in you.

38
00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:59.179
Now let's explore how you can promote team trust.

39
00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.036
How leaders build team trust in a particular trust

40
00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:05.179
among the team members themselves.

41
00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.337
First, support all team members, not just one or two,

42
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:12.322
otherwise this could really change the dynamics of the team's productivity.

43
00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:12.893
Second,

44
00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:18.036
take responsibility for team actions and part of that

45
00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:20.893
means taking responsibility for mistakes.

46
00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:23.179
So follow this guideline.

47
00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.452
When the team screws up, you take the hit.

48
00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:30.088
When the team hits the project out of the ballpark,

49
00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.997
you give them all of the credit.

50
00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:36.179
You have just doubled the trust bank.

51
00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:38.179
Next, give credit to team members.

52
00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.512
Always reinforce a good job or even a good try,

53
00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:44.679
even if things don't work out the way you want.

54
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.979
Everyone on the team may be at different levels of knowledge,

55
00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:53.179
skills, and what you expect of them, so understand that.

56
00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.901
Next, be sensitive to the team's needs.

57
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.179
Sometimes you can tell when things just aren't right with someone.

58
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.744
Maybe talk with them, but be sure it's done one on one in some privacy,

59
00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:07.179
too and find out how you can help.

60
00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.179
You never know what might be bothering someone.

61
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.465
Next, create trust between team members.

62
00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:17.036
So not only is it important for your team to trust you,

63
00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:23.079
it is also imperative that your team trusts each other.

64
00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.179
Address issues directly.

65
00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:26.591
Share relevant information.

66
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:31.767
Follow through on commitments and give early notice when you can't,

67
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:39.179
and say no when you mean no, and share what you know and what you don't know.

68
00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:41.679
And here's a tip.

69
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:49.179
The first step in building trust is to display trust; trust them.

70
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.079
One way to do this is to make a generous interpretation when someone

71
00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.238
else makes a mistake or disappoints you in some way.

72
00:03:56.238 --> 00:04:00.120
People who will always jump to the worse conclusion about others'

73
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.333
competence and motivation inspire caution or suspicion,

74
00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:04.410
not trust.

75
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.179
Give them the benefit of the doubt.

76
00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay, now let's look at what qualities in general you will need to be a good leader.
