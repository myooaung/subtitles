00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.206
Here are my 4 P's to successful presentations: Plan,

2
00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:11.631
prepare, practice, and present.

3
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:15.631
Now the first two relate to writing the presentation.

4
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:19.631
In other words, in this module on know your ABC's.

5
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.631
The second two relate to delivering your presentation.

6
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.131
It's the verbal part.

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:27.631
You're practicing and presenting.

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:32.631
Now we will cover those two in detail in the next module called Let's Talk.

9
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:38.278
Now let's move on to how you're going to plan and prepare

10
00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.631
your presentations for your success.

11
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:45.631
So let's get organized and do the preliminary planning of your presentation.

12
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:52.631
First, have the outcome in mind before you start writing your presentation.

13
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:55.631
You should know exactly what you want to accomplish.

14
00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.381
If you were given a topic or assignment from your management,

15
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.853
review it and be sure you fully understand it before you begin the planning.

16
00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.631
Who is your audience?

17
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.831
Know your audience.

18
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.631
What they may expect from the presentation.

19
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.858
Who are you about to talk to?

20
00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:15.631
Maybe who you thought would be there is not and maybe others have shown up.

21
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.536
Always be prepared to adapt.

22
00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:21.345
As long as the core message is in your presentation,

23
00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:25.231
you can use your words to evolve or adapt to

24
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.631
re-engineer your message if need be.

25
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.498
Next, research your topic.

26
00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:34.164
It's important to spend enough time collecting and confirming information,

27
00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:39.131
in order to speak with confidence and knowledge and let me tell you,

28
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.631
confidence is very important.

29
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:43.631
More on that in the verbal module.

30
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:48.131
Organize the main points in the most appropriate order

31
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.631
for the topic you're presenting.

32
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.756
Avoid writing complete sentences or paragraphs and prepare note cards

33
00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:57.098
to help you elaborate on the information presented.

34
00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:05.164
Align your presentation with their strategic interests or objectives in mind,

35
00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:07.964
so they can relate.

36
00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:10.631
Determine your delivery medium.

37
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:11.381
I love PowerPoint.

38
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.631
I'd suggest you use PowerPoint, but there are many other tools as well.

39
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:19.631
You decide what might be the best for your situation.

40
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.263
But of course, you need to allow to display text,

41
00:02:22.263 --> 00:02:24.368
maybe movies, videos, and graphics in slide form,

42
00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:25.031
of course.

43
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:29.031
Okay, now that we have the planning process in place,

44
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:35.256
let's talk about how we want to prepare to build up on

45
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:39.631
our contents of the presentation.

46
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.193
Now let's prepare the content.

47
00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.068
Open with something surprising or intriguing,

48
00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:46.842
something that will get your audience to sit up and take notice.

49
00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:49.368
Maybe it's a catchy quotation or statistic or

50
00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.540
something that might even be humorous,

51
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.631
but choose wisely and you will have their attention.

52
00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.102
You could even have a hook.

53
00:02:58.102 --> 00:02:59.749
Like, the best writing,

54
00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.219
the best presentations should always engage

55
00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.031
audiences early and then rill them in.

56
00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:10.631
Ensure they understand why they are there and what outcome is expected of them.

57
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.353
Remember, you are presenting for a reason,

58
00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:14.909
keep that in mind,

59
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.575
and focus each slide's content and your delivery on your expected outcome.

60
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.687
Sometimes this can be done with an agenda,

61
00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:28.231
but I recommend devoting a slide or two to exactly what you want or

62
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:32.381
need from them in the presentation This comes early in the deck and

63
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.381
should be revisited at the end of the presentation to get their

64
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.506
feedback from the audience.

65
00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:40.631
Minimize the number of slides.

66
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.736
To maintain a clear message and to keep your audience attentive and interested,

67
00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:48.417
keep the number of slides in your presentation to a minimum,

68
00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:51.631
just what you need to get your job done.

69
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.323
Write a script.

70
00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:54.631
I used this for this course in and of itself.

71
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.964
A little planning goes a long way.

72
00:03:56.964 --> 00:04:00.298
Most presentations are written in Power Point or some other

73
00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:03.488
presentation tool without any sort of rhyme or reason.

74
00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:05.631
I think that's kind of backwards.

75
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:08.774
Since the point of your slides is to illustrate and expand

76
00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:11.345
what you are going to say to your audience,

77
00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:16.431
you should know what you intend to say and then figure out how

78
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:19.631
you want to visualize it with the slides.

79
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.298
Make sure you write out or at least outline your presentation

80
00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:25.631
before trying to put together the slides.

81
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.631
And make sure your script follows good storytelling conventions, if you will.

82
00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:31.631
Give it a beginning, a middle,

83
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.631
and an end and have a clear story that builds toward some sort of outcome.

84
00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:39.964
Make your audience appreciate each slide but be anxious maybe

85
00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:42.631
to find out what's next and when possible,

86
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:44.631
leave them wanting more.

87
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:46.631
Display one thing at a time.

88
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:46.964
Please!

89
00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:48.298
At any given moment,

90
00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:52.698
what should be on the screen is the thing you're talking about.

91
00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:59.631
Your audience will almost instantly read every slide as soon as it's displayed.

92
00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.240
If you have the next three or four points you plan to make up there,

93
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.105
they'll be three or four steps ahead of you,

94
00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:08.842
waiting for you to catch up rather than listening with

95
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:12.631
interest to the points you're trying to make.

96
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.631
So plan your presentation with just one new point is

97
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.631
displayed at any given moment.

98
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:22.631
Bullet points can be revealed one at a time as you reach them.

99
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.231
Charts can be put on the next slide to be referenced when

100
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:28.631
you get to the data the chart displays.

101
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:32.631
Your job as presenter is to control the flow of information so

102
00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:37.131
that you and your audience stay in sync and your maximizing the

103
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:39.631
conveyance of information to them.

104
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.944
No paragraphs, ever.

105
00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:43.131
Need I even say this?

106
00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:44.006
Well, yes.

107
00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:46.631
I see it all the time.

108
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:51.572
Where most presentations fail is that their author is convinced they are

109
00:05:51.572 --> 00:05:55.409
producing some kind of stand-alone document for all time.

110
00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.631
They put everything they want onto those slides in big, chunky blocks of text.

111
00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:07.631
Well, you've just killed a roomful of people and maybe caused terminal boredom.

112
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:11.631
Your slides are the illustrations for your presentation,

113
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.631
not the presentation itself.

114
00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:16.323
They should underline and reinforce what you're

115
00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:18.631
saying as you give the presentation.

116
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:22.631
Save the paragraphs of text for your script maybe.

117
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:27.219
Power Point and other tools and software have functions to display notes onto

118
00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.431
the presenter's screen that don't get sent to the projector,

119
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.731
or you can use note cards, a separate Word processor document,

120
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:35.093
or just from memory.

121
00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:37.862
I think memory is the best.

122
00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.631
In other words, plan and prepare.

123
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:43.892
So just don't put it on the screen, but if you do for some reason,

124
00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:48.031
don't stand with your back to the audience and read it from the screen.

125
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.631
At least look them in the eye and present.

126
00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:55.381
Okay, and lastly of course, when you're preparing your content,

127
00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:59.267
you are following the 5 C's: clear, concise,

128
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:06.631
courteous, consistent, and compelling, and you will be successful.

129
00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:10.160
Here are a few more items that I'd like you to think

130
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.631
about in preparing your content.

131
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.278
Pay attention to design.

132
00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:17.396
Power Point and other presentation packages offer all sorts of

133
00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:20.131
ways to visually present things on the screen.

134
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:23.131
Fades and swipes and flashing text and all these things

135
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:25.381
that actually may be a bit annoying,

136
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:30.631
but they're really all too easy to insert with just a few mouse clicks.

137
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:34.909
So maybe avoid the temptation and don't dress up your pages

138
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.631
too much; keep them simple and basic.

139
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:39.131
Next, avoid clutter.

140
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:40.631
Less is more.

141
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.631
No clutter and keep it simple.

142
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:46.381
A headline, a few bullet points, maybe an image or two,

143
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:49.631
anything more than that and you risk losing your audience as

144
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:53.631
they sort it all out or get distracted.

145
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.086
And use images appropriately.

146
00:07:55.086 --> 00:07:57.631
Again, whatever that might mean for you.

147
00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:01.631
There are kind of two schools of thought here about images and presentations.

148
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.298
Some say they add visual interest and keep you interested and

149
00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:08.263
engaged and others say images are just unnecessary distractions

150
00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:11.420
and both arguments might be true, so in this case,

151
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.131
the best option is to split the difference.

152
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:18.631
Use images only when they add important information or

153
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.631
make an abstract point more concrete.

154
00:08:21.631 --> 00:08:23.774
Post questions in your content.

155
00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:27.631
Questions arouse interest, peak curiosity, and engage your audience.

156
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:30.964
They make them think a little bit, so ask them.

157
00:08:30.964 --> 00:08:35.488
Build tension or interest by posing a question and let your audience stew for

158
00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:38.631
a moment before moving to the next slide with the answer.

159
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.684
Maybe quiz their knowledge and show them how little they know,

160
00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:43.789
and if appropriate,

161
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.345
engage a little Q&A with your audience with you asking questions.

162
00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:49.631
So the questions would be on the slide.

163
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:51.131
What do you think about this?

164
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.381
How would you handle that?

165
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:52.631
Etc.

166
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:56.631
And maybe the next bullet or the next slide would

167
00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:58.631
answer or address the question.

168
00:08:58.631 --> 00:08:59.631
Go off road.

169
00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:00.964
As with anything else,

170
00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:06.086
there are times when each of these rules or any rule you know won't apply.

171
00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:10.631
These are general rules of thumb that I'm giving you.

172
00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:14.631
If you know there is a good reason to break a rule, just go ahead and do it.

173
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:23.000
It's perfectly acceptable. Remember, you're trying to make a point for your expected outcome.
