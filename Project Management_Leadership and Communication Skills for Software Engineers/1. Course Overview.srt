00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,824
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:10,941
My name is Michael Krasowski and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,111
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,000
Here is a quick fact for you.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,824
A survey of corporate recruiters reported that 86% of recruiters said

6
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,500
that strong communication skills were a priority.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,000
They didn't say required or even nice to have; they said, a priority.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,333
So you've come to the right place.

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,000
This course is for you.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In this course we're going to cover the following major topic and themes.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,500
We will explore why leadership and communication are interconnected,

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
intertwined, interwoven,

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,200
and that your potential as a leader will be dependent upon your

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
ability to effectively communicate with others.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,214
We will discuss just what does leadership mean and

16
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:02,000
the qualities of great leaders.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,316
Next,

18
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:06,105
we'll discuss why writing skills are critical to your success and we

19
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:09,500
will focus on the following key areas: presentations,

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
meetings, status reports, emails, and interviews.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll also examine why verbal and interpersonal skills are

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,714
essential for your success as well and we will focus on the

23
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:25,143
following key areas such as presentations,

24
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:28,000
meetings, stand-ups, walk-arounds, and interviews.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,909
By the end of this course,

26
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,364
you will know how to begin your journey as a leader or manager with

27
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:38,000
the confidence in skills necessary for your success.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,667
I hope you'll join me on this journey to improving your

29
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:51,000
skills with my Pluralsight course, Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.
