00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.228
Connecting through communication.

2
00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:08.364
For a leader like you in your new role, communication is the path,

3
00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:14.228
the way; it is how you are going to connect and motivate your team and

4
00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:19.228
communication is not just the transmission of data and information.

5
00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:22.934
Communication is critical for task assignments and executing projects,

6
00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.169
getting things done,

7
00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.006
yet is one of the often most challenging leadership

8
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:34.228
skills because it is so easy to say, but not so easy to do.

9
00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:37.657
Effective communication is far more than a one-way

10
00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:40.228
street that starts with the leader.

11
00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:44.934
Communication flows freely in both directions and in every circumstance,

12
00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:51.228
in good times and in especially in challenging and bad times.

13
00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:56.117
Whether spoken or written, and in spanning both words and actions,

14
00:00:56.117 --> 00:01:00.478
the message must convey both your vision and the

15
00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:04.853
organization's purpose; why we are doing this,

16
00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:09.228
why is it important, and values too.

17
00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:12.706
What too many people fail to appreciate is that the

18
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:20.014
message is not just what you say, but how you say it that is equally important.

19
00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:28.371
Now might the leader be in fact the message?

20
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.228
Let's see.

21
00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:32.581
The leader is the message.

22
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:34.463
Sharing information is critical,

23
00:01:34.463 --> 00:01:38.665
but it is substantially less than half the battle.

24
00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:43.478
Yes, you must communicate clearly about your team or business requirements,

25
00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.961
but you cannot stop there.

26
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:54.761
Verbally and nonverbally, the way in which you communicate may be humble,

27
00:01:54.761 --> 00:02:00.228
passionately, confidently, may have more impact than the words you choose.

28
00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:01.784
Yes, content is important,

29
00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:06.450
but you must always pay attention to the tone of your voice,

30
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.860
your facial expression, and your body language.

31
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.228
All of these things are as much the message as the words you speak.

32
00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:21.228
Why are verbal and nonverbal cues so important, you ask?

33
00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:23.895
Because we humans are just intuitive.

34
00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:29.228
We constantly read and react in nonverbal cues and as a leader,

35
00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:34.228
we have to be aware at all times of what we are projecting to others,

36
00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:36.843
whether they see you as confident, optimistic,

37
00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:39.305
tentative, or maybe worried.

38
00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.997
All of the responsibilities of leadership,

39
00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.339
particularly during challenging times,

40
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.228
communication is the most powerful and enduring.

41
00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:50.491
As a leader,

42
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:55.965
you must inspire others through your words and actions and before you speak,

43
00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:58.828
make sure you listen and observe.

44
00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:05.228
Knowing your audience is as important as the message you are delivering.

45
00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:12.228
Communication informs, persuades, guides and assures, as well as inspires.

46
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:15.702
You must be willing to reveal more of yourself and to

47
00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:18.228
let others see you for who you are.

48
00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:23.117
If you don't you will undermine your effectiveness as a leader

49
00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:26.228
and your followers may soon drift elsewhere.

50
00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:32.228
Now picture yourself on your first day at work in your new role as leader.

51
00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:32.828
Nervous?

52
00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:33.428
Unsure?

53
00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:42.000
Is that the message you want to convey? Well, let me give you some guidance.
