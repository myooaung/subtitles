1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,700
The 4 P's to successful presentations.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,300
We touched on these in the previous module.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:14,300
Plan, prepare, practice, and present.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Now the first two relate to writing of the presentation.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,300
That was in Know Your ABC's, in the lsat module.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,300
Practice and present, those are related to delivering your presentation.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:37,300
The verbal and interpersonal part, and those two we'll cover now in detail.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Practice, practice, practice, and yes, practice makes perfect.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Stand in front of the mirror and watch yourself.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Are your hands at your sides?

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,443
Well, they shouldn't be.

12
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,300
Hands should be moving, not all over the place, either.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,418
Pretend you are holding a basketball.

14
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:57,300
Your hand should be placed something like that when you move.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,500
So before a presentation,

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,300
I will stand in front of a mirror in my hotel room or home and present.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,800
I can see myself, I can hear myself speak.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,300
This provides great real-time feedback.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,900
So hear yourself speak.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,300
Yes, actually listen to yourself speak.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,300
You will be amazed at how you sound and how you can make corrections to improve.

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,300
You may even consider recording yourself and listening to that.

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,089
Project your voice loud enough and clear enough and even consider a

24
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:34,300
microphone based on the size of the audience and the room.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,100
Try to not memorize written texts,

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,300
otherwise your verbal cadence will be stiff and monotone.

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,037
Try to understand the topic to the best of your ability so you can communicate

28
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:50,300
it well during the presentation and meet the time limit.

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,967
Now you can memorize things,

30
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,633
but just memorize high-level topics or concepts that

31
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,700
later you can provide more detail.

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,500
Okay, let's do it one more time.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Practice for a coworker or manager and get their feedback

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,300
on your presentation skills and yes, practice does make perfect.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,467
Here's a tip.

36
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:10,856
Remember,

37
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:15,133
you take classes on technical topics to be better engineers so

38
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:19,531
putting time into learning how to better communicate will be

39
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,300
well worth your investment; trust me.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,000
Alright, are you feeling confident? Let's see.
