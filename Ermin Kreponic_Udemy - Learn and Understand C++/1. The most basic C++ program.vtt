00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.845
Welcome back so let's
go ahead and begin

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.690
with our first the
very first C++ program

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.580
it's not gonna do much in fact it's not
going to do anything but in this chapter

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.858
we will write a C++
program to show

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:21.880
what each C++ program
must contain you

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.050
might find it a little bit surprising
just how little will attack sure just

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.933
how little is actually
needed for a C++

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.990
program we will see
how to later on down

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.950
along. Later on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.840
within the confines of this chapter we
will see how to write to standard output

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.700
how to declare variables in C++ and
their representation but for the time

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.020
let's go ahead and see
what a C++ program

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:50.719
must contain so this is the bare
minimum

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.780
like nothing but the
mandatory things, let's just

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.260
go ahead and pop code
blocks come on come on, today

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.540
get the file gonna go
ahead and create a

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.151
new project for this
particular chapter

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.002
so just good like a console
application go next

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.499
yes we will make sure
that it's C++ and

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:26.310
not see, project title,
chapter 1, so you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.749
can change its location
here I've just save it

00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:30.680
please main on the
desktop it doesn't

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.066
really matter to me at
all, but you can place

00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.300
your or wherever you
would like to place

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
it and go ahead and click on Next

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.911
this is all fine and
dandy just go ahead

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.280
and click on Finish
so if you go into

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.560
sources main CPP go ahead
and open it up you

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.890
can delete this. In
case you don't have the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.830
main EPP you can just
just basically create

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:01.360
you just basically
create a file I do

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.233
believe that I have
demonstrated that in

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:05.159
the very beginning
chapters but you will

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.513
always have this
template in codeblocks

00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:09.569
anyway it doesn't
matter is the main

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.584
CPP is just that file can be

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.490
empty, it can contain some code

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.411
depending on how
the templates are

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.700
configured so codeblocks does gives

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.300
us does give us the basic program but I
deleted it just to show you what the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.328
basic one actually needs
to contain becasue

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:26.310
codeblocks gives
you a little bit

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.239
more than the Basic
C++ program so just

00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:32.090
gonna press enter a
couple of times for

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.629
the sake of aesthetics
no real reason

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.760
for no real technical
reason for it and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.580
and type in int main,
ok, press enter,

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:49.750
close. This is it.
This is a C++ program!

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.120
the very basic one, it is a valid C++
program and it cannot get smaller

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.792
than this, this is the
smallest possible

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:01.210
C++ program that
you can make in my

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.600
opinion if somebody else can make a
smaller one please please send me

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.680
a private message or something like that I would love to see it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.798
but I am pretty sure it's not

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:18.910
possible. Anyway
that's it this is a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.809
valid C++ program it
doesn't do anything

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.540
at all and if you
build and run it

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.161
nothing will happen
and the program will

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.910
simply stop executing
we will later on

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.260
along the way we
will explain what

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:34.670
each line of the code
does through our

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.984
examples but for now you have to

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.850
keep in mind what
we have learned in

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.535
this chapter, it may
not seem like we've

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.140
learned a lot but
believe me it is very

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.810
significant probably the most

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:47.600
significant thing you
will learn about

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.459
C++ because without
it you won't be able

00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:53.440
to move anywhere in
C++ world so each

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.621
C++ program must
have a valid entry

00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:02.430
point meaning main function what

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.042
functions are etc that
will be explained

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:07.720
along the way but for now just

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.847
take my word for it
every C++ program

00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:15.890
must have this entry
point must have an

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.946
entry point and that
entry point is the

00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.870
main function this
is how things are

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.830
and later in the course you will see
what functions are and how they work now

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.050
let's go ahead

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.713
build from the program
so build and run

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:33.120
up here and go ahead
and click on it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.528
that's it, now depending on the

00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:37.280
development environment
you are using

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.468
the integrated
development environment

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:41.550
that is I'm using
code blocks as it is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.885
the simplest one, codeblocks
 will always

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.920
pretty much do this
it will pop this

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.780
terminal and that it will hold it open
for use to it doesn't close if you were

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.806
to for example running
this in Eclipse

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.920
it would behave in a different

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.732
fashion and if you
were to run this in

00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:00.490
NetBeans again it
would behave in a

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.121
different fashion if
you were to compile

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:05.390
this from compiling
run it from the CMD

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.000
again it would behave in a little bit of
a different fashion you see

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.549
each environment adds
something of its own

00:05:12.574 --> 00:05:15.300
but as you can see
absolutely nothing

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.150
happens there was nothing printed out
onto the screen to program does nothing

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.630
etc let's just go
ahead and close it

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:26.920
and then this is
basically it that's

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.863
what you need to learn
this is the very

00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:30.220
first thing that I
wanted to teach you

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.113
what a basic most basic
C++ program looks

00:05:34.138 --> 00:05:37.410
like that it works. I
bet you very well and

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.500
we shall see each other in the next
chapter in the next tutorial.
