1
00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.436
Ok, so welcome back.

2
00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.076
Just one more

3
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:06.405
short note that I wanted to make
at the end of the chapter.

4
00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:08.391
One of the main

5
00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:10.695
I wouldn't say the main thing but,

6
00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.911
This is something that you should
definitely know.

7
00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:13.811
This

8
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:16.750
is a concept known as comments.

9
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.040
Now, comments are completely irrelevant to
the compiler,

10
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.515
They are completely irrelevant
to the machines. They are ignored.

11
00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:24.520
In fact

12
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.240
after the define statement,

13
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.020
they are all deleted by the compiler,
as it doesn't really care much for them.

14
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.840
However,

15
00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:38.146
Let's say we write the function or
you have a variable like this one

16
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.220
you can create a comment and say

17
00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.338
var is for

18
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.831
something.

19
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.080
Here you would basically explain

20
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:56.815
what this variable is for
and why have you written it here.

21
00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:58.115
Or something like that.

22
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:01.933
It is very good to put comments
in your code, In fact,

23
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.811
if you don't put comments in your code,

24
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:08.375
people will scream at you. People
will be very mad at you.

25
00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.511
Most likely, because if you are working in
a

26
00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:12.773
group project,

27
00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:13.760
In a project,

28
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.926
where mutiple people are working
on the same code,

29
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.600
and if you submit your code
to somebody else,

30
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.260
and you don't have any comments in it
explaining what is what,

31
00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.926
they would probably just return it
to you and say,

32
00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:25.530
I don't understand this.

33
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:27.340
Please comment it out.

34
00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:29.646
Even though they probably do understand it

35
00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.360
but it will take a ton load of time
for them

36
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.740
to go through every single function

37
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:35.520
and

38
00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:41.960
try to figure out what it means just
by running the code and examining

39
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.805
the functions individually.

40
00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:45.260
So, it is much better

41
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.091
to have

42
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.796
description above

43
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.600
lines of code that you believe,

44
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.450
that you should describe,
that are not self explanatory.

45
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.585
So that, whoever reads the code
and whoever needs to work on it next,

46
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:58.595
will be able to orient it

47
00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.301
themselves

48
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:01.535
with great ease.

49
00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:03.095
Now there are several...

50
00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.890
when you comment something out,
it is excluded from

51
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:08.446
it is ignored by the compiler,

52
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:11.905
it does not make any difference
in the code

53
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.600
or to the machine or anything like
that

54
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.635
so you can put whatever
you want in the comment.

55
00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:18.518
These are single line comments,

56
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.950
If you put // You can write
whatever you want in this

57
00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:25.918
single line. But as soon as you go to
the next line, It is no longer a comment.

58
00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:30.355
There is another way of commenting things
which is / *

59
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.111
and then * /

60
00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:38.460
Now, everything in between is a comment.

61
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.786
People tend to

62
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:46.011
do these things for aesthetic reasons.

63
00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:47.505
Like,

64
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.440
put,

65
00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:54.098
these things one below the
other.

66
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.633
and

67
00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:59.066
I don't know, now they write
something

68
00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:01.095
Hey

69
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.800
here

70
00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:08.070
well I do not

71
00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:10.561
know

72
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.981
there should be,

73
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.130
something.

74
00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.820
Now, the asterisk here are completely
irrelevant, I can delete them

75
00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:19.590
like this.

76
00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:23.215
But everything that you place between
this two,

77
00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:27.525
is pretty much considered a comment.
So, this is a multi line comment

78
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:28.893
and

79
00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.920
this is for longer descriptions
or something like that.

80
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.285
But as I said, you have

81
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.716
single line comments where you
can

82
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.941
put your descriptions here
and you can basically place them

83
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:45.126
one below the other,
which is also a neat trick.

84
00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:45.786
also

85
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:49.200
if one for example excludes
something from the code temporarily

86
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.710
just to see what happens

87
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.100
it is commented out.

88
00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:53.676
and

89
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.645
you can comment out an entire
section.

90
00:03:58.256 --> 00:04:00.865
and just see how the code
behaves

91
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:03.065
without that particular
section.

92
00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:05.175
where you can leave it
commented out

93
00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:09.528
you can leave it commented out
so that,

94
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.430
a portion of the code
is embedded in the program.

95
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.425
somebody will find it

96
00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:20.620
useful

97
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:24.890
so, they can just uncomment it,
and immediately use it.

98
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:27.960
So, this is the brief concept that I wanted
to explain to you,

99
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.480
something that is very important,
something that you will use a lot

100
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:33.800
I sincerely hope.

101
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:36.556
and hopefully you have understood

102
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.560
what I have explained to you
what the comments are

103
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:40.800
what they are for
the reason

104
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:41.656
that much

105
00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:43.298
to say in regard

106
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.280
to comment themselves.

107
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:50.655
Two types of them, one more time,
single line and multi line comments.

108
00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:52.471
that's it

109
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:56.840
Just write the description of your code,
state what everything means in your code

110
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.085
and be as much of your

111
00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:02.300
be very helpful to colleagues

112
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.798
who will work on
the same code.

113
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:07.765
They will appreciate it believe me

114
00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:10.200
and I'm pretty sure that they
will return the favor to you

115
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.755
because if you get somebody's code
and somebody commented

116
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:13.761
you will see

117
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.810
how difficult it is
to read it. No matter how good you are

118
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.326
It's going to take a ton
load of your time.

119
00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:23.056
Anyway, I wish you

120
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.525
a great deal of luck with this course.

121
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.770
And I bid you farewell, until next
chapter.
