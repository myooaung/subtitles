00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.055
Welcome all, my name
is Ermin and I will be

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.109
your instructor throughout
this course I'm

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.725
also its creator. So, in this
introduction video, I usually

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.100
like go over a few things in
regard to the course, like

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.671
who is it meant for?
what are records

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.669
scored? what sort of
level of knowledge is

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.640
expected from you? what are the benefits
do you have?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.167
why should you learn C++? etc.
So first thing first

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:33.340
is why should you learn C++?
why is that important

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.819
at all? first of all, C++ is
a low programming language.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:42.130
It has a very mess up syntax
in a sense that it is not

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.397
user friendly so to say.
But it's very

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:51.340
powerful it is able
to do things a lot

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.900
faster. You're able
to do things a lot

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.300
faster with C++ that
you are able to do

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.717
with other programming
languages it is

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.359
very low level it's
down to record it has

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.192
direct hardware access. For
example if you compare it

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:10.850
to Java or I don't know
maybe to Python or C Sharp

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.458
or something like that.
All those languages

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:17.809
are considerably slower
than C++ although

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289
there are a lot easier
to learn I would say,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.869
anyway. however C++ does
give you an enormous

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.516
amount of freedom and
therefore you can make

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.360
a lot of mistakes while
coding but that's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.292
the beauty of it, you can.
That you do have the

00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:34.400
ability to do pretty much
whatever it is that you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.779
wanted to you even do it perhaps

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.020
sometimes makes no sense.
Anyway,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.786
games today for PCs
they are made in C++

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.260
so most of the major
games out there

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.821
are made in C++. This is done because
they're fast they're optimize

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:59.119
and they can work. Some of the
games that are writen in Java

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.591
or some similarly
programming language

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:03.491
for the PCs they
will considerably

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.050
slower than the ones
writen with C++.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:10.050
Also operating systems
are within these

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.275
low-level programming languages as well.
In addition to that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.500
do you have a number of desktop
applications and on top far of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.450
that I personally find C++ very very
interesting and very useful especially

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.794
since in the pen testing
world, the fact that you

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.959
can do anything you want
with it that there are

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.935
pretty much no limitations,
enable us to write

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.060
pretty much all sorts
of code that we would

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.898
need for example in
other course where

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:43.669
I have created
instructions for how

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.417
to create a keylogger, that
was on C++ and that is

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:50.650
for advanced audience who
are already familiar with

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.251
C++ or already have a
good amount of knowledge

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:57.180
from before. but in order
for you to be able

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.242
to write something
complex as that, you

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:04.519
would need to learn
this basics, so they

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.992
the keylogger, it could
been written in C

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:08.969
sharp it could been
written in Java etc but

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.880
why did I actually write it in C++?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.555
well first of all
minimum amount of

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.549
dependencies practically
no dependencies

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.392
or whatsoever if you wrote
it in Java, you would

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:24.290
have to have a a virtual
layer on your need

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.291
to actually run and Java Runtime

00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:27.919
Environment they're
not installed

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.099
on every single PC out there so that is a
problem, also if you have C sharp

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.395
you'll again need a sub
layer, that's another

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.991
dependencie which is
not something that you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.610
want to make such programs pendant
on there are also a good number of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.949
frameworks there but
you don't really need

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:51.560
them to actually be
able to work in C++

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.062
keylogger the way it was
written was just pure

00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:58.310
no frameworks, no nothing,
from scratch written

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.969
and make it work

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.709
But that was for a
advanced audience,

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.220
this course is
completely different

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.090
this course will show you the
backgrounds

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.219
of making the keylogger
so to say because

00:04:08.244 --> 00:04:11.640
we will go over all
the basic things

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.567
like from square one
and other words

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:18.790
to more advanced
stages in C++ so you

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.513
don't really need any previous

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:24.330
knowledge of coding
programmig or C++

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.371
in order to take this
course, it was designed so

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:32.380
that anybody pretty much can
take it and they can go

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.159
at it, they can learn from it. It
does require some work on you I mean,

00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:40.140
it does require you to go through
the videos, take a look at the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.331
code, try to create your
own code and perhaps you

00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:46.310
take a look at the net
for some extra resources

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.550
there are a lot of them out there so
keep that in mind

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.767
C++ developers have
one of the highest

00:04:56.792 --> 00:05:00.010
salaries in the world.
I think that I'm

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.986
not sure like assembly,
I think kee is more but

00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:09.500
something like that but
C++ programmers have one

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.948
of the highest salaries in
the world as opposed to

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:16.319
PHP programmers or anything
like that primarily

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.730
in fact that it's
extremely complex, I

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:20.795
don't know in recent
years I think it's

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.948
on part with Java in
terms of salary but

00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:25.270
it ranks up pretty
high so keep that

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.096
in mind there are plenty
of jobs for it both in the

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:32.979
freelancing market and
pretty much companies also

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.235
requests it so it's a very
popular language it's

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.210
been around for very
long time and then you

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.667
refresh with the C++ elevade
standards there are

00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:43.789
basically like God saving
becasue a lot other

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.611
standardization has
been done some new

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:48.924
very useful libraries
have been added

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.980
and you have some fantastic functions
there are there as well that we will go

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.490
over so we will go
from square one and we

00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.660
will keep on moving
towards the more advanced

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.330
things and it will get very complex
the relatively short amount of time

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.275
through the course and you
will be able to learn a great

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.030
deal. Now, in addition to
all of this, you have the

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.751
Q&A section, in the Q&A
section of the course,

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:20.170
you can post any questions
that you might have

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.420
there will always be somebody there to
provide you with answers so if you

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.956
encounter problems if you can't
compile, if you code doesn't work,

00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:32.840
etc. Please go to the Q&A
section and somebody will be there

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.851
I usually hire people
to look at a Q&A

00:06:35.876 --> 00:06:38.250
section continuously
and provide you

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.040
the students with answers.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.384
so they'll help you out
they'll made the out

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.680
smoother and provide for
a better experience

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.609
overall. Another thing is that my Youtube
Channel is out and there and there'll

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:57.271
be a link somewhere here, I usually
create announcements there I create

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.614
updates in terms of
keyloggs and I stay for

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:05.800
example ok next month
doing this this is

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.760
the next course this is what I was
planning to do you'll be able to

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.925
stay updated etc, and
also please feel free to

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.430
send me private messages
in regard to request

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.230
you can request a particular
function to be added to the

00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:23.980
course that is also one of
the privileges and benefits

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.934
that I leave for my students,
so if I skip some things

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.190
in regard to C++ if I
haven't explained something

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.025
or if I made a mistake
somewhere or something

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.510
like that please feel
free to send me a

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.815
private message or fell
free to send an email

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.120
or in Youtube it
really doesn't matter

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.810
contact me however you
wish and tell me like: Hey

00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:49.270
I would like you to explain
this part and I would

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.903
like you to explain this
part, hey you didn't explain

00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:54.090
this, could you add this
to the course now there

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.335
are no guarantees that
I'll of course add

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.460
this videos but usually
I do as long as it is

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.570
something reasonable I go the
extra mile and I make it and

00:08:03.595 --> 00:08:08.680
it's gonna get posted on the course.
Why it is important? Well

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.012
I don't know if your student high
school student or college student

00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:17.870
or whatever and if you're struggling
with a particular subject

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.587
regards to C++ you can
make a request and

00:08:20.612 --> 00:08:22.990
perhaps I can make
videos in regard to that

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.282
subject to help
you along the way

00:08:25.307 --> 00:08:27.200
so that's very
nice, you can also

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.786
posts suggestions for
other courses if you like

00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:32.320
you can post suggestions
for content in general

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.834
what would you like
me to provide you.

00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:38.900
Also the review system,
please leave the

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.688
reviews, they are very
important of course,

00:08:41.713 --> 00:08:44.142
but if you leave a
bad review, that

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:46.636
is your right, and you
are fully in type

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:48.760
to it, please leave a
comment down below

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.141
a state I didn't like this
this and this and that

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.830
is why I gave one star
or something like that,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.180
just explaining why
why why you gave a

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:01.050
negative feedback so
that I can act on

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.628
it and perhaps change it
or improve it to do would

00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:07.610
do something like that
provide for a better

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.810
Anyway, I do believe that will
be it as far as the course

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:17.720
on C++ aside from all of
that, you can see my working

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.068
environment here, not
the cleanest or the

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.690
needed working
environment they're just

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.561
tons of cables on
the table, tons of

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:29.144
cables below the
table, keyboards

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.145
I have three or four
machines here working + god

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.990
knows how many virtual machines etc.
It's really

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.567
chaotic because I do all of my

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:41.089
stuff here aside from Udemy

00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:45.659
as well and sometimes I spent
three days in this room

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:49.540
like not going out anything,
I bring the supplies

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.525
in and that's like my
temple where I stay for

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.410
three days when a project
needs to be done.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:58.926
Anyway I'm always
accessible, I will

00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:02.600
always answer your
questions, doesn't

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.455
matter who you are, where
are you from or whatever,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.210
if you sent me a private
message I will do my very

00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:10.783
best to answer,
whether you are my

00:10:10.808 --> 00:10:12.909
student or not doesn't matter I

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:15.966
will do my best to
answer, I answer all of

00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:19.079
my questions and read
all of my emails and

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:22.058
questions and inquiries
and anything like

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:24.810
that so if I miss you
by chance, if I don't

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.743
don't reply to you just
send the same message

00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:32.050
again and you can push
to the top because I

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.670
receive like 100 inquiries during day I
really do try to answer them all

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:42.069
but if I miss one, I am so sorry just
send another one, just copy and pasted it

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:45.027
and send it again, it's gonna
get push to the top and I

00:10:45.052 --> 00:10:47.929
will do my very best to answer.
Anyway, I would like to

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:50.116
bet you all very
well and wish you

00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:52.173
a ton of luck with this course.
