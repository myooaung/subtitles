00:06.300 --> 00:12.000
So here is where you write comments and I could put any type of comment I wanted on here I could say

00:12.480 --> 00:18.400
you know I have new design tweaks for you to integrate.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.400
And I can comment like that.

00:20.520 --> 00:20.850
OK.

00:20.850 --> 00:26.150
So now the person who is a theoretical freelancer would see this almost immediately.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.870
What I can also do which is extremely helpful is I can just go up here and add attachments so I can

00:30.870 --> 00:33.610
attach a computer or Dropbox Google Drive.

00:33.660 --> 00:40.290
So say this person is building a screen and I just changed it tweaked a small design on it and I want

00:40.290 --> 00:41.580
them to change that.

00:41.610 --> 00:48.180
All you have to do is go up here and attach from a computer and import it into this so quite literally

00:48.180 --> 00:52.040
there's no more of this hey where's the design that we need.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.210
Missing the wrong I have the right version of the design.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.660
You don't have to send them this big convoluted folder full of designs.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.420
You can literally just put it on each individual task.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.030
And one way of doing this is say if you want to if you're working with the developer and you want them

01:06.030 --> 01:07.660
to build one big screen.

01:07.680 --> 01:14.790
So I say like build per screen you would put this task up immediately go over here give the drill down

01:14.790 --> 01:16.740
information specifically what you mean.

01:16.740 --> 01:21.070
Any comments you have any directives you have and Attash the designs.

01:21.150 --> 01:25.860
So the person comes up sees what they need to start working on first and then grabs the designs downloads

01:25.860 --> 01:27.320
them and starts on it.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.810
So that's a great way of dealing with inversion tracking and specifically finding designs.

01:32.970 --> 01:35.110
OK so there's a little other functionality over here.

01:35.310 --> 01:41.100
You can set a due date and this is very very helpful when you're working with a freelancer or a contractor

01:41.400 --> 01:46.020
because a lot of times you're going to be inclined not to give them deadlines and that's generally not

01:46.020 --> 01:47.670
a great idea.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.290
It's always a good idea to give them a deadline because it will allow them to prioritize what exactly

01:52.290 --> 01:58.200
is most important and allow them to at least give you some type of idea of how quickly they're working

01:58.290 --> 02:03.870
and when it's going to be done and the way that I suggest doing this especially with contract or outsource

02:03.900 --> 02:06.870
labor is you don't set a due date yourself.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.710
That doesn't really make sense even if you are technical.

02:09.720 --> 02:15.810
Even if you are very ingrained in the process and you know exactly how long it'll take to build the

02:15.810 --> 02:18.760
second screen it's not worth it for you to do that.

02:18.770 --> 02:22.220
It just builds resentment and it's inevitably going to be incorrect.

02:22.230 --> 02:26.700
You want them to set the due date and then you can have final say about whether or not you think it's

02:26.700 --> 02:29.680
going to take too long and you can have that discussion with them.

02:29.790 --> 02:33.960
But it makes more sense for them to reasonably give you a due date if they think it's going to take

02:33.960 --> 02:34.910
them two days.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.670
They should do that if they think it's going to take them three days.

02:37.710 --> 02:39.100
They should do that.

02:39.210 --> 02:46.010
Don't I always suggest don't try to shove that down their throat and make them make them accepted due

02:46.020 --> 02:48.850
date that you arbitrarily made up in your head.

02:49.350 --> 02:53.790
So right here and then all I can say when I want it to be done here is today you can't say in the past

02:54.560 --> 02:58.600
but you know let's say it's due in five days so I could say the 29th.

02:58.830 --> 02:59.060
OK.

02:59.070 --> 03:04.600
I can even be specific like say I have a product launch or an e-mail going out.

03:05.010 --> 03:09.040
It's going out at 3:00 p.m. so I need to have this done and uploaded at 2:00 pm.

03:09.280 --> 03:15.600
I can also set it to a recurring task and I can also you know do things like liking it.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.500
That's helpful when you're in large organizations because people can like things.

03:19.830 --> 03:25.020
It's helpful when you add adding things like ideas in here and then people can say and like it and then

03:25.020 --> 03:27.620
you can go up here and sort by popularity.

03:27.810 --> 03:28.120
OK.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.360
Now now that you've set a due date on one of your task what you can then do is go and look at your calendar

03:33.360 --> 03:39.420
for your project and this is kind of cool what it'll do is it will automatically populate your task

03:39.480 --> 03:40.420
in a calendar.

03:40.440 --> 03:45.690
So I'm literally looking at this and today's Monday I could look at Monday and say oh by tomorrow I

03:45.690 --> 03:52.440
have I expected this section to be done or this feature to be done or this bug to be fixed and I can

03:52.440 --> 03:57.080
see oh this one is specifically going to be uploaded at 2 pm.

03:57.100 --> 04:05.590
I'm not familiar with it or I'd knock off my head or I can just click it and go directly to it and then

04:05.590 --> 04:07.760
right there I can just see what exactly it is.

04:07.750 --> 04:13.000
And typically with your freelancer your contractor you can have a long thread of you know what's going

04:13.000 --> 04:14.330
on.

04:14.410 --> 04:17.070
Explanation's conversations et cetera et cetera.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.650
So very very helpful.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.370
Big projects this will fill up very quickly.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.520
This is also very helpful too.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.990
You can go directly to attachments.

04:25.990 --> 04:31.120
Now if I go to attachment So what's going to happen is it's going to take every single attachment that

04:31.120 --> 04:35.400
are in any of those threads any of those tasks and it's going to put it here.

04:35.440 --> 04:41.050
So it's going to be a big pile of all of the assets all of the files all of the instructions you needed

04:41.050 --> 04:42.340
for the task.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.100
And that's very very helpful if you're just looking specifically for a file.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.280
You don't need to know what thread it was posted in.

04:48.280 --> 04:55.340
You can always just go to this pile right here OK one of the other things that you it's very important

04:55.340 --> 05:01.010
to understand I do this is these are individual tasks but they don't have to be tasks.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.540
I can turn these into sections of I want to.

05:03.620 --> 05:03.880
OK.

05:03.890 --> 05:10.910
So now if I wanted one of these to instead be a section as opposed to a task I could just literally

05:10.910 --> 05:12.430
put a colon at the end of it.

05:12.800 --> 05:18.140
So you know I put a colon that turned it into a section as opposed to a task.

05:18.140 --> 05:23.060
Now I do want to do sections sections make a lot more sense because I can build this out say my application

05:23.060 --> 05:28.700
has five screens I could build you know first screen and then we could say build second screen and we

05:28.700 --> 05:34.810
could say build a screen like that and we go all the way down to five.

05:34.820 --> 05:40.100
You also create them by going like this and just going new section right here and I'll add one now if

05:40.100 --> 05:44.330
I wanted to add a task underneath this all I'd have to do is hit enter and there you go.

05:44.330 --> 05:48.180
Now I have a task now I can get much more granular with it.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.210
I can now say specifically what needs to be happening in the first screen.

05:52.220 --> 06:01.520
So the screen has the Facebook log in I could say Facebook log in to be installed and you know you could

06:01.520 --> 06:06.380
say logo must be displayed etc. etc..

06:06.380 --> 06:12.560
So what this allows us to do is branch them out into sections break down the sections in individual

06:12.560 --> 06:20.000
pieces and then allow them to update you as individual things get finished and you have a real time

06:20.270 --> 06:27.740
kind of trail of what's happening as they go and they click through them and you see kind of from a

06:27.740 --> 06:33.200
project standpoint how quickly your application or your project or whatever it is you're working on

06:33.200 --> 06:35.470
or building gets filled up.

06:35.540 --> 06:40.660
And now as I am doing this I can again go back and look at the complete tasks.

06:40.670 --> 06:45.170
One of the more interesting things you can do then is go to your project and just double tap it and

06:45.170 --> 06:53.090
it'll actually give you a project overview over here right here where it says your progress as tasks

06:53.090 --> 06:58.280
are being added and those tasks will remain so at the very beginning we might add say 100 different

06:58.280 --> 07:04.880
things and then right over here as we start knocking them off we can see over time how quickly we are

07:04.880 --> 07:08.900
either accelerating in our project completion or slowing down.

07:08.900 --> 07:13.610
That's really helpful to see if you have a freelancer's just knocking out tasks knocking out a task

07:13.610 --> 07:18.620
and then all of a sudden maybe has another project pop up or you get distracted and then you see it

07:18.620 --> 07:25.250
start to plateau or drop and all of a sudden that's a good way of channeling that they've lost enthusiasm

07:25.250 --> 07:27.440
or lost interest or lost time.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.250
You can also use statuses right here.

07:30.260 --> 07:34.920
Here you can just post the statuses is helpful if you have multiple people working on a project and

07:34.970 --> 07:35.900
that is not uncommon.

07:35.900 --> 07:45.490
If I had multiple people I could just say freelance or to email feel bad for freelance or to at gmail

07:45.570 --> 07:50.360
they're about to get e-mailed but I can also add them into this project.

07:50.390 --> 07:55.340
And then all of a sudden you know I can add statuses and any time I add a status they'll get notified

07:55.340 --> 08:00.750
of it so I could say you know project going well.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.180
I could also say

08:05.140 --> 08:10.290
I can also say you know the mobile application has crashed.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.300
Nothing works.

08:12.370 --> 08:17.340
So yes ok set that status everyone gets notified.

08:18.140 --> 08:22.430
So you set that status it goes to pretty much everyone when you need to do it on Harris to notify people

08:22.430 --> 08:23.930
and then add them.

08:23.930 --> 08:31.430
So you could add that out and then any time I push a status it will quite literally just push that message

08:31.430 --> 08:35.450
to everyone on their phones they'll get a push notification from the application.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.620
Very helpful.

08:36.620 --> 08:42.320
This is something you can use when your application is live or whatever it is and you need immediate

08:42.320 --> 08:44.200
feedback or immediate fixes.

08:44.210 --> 08:49.670
Very very helpful thing else so we really need to cover is the inbox and you can see up here in the

08:49.670 --> 08:54.860
inbox really all this is as you know as you have threads and idea of multiple projects as people message

08:54.860 --> 08:56.290
your update threads.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.030
It's going to populate in here.

08:58.090 --> 09:01.370
And as you get them populated you can say that you read them and they disappear.

09:01.370 --> 09:07.010
So this is typically something you can always check just to see what exactly you need to put your attention

09:07.010 --> 09:09.710
towards that you're not so when you didn't you you their e-mail all the time.

09:09.830 --> 09:15.040
OK so we've covered pretty much everything you need to know to get acquainted with a sauna.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.380
Very very simple.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.340
It's all task based.

09:18.350 --> 09:24.380
It has a very powerful notification system very easy to integrate your freelancers contractors into

09:24.380 --> 09:28.460
your projects makes it such that there's really no excuse for them not to join it.

09:28.580 --> 09:34.820
And overall a very easy way to keep track of what you're doing and keep track of where your project

09:34.910 --> 09:40.730
is now that you're acquainted we can move on and I can show you how we use a sauna when we're building

09:40.760 --> 09:48.020
our projects and what's the easy kind of template for setting up asana projects and for how you handle

09:48.020 --> 09:50.250
the actual workflow with a freelancer.

09:50.300 --> 09:57.690
So I'll see you guys in next lecture.
