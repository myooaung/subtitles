00:10.720 --> 00:12.940
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:12.940 --> 00:18.550
We're going to talk about a common scenario that can happen to you when you're hiring a freelancer or

00:18.550 --> 00:20.320
hire a contractor.

00:20.320 --> 00:25.570
The scenario is when a freelancer changes or raises their price on you.

00:25.570 --> 00:31.870
Now obviously this is one of the bad bad bad situations that can happen in any type of relationship.

00:31.870 --> 00:37.310
I mean this happened really with any vendor any customer any investor anyone really.

00:37.330 --> 00:41.570
But with freelancers and contractors it is something that can occur.

00:41.950 --> 00:47.890
And if you do this long enough you will run into some Dario's where a freelancer changes their price.

00:47.890 --> 00:53.040
Now primarily when I talk about freelancers raising their price I mean that you work with the freelancer

00:53.050 --> 00:58.930
once they did something for let's say $20 an hour then in the future when you want to contract them

00:58.930 --> 01:00.610
for the same amount of work they say.

01:00.610 --> 01:03.520
Now it's 30 dollars an hour or 40 dollars an hour.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.010
Now if that's the case that is not really that unusual because you have to think of it in terms of their

01:09.010 --> 01:10.010
portfolio.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.950
If you've done work with them then it sounds like they're probably going to take what you did and put

01:14.950 --> 01:17.830
it in their portfolio and also it means that time has elapsed.

01:17.830 --> 01:22.330
So whenever they're bidding on projects now they have a lot more to show for what they've done in the

01:22.330 --> 01:23.160
past.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.420
And now all of a sudden they can ask for a higher price.

01:25.450 --> 01:30.220
A lot of times freelancers will work with you and they know in their head they're working at a discounted

01:30.220 --> 01:37.720
rate and that's solely because they don't have enough of a clientele base or enough of a portfolio.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.230
Now that's the innocuous kind of version of this if that's the case.

01:41.230 --> 01:47.020
Honestly what you can do is you can try to say hey we you know we worked on it before at this price.

01:47.020 --> 01:52.380
I'd be more than happy if we continue at the rate we've established before.

01:52.390 --> 01:58.360
Typically if you can then explain to them why your budget is is the way it is and why that previous

01:58.360 --> 01:59.780
price worked for you.

01:59.800 --> 02:06.160
They're usually then all the way that you have to offset their increase in perceived value of themselves

02:06.610 --> 02:09.810
is by using some of the perks we talked about before.

02:09.820 --> 02:15.670
You need to find ways of making your proposal non-monetary more attractive.

02:15.670 --> 02:20.620
Now what I mean by that you know if they are wanting $40 an hour and you're trying to get $20 an hour

02:20.660 --> 02:23.320
you need to make everything around that proposal better.

02:23.320 --> 02:28.110
So what you can say is oh well it's a larger block of work.

02:28.150 --> 02:28.780
Right.

02:28.990 --> 02:34.060
Remember freelancers hate having to spend time finding projects but they like working on projects.

02:34.060 --> 02:39.910
So if you say to them you know this is a big hundred hour project then they might be willing to forego

02:39.910 --> 02:41.980
the extra money that they raised.

02:41.980 --> 02:46.990
You can also press on the fact that you have a previous working relationship which means that they can

02:46.990 --> 02:52.990
get started much more quickly than before if they're working with a brand new contractor which means

02:52.990 --> 02:58.780
that they can get working a lot faster than if they are working with a brand new employer.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.240
You can always entice them with other work.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.860
The fact that you're coming back to them means that you're serious about using them you can tell them

03:05.860 --> 03:09.610
about how there are other projects you have that you're willing to give them.

03:09.760 --> 03:15.130
Make it kind of like a package deal make it sound like you know I'm going to give you this project and

03:15.130 --> 03:19.930
if you work with me at the same rate I'm going to give you these other projects so for them all of a

03:19.930 --> 03:25.270
sudden it's like they're building a lower rate but it's for a lot more work so you can always match

03:25.270 --> 03:28.270
price but you can always make it up for volume.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.640
There are other smaller ways of offsetting this increase in price.

03:30.640 --> 03:35.530
You can say to them you know you're willing to give them a great review or a testimonial.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.570
You can even say that you they can use your project as a case study.

03:38.590 --> 03:44.000
However obviously be aware that this is actually kind of what caused the problem to begin with.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.620
If you keep doing that the price is going to keep rising until it gets to the point where it's just

03:47.620 --> 03:51.870
not rational for them to lower the price all the way back down to what it was originally.

03:51.970 --> 03:55.750
Now this happens all the time work with the freelancer they do very well.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.730
Then later I try to rehire them.

03:57.730 --> 04:02.200
And while a good freelancer is going to do well in general and they're going to have they're going to

04:02.200 --> 04:04.870
be popular so their price has risen.

04:04.870 --> 04:10.000
Typically I can negotiate them down to about half the price range but in some scenarios I'm actually

04:10.000 --> 04:14.770
able to get them back near the original rate by offsetting it with other things.

04:14.770 --> 04:18.130
A lot of times they kind of give you a oh I've worked with you before disco.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.380
Now in this scenario that you've started a project I'm a freelancer raises their price that is less

04:23.380 --> 04:26.290
common but it is still is still a serious deal.

04:26.290 --> 04:32.250
So you set a milestone system and after milestone to the freelancer decides to raise their price.

04:32.260 --> 04:37.660
Now what is typically going on here now the freelancers probably discovered in the middle of the work

04:37.660 --> 04:40.960
that it's a lot more complicated than they previously thought.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.310
Now that could be due to two things.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.400
One you didn't give them enough information up front.

04:44.410 --> 04:49.000
Or two they simply didn't do the diligence and the research to figure out how expensive it should have

04:49.000 --> 04:49.740
been.

04:49.750 --> 04:56.080
This is something that happens frequently with bidders who are bidding and they bid across lots and

04:56.080 --> 04:57.010
lots of projects.

04:57.130 --> 05:03.070
They simply don't have the attention span and the time spent on your project to actually be able to

05:03.070 --> 05:08.350
forecast how much effort it's going to take reliably and so a lot of times those people drop out.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.130
That's why we covered previously in the looking for things like message fatigue.

05:12.170 --> 05:16.190
So if it is the case that you're in the middle of a project and a freelancer decides that it's a lot

05:16.190 --> 05:19.510
more complicated or they need to be paid more money.

05:19.760 --> 05:24.410
Really what you do is you need to set down and actually think about what's going on you need to assess

05:24.410 --> 05:29.210
whether or not you put your full effort forward in describing what the project was.

05:29.390 --> 05:34.430
And if you follow all the tips and techniques in this course this will never happen to you because there

05:34.430 --> 05:40.160
are so many different safeguards before you even start a project to weed out people who are more likely

05:40.160 --> 05:45.860
to do this but also to look for weaknesses in your spec sheet and your overviews so that there really

05:45.860 --> 05:50.720
are no minds when you actually get into the actual project development.

05:50.720 --> 05:57.380
If it is the case that you did actually misrepresent your project you need to understand that freelancers

05:57.380 --> 05:58.140
are not psychic.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.230
They can't possibly understand every single thing the project's going to need.

06:02.300 --> 06:09.050
And they also are kind of basing their bid or their estimate off of a general range they think it's

06:09.050 --> 06:11.960
going to cost it's never exact.

06:11.960 --> 06:17.060
Now obviously if you did time and materials or you did that hybrid rate that we previously talked about

06:17.360 --> 06:18.370
then you don't have this problem.

06:18.370 --> 06:21.020
This is really only a problem when you're doing a project costs.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.880
This is one of the reasons why we always say don't do a project cost.

06:24.020 --> 06:29.240
But if it is the case you misrepresent yourself then you do need to be aware of the fact that you probably

06:29.240 --> 06:32.230
shouldn't be paying more and you need to reassess it.

06:32.300 --> 06:38.240
Make sure to get outside bids so that you can use that as leverage to explain to them this is a realistic

06:38.240 --> 06:43.100
bid if it's the case that no actually they just misunderstood it.

06:43.370 --> 06:48.800
Well typically what will happen in this case is you're going to have to explain to them the importance

06:48.800 --> 06:54.410
of finishing the project and explain to them after that point you know we'll make sure that all future

06:54.410 --> 07:01.370
projects are you know green light on both sides that the price is accurate and that we do double checking

07:01.970 --> 07:03.810
to make sure that the price is OK.

07:03.920 --> 07:08.540
In most cases the freelancer is fine with continuing because they don't want to waste their time as

07:08.540 --> 07:09.090
well.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.720
They want something to show for their work.

07:11.780 --> 07:17.570
And most times just trying to talk them through it to explain that you gave them all the information

07:17.570 --> 07:18.730
up front.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.390
That's usually enough for them to say OK I'm going to finish it but then I'm done.

07:23.390 --> 07:27.290
If you tell them you know oh I see I understand this is a mistake but we gave you all the information

07:27.290 --> 07:28.710
you need in the future.

07:28.730 --> 07:33.710
It will be fixed and you tell them again leverage the fact that they can have future projects that is

07:33.710 --> 07:35.590
usually enough to get them over the hump.

07:35.660 --> 07:39.170
Past that you can obviously use other perks to get them to finish.

07:39.170 --> 07:44.630
You can also use the stick as opposed to the carrot and make sure they understand that a negative review

07:44.630 --> 07:46.730
is very powerful on their profile.

07:46.730 --> 07:53.960
Again we tried to look for freelancers that have past histories working on the platform because then

07:53.960 --> 07:57.500
they have something that you can kind of hold against them in case something goes wrong.

07:57.630 --> 08:03.200
OK so those are the two main scenarios where you might have a price problem or a freelancer changes

08:03.200 --> 08:04.190
their price.

08:04.230 --> 08:07.990
One's pretty innocuous ones a lot harder and a lot trickier.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.130
But if you follow the kind of prescriptions I've given you in this lecture you should be able to get

08:13.130 --> 08:18.250
through the majority of problems you guys have any questions or any experiences you'd like to share.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.850
Posts in the group discussion I'd love to help you through it.

08:20.930 --> 08:25.330
Help you weed through any kind of sticky weird situations you have.

08:25.580 --> 08:34.670
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
