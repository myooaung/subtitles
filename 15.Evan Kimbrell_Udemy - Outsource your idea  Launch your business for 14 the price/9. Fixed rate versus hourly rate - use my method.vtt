00:05.790 --> 00:10.920
Inevitably when you list your project you're going to run into the question of whether or not you should

00:10.920 --> 00:14.600
do a fixed rate or a per hour project.

00:14.610 --> 00:20.880
Most studios you'll talk to will prefer a per hour because they understand that most projects will always

00:20.880 --> 00:25.440
have things that slip through the cracks things that aren't listed out in the specifications for the

00:25.440 --> 00:31.100
project and they get paid on a piecemeal basis to cover the entire project.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.890
That's a little bit idealistic I would say because most people who list their projects are not going

00:37.890 --> 00:42.300
to want to just have an open ended budget like that they're not going to want to say yeah a hundred

00:42.300 --> 00:46.330
dollars an hour until it's finished because I can get out of hand very quickly.

00:46.390 --> 00:52.020
And you kind of need to rely on the expertise of the freelancer or the firm to tell you how long this

00:52.020 --> 00:54.680
is going to take and then you want them to stick to that timeline.

00:55.660 --> 01:03.100
So what are the pros and cons associated with fixed cost and per hour projects with a fixed cost.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.020
Obviously the biggest pro is that you can save a lot of money when people give you a fixed cost.

01:08.020 --> 01:14.740
It is inevitably going to be lower than what it actually would cost per hour mainly because they know

01:14.740 --> 01:18.550
that when they give you a fixed cost price you're comparing against other people.

01:18.550 --> 01:25.140
And so they have a very strong incentive to keep that number down obviously be aware of people who pitch

01:25.140 --> 01:30.530
you prices that are abnormally low that means are probably cutting too many corners and they're assuming

01:30.530 --> 01:34.150
this is a lot smaller of a project and it probably really is.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.670
But the biggest cost savings come from fixed price projects.

01:38.930 --> 01:43.850
Now also an advantage of fixed price is that you can know going into it what exactly your budget should

01:43.850 --> 01:44.870
be.

01:44.870 --> 01:50.360
If they say that your projects and it costs $2000 or a thousand dollars that is a good indication of

01:50.360 --> 01:52.060
what your budget should be.

01:52.070 --> 01:58.070
However always keep a contingency fund just in case there are things outside of the scope of the application

01:58.430 --> 02:04.010
that you're going to need to rehire the freelancer or the firm to go back and add.

02:04.040 --> 02:08.840
Now the biggest con to the fixed price project in my eyes is the negative incentive structure that it

02:08.840 --> 02:10.000
creates.

02:10.010 --> 02:14.520
Let's say that you've engaged with a firm to build your application.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.020
Now if they said it's going to cost $800 that is the pre-agreed amount.

02:20.030 --> 02:22.030
Now how did they get to that $800.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.770
Well for them they're going to try as much as possible to cut costs when in the middle of the project

02:27.770 --> 02:32.840
if they see something that's a cry for extra effort they're simply going to ignore it because they want

02:32.840 --> 02:35.350
it to be exactly around that $800.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.770
And it gives them a huge incentive to go below eight hundred dollars so that they can have a profit

02:39.770 --> 02:40.320
line.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.520
This is not the case with freelancers However they will do the same thing.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.160
They budget in their head how long this is going to take.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.320
That's how they calculate your fixed price.

02:49.380 --> 02:54.410
And when it goes over that amount of time you can find some really negative things will happen.

02:54.420 --> 02:58.740
The freelancer might cut back on the amount of time they're dedicating to the project.

02:58.740 --> 03:05.130
They might start delivering lower quality code all of the headaches you've heard about people working

03:05.130 --> 03:11.580
with contractors typically has to do with fixed price projects and on the other side of the table you're

03:11.610 --> 03:17.010
the one who contracted out an $800 project you're going to try to squeeze out every single bit of value

03:17.070 --> 03:23.940
out of that as you can probably argue later down the line that your specifications actually said that

03:23.970 --> 03:26.490
they should do more and more and more.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.050
So you have two forces working in opposite directions and they're not working towards each other which

03:32.050 --> 03:34.520
is the way they should because you both should be on the same page.

03:34.660 --> 03:40.390
You want to create the best product and not just fulfill the requirements that you've written to the

03:40.390 --> 03:41.670
best you can.

03:42.100 --> 03:48.340
At the end of the day getting a cheap project bid is not worth the chance that the freelancer or the

03:48.340 --> 03:54.070
contracting firm ends up losing interest of the project or ends up bailing on it.

03:54.100 --> 03:59.280
If you notice on freelancer dot com they list out the completion rate because they have so many freelancers

03:59.290 --> 04:04.510
they have people who underbid everyone else and then what you'll notice is an average completion rate

04:04.510 --> 04:06.240
might be 70 percent.

04:06.250 --> 04:11.200
So what happens if you're that 30 percent and can really kind of screw up your project and it can really

04:11.200 --> 04:14.610
add months to your timeline for launch.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.800
On the other hand we have the option of paying per hour.

04:18.840 --> 04:23.640
Obviously the advantage of per hour is you don't have to have the same kind of stress between you and

04:23.640 --> 04:24.750
the contractor.

04:24.750 --> 04:28.080
They know that whatever effort they put in is going to get paid.

04:28.110 --> 04:33.600
So there are going to focus on making the product as good as possible because they know that if they

04:33.600 --> 04:36.460
put an overtime hours they're going to get paid for it.

04:37.420 --> 04:44.320
Per hour projects also make it such that you don't have to stick to your requirements to the T because

04:44.320 --> 04:48.160
the requirements are helpful for the developer to understand what they're building.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.950
But it's also to help them understand what is getting paid for and what isn't They're paying per hour.

04:52.960 --> 04:58.690
You can very easily and fluently add things to your specifications and you also don't need to make a

04:58.690 --> 05:03.730
very long packet of information for them because you know that whenever they have questions about what

05:03.730 --> 05:05.730
to build you can answer it at that time.

05:05.740 --> 05:12.430
So if the idea of what you're trying to build isn't 100 percent concrete you can instead opt to use

05:12.430 --> 05:18.310
a per hour agreement and then spend less time upfront building your requirements and your specifications

05:18.490 --> 05:21.720
and more time as the project progresses.

05:21.730 --> 05:26.230
This allows you an advantage that you can build something and as you see it getting better you can change

05:26.230 --> 05:26.490
it.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.470
You can modify it and you kind of tweak in whatever direction that you think you should go with it.

05:31.390 --> 05:35.890
The obvious disadvantage of the paying per hour is that you don't know what your budget is going to

05:35.890 --> 05:36.270
be.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.970
And it happens a lot of the time that the budget will just get out from under you.

05:41.170 --> 05:46.510
You expected to spend a couple of thousand dollars and you you know after a couple of months you know

05:46.540 --> 05:53.950
$5000 that can happen especially you're not keeping tabs on what's being done how long it's taking it

05:53.950 --> 05:58.780
makes it very hard upfront to know what it's going to cost at the very end.

05:58.780 --> 06:01.950
Another disadvantage is that it inevitably is more expensive.

06:02.110 --> 06:07.030
If I ask someone what their per hour wage is they're going to pitch me something that's way higher than

06:07.060 --> 06:09.810
if I ask them how much a project would cost.

06:09.850 --> 06:13.260
That is roughly equivalent of say eight hours of work.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.880
It's just something about psychology and the way that people bid.

06:17.080 --> 06:22.660
That makes it so that per hour prices are much higher than fixed price projects.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.700
Another big disadvantage with paying per hour is that sometimes you don't know whether or not they're

06:28.700 --> 06:34.850
being honest in how much they're charging you unless you have something set up like an oDesk team room

06:35.030 --> 06:36.910
or at Elance work room.

06:36.920 --> 06:43.370
It's very hard to say what is worth four hours of work and how much of that time was spent working and

06:43.370 --> 06:46.100
how much time was spent not working.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.330
You open the opportunity for someone to be a little frivolous with their billing.

06:50.510 --> 06:56.260
I've known a lot of contractors who are otherwise reputable to take their invoices and add 20 percent

06:56.270 --> 07:02.990
regardless getting into an argument with a developer over what should have taken eight hours or four

07:02.990 --> 07:06.680
hours or 12 hours that is not an argument you want to have.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.350
You honestly are just not in a good position to say how productive that person should be.

07:11.350 --> 07:12.910
It's way too complex.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.670
So how do I get around this.

07:15.680 --> 07:20.570
I've come up with a solution that I think works quite well and I strongly suggest you do it too.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.700
I do a hybrid.

07:22.770 --> 07:27.900
I asked the contractor upfront to tell me not the project price but how many hours they think it'll

07:27.900 --> 07:29.340
take them to do.

07:29.640 --> 07:34.380
And then once I have the hours that's roughly the equivalent of what I'd see in a fixed cost price I'd

07:34.410 --> 07:36.840
been negotiating rates slightly lower.

07:36.840 --> 07:43.860
So if they say to take me 100 hours and I want $50 an hour what I can say is OK I'll approve it at thirty

07:43.860 --> 07:46.470
five dollars an hour again.

07:46.530 --> 07:50.360
Kind of takes in the advantage of being able to leverage this project against.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.320
And once I see that you've approved a large portion of ours chances are they're going to say yes regardless

07:55.320 --> 07:56.940
of what the actual rate ends up being.

07:57.030 --> 07:58.910
You don't necessarily have to haggle them.

07:59.160 --> 08:04.800
Sometimes you will lose a freelancer by doing this but the most more often than not they will stick

08:04.800 --> 08:07.090
with you and you'll take a significant discount.

08:07.140 --> 08:12.260
Now after the 100 hours has expired when I start to do is I do everything piecemeal.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.790
So I say I want to add this section to it.

08:14.790 --> 08:19.680
Now how long will that take you in terms of hours and then what they'll do is they'll pitch it back

08:19.680 --> 08:20.980
to me in hours.

08:21.090 --> 08:24.960
And so I'll say I want to add this feature and they'll say oh that's an easy one that'll take me three

08:24.960 --> 08:30.960
hours and they know that three hours is in this case times 35.

08:30.990 --> 08:33.020
So it's $105.

08:33.090 --> 08:37.540
And so they know that they have to keep the per hours low otherwise it's not going to get approved.

08:37.650 --> 08:42.270
And that's how I prevent people from running up the hours so if I said add this small feature and they

08:42.270 --> 08:45.260
just said 10 hours it should be six.

08:45.270 --> 08:47.830
They know that there's a chance it won't get approved.

08:47.940 --> 08:51.810
And I will argue with them and I might say OK that's too complicated is there any way you can make it

08:51.810 --> 08:52.610
simpler.

08:52.800 --> 08:59.070
And virtually every time they can find a way of reducing it by 20 30 percent doing it incrementally

08:59.070 --> 09:04.200
like that makes it such that the freelancer knows they have to be honest about the price and it makes

09:04.200 --> 09:08.670
it much harder for them to inflate the numbers and also makes it much harder for the numbers to run

09:08.670 --> 09:13.710
away from you because if I prove 100 hours I know exactly what that cost then I know how much is left

09:13.710 --> 09:14.430
in my budget.

09:14.520 --> 09:20.490
And then I start approving all eyechart sections saying OK four hours here eight hours here 10 hours

09:20.490 --> 09:23.340
here and that's how I reach the remainder of my budget.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.100
That's how I keep the freelancer engaged in honest.
