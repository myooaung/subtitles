Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:12.170 --> 00:18.680
In this lecture we're going to talk about one of the elements that's involved in using those outsourcing

00:18.680 --> 00:21.660
freelancing platforms that we cover.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.190
We're going to answer the question is your actual site reputation important.

00:26.210 --> 00:31.100
So if you've noticed this after you're done with a project with the freelancer they leave your review

00:31.130 --> 00:33.050
and you leave them a review.

00:33.050 --> 00:38.830
You write them on a number of different things and it varies between the platforms.

00:38.840 --> 00:45.320
Several of them actually record how much money you've spent and how quickly you pay the freelancer.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.140
So obviously with most platforms out there whether or not you're renting a space on air B and B or picking

00:51.140 --> 00:57.970
up a ride on uber you probably would think that it's important that your ratings stays as high as possible

00:57.980 --> 01:00.610
as you the consumer and you the person paying money.

01:00.620 --> 01:06.320
So is your site reputation important and is not as important as you would think.

01:06.350 --> 01:13.270
I've seen over the years many many people who posted jobs had terrible feedback and still got a kid.

01:13.300 --> 01:19.010
You know consistently got large amounts of bids and found great freelancers.

01:19.010 --> 01:20.500
Now why is that.

01:20.500 --> 01:25.220
Now there's a couple of reasons it might be the case that people with bad feedback still get a lot of

01:25.220 --> 01:27.000
bids and a lot of interest.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.870
I think one is because bids are not really indicative of whether or not a freelancer is paying attention

01:32.870 --> 01:34.850
to who the employer is.

01:34.850 --> 01:38.480
Typically if someone's bidding on their project they're spending most of their time looking at your

01:38.660 --> 01:42.740
actual project description and your specs whatever you've attached to it.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.420
They rarely get to the point where they're checking out you your actual profile and making a decision

01:47.420 --> 01:50.060
whether or not it's worth it to waste their time on it.

01:50.090 --> 01:54.770
That's not something they typically do up front unless it's a large project.

01:54.770 --> 02:00.260
Now the other reason is I think that a lot of freelancers are just you know if they're biased towards

02:00.260 --> 02:06.320
whether or not they fit a project if they fit a project and the employer is showing interest in them

02:06.560 --> 02:10.870
and it seems like a good fit they're obviously going to be more interested in that project.

02:10.910 --> 02:15.560
And typically they're going to throw away the fact that the other you know the employer has some negative

02:15.560 --> 02:18.340
reviews has some marks on their profile.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.400
Now the one scenario where having bad reviews can actually come and kind of bite you later when perhaps

02:25.400 --> 02:31.730
you're launching larger projects now larger projects because a freelancer can make more money off of

02:31.730 --> 02:35.250
it and can have more billable hours off of it.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.130
They're actually going to spend more time up front larger projects are going to require even you know

02:40.130 --> 02:42.730
30 minutes of time on their own.

02:42.860 --> 02:50.360
Putting together a thoughtful complete you know very is sometimes well-researched proposal and if that's

02:50.360 --> 02:53.560
the case they're much much more likely to look at the employer.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.510
And if there's a lot of negative reviews they'll probably say that it's not worth the significant time

02:59.510 --> 03:01.790
it would take to actually bid on your project.

03:01.790 --> 03:05.960
Now the other scenario where this could become a problem is when you're doing some of the more advanced

03:05.960 --> 03:08.520
vetting techniques that we cover in this course.

03:08.540 --> 03:15.530
So if you're using things like screener questions if you're doing the $50 test if you're asking them

03:15.530 --> 03:20.150
to do small bits of work send it to you to evaluate it.

03:20.150 --> 03:26.240
If you're doing the sample technique there's a good chance that the freelancer will not do it simply

03:26.240 --> 03:31.370
because they're looking at your profile and deciding whether or not they want to spend another 20 minutes

03:31.370 --> 03:32.210
on it.

03:32.210 --> 03:37.970
Obviously they're going to be inclined to work with you because they feel as if there's a better chance

03:37.970 --> 03:39.130
of being chosen.

03:39.230 --> 03:43.670
But it can become a significant problem especially if you use multiple vetting techniques.

03:43.670 --> 03:49.880
But the more important thing is that if you're getting repeatedly negative reviews there could be something

03:49.880 --> 03:52.840
wrong with the way that you are contracting out.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.460
There could be a lot of issues and don't waste the opportunity to find a way of improving what you're

03:58.460 --> 03:59.110
doing.

03:59.330 --> 04:04.100
So realistically if you have a matter of view it's not the end of the world it actually doesn't really

04:04.100 --> 04:10.760
even matter unless you're doing large projects unless you're doing a lot of intensive vetting and you're

04:10.760 --> 04:14.730
looking for long term partners and so you're asking them to do a lot more work up front.

04:14.750 --> 04:15.950
That's one of becomes a problem.

04:15.950 --> 04:21.130
But up until that point it's not really an issue you're still going be able to find great freelancers.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.450
And once you do find a great freelancer the review from that is probably going to eventually reach you

04:26.750 --> 04:28.460
up to kind of a level point.

04:28.460 --> 04:33.860
If you're still getting bad feedback make sure to figure out what you're doing wrong and why it is that

04:33.860 --> 04:36.470
you're repeatedly having bad experiences.

04:36.530 --> 04:42.230
It's probably something wrong in the process that you're using and it's a great opportunity for improvement.

04:42.230 --> 04:49.960
So I will see in the next lecture.
