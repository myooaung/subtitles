00:05.760 --> 00:06.980
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:06.990 --> 00:12.390
So in this lecture we're going to talk about response rate and I'm going to show you some real examples

00:12.630 --> 00:16.070
of how different contractors under different scenarios respond.

00:16.070 --> 00:21.390
Now the response rate is incredibly important if I haven't already made that point before but I'm going

00:21.390 --> 00:24.950
to show you what kind of an impact it has on your project.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.170
I'm going to show you some examples where some people respond very quickly and some don't.

00:30.300 --> 00:35.230
It's really important to understand this and know what to look for know what to ignore.

00:35.340 --> 00:35.770
OK.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.780
Let's go to screencast.

00:37.790 --> 00:42.740
All right welcome back to the course so in this lecture I want to talk just a little bit about how you

00:42.740 --> 00:49.550
can monitor a response rate and use that as one of your criteria for determining who is a good freelancer

00:49.640 --> 00:51.590
What's a good proposal.

00:51.590 --> 00:56.510
So typically one of the things I suggest doing is a best practice is immediately after you list your

00:56.510 --> 00:56.870
post.

00:56.870 --> 00:59.960
Your job will start to get bids.

01:00.350 --> 01:05.660
And this is why I suggested previously in the course that you only list these job postings when you

01:05.660 --> 01:10.220
know you're going to a block of time to actually respond to them because obviously your response rate

01:10.220 --> 01:11.930
is very important.

01:11.930 --> 01:17.280
But it's really important because you can sniff out who exactly is away from the keyboard all the time.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.510
And what is your relationship going forward.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.950
Probably going to be like.

01:22.190 --> 01:26.840
So after you've gone through your initial proposals and using the techniques that we covered a little

01:26.840 --> 01:30.050
bit in the last lecture you're going to look for relevancy.

01:30.050 --> 01:32.920
You're going to look for message fatigue.

01:33.020 --> 01:38.990
You're going to look for poorly constructed sentences or sections I just don't make a ton of sense to

01:38.990 --> 01:40.100
you.

01:40.100 --> 01:45.260
One thing I'd like to do is pretty much immediately once someone has pass the sniff test I like to send

01:45.260 --> 01:48.950
them a message and that message might be completely redundant.

01:48.950 --> 01:53.790
It might just be me asking a question that I don't think was answered in their proposal.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.720
It might be something as simple as where are you located.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.750
What do you think of the project.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.670
Hey thanks for your message.

02:01.670 --> 02:03.010
Anything at all.

02:03.020 --> 02:08.960
Basically what I'm doing is I'm testing to see what exactly is their response rate going to be.

02:09.080 --> 02:15.740
What you'll find often is that if someone is mass bidding and they're doing mass proposals they might

02:15.740 --> 02:20.900
not respond very quickly and you can kind of catch them because they maybe they posted 50 in an hour

02:21.680 --> 02:26.450
and they're not expecting you to respond very quickly and you can obviously tell that because they're

02:26.450 --> 02:28.850
trying to go for a volume play.

02:28.850 --> 02:32.160
They're focusing on getting as many bids out as possible.

02:32.210 --> 02:37.280
So here's an example of someone that I just immediately messaged right off the bat.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.080
So right off the bat I just had to ask them because previously we've talked to there's a mismatch between

02:41.080 --> 02:42.910
our language skills and where the list.

02:43.070 --> 02:49.190
So I wanted to ask for clarification and as you can tell I asked it for 11 and they responded 4:49 That's

02:49.340 --> 02:55.190
pretty good I responded quite literally I think 10 minutes within from the point at which they submitted

02:55.190 --> 02:59.750
the bid so them being able to respond in 30 minutes.

02:59.750 --> 03:00.390
That's good.

03:00.390 --> 03:05.060
Not fantastic but that does show that they actually are paying attention and they're not mass bidding

03:05.270 --> 03:06.200
that's typically good.

03:06.200 --> 03:11.830
So that would be a plus for this person although you'll notice up here is that I asked a question they

03:11.840 --> 03:15.890
responded That's great I responded and then they never responded again.

03:15.890 --> 03:18.530
So maybe they lost interest maybe they got busy.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.000
Whatever it doesn't really matter.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.960
The more conversation you have with them you give them more opportunities to drop out.

03:23.990 --> 03:27.230
And that's a good thing because if they're willing to drop out that's not something you want to work

03:27.230 --> 03:27.700
with.

03:28.670 --> 03:34.430
So give an example of where the response rate test failed quite miserably.

03:34.460 --> 03:38.900
This this proposal from x x x x x x x.

03:39.310 --> 03:44.470
If he couldn't tell how professional that was to begin with what I did is I just immediately message

03:44.470 --> 03:45.460
them.

03:45.460 --> 03:50.140
So I just immediately message them as you can see four or three I think their bid came out came in at

03:50.140 --> 03:57.850
four o'clock so literally two minutes later I message them and I just pointed out the fact that they

03:57.850 --> 04:03.520
didn't divide their their estimate by the sections like I'd asked.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.580
And the second thing was they never answered whether or not they'd work for Twilio which is something

04:06.580 --> 04:08.440
I specifically asked for.

04:08.440 --> 04:13.210
So as you can see then their response came in seven hours later which is kind of crazy considering that

04:13.270 --> 04:15.750
they're probably online currently and bidding.

04:15.820 --> 04:21.790
It's possible that they were asleep or something like that but if they just bid and then you immediately

04:21.790 --> 04:23.300
respond and they don't respond back.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.270
That's just it's very unlikely it's the case that they sent you a message and as soon as they hit enter

04:28.390 --> 04:30.280
then their head hit a pillow and they fell asleep.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.230
So that's a very bad sign.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.090
And then you notice that it almost right off the bat.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.550
They don't actually answer any of the question.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.740
They just want immediately to get me off off the Elance system and onto Skype and that was something

04:41.740 --> 04:43.830
that I just did not want to do.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.820
So that's an easy way of testing responsiveness.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.620
You don't want a freelancer who's going to disappear.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.720
So what you can do from a very quick test is as if proposals start rolling in.

04:55.750 --> 05:01.030
Use the previous criteria to pick high quality ones you can ignore the ones that clearly score poorly

05:01.030 --> 05:04.180
on the the kind of criteria we established in the last lecture.

05:04.210 --> 05:06.220
Send them a message literally anything.

05:06.220 --> 05:09.840
All you're doing is seeing how quickly they respond.

05:09.850 --> 05:12.470
I'll show you the person who we ended up working with.

05:12.490 --> 05:18.490
And you can see and as you can guess they responded very quickly which is exactly what we want right.

05:18.490 --> 05:22.280
We want to make sure that their response at their computer.

05:22.510 --> 05:26.440
So quite literally at 1:41 a.m. that's I think a bit around 130.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.960
I posted a message.

05:28.030 --> 05:34.270
They responded pretty much within 30 minutes 34 minutes which is great considering that it's 2:00 in

05:34.270 --> 05:35.470
the morning where they're sending it.

05:35.470 --> 05:38.460
So that would be an example of that.

05:38.530 --> 05:41.040
Anything under 30 minutes is great within an hour.

05:41.080 --> 05:48.610
Still quite good if it's several hours probably a bad indication so use the response rate technique

05:48.640 --> 05:52.450
to very quickly kind of poke them see how quickly they respond.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.490
It's very helpful if you have five people that have passed your original test and you sent a response

05:57.490 --> 06:01.370
rate to a response rate test all five of them maybe three fail.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.480
And so now you're down to two.

06:03.550 --> 06:07.540
The whole idea behind this is we're trying to find the best freelancer and the best person to do your

06:07.540 --> 06:08.670
job.

06:08.710 --> 06:14.680
So that's usually a very good technique to figure out how actually committed they are to what they're

06:14.680 --> 06:17.490
bidding on and how committed they are to getting you as a client.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.870
So all right I'll see the next lecture.
