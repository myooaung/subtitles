You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about a technique that

00:15.580 --> 00:23.470
can dramatically help you eliminate miscommunications and to help you kind of make a final selection

00:23.470 --> 00:27.430
when you boil it down to a short list of who you want to work with for your project.

00:27.430 --> 00:34.090
So the short of it is that we use a technique where at the very end of the vetting process we asked

00:34.150 --> 00:41.410
the freelancer or the freelancing firm to repeat back to us what they're doing for the project now seems

00:41.410 --> 00:41.880
redundant.

00:41.890 --> 00:42.160
Right.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.320
Like you've had this discussion you have this very long good explanation.

00:46.330 --> 00:47.820
Hopefully it's good.

00:47.950 --> 00:51.350
Why would you want them to repeat that back to you.

00:51.400 --> 00:57.670
Well it's actually something that's incredibly useful it's not really that redundant at all if you do

00:57.670 --> 00:58.590
it correctly.

00:58.630 --> 01:03.160
First of all you don't ask them to repeat back to you what your project does.

01:03.160 --> 01:09.400
That is not particularly helpful and the reason why that's not particularly helpful is because you're

01:09.400 --> 01:15.730
not judging the freelancer based off of how well they understand your project as a whole or what your

01:15.730 --> 01:18.880
company does or what your company mission is.

01:18.910 --> 01:24.370
They need to understand what exactly is the segment that they're working on and what are the objectives

01:24.370 --> 01:25.440
they need to get done.

01:25.450 --> 01:26.850
And a little bit of the why.

01:26.890 --> 01:33.010
So what you want them to do is to repeat back to you a summary of what it is that they're working on.

01:33.010 --> 01:38.770
Or simply ask them what is it that they are building now that's important because they don't need to

01:38.770 --> 01:41.500
understand the entirety of the system if they're only building one section.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.660
They just need to understand the section.

01:43.660 --> 01:48.280
The point here though is that we're going to see how again how thoughtful how articulate they are when

01:48.280 --> 01:54.100
they repeat it back and a lot of times you can essentially find some mines that would have been a problem

01:54.100 --> 01:54.810
later.

01:54.820 --> 02:00.550
A lot of times you can have freelancers who are you know A-okay the entire vetting process and at the

02:00.550 --> 02:05.380
very end of the process you ask and them repeat the project back and you find out they have absolutely

02:05.410 --> 02:06.790
no idea what they're doing.

02:06.970 --> 02:13.430
Or they have some very core misunderstandings about what your project is or what your product does.

02:13.450 --> 02:18.400
Now sometimes these are pretty innocuous things that aren't a huge deal but you have the opportunity

02:18.400 --> 02:21.980
to correct and sometimes they're absolutely huge.

02:22.090 --> 02:26.710
They're building something and they have no idea what it is or they're planning to build it backwards

02:26.710 --> 02:31.060
so well you can do is you can correct them if you want to stick with this freelancer.

02:31.080 --> 02:37.990
You can also get a final indication of whether or not you both understand what is going to happen and

02:37.990 --> 02:39.870
what you both expect out of it.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.560
Now in general if you're trying to outsource to say South Asia.

02:43.600 --> 02:50.650
Lower your expectations for how good their prose is going to be as long as they understand the gist

02:50.650 --> 02:50.940
of it.

02:50.950 --> 02:52.120
That's what you should be going for.

02:52.120 --> 02:57.260
So keep in mind it's all relative to your project and where you're trying to outsource to.

02:57.280 --> 03:02.830
But in general this is very helpful when you're down in the late two or three freelancers or even one

03:02.890 --> 03:06.250
and you just want to be 100 percent sure that you're on the same page.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.450
Just ask them hey.

03:07.480 --> 03:13.660
Repeat back to me what it is that you're building what it is that this project is supposed to do now

03:13.780 --> 03:16.990
how you actually do it is honestly the last thing I'd do.

03:16.990 --> 03:23.590
Right before I hire them is I just ask them Hey I just want to make sure that we don't have any misunderstandings.

03:23.590 --> 03:29.100
Do you mind just letting me know what exactly your work what you're going to work on.

03:29.230 --> 03:32.460
Or can you give me a summary of the project.

03:32.610 --> 03:37.030
Now I might sound a little bit weird but what you can do at the very end of that is you can give them

03:37.030 --> 03:42.200
a carrot and say you know I just want to make sure that you know there's no Miss understanding's as

03:42.220 --> 03:45.630
soon as we get through this we'll be ready to start.

03:45.630 --> 03:50.140
Or something like that so they understand that it's kind of like the final hurdle and you just want

03:50.140 --> 03:53.810
to make sure that this last potential issue is out of the way.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.760
OK guys let me know in your own experiments how all of this works.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.030
You post in the group discussion if it's an issue or you have some suggestions otherwise.

04:02.050 --> 04:08.510
See in the next lecture.
