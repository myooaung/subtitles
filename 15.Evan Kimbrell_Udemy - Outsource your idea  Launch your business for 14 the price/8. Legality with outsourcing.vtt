00:09.020 --> 00:09.380
Hey guys.

00:09.380 --> 00:13.770
Welcome back to the chorus in this section we're going to talk about legality.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.380
How does legality apply to outsourcing specifically.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.840
This is not contracting in general.

00:20.900 --> 00:27.290
I'm talking specifically about how legality applies to when you take work and you get someone in another

00:27.290 --> 00:28.720
country to do it for you.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.100
So I'm sure a lot of you run into this problem before or you're wondering to yourself I'm going to select

00:34.100 --> 00:35.140
someone who is overseas.

00:35.150 --> 00:35.890
I've never met.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.910
I don't even know the city they're from.

00:37.910 --> 00:44.840
I have no instant no connection to them and I don't know if they're going to return my money back to

00:44.840 --> 00:47.600
me or they're even going to do the project once I pay them.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.280
Now if this were the case that we were working in the United States or in Europe or wherever you're

00:52.280 --> 00:58.070
taking this course you probably know exactly how you would go about dealing with someone that takes

00:58.070 --> 01:01.430
money and doesn't return what you agreed on.

01:01.430 --> 01:05.680
Now the problem here is that we now have to deal with someone who is in a separate country.

01:05.690 --> 01:11.840
Well for the practical matter of what happens if I pay someone and they don't actually give me the work

01:11.840 --> 01:12.480
that I want.

01:12.590 --> 01:16.240
Well really the only way that you address this is through prevention.

01:16.310 --> 01:23.180
There is practically no way that you can get money back from someone who works in India who didn't deliver

01:23.180 --> 01:28.850
on their promises or might have broken something in your contract it's actually it's practically impossible

01:28.850 --> 01:33.890
unless you go to India or have someone who lives there who can help you through the process and even

01:33.890 --> 01:36.650
then it could be a six month journey typically not worth it.

01:36.650 --> 01:39.260
The way we work with this is we work on prevention.

01:39.260 --> 01:45.240
So if you've contacted a firm directly through if you watch running in elections or the lectures where

01:45.240 --> 01:51.770
we went through like The Firm West or we use google to find high quality freelancing firms if that's

01:51.770 --> 01:56.750
the case and you work directly through them you probably did some contract work for the most part that

01:56.750 --> 02:01.550
contract work is all just an exercise in making you feel better about the project.

02:01.610 --> 02:03.490
That's really all it comes down to.

02:03.500 --> 02:10.370
That contract might make you feel better but it's simply not going to help you actually get money back

02:10.550 --> 02:14.210
or to remedy any of the broken terms in your contract.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.290
It's really just an exercise in futility.

02:16.310 --> 02:21.560
The way that I strongly suggest you work through this problem is two things.

02:21.560 --> 02:29.540
One you use a platform like the ones we've covered to at least at the bare minimum handle the payments

02:29.630 --> 02:32.000
associated with your project.

02:32.030 --> 02:35.140
Now the way that they work is you pay them.

02:35.210 --> 02:39.370
And then once the project's done you agree to it they release it.

02:39.410 --> 02:46.150
Now if you pay them and your freelancer does not return what you expected is something something's wrong.

02:46.250 --> 02:52.760
Something you'd be in a normally into a dispute with that company will then act as the arbiter between

02:52.760 --> 02:57.920
the two of you and decide what where the money should go whether or not it's been finished what needs

02:57.920 --> 03:00.190
to happen before the money should be released.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.240
That is incredibly helpful.

03:02.360 --> 03:07.360
And thankfully it's the case that a lot of freelancers a lot of freelance firms are used to this concept

03:07.360 --> 03:13.730
it's an escrow but they're also used to having these companies oversee millions of projects.

03:13.730 --> 03:18.110
Hold onto the money and then make the final determination about releasing it.

03:18.110 --> 03:22.640
The downside to that obviously is that these companies are going to take a portion of the payment as

03:22.640 --> 03:23.390
the employer.

03:23.420 --> 03:30.590
It's not as big of a deal because the companies like Elance or freelancer or up work people per hour

03:31.250 --> 03:34.220
they take the money out of the freelancers pocket.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.430
So they essentially deducted from the freelancer.

03:36.440 --> 03:41.630
Now your freelancer might bring that up and they might if you have a long term relationship ask to be

03:41.630 --> 03:42.800
compensated on that.

03:42.950 --> 03:48.230
But in my experience that 7 percent or 10 percent or whatever it ends up being sometimes it's lower

03:48.580 --> 03:50.080
is almost always worth it.

03:50.090 --> 03:55.550
It's always worth knowing that your money is at least protected in the case that something goes wrong.

03:55.550 --> 04:00.050
Now if you've had a long term relationship with a company you've worked on them several projects then

04:00.050 --> 04:05.570
it might be the case that you do not need this at all and you're perfectly fine saving those cost savings

04:05.570 --> 04:07.730
between you and your contractor.

04:07.730 --> 04:13.370
Now the other way to remedy this problem is by using a very rudimentary technique and it's called using

04:13.370 --> 04:16.090
milestones milestones you've heard of this.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.290
It's a little confusing if you never heard of it.

04:18.290 --> 04:22.220
Essentially what you're doing is you take your project and you divide it up into segments.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.660
Very similar to what we did when we wrote out our project description.

04:25.850 --> 04:31.630
But this is for the actual process of building your project you take it up and you say here's one section.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.660
Here's the second section.

04:32.660 --> 04:39.560
Third fourth that whatever it is and then you say you know if our total project is say $2000 and we

04:39.560 --> 04:45.680
have five segments in our project then we'll just divide it and every time you finish this segment you'll

04:45.680 --> 04:47.330
get paid $400.

04:47.330 --> 04:53.000
So what ends up happening is the freelancers will work on one portion and then once you see that it

04:53.000 --> 04:57.580
works see that it's good see that it matches the requirements see that they delivered it on time.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.870
There's no issues you release that milestone.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.560
Then you go to the next section then you go to the next section and you do that until the project is

05:03.560 --> 05:04.010
finished.

05:04.010 --> 05:10.950
Now the downside to this obviously is that the freelancer they might get a little skittish about this

05:10.950 --> 05:16.770
because they're afraid that you might say only give them a portion of the money or not be happy right

05:16.770 --> 05:18.390
after the first section of work.

05:18.390 --> 05:24.750
But unfortunately this is kind of the standard even if you use Elance or up work in any of those escrow

05:24.750 --> 05:27.940
services they're going to make you put everything into milestones anyway.

05:28.050 --> 05:29.480
So that's typically what they're used to.

05:29.490 --> 05:30.990
Now there's hope.

05:31.120 --> 05:37.410
It really runs the gamut in terms of like all the different types of milestones set up so you can get

05:37.470 --> 05:40.440
a lot of people do 50 percent upfront 50 percent at the end.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.780
That is better than paying 100 percent upfront.

05:44.100 --> 05:50.160
But it's not nearly as good as say segmenting it out say you pay 20 percent upfront and then you pay

05:50.160 --> 05:54.240
out the other 80 percent over the course of four different milestones.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.980
In general it's going to yes it's a negative for the freelancer.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.730
But it also creates a little bit.

06:00.810 --> 06:06.470
It slows your project down ever so slightly because now all of a sudden you have four different milestones

06:06.470 --> 06:10.170
that means you have four different checkpoints where they have to present their work to you or wait

06:10.170 --> 06:14.970
for you to prove it and then you have to go through it and make sure that everything is to the T.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.550
A lot of times you say this milestone is not done.

06:17.550 --> 06:20.010
I need to go back and fix this and this and this.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.420
Whereas if you did this in one big milestone you would have told them to fix everything at the very

06:24.420 --> 06:27.180
end so you lose a little bit of efficiency.

06:27.200 --> 06:32.920
But at the same time you really do save yourself from getting burned on putting up too much money up

06:32.920 --> 06:33.210
front.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.120
So that's the best way.

06:35.130 --> 06:42.480
It all practicality of preventing yourself from getting burned legally in a freelancer relationship

06:42.840 --> 06:44.430
use an escrow service.

06:44.430 --> 06:48.550
They're very easy to use even if you made the arrangement outside of the escrow service.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.130
Ask them to then go onto the service and bid on a private project.

06:53.130 --> 06:57.610
You can use that then you can use say Lantz's service to maintain the work.

06:57.850 --> 07:03.750
And Adam absolute minimum use a milestone system with them have that in writing so they know exactly

07:03.750 --> 07:09.180
what they need to reach to get paid and just use that as kind of a way of preventing yourself from getting

07:09.180 --> 07:13.860
burned once you then get used to that person you can pick really whatever you want to whatever arrangement

07:13.860 --> 07:14.570
you think works.

07:14.580 --> 07:21.990
Now legally what happens if something really does end up blowing up what happens if they take your idea

07:21.990 --> 07:23.180
and they steal it.

07:23.440 --> 07:29.820
Well unfortunately there's not much you can do because the legality around outsourcing is virtually

07:29.820 --> 07:31.540
nonexistent.

07:31.590 --> 07:36.210
Luckily if you use either Lance or you use up work or any of those Web sites they have their own terms

07:36.210 --> 07:37.140
and agreements.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.780
They have a long list the agreements that protect you in some ways.

07:41.830 --> 07:47.700
So you can opt to have intellectual property protection and include that in the legal contract you make

07:47.700 --> 07:48.890
with your freelancer.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.120
However what happens if that person does actually steal your idea.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.460
Well really nothing.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.480
I mean there's virtually nothing they can do.

07:55.500 --> 08:01.200
The only thing you can rely on is that you can rely on the fact that you used the techniques in this

08:01.200 --> 08:07.590
course to pick a good freelancer a responsible trustworthy freelancer that most importantly has a track

08:07.590 --> 08:08.410
record.

08:08.460 --> 08:15.420
That's the biggest thing you can use to prevent a legality issue like say IP theft is that you look

08:15.420 --> 08:17.800
for someone who has a reputation to protect.

08:17.940 --> 08:25.800
If they have 50 projects on their L.A. profile and this is a big source of income for them they're not

08:25.800 --> 08:31.440
going to want to jeopardize that over some small issue depending on how large a project is it's just

08:31.440 --> 08:32.660
never worth it.

08:32.760 --> 08:40.110
The shallow or their work history is the less inclined they're going to be to use to understand what

08:40.110 --> 08:42.300
they have to lose in this type of situation.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.550
But if they have a track record they're going to be a lot more committed to doing everything right.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.250
It is a lot less to worry about.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.960
But in general make sure that you're aware of this.

08:50.970 --> 08:58.170
It is kind of the Wild Wild West because it is virtually impossible and a lot of these countries to

08:58.200 --> 09:02.370
sue them or to have some legal action against the person you hired.

09:02.370 --> 09:03.060
Why is that.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.910
I mean it's solely because we have court systems in every single country.

09:07.050 --> 09:12.570
They work within that country and they don't have any way of interacting between the two with Sprint

09:12.600 --> 09:18.240
Qik have had disputes with Canadian companies and we're in San Francisco and even those two countries

09:18.240 --> 09:21.750
that are very very similar and cooperate on so many different things.

09:21.750 --> 09:25.790
We have no regle we have no legal remedy against them.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.250
But in retrospect we could have saved ourselves by just using simple prevention techniques.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.420
So be aware legality.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.310
There's nothing you can really do.

09:35.310 --> 09:38.150
You can't sue someone outside the country.

09:38.250 --> 09:42.830
And if you can and a lot of situations you can it's very rarely worth it.

09:42.900 --> 09:48.930
Only if you're doing a multimillion dollar project would it ever make sense to establish a presence

09:48.930 --> 09:51.480
in another country and then pursue them legally.

09:51.510 --> 09:57.180
The way that you protect yourself legally you use very practical common sense prevention methods use

09:57.180 --> 10:03.300
milestones use escrow services make sure everything you're doing is written out in writing not because

10:03.300 --> 10:08.060
it makes it legal but because you can now know exactly what is expected.

10:08.750 --> 10:13.380
And what you should be receiving and there's no miscommunication between the two of you do you guys

10:13.380 --> 10:17.940
have any questions at all or any stories about this post in the group discussion.

10:17.940 --> 10:21.510
More than willing to go into depth with this kind of in general.

10:21.720 --> 10:26.190
There are some exceptions there are a couple countries where I've heard of people be able to do small

10:26.190 --> 10:31.830
claims court decisions against other companies but in general it's just not something you should plan

10:31.830 --> 10:38.610
on relying on if you have legal concerns then honestly you should use prevention techniques to protect

10:38.610 --> 10:43.350
yourself and if honestly passed that point you don't feel safe enough then it's probably the case that

10:43.350 --> 10:44.820
you shouldn't be outsourcing.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.230
OK guys I'll see in the next lecture.
