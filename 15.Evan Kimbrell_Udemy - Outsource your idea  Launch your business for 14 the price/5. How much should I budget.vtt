WEBVTT

00:06.090 --> 00:13.550
Let's talk about what is a reasonable budget for when you're trying to launch year in the year first

00:13.550 --> 00:20.530
diversion through contracting first thing I want to say is it is not very expensive.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.830
And if it were the case that webapps especially mobile apps were extremely expensive then I would not

00:26.830 --> 00:28.920
be making this course.

00:28.950 --> 00:35.100
I think that a lot of people are under the impression that apps if done well are extremely expensive.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.580
That is just not the case.

00:36.810 --> 00:44.140
You can take that from me and running a web studio for over almost three years now and it made me 120

00:44.140 --> 00:48.690
hundred thirty applications it's just not nearly as expensive as you think.

00:49.730 --> 00:55.160
In my experience as an entrepreneur I've run the gamut in terms of how much money I've spent on contracting

00:55.720 --> 00:59.880
I've gotten deployable apps out in into market for as little as $200.

01:00.320 --> 01:08.680
I've built apps that seem like large applications that you know I spent $1000 $2000 on to give you an

01:08.680 --> 01:13.000
example of the most recent personal software project that I did.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.310
I actually had built software that tracks taxis and manages the check in process and use for taxis that

01:21.490 --> 01:23.400
was essentially an Administration panel.

01:23.440 --> 01:31.440
And what it did was it would allow it allowed all the drivers to check in online with a visual schedule.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.200
They can click and choose and drop and swap out shifts.

01:35.260 --> 01:36.930
It's integrated Twilio.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.800
You know if you guys are not familiar with Twilley Antonios a system that allows you to send text messages

01:41.800 --> 01:43.840
from your web application.

01:43.840 --> 01:49.240
It use Twilio to check ins every time the taxi driver did to their car they would check in answer a

01:49.240 --> 01:52.720
bunch of questions the application would store it and present that information.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.580
It could calculate late fees based on when they checked in they could do things like expense tracking

01:57.850 --> 02:01.800
kept track of how much was spent on gas and how much was spent on carwashes.

02:01.810 --> 02:04.990
And it used an automatic keyword system.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.170
So as opposed to having taxis call in to the dispatcher may have problems they could just text into

02:11.170 --> 02:16.840
the application and based on the keywords the system could respond with instructions or pass that information

02:16.840 --> 02:20.700
on to another person who could actually respond to it.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.230
Now that would sound like a big application.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.400
Nope it actually wasn't.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.450
I spent about $1300 on that entire thing.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.530
That took about 10 days to build and I use a native English speaker.

02:32.590 --> 02:37.540
I didn't have to take this Dandiya I didn't have to send this to South America or to Eastern Europe

02:37.540 --> 02:41.020
or use someone in England and it was barely over a thousand dollars.

02:41.020 --> 02:45.890
I mean I could have launched a more basic version of it for eight hundred seven hundred dollars.

02:45.910 --> 02:48.950
So there's a lot of functionality involved in that example.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.110
And it really is not something that has to break the bank.

02:52.930 --> 02:58.090
Now if you're going out and getting quotes what you're trying to build and looks like you're about to

02:58.090 --> 03:00.180
spend what you'd spend on a luxury car.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.430
You are doing something wrong.

03:02.860 --> 03:06.980
It's not the case that you have to spend that much money to build your application.

03:06.970 --> 03:12.430
It very rarely is if it is the case you're probably doing one of two things.

03:12.430 --> 03:18.430
One you're asking a studio and a studio has overhead and they charge a premium and they have their own

03:18.430 --> 03:20.340
marketing budgets and everything like that.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.160
You're using a studio that's charging you a lot of money.

03:23.170 --> 03:27.430
It's also probably the case that they're located here in the United States and so you're not actually

03:27.430 --> 03:30.830
taking advantage of the cost efficiencies of contracting when you do this.

03:30.970 --> 03:34.110
They're charging you probably roughly what you'd pay an in-house developer.

03:34.180 --> 03:41.810
That's bad you're also probably layering on way too many features at first when you launch your product

03:42.020 --> 03:48.050
you want to launch with the core of what you think can deliver the effectively what the value of your

03:48.050 --> 03:50.120
application to the consumer is.

03:51.110 --> 03:56.270
You basically need to identify what the number one number two things that this apps are going to do

03:56.280 --> 04:01.460
and build those first you do not need to launch with 20 25 features.

04:01.460 --> 04:05.600
Actually I think in a lot of cases thats a very bad thing to do because you don't realize what your

04:05.600 --> 04:09.330
customers want or your users want until you push it out there.

04:09.330 --> 04:13.640
And so once you push it out there you will see what they want theyll demand other things and it might

04:13.640 --> 04:19.100
be the case that they end up rejecting a lot of the features you've built if you're spending $20000

04:19.100 --> 04:23.800
$40000 you're probably launching with something that's just too large.

04:25.060 --> 04:30.280
If you guys follow any of like Eric recently in startup one of the things they talk about a lot is just

04:30.280 --> 04:33.940
minimizing how much money you have to spend upfront before you figure out with new whether or not something

04:33.940 --> 04:34.860
works.

04:34.900 --> 04:41.230
Follow that model or build an MVP minimally viable product try to launch the smallest thing you possibly

04:41.230 --> 04:41.620
can.

04:41.620 --> 04:47.020
If it's costing you tons and tons of money to get it out the door you probably have too many features.

04:47.020 --> 04:52.630
If you can afford to launch it for tons and tons of money then power to you but just be aware you're

04:52.630 --> 04:56.580
taking a risk and this might be the most effective way of spending your money.

04:57.930 --> 05:03.990
I think the most effective way of giving you an idea of how much things typically cost is just to give

05:03.990 --> 05:10.740
you some examples and through examples you can get an idea of what raises the cost what lowers the cost

05:10.740 --> 05:16.480
and what is a dollar value to associate with a small app and a medium sized app and a large.

05:16.570 --> 05:17.890
Let's start with the example.

05:17.890 --> 05:24.590
Number one let's say you want to build a Chrome extension app because you're not familiar.

05:24.590 --> 05:29.300
You open up Google Chrome the Web browser the top right there is the Options button.

05:29.350 --> 05:35.150
And next in that you can go to the Chrome store and you can install plug ins that affect your browser.

05:36.020 --> 05:44.080
Say you wanted that app to make actions on your web browser based on the behavior of the web browser.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.580
Let's get a little bit more specific.

05:45.650 --> 05:50.660
Let's say you wanted to build an app that reminds you to get back to work every time you go to a certain

05:50.960 --> 05:54.850
like say 20 25 websites from building that app.

05:54.860 --> 05:57.980
Getting it in the App Store Xining little icon for it.

05:58.250 --> 06:02.270
I think a realistic price for that would be about $400.

06:02.460 --> 06:06.560
You could get it done for a thousand you could probably get it done for two hundred but I think you

06:06.560 --> 06:09.750
might be cutting too many corners if you're going that low.

06:09.770 --> 06:17.150
Now if you wanted to add in the ability to have settings on the system and add Web sites on the fly

06:17.360 --> 06:22.180
you might need to add in an extra $200 that's a decent example.

06:22.220 --> 06:27.560
That is a broad generalization as different every single time you ask a contractor because different

06:27.560 --> 06:33.330
contractors have different rates different contractors work at certain speeds versus other people.

06:33.380 --> 06:36.610
It's also depends if you use a fixed rate versus a price per hour.

06:36.620 --> 06:41.710
That's something we're going to talk about later in the course so let's use an example number two.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.360
This one is going to be a web app.

06:43.410 --> 06:50.580
This web app allow you to log in through Facebook display on a wall all of your friends and their upcoming

06:50.590 --> 06:56.820
birthdays then allow you to select a friend add notes to them about what you want to buy them for their

06:56.820 --> 07:06.180
birthday and then have a system that can send you e-mail reminders and could possibly even in the e-mail

07:06.190 --> 07:11.340
reminders populate some of the key words you used in your notes to give you Amazon suggestions.

07:12.190 --> 07:19.210
That one hi would assume you could get built for anywhere from a thousand to $2000.

07:19.210 --> 07:23.950
Again you can go above and below that then you're either paying way too much or you're cutting too many

07:23.950 --> 07:25.060
corners.

07:25.060 --> 07:30.610
The reason why this one's a little bit more complicated is because you now have to use Facebook logon

07:30.910 --> 07:32.600
which means you have to integrate Facebook.

07:32.890 --> 07:38.390
You need to handle user IDs and user accounts which means to log in log out.

07:38.470 --> 07:44.050
Probably gonna have to add account settings and also has to do some pretty heavy manipulation from the

07:44.050 --> 07:48.200
Facebook data and also e-mail notifications email notifications.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.310
That's another day of work for a freelancer.

07:50.320 --> 07:55.810
But it is a day of work e-mail notifications are generally simpler than say text message notifications

07:55.810 --> 07:57.730
or push notifications on an app.

07:57.730 --> 08:01.570
But it is something that they have to spend a day building and integrating Amazon.

08:01.570 --> 08:02.920
Maybe that's another half day.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.110
So I'd say about a thousand or $2000.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.430
Now if you want to make this more polished You could definitely add some more features and I would probably

08:10.430 --> 08:12.810
add a couple of more thousand dollars depending on what it was.

08:12.830 --> 08:18.890
If you wanted to make this responsive responsive meaning that the web site would respond to whatever

08:18.890 --> 08:24.350
screen resolution is opening it would automatically add just the Web site's dimensions to fit my iPad

08:24.770 --> 08:26.140
or my iPhone.

08:26.210 --> 08:30.290
Yeah you could probably add another $1500 to it because what you have to do is go back and design an

08:30.290 --> 08:34.850
entirely new layout and that's going to depend a lot on the graphic design that you use.

08:35.060 --> 08:40.940
That project right there the core of it one to $2000 you earlier wanted to polish it out make it responsive

08:40.940 --> 08:43.310
and sharpen iPads and iPhones flawlessly.

08:43.310 --> 08:47.730
You could spend easily three $4000.

08:47.750 --> 08:54.930
There are certain things out there that will raise the price of your project significantly.

08:55.160 --> 09:02.270
And this is where we get to the point where your project costs more than say $5000 is your project multi-platform

09:02.480 --> 09:07.130
multi-platform meaning if you're building a mobile app doesn't need to be on iPhone Android Windows

09:07.130 --> 09:08.960
phone and BlackBerry.

09:08.960 --> 09:16.790
A good rule of thumb is that take the cost for building it on one application and then add 60 to 70

09:16.790 --> 09:18.750
percent to build it on a second one.

09:18.770 --> 09:22.840
And so if you're doing that four times you would need to make that calculation four different times.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.160
Obviously depends on a lot of different variables.

09:25.160 --> 09:31.130
I'm just speaking in general terms if I were to take an application and build it on an iPhone you would

09:31.130 --> 09:36.650
have to design the front of the application for the iPhone and a server application that could handle

09:36.650 --> 09:42.440
the data well the server application can be used in Android can be used in Windows Phone.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.540
And that's what allows you to have some savings.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.300
You're not doing the project effectively four times.

09:47.480 --> 09:51.440
And if it's a case that you want to launch multi-platform like that that's where I think you need to

09:51.440 --> 09:56.600
set down and have a hard think about whether or not it's smart to launch a basic project on multiple

09:56.600 --> 09:59.360
platforms at once when it's just you.

09:59.360 --> 10:05.600
It's generally a better idea to launch with one and less the entire value proposition of your application

10:05.660 --> 10:09.200
is that it is multi-platform in which case you're just going to have to know are going to be spending

10:09.200 --> 10:10.610
more money.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.860
Another thing I look for.

10:11.960 --> 10:17.240
Are you building something that's never been done before really all that means is that this is something

10:17.240 --> 10:23.870
that the freelancer or the contractor or the studio they're going to have to do a lot of time researching

10:24.260 --> 10:26.120
and if it's a really hard thing to do.

10:26.120 --> 10:31.550
They could spend five hours researching it for every one hour they actually spent implementing it.

10:31.610 --> 10:35.300
And so that's going to drive up the cost and that's something that you need to know that if you're building

10:35.300 --> 10:40.370
something you've never seen before or since it's not very common it's going to get significantly more

10:40.370 --> 10:41.180
expensive.

10:42.590 --> 10:46.550
This was just a little taste of what I'm talking about when I say something.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.770
Contracting is cheap.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.360
Getting your first version out is cheap.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.670
I think everyone's experience is going to be different.

10:52.700 --> 10:57.410
It just depends what you're comfortable launching with and if you are again launching with something

10:57.410 --> 11:00.860
that cost over ten thousand dollars or $8000.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.290
Please do take some time to reassess whether or not these features are absolutely necessary.

11:05.300 --> 11:09.580
I don't want you to go and spend a ton of money upfront and get burned realizing half what you build

11:09.620 --> 11:14.320
isn't necessary isn't useful and isn't being accepted by your users.

11:14.420 --> 11:18.650
You guys have any questions post some of the group discussion or private message me if you guys are

11:18.650 --> 11:22.820
looking for estimates for cost on your applications.

11:22.820 --> 11:25.300
I would say please hold off on that.

11:25.310 --> 11:29.570
The reason why I'm saying this is because later in the course we're going to talk about how you will

11:29.570 --> 11:35.210
find a contractor and how you can effectively gauge what the price is when you go out and actually do

11:35.210 --> 11:36.080
this for real.

11:36.080 --> 11:41.330
It's going to get you the most accurate price and it's kind of you're wasting time by asking for quotes

11:41.540 --> 11:42.670
from someone else.

11:42.770 --> 11:48.620
Even if you are going around shopping around to studios based on your idea just know that right now

11:48.620 --> 11:52.520
until you actually get out there and you follow the rest of the steps in the course you're not going

11:52.520 --> 11:57.620
to get a very accurate representation with the prices so have a little patience and just hold off just

11:57.620 --> 12:00.350
for a second but have any other questions regarding this lecture.

12:00.350 --> 12:08.030
Just let me know and we can talk about it.
