Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture it's going to be a quick one.

00:14.550 --> 00:20.070
We're just going to go over a real quick strategy that has really helped us accelerate the vetting process

00:20.070 --> 00:26.490
for finding who is a good project who has a good project proposal and who's a good freelancer and to

00:26.490 --> 00:29.000
save you a lot of time in this process.

00:29.190 --> 00:35.640
OK so the short of it is get the freelancer or the firm get them off the platform.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.620
So what I mean by getting them off the platform is that at the very beginning of the process you have

00:40.620 --> 00:48.030
a lot of project proposals and it's very very helpful if you get them to leave the messaging system

00:48.030 --> 00:53.100
or the embedded system that each platform uses to facilitate conversation.

00:53.100 --> 00:58.350
Now in general if you use Elance or freelancer up work they are very bulky systems are communicating

00:58.350 --> 01:03.120
you send a message sends it to them they accept it and then they respond.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.510
And there's usually a lag in between the times.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.860
It's almost like writing an email back and forth and it's completely anonymized and you can't contact

01:10.860 --> 01:12.770
them directly off the platform.

01:12.780 --> 01:15.150
Now that messaging system is fine right.

01:15.150 --> 01:20.340
You can get a lot of information out of people but you will notice is that over time the more messages

01:20.340 --> 01:26.130
you send you'll get a lower and lower response rate simply because they're bidding on other projects

01:26.130 --> 01:28.660
that probably got something else that's come through.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.260
They're focusing their attention over there.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.420
They might disappear entirely if you ask too many questions.

01:33.420 --> 01:38.550
So what I like to do is I like to get them off the platform for at least the messaging part of this

01:38.550 --> 01:41.940
whole process so I usually like to ask them if they have skype.

01:41.990 --> 01:46.320
Ask them if they have whatsapp ask them if they can talk on the phone whatever it is.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.220
Ninety nine percent of time it's Skype if you get them on Skype and then you talk to them you can vet

01:51.280 --> 01:53.850
them so much more quickly.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.580
You don't have to wait for them to respond.

01:56.610 --> 02:01.960
You don't have to wait for them to get an e-mail notification to log on to e lands to the message you.

02:01.970 --> 02:07.620
You can talk to them instantly and all of a sudden you can see how they are you can see how responsive

02:07.620 --> 02:08.190
they are.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.540
You can see how thoughtful they are.

02:09.540 --> 02:15.120
You can see how smart they are you can figure out very quickly how well they understand the project

02:15.570 --> 02:20.930
and how well of a fit they're going to be and you can do that honestly in ten minutes with them on Skype

02:20.940 --> 02:22.340
you don't necessarily need to call them.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.250
You can do skype chat.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.310
That's perfectly fine.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.090
There's a lot of benefits to doing that.

02:26.370 --> 02:30.750
And honestly you can ask them Hey do you have skype Let's talk on Skype and if they don't have skype

02:30.750 --> 02:32.370
you can use that as a red flag.

02:32.370 --> 02:37.860
It's very strange that a freelancer who supposedly is good at what they do is been doing this for a

02:37.860 --> 02:43.830
period of time is not willing or does not have the ability to talk to you on Skype.

02:43.830 --> 02:50.140
So if you want to save time and get them off the platform those communication tools are very clunky.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.690
The worst part about those outsourcing platforms.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.560
So if you just navigate around that you can get people on Skype you can have.

02:59.730 --> 03:03.690
I mean you can interact 20 times faster through Skype.

03:03.690 --> 03:08.670
Figure out if they're worth it in 10 minutes as opposed to taking several days to figure out whether

03:08.670 --> 03:09.580
or not they're worth it.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.370
And having an abandonment rate that's way too high to be acceptable.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.150
OK that was a quick strategy.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.890
That's something that's really really helped me.

03:17.910 --> 03:23.490
It really helps me kind of establish long term relationships with them really helps kind of improve

03:23.490 --> 03:25.980
the response rate on both sides.

03:25.980 --> 03:30.870
It's really nice that you can directly contact someone if you need anything or have a question you can

03:30.870 --> 03:34.320
just message them and it doesn't have to be monitored by the other platforms.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.410
I always suggest using the other platforms for their escrow service and there milestone services so

03:40.800 --> 03:46.860
all of them have this system where you can pay money to them and as an intermediary they'll judge when

03:46.860 --> 03:50.130
the project's done and release it at the correct time.

03:50.130 --> 03:55.950
Now don't try to do the transaction off of their system entirely until you have a rapport with the freelancer

03:56.190 --> 04:02.300
or you at least have your own established process and a lot of expertise with contracting.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.610
So really simple if you want to figure out who's the best.

04:05.610 --> 04:11.530
Very quickly get them off the platform get them onto Skype and figure it out so much faster.

04:11.540 --> 04:19.140
Or see the next lecture.
