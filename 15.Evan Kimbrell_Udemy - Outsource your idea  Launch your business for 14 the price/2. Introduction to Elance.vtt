WEBVTT

00:05.970 --> 00:12.460
All right let's spend a little bit of time checking out e Lance Lance was the web site I mentioned previously.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.350
It's by far my favorite Web site for finding freelancers.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.680
The quality of freelancers are much higher.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.600
They're a little bit different than the other two.

00:21.600 --> 00:29.290
I'm going to show you the way that they work behind the scenes as they make their money off number one

00:29.320 --> 00:31.170
featured postings.

00:31.170 --> 00:37.920
And number two they charge a percentage to the freelancer of about eight point seventy five percent.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.780
Now you might think that's a lot of money and it kind of is especially if you're paying and a large

00:42.780 --> 00:47.910
project or you're having an ongoing relationship with a freelancer but compared to the other ones it's

00:47.910 --> 00:55.470
actually a much lower freelancer for instance charges 15 percent Lance has about 2 million freelancers.

00:55.470 --> 00:56.210
Sounds like a lot.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.050
It's actually less than the other two.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.900
But in my experience they're much higher quality.

01:02.010 --> 01:02.860
They are.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.290
It's actually a big company.

01:04.290 --> 01:08.050
Surprisingly they make about 800 million dollars a year.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.890
There's also we're a venture capital darling.

01:10.890 --> 01:14.980
They have taken something like 78 million dollars in funding.

01:15.300 --> 01:23.070
So we'll just log on and show you generally kind of what it looks like what buttons and what areas you're

01:23.070 --> 01:26.790
going to navigate around when you go to post.

01:27.490 --> 01:28.960
Post your first job.

01:29.140 --> 01:35.080
So if you've played around with any of these three websites before you Lance is by far the cleanest

01:35.080 --> 01:40.630
in terms of the user interface they separate everything out into my Elance is where they have all of

01:40.630 --> 01:44.600
your your tasks and jobs that you've posted.

01:44.710 --> 01:49.630
Hiring This is where you'd go if you wanted to post a job where you actually wanted to do the opposite

01:50.020 --> 01:55.000
which is you find an individual freelancer first as opposed to posting a job and letting the freelancer

01:55.000 --> 01:56.750
freind find you.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.880
They have some other features on here that I'm not going to really cover but they do have quite a robust

02:03.880 --> 02:09.280
product and has a lot of different things on here that a lot of you might have find to be pretty useful

02:09.280 --> 02:12.740
that I don't particularly use when I use the lance.

02:12.790 --> 02:18.270
So the way that you post the job is you would just simply go to post to job.

02:18.320 --> 02:25.460
This is the simplest by far and it looks very simple similar to every other job posting site you've

02:25.460 --> 02:26.910
seen it says job.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.720
But really they mean project.

02:29.720 --> 02:36.050
You can make it like a job because later you're going to be able to select per hour or per project and

02:36.230 --> 02:41.660
later in the course we're going to talk in depth about whether or not you want to use per project or

02:41.660 --> 02:42.500
per hour.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.840
Really depends on the project that you're doing and it depends on you specifically how much experience

02:47.840 --> 02:49.220
you have.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.690
We're also going to cover how you should work on titles and descriptions when to do that in a later

02:53.690 --> 02:55.820
time and really get into depth of that.

02:56.030 --> 03:00.050
But we're just trying to get familiar with how their web site looks.

03:00.050 --> 03:04.000
So you put the title of your job description goes here.

03:04.010 --> 03:10.760
There is a 4000 character limit the way that you get around that is you would write as much as you can

03:10.760 --> 03:19.280
in the described section and then you would attach an attachment a Word document with the actual multi-page

03:19.520 --> 03:21.930
definition of what you're trying to build.

03:22.040 --> 03:27.440
That's they do they do that because they don't want people to go and look at a posting and just see

03:27.680 --> 03:31.870
an enormous amount of text they can describe it as your overview.

03:31.910 --> 03:37.580
You give the overview the key details kind of give some information around who you want specifically

03:37.580 --> 03:40.230
what type of person you're looking for and who should NOT bed.

03:40.790 --> 03:45.470
And then put the actual details in the attachment so they can pre-qualify themselves.

03:45.470 --> 03:50.030
They can read that verse description and then they can move on to the attachment if they're interested.

03:50.030 --> 03:55.730
Category of work you'll notice that they're all kind of the same and all of these Web sites and bin

03:55.720 --> 03:58.650
support is typically like virtual assistance.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.870
People need to make phone calls Excel sheets things like that.

04:01.970 --> 04:08.300
You can find graphic designers on here graphic design firms were specifically talking web applications

04:08.300 --> 04:09.230
mobile applications.

04:09.230 --> 04:14.270
But if you have a physical hardware project and that is your startup you can go into engineering manufacturing

04:14.270 --> 04:19.790
too and there are some really talented people on here so early that you can find in legal and finance

04:20.240 --> 04:25.880
people who can give you for instance in legal legal advice regarding your startup regarding what you're

04:25.880 --> 04:27.070
trying to do.

04:27.470 --> 04:34.070
And also in finance You'd be surprised you can find some part time era CFOs people who are quite good

04:34.070 --> 04:35.750
at giving you financial advice.

04:35.750 --> 04:40.090
Doing your books doing your cost projections.

04:40.160 --> 04:48.530
People who can look over your pro-forma pro-forma financials performer means just in the future that's

04:48.530 --> 04:53.450
typically a Excel calculation you'll make where you're predicting how much you think your startup will

04:53.450 --> 04:53.930
make.

04:54.050 --> 04:57.780
If you go the venture capital and you're not taking this course because you want to make a lifestyle

04:57.800 --> 05:00.590
business you will have to do something like that.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.180
And it's a useful tool to do.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.850
Anyway I digress.

05:04.910 --> 05:08.320
Your typical is going to be looking under I.T. and programming.

05:08.330 --> 05:14.780
You can also use people marketing writing translation really a very broad group of people you can hire

05:14.780 --> 05:16.480
through this Web site.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.800
So you know it's like a subcategory.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.580
You technically don't even have to.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.060
There's another way of doing this.

05:22.340 --> 05:27.320
And a lot of times depending on your application there might be you know I have a very specific skill

05:27.320 --> 05:33.320
set you're looking for or you're building is very specific in general if that's the case and I usually

05:33.320 --> 05:39.560
just typically live out leave out select subcategory and I use the requests specific skills or groups

05:39.830 --> 05:51.280
and then I'll type in something very specific and you'll notice like you use an or so this will be an

05:51.280 --> 05:52.670
example.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.950
Maybe you want to build an e-commerce platform you don't just want someone who's skilled and just regular

05:56.950 --> 05:57.820
e-commerce.

05:58.010 --> 06:01.570
You don't you know you have your specific about what you want to use you don't want to use Shopify or

06:01.570 --> 06:06.090
you don't want to use a like Wick's or Magento you want to use them.

06:06.130 --> 06:09.180
Or you can do Zen Cart and I can add that as a skill.

06:09.190 --> 06:15.880
Now anybody who's listed Zen Cart will get that message and they all essentially be hit up and they'll

06:15.880 --> 06:20.500
be brought to your project and they will show it and ask them to kind of bid.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.250
So that's a great way of honing in.

06:22.450 --> 06:27.180
Typically then what I would end up doing is I would select skills that are complimentary to that that

06:27.180 --> 06:28.630
you would kind of assume.

06:28.630 --> 06:38.080
So like ph P and then I pick say ph Peak's that's the language that Zen card has made in cake THP is

06:38.080 --> 06:39.220
a framework.

06:39.320 --> 06:44.740
If that's something specifically you wanted to use I try to keep it broad because typically someone

06:44.740 --> 06:54.490
who is skilled in say ph before ph 5 ph PBB which is a forum they're also going to get messages for

06:54.490 --> 06:57.740
PH P some kind of wasting my time by saying four or five.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.180
Or cake.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.570
The only time I would say something specific like I'd select cake is if I've already built my application

07:04.570 --> 07:07.570
I'm looking for another freelancer and I use cake.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.480
So I got to make sure that they're good at that.

07:09.490 --> 07:17.890
So just say ph see if you notice on a sidebar here this is actually kind of cool you can just use your

07:17.890 --> 07:22.960
job templates if you're posting a job a repeat job or you're posting a job that's very similar to something

07:22.960 --> 07:29.180
you posted before you can actually just pull it up on the side and it will automatically drop in all

07:29.180 --> 07:29.980
of the details.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.700
You don't have to redo that over again.

07:32.740 --> 07:38.320
See also they do this the popular job template.

07:38.410 --> 07:41.950
This is actually quite helpful is it first time you're doing it so you do want to get a logo design

07:41.950 --> 07:42.550
done.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.240
You could pick logo design and it will drop in

07:50.300 --> 07:51.730
there you.

07:52.170 --> 07:55.860
So it's going to give you a separate form to fill out and it's been a point you kind of in the right

07:55.860 --> 08:00.540
direction like what type of Logo are you looking for.

08:00.750 --> 08:05.550
And you can get see they've designed this for people who are making logos and verli looks like they've

08:05.550 --> 08:09.560
already selected your skill for you or your section.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.860
The last thing is you know you'll notice there's a fixed price again hourly.

08:12.930 --> 08:16.870
What I like about you Lanson you won't notice listening in there to is when you say fix price.

08:17.070 --> 08:23.840
You can actually say your own range and you could say decide later that's really helpful.

08:23.850 --> 08:29.640
One of the biggest problems of the other two is that you have to determine your range beforehand.

08:29.850 --> 08:36.810
And so what was happening is you'd say like this and you don't always know how much the application

08:36.810 --> 08:37.760
cost.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.930
So maybe someone will make it for $300.

08:39.930 --> 08:45.070
What the system is going to do it's going to say no it's between 500 and 1000 You can't be below that.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.410
Elance does not have that problem.

08:47.460 --> 08:52.740
So you can put a suggestion and then people will bid around that.

08:52.890 --> 08:56.330
Here's the biggest thing I think you should pay attention to when you do.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.380
If you do a fixed price or hourly.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.800
I always do decide later.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.100
Always again decide later.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.190
And why do I do that.

09:08.220 --> 09:15.270
Because freelancers are very much influenced by the price set.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.200
It's an anchor point.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.510
So if I'm building an application I think it's going to cost $4000 and I say it's worth.

09:21.570 --> 09:26.390
You know I say my budget is you know one to five thousand dollars.

09:26.410 --> 09:31.550
Or let's say OK let's scratch and let's say I think my projects were $6000.

09:31.740 --> 09:38.040
So I would say five to $10000 what will happen is you will have freelancers who would build this for

09:38.050 --> 09:41.730
$4000 or three or $2000.

09:41.730 --> 09:46.950
But they see that your budget is five to ten and they're more likely going a bit higher.

09:46.950 --> 09:53.220
That has happened pretty much every single time I've done this where I've set my own price so you are

09:53.220 --> 09:58.290
going to influence their bids and a lot of them are just going to assume that you don't know the actual

09:58.290 --> 10:01.250
price or they're going to assume that they're wrong.

10:01.260 --> 10:07.110
The point is if you say decide later they're in the dark they need to come up with their own price and

10:07.110 --> 10:09.910
that's what you want them to do any way you want them to think about it.

10:09.930 --> 10:15.600
They want them to pitch their price to you based on the analysis they've done of what you've written.

10:15.600 --> 10:15.840
Right.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.410
You don't want them to be to look at other people's bids and base it off of that.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.580
That's the lazy way.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.320
That's the inaccurate way.

10:22.440 --> 10:30.900
Location privacy and other options this is you can set it as public you can allow Google to index it.

10:30.920 --> 10:36.350
That's definitely something you want to do unless you think you have some IP protection issues so if

10:36.350 --> 10:41.450
you're pitching something and you don't want to get out there maybe you don't want to check that.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.360
But you can also prefer people from a certain location.

10:45.420 --> 10:52.270
It this actually in my experience doesn't work particularly well because so like for instance it says

10:52.330 --> 10:54.230
select a region OK.

10:54.440 --> 11:04.250
Like I said North America that is really imprecise North America also mind you includes Central America

11:04.370 --> 11:05.110
Mexico.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.950
It includes the Caribbean.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.720
So maybe that's not something I want but of course I could have selected North America because I like

11:11.720 --> 11:17.760
the time zones but realistically I selected North America because I want an American or Canadian.

11:17.960 --> 11:23.180
That's why I really hate the way they do this because even if I say you know there's a lot of these

11:23.180 --> 11:26.710
kind of loopholes to it.

11:27.290 --> 11:28.230
So like Australia.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.240
OCEANA.

11:29.360 --> 11:34.400
I mean I want Australia right but that also brings up things like Papa New Guinea.

11:34.410 --> 11:41.600
I think it also might actually bring in like Indonesian bidders and people from like small islands like

11:41.600 --> 11:42.740
now roo and things like that.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.440
It's really kind of bizarre.

11:44.690 --> 11:46.440
So I very rarely use that.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.820
This is a problem with the L'anse.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.930
You can do country.

11:49.940 --> 11:55.790
But again this drives me nuts too because I want to say multiple countries and the other ones you can

11:55.790 --> 11:57.950
do that Neal and you're kind of just screwed.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.940
I mean you have to pick one country so you'd pick the United States.

12:01.940 --> 12:07.340
This is cool because you can actually go down and drill down to the city and state if the case is that

12:07.340 --> 12:11.360
you feel more comfortable working with someone in your own city or within driving distance.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.690
That's something you would do.

12:12.710 --> 12:18.020
And so you can sit with them sometimes and actually have face to face later we're going to talk about

12:18.020 --> 12:23.330
graphic designers and how that can be very advantageous to have someone who works in your city and someone

12:23.330 --> 12:27.800
who you can meet for coffee to go over designs with developers.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.950
That's not really not particularly the case.

12:30.950 --> 12:36.610
Developers are you're not going to get as much from meeting them face to face.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.100
And that's something that they're going to find quite annoying and it's going to be kind of distracting

12:40.100 --> 12:43.290
for them so I don't think are going to get much out of it.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.510
Typically when you meet with them it's kind of the idea that maybe they can showcase what they've built

12:47.510 --> 12:52.550
so far with development it's just the case that if you meet them halfway through the project they can't

12:52.550 --> 12:54.130
show you half your website.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.650
That's just not how programming works.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.660
Propose start date you can do it immediately.

12:59.700 --> 13:05.180
So it launches right after you launch it just goes through a quick review period and or you can set

13:05.510 --> 13:09.870
a date in the future later in the course as an extra.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.430
What I'm going to do is we're going to go through a live demo and I'm going to make up a web application

13:15.440 --> 13:23.210
show you how to wireframe it show you how to disk right the project description the project specifications

13:23.210 --> 13:26.250
post it and then select someone.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.560
But right now we're just getting you used to Elance.

13:28.580 --> 13:36.500
And at this point in the course you should just be familiar with it and kind of know no I want to encourage

13:36.500 --> 13:41.270
you to actually go out and play with these websites so that you get more comfortable with them.

13:41.270 --> 13:49.330
The other thing is I want to point out with Elance would be one when you search you have two options.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.060
You can search for jobs or freelancers.

13:52.190 --> 13:56.660
You can also search for portfolio samples but that's that never really seems to work out particularly

13:56.660 --> 13:57.450
well.

13:57.530 --> 14:02.110
So one benefit is this you can say freelancers.

14:02.150 --> 14:07.980
So let's say you wanted to build an application I can borrow something from a project I did before 12

14:08.030 --> 14:14.600
so let's say I wanted to look for freelancers that are skilled in Twilio because again maybe I have

14:14.600 --> 14:16.750
a very specific idea of what I want to build.

14:16.790 --> 14:22.190
I don't want to post a job I would rather go after individual freelancers and try to recruit them that

14:22.190 --> 14:23.150
way.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.130
So I can say truly a

14:27.870 --> 14:29.670
scuse my computer.

14:30.130 --> 14:36.100
OK so you can see people here that advertise themselves with Twilio to Olio.

14:36.730 --> 14:40.930
And if they're advertising themselves saying that they're good at Tullio chances are that's one of the

14:40.930 --> 14:44.350
things this subtitle page right here.

14:45.310 --> 14:52.410
It's limited by characters so you actually see that they're putting it up there that means there that's

14:52.420 --> 14:54.080
one of their big things that they do.

14:54.130 --> 14:55.810
And again you can drill down.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.810
We could say zip code.

14:58.850 --> 14:59.350
OK.

14:59.440 --> 15:05.560
Like I was saying you could look based on distance.

15:06.090 --> 15:13.660
And so when I put a 9 4 1 0 9 that is the zip code for San Francisco and now I can see people who are

15:13.660 --> 15:21.620
good at Tulio in my area to see here's a tweet Liow developer he's an expert Tullio developer.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.600
This is California so he's about forty nine dollars an hour.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.110
Sixty six seventy nine dollars an hour.

15:27.130 --> 15:29.350
So if that's what you wanted to do you could do that.

15:29.380 --> 15:33.610
L.A. is the place to do that if you want to look for an individual local freelancer.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.440
I think it's a it's a good way of doing it.

15:36.700 --> 15:41.920
But there are options available for you if you're trying to do something really specific that helps.

15:41.920 --> 15:48.970
I also suggest that when you post your job posting you go ahead and search for freelancers anyway.

15:49.210 --> 15:53.890
Look for people who have very specific skills to what you're trying to build and you can individually

15:53.890 --> 15:55.700
recruit them.

15:55.990 --> 16:00.130
And the way that you do that is you just say like hire me it's a button and what I'll do is it will

16:00.130 --> 16:06.430
prompt you to send them a message and invite them to your job posting and that will help considerably

16:06.490 --> 16:14.320
because say you post your job posting and it's a generic you know a Ph based forum Web site.

16:14.410 --> 16:19.150
It's only going to attract so many people because so many people there are only so many people who are

16:19.150 --> 16:20.480
actively browsing.

16:20.590 --> 16:26.230
But if you actually yourself go out and look for some people you want you can dramatically kind of increase

16:26.230 --> 16:31.720
the participation in your job by individually going after people and saying I went in you know I want

16:31.790 --> 16:38.900
to I would invite people to my project and and if you invite them directly.

16:39.010 --> 16:41.620
The odds of them bidding are significantly higher.

16:41.620 --> 16:45.790
Probably 60 70 percent will end up actually providing a bed.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.250
And then alternatively you can search for jobs.

16:49.260 --> 16:52.280
I like this because so let's try this again.

16:52.330 --> 16:53.400
Say Twilley.

16:53.830 --> 17:00.320
The reason why I do this is why this is helpful is because I can go and look at other people's jobs.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.510
And sometimes when I'm writing descriptions running specifications I kind of get stuck.

17:04.570 --> 17:10.120
I've written everything I can think of and I can think that could be on it but I would be curious to

17:10.120 --> 17:13.600
see what other people are saying and so you can do is you can search for other jobs.

17:13.780 --> 17:19.690
I can look at say a mobile application that might include this and I can kind of search their listing

17:19.690 --> 17:25.510
to see if there's any information around Twilley that might be useful or something they included I can

17:25.510 --> 17:26.330
think of and that's it.

17:26.350 --> 17:32.710
This is where I've gotten a lot of my kind of a lot of the things I put at the end of my specifications

17:32.730 --> 17:38.320
from because over time I've kind of just made a compounding list of the things I need to remember to

17:38.320 --> 17:39.950
mention.

17:40.060 --> 17:46.090
So here's an interesting that they listed out the Twilio SDK.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.950
I'm not sure why you would want to do that but that's something that they pull out.

17:51.250 --> 17:58.090
So maybe there's someone who does Twilley know but they are not familiar with the with putting it on

17:58.090 --> 18:01.480
an application for Android or iOS So you put it there.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.130
That could be helpful.

18:03.130 --> 18:10.450
So anyway that's a way that I've put together a really good specification sheet like master template.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.590
I've just gone through and looked at other projects that are similar to what I'm posting.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.140
I noticed that people are really good at it.

18:16.150 --> 18:24.810
And so I've just kind of borrowed some of the things that they they have done Nazi manage.

18:24.890 --> 18:27.770
This is kind of the section where you do things like payments.

18:27.830 --> 18:32.970
You can also deal with files and you know transactions in your team.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.630
I mentioned earlier Odessa as the thing called Team view.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.360
Elance has emerged with oDesk So they've actually added that.

18:39.730 --> 18:43.490
So you can go to your team and you can add people to it.

18:43.490 --> 18:50.180
Right now it's just me but I could add a new team member and what it'll do is it'll ask me of all the

18:50.180 --> 18:55.340
people in my projects who have I hired will show a list of them I can select someone add them to my

18:55.340 --> 18:56.730
team.

18:56.870 --> 19:04.610
What that allows me to do is it allows me to keep everyone kind of in one space but also I can ask them

19:04.610 --> 19:06.640
to do time tracking.

19:06.740 --> 19:13.450
That's something I've never used with Elance but it's actually a possibility if he wanted to do that.

19:13.490 --> 19:17.120
That again is something that you might want to do if you're doing per hour because you can make sure

19:17.120 --> 19:22.550
that they are working for how long that they're saying that they're working with.
