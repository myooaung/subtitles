WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:06.370
Of course.

00:06.370 --> 00:13.770
So this lecture I'm going to take the design that I introduce you before this current market access

00:13.830 --> 00:16.930
portal works.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.540
And I'm sure you could for that.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.360
The really basic technique then I can put that into a deployable usable prototype.

00:26.370 --> 00:32.450
Now this is a play which you probably have design in hand if you are interested in design.

00:32.460 --> 00:39.570
So I'm in the process of putting you know of course how Shinners designers anybody who wants to actually

00:39.570 --> 00:42.740
get even more into this and do the design themselves.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.790
But right now the best thing you can do is find someone else to design it so that this person that you

00:47.790 --> 00:52.890
have something to work with doesn't have to be perfect because you can't keep your feet you've bought

00:52.890 --> 00:56.670
whatever you see those incredibly simple.

00:56.670 --> 01:02.400
We're not going to use any code it's something that anybody can do take much time.

01:02.400 --> 01:10.070
So without further ado you have to show you have an emergency access panel the last chair and then start

01:10.080 --> 01:11.040
working with it.

01:11.040 --> 01:11.460
All right.

01:11.460 --> 01:16.800
So I'm going to show you how to take those designs that you've gotten created or they're polished or

01:16.800 --> 01:17.270
not.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.420
And move those into pet Daco and add some interactivity.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.750
Now there are going to be multiple lectures on this.

01:24.750 --> 01:29.790
I'm going to show you right now how we're going to do the front end of the web version and then later

01:29.790 --> 01:33.510
I get to show you how we do the tablet version in the mobile version that will bring it all together

01:33.510 --> 01:38.670
and I can show you what they look like in actual display on actual devices.

01:38.670 --> 01:42.870
So what I did is I just went ahead and created a project.

01:42.870 --> 01:46.070
Now remember to label it correctly not like we did last time.

01:46.140 --> 01:52.890
I just call it a prototype and AP was the marketing access portal and that was what I showed you in

01:52.890 --> 01:53.820
the previous lecture.

01:53.820 --> 01:58.560
So that's what we're going to use since that one has wireframe and design and it's easy to use.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.690
So I went ahead and created a page right here just to save a little bit of time but what I'm going to

02:03.690 --> 02:08.520
do is I'm going to create multiple pages and then I'm going to we're going to go through I mean to show

02:08.520 --> 02:12.270
you how we import the images and use interactivity.

02:12.300 --> 02:18.010
So right here is the homescreen and now one thing that's worth doing is when I get to the home screen

02:18.030 --> 02:23.490
I just know that I'm going to import an image and use it kind of in the background here.

02:23.610 --> 02:28.170
But what you need to do is you need to make sure that your canvas is large enough to accommodate the

02:28.170 --> 02:38.000
image and the way that you do that is you would go to first go to the image files that you have and

02:38.000 --> 02:43.350
if you're on a Macintosh you right click it and you get info on a PC it's a very similar process.

02:43.830 --> 02:52.980
What we do is we just go to more info right here and it gives you the dimensions 16:00 by 20 to 22.

02:52.980 --> 02:55.700
And obviously I know that it has more height than it has width.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.840
So this is going to be the height and this is going to be the width.

02:58.910 --> 03:07.080
So now that I know that 16:00 by 20 22 you can go in here now select the page and right click this and

03:07.080 --> 03:10.290
then go to width and I've already set it right here.

03:10.290 --> 03:17.070
So he made a mistake 22 and then when you hit enter or you click out it will resize to roughly what

03:17.070 --> 03:18.330
the image should be.

03:18.330 --> 03:23.130
Now that's good because if I had a canvas that was too small and important an image that was big it

03:23.130 --> 03:25.250
would overlay on top of the canvas.

03:25.260 --> 03:31.290
And then when I go to simulate it I'd actually only display the part that is pasted over the canvas

03:31.290 --> 03:34.040
and that would be a problem and it wouldn't come through correctly.

03:34.050 --> 03:39.790
You might not actually know what's wrong because every time you log into that Oko you see it correctly.

03:39.930 --> 03:42.510
So now there's multiple ways of importing your image.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.850
I don't suggest using a background image.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.220
I personally just pull it in as a layer.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.540
You can do it as a background if you wanted to do as a background right here or you just select your

03:51.540 --> 03:53.100
image and you import it.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.300
I don't do that.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.850
I just like kind of throwing it in and being able to move it.

03:56.850 --> 04:01.550
When you do it as a background it's actually plastered in there and you can't move it cut it crop it

04:01.560 --> 04:02.900
or anything like that.

04:02.990 --> 04:09.020
We don't necessarily have to do that right now but it's something I appreciate the flexibility.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.140
Now another way you can do it is you drag an image in double click it and then add the image and the

04:13.140 --> 04:17.760
last way to do it is you can simply just import it into the side panel into my images by hitting upload

04:17.760 --> 04:19.920
new image and then dragging it in.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.440
I always just do it this way I throw an image.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.970
I double click it.

04:23.970 --> 04:30.300
I've already imported it soldiers double click it again and there it is and then slide it so it fits

04:31.130 --> 04:31.850
OK.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.010
And it looks good.

04:34.050 --> 04:39.330
Now one thing that's important to do when you do this because we're building a prototype and the biggest

04:39.330 --> 04:45.690
part of the prototype is that it looks it looks seamless it looks native when we actually go ahead and

04:45.690 --> 04:51.930
put it onto someone's computer or someone's tablet someone's mobile app what you want to do is you want

04:51.930 --> 04:54.850
to go to simulate and we covered this previously with the wireframe.

04:54.870 --> 04:59.700
But just go to simulate plain and all that's going to do is just display your image in a browser.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.510
So OK so now I did that.

05:02.510 --> 05:08.130
Now I can see this is what it actually displays at when I'm displaying it in my browser.

05:08.130 --> 05:12.360
Now what's interesting here is that first of all you need to make sure just ignore the top bar.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.830
You can never really get rid of that.

05:13.830 --> 05:18.120
They put this up here because you might want to switch between scatch sketched aerial and plain that's

05:18.120 --> 05:21.990
not relevant to this because we're just displaying an image and then obviously you can add comments

05:21.990 --> 05:22.850
here.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.280
But what's interesting here is that it's actually cut off.

05:26.630 --> 05:26.870
OK.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.500
And that's not something that you want.

05:30.540 --> 05:35.310
I'm using a pretty standard resolution on my computer which means that someone else probably with the

05:35.310 --> 05:39.840
same problem you never want your Web site where you have to scroll over to see the whole thing.

05:39.900 --> 05:44.720
That's a little bit ridiculous and also this is way larger than it ever won it.

05:44.790 --> 05:50.240
Well if I were to go and make this and develop this it would the developer would actually make this

05:50.240 --> 05:56.280
size down to the resolution so they'd make it probably responsive or hard coded to make it fit most

05:56.340 --> 05:57.730
standard browsers.

05:57.780 --> 06:01.520
So we're going to want to shrink this so that it actually comes over on this edge.

06:01.560 --> 06:06.450
So what's actually going to be more important is that you go and you check out what your browser resolution

06:06.450 --> 06:07.090
is.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.390
Now there's really no quick trick to do this on your Web site you just need access to the Internet.

06:12.540 --> 06:18.630
And so what I would do is just go to this is what my browser size dot.com pretty easy to remember.

06:18.630 --> 06:23.030
I'll put that in the resources and right here it's going to tell you what your browser window with is

06:23.040 --> 06:27.330
and what's your browser window height is are more concerned with this one because previously when you

06:27.330 --> 06:29.490
saw we simulated it it had that issue.

06:29.490 --> 06:35.820
So what I'm concerned with is 13 75 now going to go back and I'm going to edit that into the canvas

06:36.420 --> 06:44.370
by going here and changing that previous 6800 to 13 75.

06:44.380 --> 06:48.840
OK so now you can't tell because it actually changed the canvas underneath this.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.530
So usually you just dip it down.

06:50.620 --> 06:56.080
And then what I try to do is I grab this corner and you're grabbing the corner because you want it to

06:56.080 --> 07:03.220
scale properly not only vertically only horizontally because that will create distortion distortion

07:03.220 --> 07:04.590
is always going to happen.

07:04.660 --> 07:07.940
Unfortunately with these prototypes This is the best you can really do.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.350
So then I'll slide it up and fit it.

07:10.420 --> 07:10.680
OK.

07:10.690 --> 07:15.580
So now what I have is this a little bit of wiggle room down here.

07:15.580 --> 07:18.880
I'm not really concerned with that because it's a prototype.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.300
No one's really going to scroll down all the way to the bottom.

07:21.550 --> 07:25.420
But if you were really concerned with it you could take a couple of stabs at it lowering the canvas

07:25.420 --> 07:30.910
height you could try to bring it down to 9900.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.920
And as you see it's getting closer and closer it's not really an exact science go like that.

07:37.050 --> 07:37.590
OK.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.050
That's close enough for me at least.

07:41.150 --> 07:41.450
OK.

07:41.450 --> 07:44.800
And then what we can do is simulate plane again.

07:44.990 --> 07:45.510
And there you go.

07:45.510 --> 07:51.650
Now it fits the browser correctly and this is roughly what it should look like in the browser.

07:51.650 --> 07:52.940
Minus that little tag.

07:52.940 --> 07:57.580
Now if you wanted to view it perfectly well you could do is just click this for your purposes.

07:57.590 --> 08:00.610
But now I can see pretty much everything.

08:00.660 --> 08:07.200
OK so now that I have this displaying correctly in the actual screen I going to go back and create some

08:07.200 --> 08:12.450
more screens by just going back to the bride comes navigation.

08:12.490 --> 08:18.360
And here's what I usually do is I usually just create all the pages at once that I that I want you know

08:18.450 --> 08:22.630
actually what's go ahead and duplicate a page that'll be much easier.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.770
So trash this one and we'll go here and we will duplicate it.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.570
So a clone element.

08:30.990 --> 08:31.550
OK.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.540
Now that's what I'm going to call the

08:36.550 --> 08:39.230
info page.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.390
OK so homescreen that we created.

08:41.390 --> 08:44.330
Now let's go to the home info page.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.440
Double click it.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.050
So he got all this images and stuff in here it's perfect because it's already precise for our browser.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.760
Now we just want to import the next image.

08:53.810 --> 08:54.910
We'll just throw in an image

08:59.580 --> 08:59.770
OK.

08:59.770 --> 09:09.580
So then the import project info there takes us do what we did before.

09:13.320 --> 09:13.800
OK.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.640
And then we want to zoom it to fit

09:28.930 --> 09:29.200
OK.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.840
And now this one has a much longer length.

09:31.900 --> 09:36.070
So we're going to have to do is increase the height of the image.

09:36.310 --> 09:37.660
So I want to find

09:45.390 --> 09:49.690
so it's 43 50 so ago appear change the height.

09:49.770 --> 09:51.060
It's a long page.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.440
Changed it to 43 50.

09:53.790 --> 09:54.290
OK.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.940
So it went a little bit over because we shrunk a little bit but we can always taper that down.

10:00.940 --> 10:07.420
Remember So let's bring it down to forty one hundred overdo it.

10:07.470 --> 10:14.670
Maybe just checking.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.430
So that should display correctly.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.090
We can check.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.680
I simulating it.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.950
Everything looks good.

10:23.080 --> 10:23.770
OK.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.550
So now we've set up that second page.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.740
Now we'll go back and set up another page.

10:29.740 --> 10:35.260
There's one page actually missed which was the stacked version of the homescreen so many going ago the

10:35.270 --> 10:41.970
homescreen to duplicate it.

10:42.170 --> 10:46.010
Now we're going to call this one screen.

10:46.090 --> 10:54.940
Stack might as well call this one homescreen grid just so we know the difference stack is when you want.

10:54.950 --> 10:58.210
You tell the system to display portfolio items in a stack.

10:58.210 --> 11:00.280
You'll see it just here in a second.

11:00.430 --> 11:01.920
So we'll go here.

11:02.280 --> 11:07.300
I was going to assume it's the same size and will throw in an image

11:21.610 --> 11:23.170
k then we'll just import it

11:26.200 --> 11:32.040
OK so then we import it and it should just fit roughly and then shrink it to fit

11:34.860 --> 11:35.480
again.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.520
OK.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.110
Looks like it works.

11:42.130 --> 11:42.420
All right.

11:42.430 --> 11:43.510
Perfect.

11:43.510 --> 11:50.020
OK so now that we have three screens inserted I can show you very quickly now how we can link some of

11:50.020 --> 11:50.940
these screens together.

11:50.940 --> 11:55.770
It's a little bit different than how we did it before but it's actually just as simple.

11:55.770 --> 12:00.060
So let's go to the original screen or get to screen grid and zoom in.

12:00.110 --> 12:05.400
Now what you want to do is you can identify any areas that have basic interactivity so right here we

12:05.410 --> 12:08.640
have a search box that's probably going to want to be able to search through that.

12:08.650 --> 12:12.820
Now through a prototype you're not going to be able to hear.

12:12.850 --> 12:17.900
Usually when you click up at the top left button what it will do is lead back to the home page just

12:17.920 --> 12:20.270
general just kind of X.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.710
Here is the categories section.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.280
That's something I don't actually have designed so it's something I would leave out.

12:26.500 --> 12:31.550
Here we have the grid view and because it's highlighted we know that we're seeing the grid view.

12:31.690 --> 12:36.850
Now if you guys went and got all sorts of different states designed say you had this designed and then

12:36.850 --> 12:39.670
you had designed this button to look like this.

12:39.730 --> 12:44.050
So it would look correct when you click on that button we could actually add a lot of interactivity

12:44.050 --> 12:47.160
where if you hover over it it changes the way it looks.

12:47.170 --> 12:52.300
Unfortunately I'll actually have that in the design asset so we're just going to have to simulate pages.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.930
So what you want to do is you want to pull over here in the course stencils area and you can use this

12:55.930 --> 12:57.570
thing called an action area.

12:57.580 --> 13:02.840
Now all I want to do is take the action area and put it over any area I think that they think I really

13:03.490 --> 13:04.840
should simulate as a button.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.430
So I'll put it over the time of and now that is a click area.

13:10.430 --> 13:20.310
So what I'll do is action click and I'll send the target to home screen grid OK.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.410
Simple enough.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.890
And then we can just keep doing this for individual section.

13:23.890 --> 13:27.680
So if I went say they wanted to double tap grid.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.830
Well it's up to you if you want to be able to let them do that.

13:29.830 --> 13:36.760
Let's say that they can click stack anywhere in this area and they'll put click will put the target

13:37.330 --> 13:44.570
home screen stack you go and down here it will be the homescreen contact us.

13:44.570 --> 13:48.120
I might as well put it down here and then later I'll mess with it.

13:49.900 --> 13:53.400
You go make a big case.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.260
People are messy with their clicks.

13:55.310 --> 13:59.270
And then we can go to Khond home contact us.

13:59.450 --> 13:59.820
OK.

13:59.870 --> 14:05.130
So now let's make sure that that works go to simulate playing.

14:05.190 --> 14:08.290
OK so now I'm going to click this OK.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.300
Now it took me back to the homescreen nothing happened.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.630
Phoniest stacked view like this.

14:12.630 --> 14:13.050
There you go.

14:13.060 --> 14:13.870
Now you've stacked you

14:16.680 --> 14:17.000
OK.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.570
And then if I wanted to say click the contact us it would take us to a page that we haven't yet defined.

14:24.610 --> 14:28.820
So you know it took me to a page that doesn't have click areas so what I would just generally do do

14:28.820 --> 14:33.740
is go in the back screen now when you put all your prototypes together you'll have all of these work.

14:34.310 --> 14:37.540
But this is the basics of how you make action areas work.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.850
So this will take me to nowhere because I've designed anything.

14:39.980 --> 14:45.320
Well this is the template that I copied over but now you can see basically this is how interactions

14:45.320 --> 14:46.560
work in Pinocchio.
