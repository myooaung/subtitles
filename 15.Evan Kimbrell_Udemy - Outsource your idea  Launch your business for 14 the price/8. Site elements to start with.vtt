Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture I just want to give you guys a quick reminder

00:09.820 --> 00:15.450
that and a lot of you are probably looking at this blank canvas wondering what do I even do.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.150
I have no idea where to start now.

00:18.160 --> 00:18.860
Don't be afraid.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.380
That is what everyone feels like right now.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.610
A lot of times good I get into wireframe I sat down and I'll look at it and I have a lot of training

00:27.610 --> 00:32.380
and experience in X UI user Flo's process flows things like that.

00:32.380 --> 00:37.690
Project management and even when I sit down and a look at a blank canvas like this my mind kind of just

00:37.690 --> 00:41.700
goes where do I even start right now.

00:41.920 --> 00:46.330
I'm just making this really short lecture just to show you the way that I get myself out of this kind

00:46.330 --> 00:49.970
of right where I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing right now where to start.

00:50.290 --> 00:52.940
It's kind of the dilemma of the painter when you have an empty canvas.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.910
What do you even start with.

00:55.230 --> 01:00.820
Now the way that I get out of it and I've seen other people suggest similar techniques is to start with

01:00.820 --> 01:08.110
really simple things that are not very risky and things that you know are going to go on there anyway.

01:08.380 --> 01:13.540
Things that will help you shape the way the page looks that are very standard and very generic.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.550
Luckily the vast majority of Web sites all have the same elements in them.

01:18.580 --> 01:24.070
So where I always do is the first thing I do since this is a web page now is a little bit different

01:24.070 --> 01:30.470
with mobile but this is Web quite literally the logo is almost always in the top left of your page.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.770
So go and grab an image placeholder.

01:32.770 --> 01:33.430
There you go.

01:33.430 --> 01:34.720
Now that's your logo.

01:34.750 --> 01:35.610
OK.

01:36.310 --> 01:38.060
Throw some text on it.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.310
Mind yourself that it's the logo.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.040
And OK great right now.

01:45.050 --> 01:46.420
Now what exactly do I do.

01:46.430 --> 01:53.000
OK the next thing you can do is almost every single Web site is going to have a header bar of some kind.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.080
Sometimes it's a long header that encapsulates the logo.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.110
Sometimes it's a bar underneath the logo really kind of just a pen.

02:01.110 --> 02:07.310
So you know here's an example of one barm of the other one.

02:07.550 --> 02:12.650
Here's one you can see how this is the entire bar at the top logo and then whatever you want but still

02:12.650 --> 02:15.740
they still have this navigation bar Rick.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.630
Here we have all the sections of the application.

02:18.950 --> 02:23.240
Here's another example of one that another bar again.

02:23.300 --> 02:30.210
They have a big search bar and then over here is the actual navigation and a little bit over here.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.680
Those are a little bit different.

02:33.080 --> 02:38.960
It's not weird at all to see standard like this where it's logo.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.440
And then a bar underneath it and also has a bar on top.

02:42.440 --> 02:47.300
When you start building large web applications you'll start adding tons and tons of this stuff everywhere.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.720
It gets a little bit more complicated you have more sections you need to take care of but at the very

02:50.720 --> 02:56.090
beginning you can literally just start with a bar right underneath it.

02:56.310 --> 03:02.450
And this is typically how I like to start and then later I can kind of step back and think about whether

03:02.450 --> 03:04.960
or not I care what the bar design looks like.

03:05.090 --> 03:10.470
It's also something that your graphic designer is probably going to care about more.

03:12.630 --> 03:16.980
OK and then literally if you want to I mean there's other ways you can do this.

03:16.980 --> 03:22.860
You can then section it out by all of the different pages in your app but you can use these tabs over

03:22.860 --> 03:24.360
here if you want.

03:24.480 --> 03:29.390
TAB TAB TAB but that's how I generally like to start.

03:29.740 --> 03:35.130
There's a little bit ugly what you could do is use lines right here like he's a vertical line to just

03:35.130 --> 03:39.620
segment these and then do text instead.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.080
That's one way of doing it.

03:47.190 --> 03:52.100
Yeah I mean you could do like that and then just put text that's multiple different ways of doing this.

03:52.110 --> 03:58.120
The third thing I like to do is just copy this paste and then put it to the bottom of the footer.

03:58.270 --> 04:04.530
You will always have a footer where like you put your contact information your business location and

04:04.530 --> 04:09.420
a list of the other pages that you can access that aren't immediately accessible directly from the top

04:09.420 --> 04:10.890
bar.

04:10.890 --> 04:19.050
And so when you saw this when we sketched out in person on paper that we started with the same basic

04:19.080 --> 04:21.990
elements and the same rules apply to this.

04:21.990 --> 04:22.520
OK.

04:22.650 --> 04:27.110
So now I haven't actually done anything and I did this for almost every single app that I do.

04:27.150 --> 04:32.520
Now it makes it a lot easier and then I can start pulling up my scope documents and start looking at

04:33.300 --> 04:38.310
what are the goals what are the scope cut and get a decent idea of whatever it is that I think needs

04:38.310 --> 04:38.970
to go on the page.

04:38.970 --> 04:43.830
And then I can really just start jumping into it now as opposed to dealing with this whole space that's

04:43.830 --> 04:47.190
a big wide and scary really dealing with this area right here.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.810
It's much much more confined.

04:48.840 --> 04:54.720
Guys don't worry too much if you're moving too slowly at first it's very hard to kind of conceptualize

04:54.720 --> 04:55.710
what you're doing.

04:55.710 --> 05:02.250
My best advice is to take your list of comparable functions and look at the Web sites that you pect

05:02.270 --> 05:05.070
and then go and look at them and just see how they use it.

05:05.190 --> 05:06.360
It'll jog your memory.

05:06.480 --> 05:12.420
You'll figure out pretty quickly you know oh it's usual that there's a big image here text below it

05:12.420 --> 05:17.590
followed by multiple images or you'll find some kind of lay out that you're happy with.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.760
Don't overthink it just get it on the page once it's on the page is much easier to rearrange then compared

05:23.760 --> 05:24.720
to you putting it on the page.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.010
Perfect the first time.

05:26.010 --> 05:34.670
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
