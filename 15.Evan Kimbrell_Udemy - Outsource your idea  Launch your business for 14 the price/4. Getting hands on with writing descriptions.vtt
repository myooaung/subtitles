00:03.300 --> 00:06.050
It's OK.

00:06.050 --> 00:11.380
So applying this now to a job listing and you guys can literally just type it in like I did.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.550
And so I think it's always a good idea to literally just put it in like that because then what I can

00:17.550 --> 00:21.810
do is if I if I forget what I'm supposed to be writing I can just go oh hey look.

00:21.810 --> 00:26.670
Next section is called Why next section is called How next section is called specifics.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.680
In the next section is called perks and you can literally just write underneath these letters.

00:30.720 --> 00:35.250
I would remove the headers because it looks ridiculous but this is a good rough guide especially for

00:35.250 --> 00:37.540
you out there who have never done this before.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.920
This is a template that works very very effectively.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.550
I wish more people did it because they'd get a lot more bids and they get better people.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.380
But if you follow this this is how we honestly.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.940
Every time we post the job we get anywhere from like 30 to 60 people where other people get five to

00:53.940 --> 00:54.630
10.

00:54.870 --> 00:55.120
OK.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.270
So let's just kind of role play a little bit.

00:57.270 --> 01:01.530
Let's imagine you are building that dating iOS app that's native.

01:01.530 --> 01:05.190
What would we say in the what we would say.

01:05.330 --> 01:09.990
And honestly don't worry about we versus I versus us it doesn't really matter.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.780
So I'm just going to make this up as they go OK.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.910
So here is a good one description.

01:16.970 --> 01:22.590
We don't need to give them too much detail just again a fly over a description of what it is.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.480
I'm just making this up on the fly.

01:24.830 --> 01:28.550
We are looking to build an iOS app for dating in the United States.

01:28.550 --> 01:32.410
The app will be tailored for the 30 to 40 year old group range.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.030
I just put that for you know giggles.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.700
I don't think that 30 to 40 year old groups are going to be using Aiwass.

01:38.780 --> 01:43.100
This probably isn't going to be a great project but I do want to say 20 to 30 year olds because I'm

01:43.100 --> 01:46.690
just quite literally imitating other applications.

01:46.700 --> 01:51.640
The app will operate in many ways like a cross between tender and those who do not know what that is

01:51.650 --> 01:52.340
I put a link.

01:52.340 --> 01:57.810
And Coffee Meets Bagel again put a link that's always helpful if someone knows what it is.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.830
Great if they don't put the link so they can go and look for it.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.420
The more time they spend researching this and looking into it the better.

02:04.430 --> 02:09.680
It also gives the contractors an opportunity to say hey I looked at this Web site and then you know

02:09.680 --> 02:12.540
hey there they're actually interested in doing some outside research.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.590
They're taking a little more initiative.

02:15.060 --> 02:19.220
And I said all the matching investment we've done for the phone and automatically connects you to location

02:19.220 --> 02:21.150
based singles in your area.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.870
All very very very generic.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.040
When you build your own app whatever anything you're getting done you obviously will give a little bit

02:31.040 --> 02:35.450
more detail it wouldn't be nearly as generic as this but that is sufficient for the what.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.900
So now will move on to the why now I'm going to keep this very simple.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.580
I'm only going to limit this to maybe one or two sentences.

02:41.990 --> 02:46.880
So I put down two sentences for the Y and do a little bit more you can do a little bit less just don't

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
go crazy with it.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.520
I just I'm just making this up.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.690
This absolutely makes no sense but we've noticed that there are limited options for dating when you're

02:53.690 --> 02:59.120
between 30 to 40 the age range is increase this age range is increasingly using smartphones and have

02:59.120 --> 03:06.040
been using tender feeling out of place as they should Tinder is kind of like an orgy on your phone.

03:06.080 --> 03:12.440
So that's the reason why I put this is because again we want people to feel some kind of a connection

03:12.440 --> 03:12.980
to it.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.790
They need to understand that there is a pain point we're addressing.

03:15.860 --> 03:19.480
Typically if you don't add the y it's hard to connect to the project.

03:20.060 --> 03:24.970
I put you know there's limited options for dating when you're between 30 and 40.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.230
Hopefully what I'm looking for is someone who might be in the 30 to 40 range and has connected with

03:30.230 --> 03:31.430
this problem before.

03:31.430 --> 03:35.540
So one of the best things you can do is have someone who's actually trying to build something they would

03:35.540 --> 03:40.030
use that's going to make them much more interested in it's going to be easier to get them to do over

03:40.030 --> 03:41.120
time.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.690
It's just a much much more fluid relationship.

03:44.690 --> 03:49.280
And in the rest of it I just kind of gave some market justification saying there are a lot of them using

03:49.280 --> 03:54.540
smartphones but they can't use these other things that are cater to the twentieth 30 year olds whatever.

03:54.550 --> 03:56.510
OK so now the how.

03:56.530 --> 04:00.140
Now remember the how is not very specific.

04:00.130 --> 04:03.520
We're going to deal with actual documentation later.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.460
We have an entire section on it.

04:05.480 --> 04:10.290
The how is really I'm just going to give a basic kind of description.

04:10.420 --> 04:14.270
So as they're reading it they can understand what's involved.

04:14.350 --> 04:15.880
What does a user see.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.830
They can start to mentally prepare for how big this project is.

04:20.050 --> 04:20.830
Now what the how.

04:20.830 --> 04:25.900
Honestly I would just describe everything you can't get but don't go crazy you don't need to explain

04:25.900 --> 04:27.310
the color of the buttons.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.530
You just need to explain these are the main functions.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.710
These are the main points of the application.

04:32.710 --> 04:33.310
OK.

04:33.450 --> 04:34.930
And so I just kind of threw this down.

04:34.930 --> 04:42.630
It's kind of like a fat paragraph which is roughly what I think you should shoot for what I said here

04:42.630 --> 04:51.090
is I am imagining that I'm picking up the app and I'm downloading it logging in and using the primary

04:51.090 --> 04:52.300
functions of the app.

04:52.380 --> 04:58.560
So I'm just describing verbally what happens now if you're building a small application this is easy

04:58.560 --> 05:02.550
to do if you're building a large one then you might want to paint with broader strokes and you might

05:02.550 --> 05:05.030
want to describe more things at once.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.770
So what I said was users log into a splash page and see an option for Facebook log and splash page for

05:10.770 --> 05:13.780
those of you who don't know what that word phrase means.

05:13.930 --> 05:18.420
That's when you open up your application and the first screen that you get kind of introduced to the

05:18.420 --> 05:22.200
app that's the splash page it's technically what you land on.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.470
You can also call it a landing page.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.000
I've heard other terms for it as well but that's where it just pops up and says name of application.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.450
Sign up or read our terms and agreements.

05:33.540 --> 05:36.350
So they're going to see an option for Facebook logon.

05:36.450 --> 05:40.500
Now then I specified no other log in options at this time.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.020
That's important because you know if you have multiple ways of log in say you can log in with linked

05:45.020 --> 05:50.400
and Facebook and e-mail that is significantly more complicated than just logging in with Facebook.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.810
That's a lot more work for the developer.

05:53.190 --> 05:58.050
And so I don't want them to think that there are multiple ways of logging in.

05:58.050 --> 06:02.170
I like to be specific in that sense I like to show them that this is simple.

06:02.190 --> 06:06.810
So after logging in the answer questionnaire that has 25 questions and it's three pages long all questions

06:06.810 --> 06:09.750
are to 10 radio buttons.

06:10.110 --> 06:15.390
So now here is what I'm kind of envisioning is that you see a page and it asks you questions you know

06:15.390 --> 06:17.880
do you hate cats do you love dogs.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.100
How much alone time do you need.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.000
How desperate are you.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.060
Things like that.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.670
And they answer all of those.

06:24.870 --> 06:28.410
And then I would explain as I say these are 1 to 10 radio buttons.

06:28.410 --> 06:34.170
Now again radio button is those buttons where say you have multiple options and you can only select

06:34.170 --> 06:35.120
one.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.330
It's not a dropdown.

06:36.330 --> 06:41.190
So when you click those buttons that have there are just tiny circular buttons that you select.

06:41.190 --> 06:45.720
So it would have a 1 through 10 and they'd have to answer based on that rating scale.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.550
Now the reasons why I said All questions are like this is because that again reduces the complexity

06:50.550 --> 06:56.610
of the application saving that into a database is very simple versus say if I said you know there's

06:56.940 --> 07:03.450
four or five different question types we have long form where you have short answer dropdown boxes combo

07:03.450 --> 07:05.810
boxes and radio buttons.

07:05.850 --> 07:10.590
So I simplified it and I always suggest people start with the simplest version of re-application as

07:10.590 --> 07:12.370
possible but of course it's up to you.

07:13.150 --> 07:18.430
If I had multiple ways be answering questions I would have explained that as well after they answer

07:18.430 --> 07:22.330
these questions they're invited to write a short one to two sentence description of themselves and finish

07:22.330 --> 07:23.290
their profile.

07:23.290 --> 07:30.070
Now there's a lot more detail I could put into that I can say how many characters it is I could say

07:30.070 --> 07:34.120
whether or not there's key words I could say what the problem is.

07:34.450 --> 07:40.560
I could say what exactly they do to finish the profile but this is honestly the description of the post.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.790
So we don't need to get that specific.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.880
That's in the documentation section.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.160
After this they will be presented with a homescreen with two options.

07:48.160 --> 07:54.370
So I'm just explaining to them the process flow 1 C or matches for the day two to four matches per day.

07:54.550 --> 07:59.920
And to change your profile information and upload photographs so that is the way I see this it's just

07:59.920 --> 08:01.250
very very basic.

08:01.320 --> 08:08.440
You you click one button and it shows you matches and you click another button and you can change your

08:08.440 --> 08:09.240
information.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.600
Now I did not elaborate.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.840
What happens after you see your matches.

08:12.850 --> 08:16.010
That's something that probably I should elaborate on.

08:16.070 --> 08:20.450
And if you're building something like that make sure that you don't leave out that chunk of information.

08:20.590 --> 08:24.940
But at this point they probably know that that section is missing so they're going to go to your documentation

08:24.940 --> 08:27.070
section and read more about it.

08:27.190 --> 08:32.490
The matching system is simple and based off a 100 point system which is elaborated on the attached documentation.

08:32.500 --> 08:37.630
Now whenever you put something that's like a matching system or you click a button and the system finds

08:37.630 --> 08:39.720
you this you need to elaborate.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.110
How that's done.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.120
You don't need to say in the description.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.550
Here is my algorithm for how it matches people.

08:46.570 --> 08:48.500
All I can say is it's a simple system.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.860
You want it you know and it's a point system.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.560
That's a very easy way of describing it to them.

08:53.560 --> 08:58.990
If you didn't describe how the algorithm works there's going to be a big question mark in the person's

08:58.990 --> 09:00.920
head thing themselves.

09:01.060 --> 09:01.990
How big is this.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.460
How complicated is this.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.310
How often does the algorithm have to update.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.070
Does the algorithm have to update itself etc. etc..

09:08.140 --> 09:09.870
I'm saying no it's very simple.

09:10.190 --> 09:10.520
OK.

09:10.540 --> 09:16.200
Moving on to specs now and specs we're just going to focus on the specific requirements of the application.

09:16.210 --> 09:21.040
Here's where the odds and ends but that you would put But these are the things that are very very specific

09:21.040 --> 09:22.070
to the application.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.620
It won't work without it.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.210
And so I kind of just heard this out.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.210
This is all just theoretical.

09:27.220 --> 09:31.410
These are all just made up information I said app should be a native application.

09:31.420 --> 09:35.800
Explain this in a previous lecture native application means native application means that it's an app

09:35.800 --> 09:41.770
on your iPhone you click it and it opens up a screen that is made for that app it's not opening up a

09:41.770 --> 09:47.860
screen that leads you to actually their Web site and the web site does not look like the mobile application

09:47.860 --> 09:51.530
this is built entirely separate from the Web site.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.700
So that's what I said that's something specific.

09:53.710 --> 09:58.720
Now if someone if I didn't put that they'd think who can be a hybrid app like oh is it just a Web site

09:58.750 --> 10:00.040
that's mobile friendly.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.570
No it's a native application.

10:01.570 --> 10:06.040
I said I want to integrate SML tools into the application so must be familiar Tulio or some similar

10:06.040 --> 10:11.710
service because you're not familiar with Twilio Toyo is a service that allows you to send text messages

10:12.100 --> 10:15.450
and have robots make phone calls and such and such.

10:15.500 --> 10:20.710
They're very easy to use and they're very helpful and they make it such that building S.M. ass functionality

10:20.710 --> 10:22.540
and your application is very easy.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.550
But this is just theoretical right.

10:24.550 --> 10:29.290
Like I could've just said I want to integrate SML tools into this application so you must be familiar

10:29.290 --> 10:31.200
with knowing how to do that.

10:31.450 --> 10:36.280
You don't need to be specific you just to tell them what the end product you want is you don't need

10:36.280 --> 10:37.270
to know all of this.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.200
You also don't need to know all this jargon.

10:39.250 --> 10:44.260
You just need to be able to convey to the person this is what you want and then I said this is always

10:44.260 --> 10:45.280
something you should always address.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.000
I said I will provide designs.

10:47.020 --> 10:49.490
You have to slice and place the images again.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.440
You don't have to be this specific.

10:51.490 --> 10:54.350
I do this because I run a web studio so I know these things.

10:54.370 --> 10:58.890
But you could say I will provide the designs and that's it.

10:58.930 --> 11:03.690
And they'll be able to figure it out from there that you're going to send them designs.

11:04.090 --> 11:07.960
It's helpful to tell them what format you're going to send them to designs and but this is helpful because

11:07.960 --> 11:12.760
what this means is when I say provide designs that means I have the designs done I'll give them to you

11:13.030 --> 11:17.640
but I don't have someone who has taken the image and cut them up for use.

11:17.650 --> 11:20.890
No one's taken it and created buttons out of this design.

11:20.890 --> 11:23.070
I just have one big photoshop file.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.970
Again you don't need to know that.

11:24.970 --> 11:28.960
You can just say it as plain as possible.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.100
They'll understand you just want to get that across.

11:31.120 --> 11:36.240
OK last thing perks perks I'm just going to elaborate on what I put up at the top.

11:36.310 --> 11:36.730
All right.

11:36.730 --> 11:41.430
So here I just literally went oh down the line and elaborated.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.960
So repeat work.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.430
Now generally what that means is.

11:45.590 --> 11:49.600
So what I said is if this is built well have many more features that I would want to add to it.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.160
I also have another mobile application idea I'd love to start a long term developer relationship.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.570
This could mean a lot of different things if you work for a company you could say we have other projects

11:58.570 --> 12:02.080
and we're looking for developers that we can trust.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.670
You could say Yeah I mean if the if the application is successful will expand it.

12:06.880 --> 12:12.160
You can say that we have other projects that we're posting right now that will shortlist you for things

12:12.160 --> 12:18.140
like that those are very very attractive to developers or contractors.

12:18.250 --> 12:22.250
And then I said I will pay hourly and I like to start as soon as possible.

12:22.290 --> 12:28.010
Now hourly if you want to get technical what you can call that is time and materials but time and materials

12:28.010 --> 12:32.240
means that I'm willing to explain it very quickly because the later we have a full lecture on this because

12:32.240 --> 12:38.540
it's a very important thing time in materials means that whatever they build you're going to pay them

12:38.540 --> 12:42.260
for how long it takes them and not what they built.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.670
So if it takes them five times as long to build it as they originally thought it doesn't matter you're

12:46.670 --> 12:48.170
paying them for how long it took.

12:48.170 --> 12:52.850
Same thing goes that if it takes them half as much time they're getting paid for that much people.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.290
Contractors like that.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.640
That's what they generally like.

12:55.640 --> 13:02.120
They don't like to only get paid when something works well or comes out correctly because a lot of times

13:02.120 --> 13:07.160
it's not entirely their fault if it's delivered late or if something doesn't work.

13:07.190 --> 13:11.810
So they know that regardless of what happens they're going to get paid for their time which is what

13:11.810 --> 13:13.280
they want to get paid for.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.940
The other thing I just said is I'd like to start as soon as possible.

13:15.950 --> 13:17.450
This is a larger application.

13:17.450 --> 13:23.660
So I would not suggest ever doing that but since you put at the top I just showed you how to handle

13:23.660 --> 13:24.210
it.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.960
I just put the please message me with your availability.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.740
Now that's important because if you're trying to start right now you want someone who's immediately

13:30.740 --> 13:32.060
responsive.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.600
I don't want someone who's going to bid and then check in two days later.

13:34.610 --> 13:37.480
I want someone who's going to bid and say hey I can start now.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.560
That's obviously important.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.640
At the very end what you would do is you put some kind of directives I'm not going to cover that right

13:43.640 --> 13:48.110
now because later we're going to talk about that in depth because that deserves an entirely new lecture.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.520
Directives are very helpful.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.240
This is an example of a directive so message me with your availability.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.230
What that basically means is that if someone responds and they don't tell you your availability they

13:57.230 --> 13:59.240
did not read the entire description.

13:59.330 --> 14:04.220
Probably not a detail oriented person probably a little too busy so that's a negative score against

14:04.220 --> 14:07.430
them helps you kind of predetermine who you want to work with.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.440
OK so this was a sample run.

14:10.780 --> 14:16.970
Later in the course I'm going to run through another example of making a a job description.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.560
If you think you've gotten it you can skip over it.

14:20.570 --> 14:25.340
I think it's just helpful to watch me just go through and post these because honestly I've posted probably

14:26.540 --> 14:36.800
probably 300 job or application or contractor postings over the last four to five years so I know kind

14:36.800 --> 14:37.550
of how it works.

14:37.550 --> 14:41.370
I know what works for us and I know generally what are the best practices.

14:41.450 --> 14:46.490
If you want some more practice with it there is another lecture coming up but otherwise I will see you

14:46.490 --> 14:52.610
guys in the next lecture where we cover the rest of the posting where we cover things like down here.

14:52.640 --> 14:57.980
What are the thought processes behind the category of work specific skills are really arrangements things

14:57.980 --> 15:05.650
like that so see in the next lecture.
