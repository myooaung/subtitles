00:10.830 --> 00:15.600
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about what are the popular

00:15.690 --> 00:17.890
areas for outsourcing.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.250
What are their advantages or disadvantages.

00:20.250 --> 00:27.690
What do you need to know about each area and how do you determine whether or not you should pick one

00:27.690 --> 00:28.930
area versus the other.

00:28.930 --> 00:34.230
So when you go ahead and list your project or start looking for contractors you're probably going to

00:34.230 --> 00:40.710
be amazed at how many different areas and how many different countries are represented in your project

00:40.710 --> 00:41.840
proposals.

00:41.850 --> 00:47.010
So really quite a lot of different hotspots out there for outsourcing.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.020
But you as someone who is trying to get your project done.

00:50.130 --> 00:56.270
How do you kind of tell the difference between an advantage and a disadvantage with regards to an area.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.240
So the big question is does the country that you outsource from does it really matter.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.420
Well I have to say it's kind of a mixed question.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.890
It's not a clear yes or no.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.930
In some cases absolutely not.

01:08.970 --> 01:14.190
In some cases yes I think there are clear advantages and disadvantages to picking a certain area or

01:14.190 --> 01:15.450
a specific country.

01:15.450 --> 01:22.560
Unfortunately when you ask really anybody else about outsourcing countries and what are their preferred

01:22.560 --> 01:30.390
areas they often will lean on stereotypes and stereotypes are not particularly helpful as they're usually

01:30.390 --> 01:35.550
based off of whatever happened in that person's last experience and are not completely representative

01:35.550 --> 01:41.910
of an area as a whole but also based off of just weird cultural kind of misnomers or misunderstandings.

01:41.910 --> 01:48.510
However it is useful to understand that each area has its own interest cities and each area kind of

01:48.510 --> 01:55.200
has their own unique things about them that if put with prior knowledge it can definitely help you kind

01:55.200 --> 01:56.840
of narrow down your list.

01:56.850 --> 02:02.430
So let me give you three criteria that you should actually use when determining whether or not you should

02:02.430 --> 02:04.260
be specific about an area.

02:04.270 --> 02:09.180
Now these are three things that typically a lot of people don't think about but they're really the only

02:09.180 --> 02:12.150
things that are relevant to me in my experience.

02:12.150 --> 02:16.500
When you are trying to narrow down your list and you're trying to think of geography.

02:16.530 --> 02:20.370
So the first thing you should think about is time zones.

02:20.370 --> 02:26.850
How important is it to you that you're able to communicate with the company or the freelancer that you're

02:27.000 --> 02:28.470
contracting out to.

02:28.470 --> 02:34.200
Does it matter whether or not you can just easily pick up the phone or pick up Skype and immediately

02:34.200 --> 02:35.910
be able to communicate with them.

02:35.910 --> 02:40.180
Does it matter if they are working the same times that you are working.

02:40.200 --> 02:46.590
So there are a lot of different project types that can benefit or find it necessary to work at the same

02:46.590 --> 02:48.810
time as your outsource labor.

02:48.810 --> 02:54.060
If you are running a call center or you need someone to do customer service for you you probably need

02:54.060 --> 02:58.110
those people to work at the same time that you're getting your customer service requests.

02:58.110 --> 03:02.880
Similarly if you're using a virtual assistant it's often the case that you need to interact with them

03:02.880 --> 03:07.100
frequently and you need them to work while you're working.

03:07.110 --> 03:12.150
Typically when you have a project that requires a lot of back and forth you're going to want to look

03:12.150 --> 03:14.910
at time zones and take that into consideration.

03:15.030 --> 03:19.320
If you have a project also that has a lot of changing requirements.

03:19.320 --> 03:25.290
So let's say you have a project but you're constantly updating what needs to be done where you're constantly

03:25.290 --> 03:28.810
changing the directions from day to day.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.960
That might be the case that you need to be able to communicate with them faster more effectively and

03:33.960 --> 03:39.150
more frequently and thus you might actually care about where the company is located.

03:39.150 --> 03:45.270
So a second thing to take into consideration is does your project have some sort of a cultural component

03:45.450 --> 03:46.690
to it.

03:46.710 --> 03:50.600
Now let me explain what exactly I mean by a cultural component.

03:50.610 --> 03:56.760
Now if you're trying to build a project or let's say a Web site or a mobile application and that relies

03:56.760 --> 04:03.240
on something that is very specific to one culture or one area such that someone outside that area would

04:03.240 --> 04:08.060
have a difficult time understanding that that is something you should take into consideration.

04:08.070 --> 04:12.030
Does your app use a lot of phrases that are very localized.

04:12.030 --> 04:17.220
Does it use a lot of idiomatic phrases that might be confusing for someone who's not familiar with what

04:17.220 --> 04:20.360
you're talking about in those types of cases.

04:20.370 --> 04:27.690
It might be a problem when you explain things to your outsourced team or freelancer because they might

04:27.840 --> 04:32.220
just not understand why you're building it or what exactly it's supposed to do.

04:32.220 --> 04:39.210
Now all outsourced freelancers and Laver's firms they're all very good at following directions.

04:39.330 --> 04:44.220
But what we're more concerned with is that they understand the project as a whole and they understand

04:44.220 --> 04:48.100
the bigger questions because that's going to allow them to be more effective in the long term.

04:48.210 --> 04:53.250
And that's going to make it such that they are probably a better partner for a long period of time if

04:53.250 --> 04:58.170
that is the case then obviously you're going to start looking for countries that are a little bit more

04:58.350 --> 05:04.740
say Westernized if you're Western or say if you like live in an Asian country you might want to look

05:04.740 --> 05:11.390
for an outsourced team that can relate specifically to whatever your nation or whatever culture your

05:11.390 --> 05:12.780
application deals with.

05:12.860 --> 05:18.410
So the last criteria that I would introduce is that you think about infrastructure requirements.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.720
Now what exactly do I mean by that.

05:20.780 --> 05:30.050
How important is it that say your freelancer or your outsourced team is available every second of the

05:30.050 --> 05:30.680
day.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.140
So if you have a project that for instance could go off line and I could create a serious problem for

05:36.140 --> 05:40.580
your business and you might want to consider an area that has a better reputation for infrastructure

05:41.380 --> 05:44.810
and what I mean by infrastructure I mean internet speeds.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.600
I mean internet availability.

05:46.670 --> 05:48.380
I mean electricity.

05:48.410 --> 05:53.640
I mean really kind of any issue that could get in between them and getting your work done.

05:53.690 --> 06:00.380
This is specific to for instance people who are doing film projects or any project that deals with uploading

06:00.380 --> 06:01.940
lots of information.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.990
So if you're doing a film project you might have to upload gigabytes and gigabytes of film.

06:05.990 --> 06:11.420
So if you use a country that has slow internet speeds that could actually be a deal breaker so you might

06:11.420 --> 06:17.780
want to focus on areas that at least can handle large file uploads and transfers.

06:17.810 --> 06:22.070
So really I mean it could work the same way and say like a web site if you have a Web site that deals

06:22.070 --> 06:24.250
with large file transfers.

06:24.320 --> 06:31.120
We built an application like that before and you know how do we use say like a limited bandwidth connection.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.580
It really would have been impossible even to build or test it.

06:34.760 --> 06:40.460
But if you have a looser timeline or what it is that you're outsourcing is not crucial to the everyday

06:40.460 --> 06:46.040
operations of your business or your project then you don't really need to be picky about the infrastructure

06:46.040 --> 06:48.280
requirements of where you source your team.

06:48.290 --> 06:54.120
So keep those three criteria in mind because that's what we use to determine whether or not there's

06:54.140 --> 06:56.180
an advantage or a disadvantage to a certain area.

06:56.180 --> 07:01.830
So with that let's cover some of the bigger more popular areas that you're gonna run into.

07:02.150 --> 07:07.520
So right off the bat the biggest one that you're going to notice is South Asia and what I mean by South

07:07.550 --> 07:16.820
Asia is India Bangladesh Sri Lanka Pakistan those four right there are kind of in a lot of cases they'll

07:16.820 --> 07:21.630
end up being 60 percent of the bids that you get sometimes 70 percent of the bids you get.

07:21.680 --> 07:31.400
Now those areas are very prolific because outsourcing and BPO business process outsourcing makes up

07:31.400 --> 07:35.880
a very large portion of the economies in those four countries.

07:35.990 --> 07:39.140
There's also a very strong cultural component in that area.

07:39.140 --> 07:45.440
People grow up knowing that jobs are typically associated with outsourcing or usually good jobs and

07:45.440 --> 07:49.320
so there's a much larger group of people that try to move into that space.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.950
The biggest portion of this is really India.

07:51.950 --> 07:56.440
India is probably the prototypical outsourced country.

07:56.510 --> 08:00.020
When you think of outsourcing you probably think of India.

08:00.050 --> 08:06.110
There are the country that gain traction with outsourcing long before other big outsourcing hubs popped

08:06.110 --> 08:06.620
up.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.990
So let's try to evaluate South Asia based on those three criteria that I gave you.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.780
So first off time zones.

08:13.790 --> 08:20.510
Well India and Bangladesh and that whole area typically will range at least in the United States anywhere

08:20.510 --> 08:24.280
from 10 hours difference to 12 hours difference.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.180
So that's a pretty significant shift.

08:26.180 --> 08:32.120
Usually if you're using the AM PM clock I like to think of it like switching it you literally just flipped

08:32.120 --> 08:33.630
the AM of the PM.

08:33.650 --> 08:39.920
So what that means for you is that typically these India is a country or Bangladesh is a country that's

08:39.920 --> 08:44.580
better if you're OK with them working on their project while you're asleep.

08:44.600 --> 08:52.190
It's better if your more kind of tune towards meeting them when there are morning or night they work

08:52.460 --> 08:55.960
and then you wake up and cap off what they've done for the day.

08:55.970 --> 09:02.490
A lot of firms in India and in this general area they will adjust their schedule to match yours.

09:02.780 --> 09:08.780
But because of the way that the time zone shift works it's never a complete match usually just means

09:08.780 --> 09:13.640
that the more dedicated firms are freelancers can make sure that you have at least three or four hours

09:13.640 --> 09:20.420
of overlap so you can in most cases get half a day overlap with this area but you're never going to

09:20.420 --> 09:22.790
get full complete coverage.

09:22.790 --> 09:25.600
They're not going to work the same 4:51 that you do.

09:25.640 --> 09:31.910
So now culturally This is often debatable but in my head it's very clear as far as Westerners nation

09:31.940 --> 09:32.300
goes.

09:32.300 --> 09:36.620
India is lagging behind the majority of the other outsource hubs.

09:36.680 --> 09:42.650
If you have ever traveled to India it is wildly different than any other western country in general.

09:42.650 --> 09:49.520
It is very hard for an Indian person to understand the same likes and predilections as say someone living

09:49.580 --> 09:52.700
in Western Europe or North America.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.920
So what does that mean.

09:53.930 --> 09:59.180
That means are typically not great if you're trying to pick something again that has a very strong cultural

09:59.180 --> 10:03.110
component to it because that's something that they'll struggle to grasp.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.140
And you're always going to be at a disadvantage with that.

10:05.330 --> 10:13.050
It's also worth noting that if you're an English speaker you are taking this course India speaks a dialect

10:13.140 --> 10:18.600
of English and that's one of the more common misunderstandings about the area.

10:18.630 --> 10:24.870
It's almost better if you're working with a freelancer or an outsource firm that learned English a specific

10:24.870 --> 10:25.370
way.

10:25.380 --> 10:29.880
India has its own dialect and what that means is that they have their own phrases and they have their

10:29.880 --> 10:36.090
own way of saying things so to native English speaker from another country they can often be very hard

10:36.090 --> 10:37.260
to understand.

10:37.350 --> 10:43.290
A lot of times they'll use phrases or concepts or ways of communicating that are very strange and foreign

10:43.290 --> 10:43.970
to you.

10:44.100 --> 10:48.870
You've probably already noticed at this point if you have a project up and you're taking PIDs that probably

10:48.870 --> 10:51.850
at least one Indian freelancer has called you dear.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.770
You haven't already picked up on that.

10:53.780 --> 11:01.740
That's they use that as basically a common way of greeting you and Lisa or I'm coming from that's a

11:01.740 --> 11:06.200
term of intimacy so that always just sounds incredibly strange to them.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.710
That's not strange at all.

11:07.710 --> 11:11.390
Now the last criteria for India and South Asia is infrastructure.

11:11.400 --> 11:17.800
Now infrastructure is one of their weaker points in terms of Internet speed it really just kind of depends.

11:17.820 --> 11:23.140
Their internet speeds in larger hubs like Bangalore or say New Delhi are modest.

11:23.220 --> 11:27.420
They're never going to reach Western standards but it's a modest speed.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.230
So for basic web development mobile application perfectly fine.

11:31.230 --> 11:37.740
Video Production and editing they might struggle outside of the hubs internet quality crashes considerably.

11:37.740 --> 11:42.770
The other part of infrastructure was electricity and that's an issue that they run into constantly.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.050
Even in large areas they will have outages.

11:46.050 --> 11:51.780
Now that's a problem when you have servers when you have storage and you could have issues where you

11:51.780 --> 11:53.600
need On-Call workers.

11:53.610 --> 11:58.140
Now again of course if you don't need any of that you don't need someone who you can snap your fingers

11:58.410 --> 12:00.060
and they show up and fix it.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.890
Then don't worry about picking South Asia.

12:03.060 --> 12:06.780
So keep that in mind when you're thinking about this general geographic area.

12:06.780 --> 12:11.880
So the next one worth discussing is Eastern Europe Eastern Europe is probably the number two I would

12:11.880 --> 12:18.840
say it's probably the second most represented in the bid list that you're going to get for your project.

12:18.840 --> 12:23.440
Eastern Europe could honestly mean a whole range of countries.

12:23.580 --> 12:32.220
You know Ukraine and Poland and Belarus and even like Hungary and Croatia those are very common countries

12:32.220 --> 12:38.040
that get bids from those are countries that have very strong developer cultures.

12:38.130 --> 12:44.400
There's a very large portion of the country that is interested in computer science or tries to get jobs

12:44.430 --> 12:45.850
in computer science.

12:45.870 --> 12:51.870
Now in general if I had to pick between two bids that are the exact same one was in Eastern Europe one

12:51.870 --> 12:52.460
was in India.

12:52.470 --> 12:57.600
Typically it picked Eastern Europe that simply because of three criteria we discussed before they actually

12:57.600 --> 12:58.890
score quite a bit better.

12:58.890 --> 13:04.590
So in time zones they're a little bit better if you're in Europe then they don't have a terrible time

13:04.590 --> 13:06.700
zone switch only a couple of hours ahead.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.280
The United States it's less than India and India is typically 12 for us.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.680
There are usually more around eight or nine.

13:13.690 --> 13:16.370
Culturally it could really range.

13:16.370 --> 13:22.470
I mean a lot of Soviet bloc countries have a lot of differences with westernized countries.

13:22.590 --> 13:28.020
But as a whole they're much much more westernized than say South Asia.

13:28.020 --> 13:33.690
So that makes it a lot easier for them to understand they're probably more familiar with things that

13:33.690 --> 13:34.890
you're familiar with.

13:35.010 --> 13:41.970
They'll probably catch on more references that you make to say popular applications or popular businesses

13:42.030 --> 13:43.620
in the country that you're from.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.840
And then last thing infrastructure infrastructure is again considerably better.

13:48.840 --> 13:54.820
There are several countries that have higher internet speeds than say even the United States.

13:54.840 --> 14:00.570
Romania is actually a great example of a country that's average internet speed is almost up there with

14:00.570 --> 14:02.900
like even South Korea and Japan.

14:02.910 --> 14:09.060
So if you're trying to do large file transfers if you're worried about whatever it is that you're outsourcing

14:09.060 --> 14:13.540
needs high connection speeds usually that's not a problem.

14:13.560 --> 14:18.260
It's a terrible way of generalizing but in general if I were to average out all of the countries that

14:18.260 --> 14:24.420
all kind of come together to build your build your bed base they do have faster internet.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.050
So those are the two biggest hubs.

14:27.060 --> 14:32.490
And honestly if you stay within those two regions you'll do perfectly fine.

14:32.490 --> 14:37.980
I'm going to discuss two other areas briefly and I'm just going to highlight what exactly are the differences

14:38.010 --> 14:40.610
about those and why you would consider them.

14:40.620 --> 14:46.490
So one of them is Southeast Asia in general Southeast Asia is not a big hub for outsourcing.

14:46.830 --> 14:54.510
Thailand and Indonesia don't really make up a big portion of outsourced projects or even outsourced

14:54.510 --> 14:55.560
firms.

14:55.560 --> 15:02.220
The Philippines in general have a much stronger call center culture and in general have better English

15:02.220 --> 15:03.900
speaking skills.

15:03.900 --> 15:08.820
Anecdotally it's actually interesting how many American countries actually outsource their call centers

15:08.820 --> 15:09.800
to the Philippine.

15:09.960 --> 15:16.480
And it's specifically because so many people in the Philippines get English training and cultural training

15:16.780 --> 15:21.500
so that they can actually be passed off as American call center agents.

15:21.550 --> 15:26.220
So keep that in mind if you have a project that's very sensitive towards accents.

15:26.230 --> 15:32.140
If it's something where you need your outsourced freelancer or firm to speak on the phone or make recorded

15:32.140 --> 15:35.500
messages then the Philippines are an area to consider.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.910
The other thing that's very interesting is because of the call center culture a lot of people have what

15:39.910 --> 15:46.840
we call reverse schedules or reverse schedule meaning that they actually sleep when North America Sleeps

15:46.870 --> 15:49.060
and they're awake when North America is awake.

15:49.060 --> 15:57.370
They also do similar schedules switches for Europe as well so if you have something like a virtual assistant

15:57.820 --> 16:02.710
task that could be the spot that's probably the most ideal.

16:02.710 --> 16:08.450
So data entry tasks virtual assistants Philippines can be a great spot for that.

16:08.590 --> 16:13.660
Developers on the other hand it's less developed and you're going to have to judge that pretty much

16:13.660 --> 16:15.070
on a case by case basis.

16:15.070 --> 16:18.620
Now the last area I'm going to ask us is Central and South America.

16:18.670 --> 16:24.370
Now I'm only highlighting Central and South America because there are time zones match almost perfectly

16:24.700 --> 16:27.360
with the United States and Canada.

16:27.400 --> 16:33.940
So if you have a project that it is crucial that you have matching time zones it's crucial that you

16:33.940 --> 16:39.030
know at a second's notice you can communicate with your freelancer or with your outsourced firm then

16:39.040 --> 16:41.270
consider Central and South America.

16:41.350 --> 16:45.060
They are not areas that are specifically well-known for anything else.

16:45.060 --> 16:53.020
They don't have strong developer cultures they don't have strong business process outsourced cultures.

16:53.110 --> 17:00.610
But specifically if time zone is the most important thing to you then look for countries like Argentina

17:00.700 --> 17:04.320
Costa Rica anywhere that's kind of in that area.

17:04.330 --> 17:10.820
So in general guys you really want to judge your bid or your proposal based off the merit itself.

17:11.020 --> 17:17.860
If you have specific requirements on your project like say you need fast internet speed or say you need

17:17.860 --> 17:24.460
some type of cultural fluency or you need a reduced accent because you need a freelancer who can speak

17:24.460 --> 17:26.060
on the fly.

17:26.140 --> 17:29.580
These are things to take into consideration and apply those too.

17:29.590 --> 17:36.420
Now what you now know about some of the hotspots around the world for outsourcing in general.

17:36.460 --> 17:40.180
Personally if I had to pick I usually use Eastern Europe.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.090
India is great for certain things.

17:42.100 --> 17:47.320
Central America South America are fantastic for time zones if you're in North America and obviously

17:47.320 --> 17:52.840
the Philippines is great if you're trying to do data entry virtual assistants or anything that involves

17:52.840 --> 17:53.700
the telephone.

17:53.830 --> 17:59.470
OK guys if you have any questions I know a lot of these things are generalizations so don't you know

17:59.470 --> 18:01.600
be up in arms about anything I've said.

18:01.810 --> 18:06.890
But I'm trying to make kind of boil this down and and distill this so that it's helpful to you.

18:06.910 --> 18:11.110
That's why I use those three criteria because those are the only real three things that you should take

18:11.110 --> 18:12.170
into consideration.

18:12.280 --> 18:17.150
There are obvious exceptions in every single area but I'm trying to give you a bit of a shortcut.

18:17.170 --> 18:21.880
When you go and you have to actually pick someone you're just kind of confused about what does it matter

18:21.880 --> 18:22.930
what country they're from.

18:22.930 --> 18:30.200
So I'll see in the next lecture.
