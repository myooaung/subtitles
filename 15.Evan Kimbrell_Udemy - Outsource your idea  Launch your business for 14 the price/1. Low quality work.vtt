Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about one of the worst nightmares

00:16.030 --> 00:19.890
associated with contracting or really with employees in general.

00:20.230 --> 00:25.870
It's what happens when you have a project you describe that project as well as you think you have but

00:25.870 --> 00:29.110
the frequency just keeps coming back with substandard work.

00:29.110 --> 00:35.410
Now what do I mean by this I mean that maybe you asked a freelancer to design your web site and everything

00:35.410 --> 00:41.590
they send back to you is just much lower quality than you thought it would be or you asked for an application

00:41.590 --> 00:46.290
development and they sent it back to you and an all the intangible things that you couldn't describe

00:46.540 --> 00:47.450
in your application.

00:47.470 --> 00:49.070
It's just not working well.

00:49.110 --> 00:52.490
The load times bad certain sections just function.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.420
Strangely certain things just don't look right.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.900
It doesn't have the general look and feel that you want.

00:58.910 --> 01:05.800
Those are often things that can be problems in a project that are much harder to specify at the beginning

01:05.830 --> 01:06.880
of the project.

01:06.910 --> 01:11.950
When you build specs sheets or overview sheets for your projects it's really easy to get the details

01:11.950 --> 01:12.950
and the facts.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.060
And this does this.

01:14.080 --> 01:14.550
Right.

01:14.560 --> 01:14.760
Right.

01:14.770 --> 01:19.540
Because it's just they're just facts but look and feel and the way that certain pages should load and

01:19.540 --> 01:25.630
transition and all that other stuff there's a lot of information and opportunity for problems that exist

01:25.660 --> 01:29.530
in between the cracks of essentially of what you're describing.

01:29.530 --> 01:34.170
So what happens when you have a freelancer keeps returning bad quality.

01:34.220 --> 01:41.320
Well and previously we talked about using milestones to protect yourself from freelancers and getting

01:41.320 --> 01:44.620
yourself in a situation where you're only paying for what you're proving.

01:44.650 --> 01:50.830
So the best case scenario is that you prevented this or at least prevented the damage from this by setting

01:50.830 --> 01:52.540
up a milestone system.

01:52.570 --> 01:57.070
So what you'd say is after this milestones don't pay you X amount into the next month and three the

01:57.070 --> 02:03.550
next money if there's a case where you're getting substandard work you can usually tell by the first

02:03.550 --> 02:05.280
milestone.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.750
Usually what'll happen is if you can tell it's substandard.

02:08.830 --> 02:14.350
You need to make sure that you look and try to identify what exactly is wrong and then you need to see

02:14.350 --> 02:19.570
whether or not you can make the freelancer or the contractor understand this is lower quality and this

02:19.570 --> 02:20.640
is what it should be.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.470
If you can get them to understand what it is they're doing wrong or why it's different then it's OK

02:26.470 --> 02:29.320
to authorize them for the next milestone.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.850
Now if you cannot even get them to recognize what they're doing wrong or they're becoming accusatory

02:33.850 --> 02:38.860
saying it's it's something wrong with your specification sheets or your instructions that might be the

02:38.860 --> 02:43.950
case that you probably need to consider cutting your losses and moving on to another freelancer.

02:43.960 --> 02:50.590
Typically this only happens when you haven't described your project in enough detail or you didn't actually

02:50.590 --> 02:55.920
put in the time or the effort to really take your time and vetting a freelancer.

02:55.990 --> 03:00.670
A lot of times you post a project you don't maybe get a lot of bids if you follow this course you should

03:00.670 --> 03:05.150
be getting a lot of bids but maybe you had to pick between two people that you weren't thrilled about.

03:05.350 --> 03:10.930
In-general picking a freelancer should be an obvious decision there's always someone who is just WAY

03:10.930 --> 03:15.830
above the other ones or at least considerably better than the other bids you have.

03:15.850 --> 03:21.070
But if it's a case where you had to pick between two people who don't have reviews or two people who

03:21.070 --> 03:26.350
don't have a huge amount of confidence in this could very often happen and you just understand that

03:26.350 --> 03:28.680
this is a big risk that you could be taking.

03:28.680 --> 03:34.030
So if you're having to pick between the lesser of two evils when it comes to a freelancer you might

03:34.030 --> 03:36.020
need to reassess your project as a whole.

03:36.100 --> 03:41.260
You might need to go back rework on your wireframe where you work on your description or try some of

03:41.260 --> 03:47.010
the other platforms or keep rapid cycling your posts until you finally get someone who just clicks.

03:47.020 --> 03:51.910
But in general my best practice is that you always have them on a milestone situation.

03:52.090 --> 03:56.950
If you're lucky you didn't have to pay them up front and a lot of times that is negotiable.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.140
They don't have reviews.

03:58.150 --> 04:03.730
You could obviously say to them I'm going to pay this milestone after it's done and that you reserve

04:03.730 --> 04:07.500
the right to terminate the contract if they simply don't hold up their end of the bargain.

04:07.510 --> 04:12.970
Now you're going to be able to need to be able to describe what exactly is wrong and be OK with the

04:12.970 --> 04:18.550
fact that you might end up losing a little bit of money but in the grand scheme of things you just saved

04:18.610 --> 04:24.070
a ton of money down the road and you probably learned a ton about your project.

04:24.070 --> 04:30.370
The point is not to get discouraged but to go back and reassess what exactly went wrong in the process.

04:30.460 --> 04:35.320
Did you jump in your project without with the wrong freelance or did you jump on your project without

04:35.320 --> 04:41.950
enough bids did you not properly vet the person did you pick someone that didn't have comparable applications

04:41.950 --> 04:45.600
or comparable Web sites or projects that they've completed in the past.

04:45.610 --> 04:51.660
Did you pick someone who has a great profile except for one or two reviews that are glaringly negative

04:51.670 --> 04:52.940
with red flags.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.010
Is that the case.

04:54.010 --> 04:59.650
Go back try to pinpoint what exactly the problem is and honestly just start from scratch.

04:59.710 --> 05:05.560
If you followed my advice before about milestones and about minimizing the legal cost or the problems

05:06.050 --> 05:09.250
with the cash that you put up front then you should be fine.

05:09.280 --> 05:15.030
You might end up raping your knees just a little bit but it's only a problem that people who are new

05:15.030 --> 05:16.160
to this ever make.

05:16.170 --> 05:19.530
And it doesn't even necessarily happen to everyone.

05:19.530 --> 05:26.130
So try to take it in stride try to learn as much as you can in it and try your best to get the other

05:26.130 --> 05:30.350
person to understand what they're doing wrong and try to correct course if it's impossible.

05:30.350 --> 05:37.740
Make sure to cut your ties back out try this process over again and try to make the best logical detailed

05:37.740 --> 05:45.710
argument you can to get at least the reasonable portion of the amount of money you paid back to you.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.190
These are sticky situations.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.350
They're a little bit hard.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.990
There's not exactly a blueprint for going around this.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.160
This is just from my experience really you just need to understand whether or not there's a miscommunication

05:56.370 --> 05:58.840
and I understand whether or not it's something that can be remedied.

05:58.860 --> 06:02.840
Do you guys have any horror stories or questions just post in the group discussion.

06:02.880 --> 06:09.240
Otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
