WEBVTT

00:06.450 --> 00:13.340
All right let's get acquainted with oDesk I would ask was the second freelancing site that I mentioned

00:13.950 --> 00:22.200
I mentioned them second because they are second in size and also I think second in terms of priority

00:22.410 --> 00:25.920
at least for me when I go and I start my search for a freelancer.

00:26.980 --> 00:31.330
They are different than last but not by much.

00:31.750 --> 00:39.890
If you follow tech news you will know that the oDesk and Elance actually had emerged relatively recently.

00:39.910 --> 00:43.000
However they still operate to different products.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.990
You can still go to Elance dot com and you still go to oDesk dot com.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.800
So why would they merge and then keep to Web sites.

00:49.810 --> 00:52.710
Well it might have to do with just the user base that they have.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.060
But also I think it's that people go to oDesk for a different reason and they go to Elance oDesk focuses

00:58.120 --> 01:02.810
a lot on per hour freelancing.

01:02.830 --> 01:10.300
So they try to target businesses that are looking to hire someone indefinitely or so or to hire someone

01:10.300 --> 01:17.260
say for a week or two weeks or three weeks or something like that oDesk similarly to freelancer was

01:17.260 --> 01:19.980
a big venture capital company.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.150
They raise something like $44 billion.

01:23.230 --> 01:26.990
This is different than L.A. who raised in the 70s.

01:27.070 --> 01:29.800
They have about 3.1 million freelancers on it.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.600
So they're the second largest they're larger than Elance in that regard.

01:33.700 --> 01:40.160
And every year they post about 3.6 million jobs which is number two is oil.

01:40.210 --> 01:45.440
They're a little bit different than the land they charge 10 percent of plants was eight point seventy

01:45.440 --> 01:51.370
five if you remember from the last lecture 10 percent just comes from the freelancer and they also make

01:51.370 --> 02:00.220
money off of featured postings and additional kind of things you can purchase to increase the visibility

02:00.280 --> 02:01.760
of your posting.

02:01.780 --> 02:05.790
But once we actually get into it you'll notice that that's not exactly.

02:06.070 --> 02:09.360
It's not really the case or they make a ton of money off of that.

02:09.430 --> 02:14.320
They really only offer a couple things that you can upgrade for your listing appliances has a little

02:14.320 --> 02:15.070
bit more.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.550
Once you get to freelancer you'll notice they have an entirely different business model.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.820
Otis by far though is the most profitable.

02:21.820 --> 02:24.520
They make close to a billion dollars a year.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.160
The reason why they're so profitable is because they focus on per hour labor.

02:29.620 --> 02:37.330
And typically when you do per hour labor freelancers are going to bill a lot more money and oDesk is

02:37.330 --> 02:39.690
going to collect a lot more on their fees.

02:40.330 --> 02:45.380
So you will log in and I'll show you what the user interface looks like.

02:45.490 --> 02:52.990
It is not wildly different than the other Web sites but you'll notice it has some as centricity to it.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.920
It's probably the simplest in terms of a user interface.

02:55.990 --> 03:01.990
However they really do put a focus on their team environment and I'll get to that in a second to show

03:01.990 --> 03:02.450
you.

03:02.710 --> 03:07.580
So as you can tell I don't particularly use oDesk very often.

03:07.690 --> 03:13.980
I like to focus more on Lance and I like to focus more on freelancer but oDesk It's always nice to use

03:13.990 --> 03:18.640
because you know if you're posting in L.A. or posting a freelancer you can always just copy and paste

03:18.640 --> 03:23.590
the job posting you use to get to oDesk it's never They don't ask any questions.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.120
The other two don't.

03:25.210 --> 03:28.150
You can see that the

03:31.390 --> 03:33.370
you can view all your job postings.

03:33.370 --> 03:37.520
I have to go back in time to look at them because I don't have any open jobs right now.

03:37.750 --> 03:42.070
But you can kind of see what this typically will look like.

03:42.070 --> 03:43.480
Not really any different.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.740
I use oDesk mainly for virtual assistance.

03:46.750 --> 03:50.850
You can tell that or use it for things like bug control.

03:50.920 --> 03:56.650
If I'm looking for a developer to come in to fix something and I don't know how long it's going to take.

03:56.770 --> 04:01.720
Whenever you have bugs that's just the way it kind of goes you're not going to say fix this bug for

04:01.720 --> 04:02.390
$200.

04:02.390 --> 04:06.480
They have no idea if it's gonna take 2 hours or 14 hours.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.920
So look at the posting user interface

04:12.830 --> 04:16.530
so like ants it's pretty much the same.

04:16.550 --> 04:23.150
You'll notice that you can take previous jobs and will repopulate for you if you want to.

04:23.270 --> 04:29.810
As you notice these are mostly V.A virtual assistant tasks that I did that's pretty helpful.

04:29.810 --> 04:35.390
They don't give you the templating versions that Elance gives you but at the same time I would typically

04:35.390 --> 04:38.390
say that's not I don't mean that's not a big feature.

04:38.390 --> 04:41.070
I always write my job descriptions custom.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.310
I don't really need the extra help.

04:43.370 --> 04:47.390
Maybe you do but regardless they don't give you that kind of structural support.

04:47.660 --> 04:50.180
Same kind of system you're going to pick.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.070
Generally the type of person you're looking for oDesk does have a very rich community in terms of they

04:55.070 --> 04:59.740
have all sorts of different people doing different things you can get video specialist audio specialist

04:59.750 --> 05:05.640
you can get legal you can get marketing companies that will charge on a per hour basis.

05:06.170 --> 05:13.580
You really can do the whole comprehensive suite in terms of outsourcing on oDesk job titles very similar.

05:13.580 --> 05:19.030
They actually limit the job posting your title a bit more than the others.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.250
You can write a little bit more in the description but again like we said before doesn't really matter

05:25.250 --> 05:30.020
because your specifications are going to put in a separate sheet outside of the job posting.

05:30.020 --> 05:36.260
This is nice because you can just list out the skills you need works very similar to Elance day.

05:36.710 --> 05:40.860
Yeah I mean they just limit you to how many times you can how many different things you can list out.

05:40.910 --> 05:42.860
Nothing particularly new here.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.560
You'll notice that the default option is hourly you pay by the hour.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.770
Verify with the work diary.

05:48.770 --> 05:52.870
The reason I say default is again because oDesk really really focuses on that.

05:52.910 --> 05:58.670
They focus on the hourly wage worker and fix price is really kind of a secondary thing that they they

05:58.670 --> 05:59.960
use hourly.

05:59.960 --> 06:05.720
You'll notice where it says pay by project for a fixed price and it says requires detailed specs.

06:05.780 --> 06:06.790
That is true.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.820
One of the things of hourly workers is that if you know you just have a rough budget and you know your

06:10.820 --> 06:17.300
specifications are not ready right now you can effectively hire someone per hour and then fill them

06:17.300 --> 06:18.300
in as a go.

06:18.320 --> 06:23.150
I don't think it's a good strategy because I think writing the specifications out front will give you

06:23.150 --> 06:27.520
more accurate estimates and also get you more acquainted with your project.

06:27.550 --> 06:34.220
But for whatever reason you want to do it the other way you can do it but you can notice here that it

06:34.220 --> 06:36.190
kind of reminds you you don't have detailed specs.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.910
Probably not going to work for a fixed price.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.080
So we'll keep it at hourly.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.860
You'll notice here this is essencia NSA Trinity with oDesk.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.020
They ask what your estimated duration.

06:45.020 --> 06:49.050
And you'll notice here that less than one week is the smallest.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.820
Typically people on oDesk are hiring people for a couple weeks.

06:52.850 --> 06:59.120
They really don't have people that do a lot of one off jobs where they work one day or two days or three

06:59.120 --> 07:00.140
days.

07:00.350 --> 07:02.300
It's usually something that goes on for quite a while.

07:02.300 --> 07:06.900
The people that I've hired an oDesk they worked for a month or two months or something like that.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.060
More than six months.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.910
That's actually quite common you see job.

07:10.010 --> 07:12.100
And this is effectively a job.

07:12.200 --> 07:17.270
A lot of times and oDesk people post the six month contract jobs after the six months they actually

07:17.270 --> 07:18.530
end up hiring the person.

07:18.530 --> 07:23.870
So I know quite a few people who've gotten their developers from oDesk by using a long term kind of

07:23.870 --> 07:26.820
contract system estimated workload.

07:26.960 --> 07:33.470
And then you know this is pretty obvious full time meaning 40 hours a week part time meeting twenty

07:33.770 --> 07:38.230
fifteen twenty five hours a week as needed just means it just depends.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.410
It's not really a set workload.

07:40.430 --> 07:46.220
Maybe you need someone to just take to respond to customer e-mails in an e-mail account or something

07:46.220 --> 07:47.090
like that.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.550
You don't know how many emails and or comments you say as needed.

07:50.390 --> 07:52.060
Desired experience level.

07:52.130 --> 07:58.220
This is actually quite helpful because you can say I'm looking for an entry level intermediate or expert

07:58.650 --> 08:04.370
and depending on how complicated your application is you could pick you know expert or intermedia if

08:04.370 --> 08:10.270
you're trying to save money by giving more detailed specs and keeping the actual development simple.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.850
You can go at the entry level if you wanted to.

08:13.010 --> 08:16.990
That's automatically going to filter out people that charge too much.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.190
You're getting a lot of outsourcing offers where they charge five dollars an hour six dollars an hour

08:22.580 --> 08:28.220
and you get an intermediate you're going to get outsourcing mixed with people who are junior developers

08:28.220 --> 08:29.420
in your own country.

08:29.570 --> 08:34.730
And you know again the outsourcers going are probably going to be like $10 $15.

08:34.730 --> 08:36.500
Where are the junior developers in your country.

08:36.500 --> 08:44.770
Probably like $20 $30 or 20 25 expert then you can really get into people who are charging $100 an hour

08:44.840 --> 08:46.220
60 dollars an hour.

08:46.220 --> 08:49.220
Those people really know their stuff.

08:49.220 --> 08:53.500
Similar to L.A. You can choose your job exposure.

08:54.050 --> 08:58.760
This is actually interesting and Odense oDesk they have a setting called only oDesk users can find this

08:58.760 --> 08:59.450
job.

08:59.690 --> 09:05.540
This is interesting meeting that if I come to your Web site and I'm not signed up as a freelancer I

09:05.540 --> 09:06.760
cannot find your job.

09:06.770 --> 09:10.950
So it's not going to show up on google it's not going to show up on the browsing section of the Web

09:10.950 --> 09:13.750
site if someone just goes to the Web site and browse it.

09:13.760 --> 09:20.060
That might be something you want to do if you want to keep the put the lid on kind of the promotion

09:20.060 --> 09:21.540
of your application.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.620
You know what too many people reading it.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.130
That's something you can put my personal opinion is you want more people looking at your application

09:28.130 --> 09:32.730
regardless unless you have some super secret that you really need to hide.

09:32.870 --> 09:37.680
This only means that you're going to reduce the amount of bids you get by probably 60 percent.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.360
Again here's another oDesk thing that's quite specific to them.

09:41.450 --> 09:46.130
I want to hire one freelancer I want to I need to hire more than one on L.A. when you do this you would

09:46.160 --> 09:50.690
hire one freelancer and then do what you would say is I want to keep hiring and then you can add more

09:50.990 --> 09:51.960
here you can stay.

09:51.970 --> 09:56.210
You could specified up front typically And you say need to hire more than one freelancer are you going

09:56.210 --> 09:57.490
to get more bids.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.940
That's just basic bidding psychology.

10:00.050 --> 10:05.630
People are going to bid more because they think the likelihood of getting hired is much higher.

10:06.080 --> 10:13.070
ODesk you'll notice the people who end up bidding they don't give the best kind of responses or bidding

10:13.160 --> 10:19.790
details a lot of them will copy and paste which I think is kind of a shame considering that oDesk is

10:19.790 --> 10:27.290
so focused on hourly wages that it seems like they should put more effort into you know being specific

10:27.290 --> 10:33.440
as to why they're good at whatever job you're looking for or position or trying to fill because the

10:33.440 --> 10:36.150
potential to make money on it is much larger.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.280
Here you can see preferred qualifications.

10:41.430 --> 10:45.460
You know that's just something that if you you can get into this.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.900
This is where you kind of drill down on the ratings for freelancers.

10:51.190 --> 10:56.390
At a minimum feedback score or you can say the freelancer type here is interesting you can say independent

10:56.390 --> 10:58.990
or agency maybe really do want an agency.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.930
There are a lot of benefits to working with an agency and there's a lot of benefits working with an

11:01.930 --> 11:03.010
independent.

11:03.010 --> 11:08.620
You might have a specific idea of what you want and you can actually say that one of the problems in

11:08.620 --> 11:13.390
Odessa though is if I say independent Trust me I'll get a lot of agencies and if I say Agency I'll still

11:13.390 --> 11:14.380
get a lot of independents.

11:14.380 --> 11:19.330
So you still need to read the bids when people bid this one.

11:19.660 --> 11:20.800
Minimum feedback score.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.540
I mean the thing is that if they have below whatever that feedback score is you can self-select and

11:25.540 --> 11:26.580
remove them.

11:26.590 --> 11:36.040
I typically don't put this also because if I say minimum feedback score for someone can bid with a feedback

11:36.040 --> 11:37.110
score of five.

11:37.210 --> 11:41.140
And the reason they bid five is because they've only had one job and they got five stars.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.990
That job was for 20 bucks.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.130
So that doesn't really help me.

11:45.180 --> 11:53.290
This is another thing on oDesk because they track hours and not fixed price projects as much.

11:53.770 --> 11:58.080
Or what they'll do is get a fixed price project they'll convert that to ours.

11:58.180 --> 12:04.900
You can actually say I want someone who has build on oDesk before and that just means that they're familiar

12:04.900 --> 12:10.250
with oDesk they're responsible primarily you'll notice on the other web sites people kind of flake.

12:10.270 --> 12:13.990
So if I said I wanted at least 100 hours billing that means that the people who are going to bid are

12:13.990 --> 12:20.010
quite skilled or quite familiar with the service they use this quite often.

12:20.290 --> 12:24.360
That means that they're not just someone who fishes on oDesk doesn't spend a lot of time on it.

12:24.640 --> 12:30.250
I don't usually use this again because most freelancers bid on all three Web sites so I don't want to

12:30.250 --> 12:37.570
limit limit it to the people who are primarily working on oDesk location very similar.

12:37.630 --> 12:39.110
I'll show you later though.

12:39.790 --> 12:46.720
You can when you search for freelancers you can search for much more specific details Englis level this

12:46.720 --> 12:49.320
is a kind of goofy because it's self-assigned.

12:49.600 --> 12:56.470
So if you know anyone who's bilingual a lot of times they exaggerate how fluent they are.

12:56.590 --> 13:04.080
But if it's essentially it's self-assigned in this case you can say basic conversational fluent native

13:04.090 --> 13:08.710
and it's you know I don't usually Again do that one.

13:08.740 --> 13:14.260
You can tell very quickly in the bidding and I prefer to have more people bid on my project because

13:14.260 --> 13:17.830
then that makes the project look like it's popular which brings in more bids.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.510
So I don't try to get too specific up front.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.550
You run the risk of just getting no bids whatsoever.

13:23.980 --> 13:24.910
Cover letters.

13:24.910 --> 13:31.660
This is a feature of oDesk when you post a job os treats this like it is a actual position.

13:31.870 --> 13:36.700
So they call things interviews they call it cover letters you can add screening questions.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.680
I do like this quite a bit.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.530
Typically what I would like to add.

13:42.040 --> 13:50.920
I like to add basic questions like you know so why did you apply those particular job wash experience

13:51.550 --> 13:52.400
to you.

13:52.800 --> 13:59.920
You think and that's really helpful because there they have to actually answer that question if they're

13:59.920 --> 14:01.470
going to bid they're going to have to answer it.

14:01.480 --> 14:07.180
They can't just give you some copy and paste a description on their bids so they can't avoid kind of

14:07.180 --> 14:11.080
the crucial questions that you have that's really helpful.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.310
Cover letter is not helpful at least in my experience because they're in a cover letter basically means

14:15.310 --> 14:19.120
that they have to write a little bit saying why they're interested in what you do what you're asking

14:19.120 --> 14:22.630
for and what their qualifications are.

14:22.660 --> 14:26.980
Ninety nine point nine percent the time is just copy and pasted and it's just not useful so you just

14:26.980 --> 14:33.070
have to end up reading more bulk and wasting more time and that's typically why I don't like it.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.260
You can preview your posting.

14:35.260 --> 14:36.310
I don't really know why.

14:36.310 --> 14:40.520
Because it's not like you're worried about the design of your job posting.

14:42.570 --> 14:46.640
Similarly you can save a draft if you want to.

14:46.650 --> 14:49.570
Pretty much every system has that.

14:49.740 --> 14:54.390
Drafts are helpful if you want to get all your thoughts out and come back later.

14:54.390 --> 15:00.440
The thing is that primarily your job posting is what your main description body is.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.690
So that's what you should work on in a separate word document.

15:03.690 --> 15:07.440
I don't ever see the point in saving a draft.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.390
The biggest thing on oDesk is their team feature.

15:11.620 --> 15:22.980
And so like to even page the team feature is quite helpful if you're hiring someone who's per hour because

15:23.130 --> 15:27.820
it will kind of keep them honest in terms of how much they're billing you how much they work.

15:28.050 --> 15:34.950
So as you can see here I had hired two freelancers previously to do translations

15:38.690 --> 15:47.090
this was quite a while ago and as you can tell I focus oDesk on virtual assistant tasks things like

15:47.090 --> 15:49.140
for instance a translation I would need.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.850
I don't want to charge per word per letter.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.650
So I focused on just doing hourly.

15:56.030 --> 16:03.530
But typically the way that these work is they have a work diary and the work diary will show you snapshots

16:03.590 --> 16:07.240
or screenshots of how they've worked over time.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.120
Since it's so old I can't really bring it up.

16:10.130 --> 16:20.360
But the best way of describing it is they do screen shots of the person's screen every like I believe

16:20.360 --> 16:25.740
it's every minute and you can set it to do separate intervals like every five minutes.

16:25.790 --> 16:33.080
So when someone works on oDesk they have to agree to work on through the team management system that

16:33.080 --> 16:37.160
they have that's different than ads that's different than freelancer.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.720
They have to use that system.

16:38.870 --> 16:42.860
You can elect for them not to use it but you might as well since everyone is pretty much acquainted

16:42.860 --> 16:44.040
with it anyway.

16:44.180 --> 16:49.340
The biggest difference with oDesk though is that they're going to screen shot every single interval

16:49.400 --> 16:55.430
of time what they're going to screenshot the person's computer screen and that's mandatory.

16:55.430 --> 17:01.490
Whereas Elance the work diary they enter it in themselves and it kind of tracks more like every time

17:01.490 --> 17:08.750
they message you and every time they upload information oDesk really tracks it down to some really significant

17:08.750 --> 17:10.940
details like how many clicks they make.

17:11.070 --> 17:17.930
What are the words per minute when they type so a lot of times you have a typing or a data entry and

17:17.930 --> 17:23.810
they'll literally record how fast they're typing on their keyboard and send that to you so you can see

17:23.810 --> 17:24.880
if there's a dip.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.760
And you can see if there are 10 of taking breaks or that's something you might want to take out of your

17:28.820 --> 17:29.680
price.

17:29.690 --> 17:32.780
It sounds a little micro-manager.

17:32.970 --> 17:40.420
It can be and I don't necessarily use it every time but it's nice having that available.

17:40.610 --> 17:50.810
If if it is something that you can consider useful you will notice see contracts like Lance oDesk will

17:50.900 --> 17:53.650
manage your contracts for you.

17:53.810 --> 18:00.590
But you can upload contracts if you want and they don't use it the same way Elance does in the U.S.

18:00.590 --> 18:02.550
you can upload your own contract.

18:02.660 --> 18:03.770
And how does an attachment.

18:03.770 --> 18:08.450
Here you have to include it and like your messages are included in your job posting.

18:09.520 --> 18:13.260
But it basically shows that people you sign contracts where you can download it.

18:13.270 --> 18:15.400
That's pretty nice if you use this quite a bit.

18:15.410 --> 18:22.290
Again oDesk is really focused towards having an army of freelancer doing freelancers doing some menial

18:22.300 --> 18:23.890
task.

18:24.280 --> 18:30.490
And it's less focused on having a web developer say I'm going to build this web app for X amount of

18:30.490 --> 18:31.610
money.

18:31.630 --> 18:39.130
It's more like you'll find a web developer says I'll build this app and pay me $50 an hour reporting.

18:39.190 --> 18:49.600
Not particularly helpful if you have a company and you are operating and you do have outsourcing needs

18:49.600 --> 18:50.290
quite a bit.

18:50.290 --> 18:55.390
This can be helpful because they don't keep track of how many hours a week you're paying how many payments

18:55.390 --> 18:56.900
you're giving out each week.

18:56.900 --> 19:02.350
So you kind of keep track of your costs so you can kind of think of this as a way to manage your outsourced

19:02.380 --> 19:05.830
employees and that's kind of the way I think of it.

19:05.830 --> 19:12.250
So if I'm earning a marketing campaign and I need to hire some people to gather e-mail addresses or

19:12.250 --> 19:19.300
something or web sites or find some blogs in my space I'll hire three or four people to go out five

19:19.330 --> 19:24.640
hours a day and I'll track through this how much I'm paying per day in over a week and that's how I

19:24.640 --> 19:34.710
can kind of keep to keep the lid on my costs.
