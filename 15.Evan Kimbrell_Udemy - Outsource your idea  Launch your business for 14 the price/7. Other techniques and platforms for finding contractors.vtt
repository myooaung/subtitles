Hey guys.

00:06.270 --> 00:07.920
Welcome back to the course.

00:07.980 --> 00:14.450
In this lecture we're going to look over some alternate places you can find small contractors.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.840
Now you don't always have to use just those platforms that we covered.

00:18.840 --> 00:25.000
There are some other ways to find people you just need to know where to look and a couple of basic techniques

00:25.000 --> 00:25.920
for finding them.

00:25.920 --> 00:31.210
So we're going to go over a couple of my favorites so I'll see in the screencast.

00:31.230 --> 00:31.490
All right.

00:31.500 --> 00:39.600
So another way of finding out sourced firms or freelancers believe it or not is just actually just using

00:39.600 --> 00:40.250
Google.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.340
Now Google is really really good at keying in on key words.

00:44.340 --> 00:50.640
And so when you're looking for a freelancer or a freelance firm through google you want to be as specific

00:50.700 --> 00:52.430
as possible.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.410
Now the previous lectures we talked about using Ilands oDesk and freelancer Those are great if you want

00:58.410 --> 01:04.620
people to come towards you come out of the woods and pitch you on whatever you've given to the public.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.080
Now if you had something very specific this is what I would use Google for now if I wanted to build

01:10.080 --> 01:17.190
an application that use a very specific technology if I was very very specific about what framework

01:17.220 --> 01:19.060
I wanted people to work with.

01:19.500 --> 01:26.220
Maybe it has a technology that's more obscure then in that case what I would do is I would use Google

01:26.870 --> 01:33.390
and in this case I would look for firms and then I would add the keyword of whatever the technology

01:33.480 --> 01:34.140
is.

01:34.170 --> 01:38.730
This is what Google is primarily useful for but you can use it for really anything.

01:38.790 --> 01:47.550
Now if I were going to look for say a developer that can let's say use Twilio I could say Twilio developer

01:47.980 --> 01:49.450
developers.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.460
This one might see.

01:51.510 --> 01:56.650
Now you can go to like Tullio developers network here you might be able to message people on LinkedIn.

01:57.060 --> 02:01.380
Once you get past all of the news stories you should be able to find some people.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.680
But typically what's easier to do is you say Toshio developers and then freelancer or well you can say

02:07.680 --> 02:12.520
is firm or web studio or something like that.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.350
Now these aren't necessarily going to be out of the country and that's why it's helpful if you want

02:16.350 --> 02:23.040
to say something like Twilio freelancer and then insert the country that you're interested in.

02:23.430 --> 02:31.470
So you could say you know some people have specific areas that they have better expertise with or better

02:31.470 --> 02:32.390
experiences with.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.020
Maybe I'm going to Eastern Europe.

02:34.020 --> 02:40.780
I could say something like Ukraine or maybe I wanted to say India we say India.

02:40.910 --> 02:46.920
And so right here it obviously brings us back to a park which is oDesk nowadays but you can see that

02:46.920 --> 02:50.630
there's other Web sites that have access to developers.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.360
Looks like you can find people on people per hour work in higher.

02:54.360 --> 03:00.240
Here is an example of someone who has identified themselves as a Twilio developer.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.760
Same thing here same thing.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.580
You can go and gooroo dot com.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.690
Here's another one.

03:04.710 --> 03:09.150
Here's an actual company who looks like they've made in an individual page saying that they work with

03:09.190 --> 03:09.920
Twilio.

03:09.960 --> 03:16.280
Now this could work for really whatever maybe you're very specific about using or react or no.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.150
Yes there's something something very specific.

03:19.260 --> 03:24.750
Now another way that you can look for outsourced firms to work with this is a Web site called the firm

03:24.750 --> 03:32.250
list and what the firm list does is it's just a massive index of all web studio and web development

03:32.250 --> 03:33.800
firms in the world.

03:33.840 --> 03:40.110
They don't have every single one but this is this is what you would use if you cared most about where

03:40.110 --> 03:41.520
they are located.

03:41.550 --> 03:44.810
I would go here if that's really all I cared about.

03:44.820 --> 03:49.980
If I was like I want to outsource sperm but I want them in Mexico or I want them in Costa Rica I want

03:49.980 --> 03:51.310
them on my time zone.

03:51.390 --> 04:00.330
Or maybe I specifically want them in Slovakia or Latvia or India or whatever it is I would use this

04:00.330 --> 04:00.820
Web site.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.720
I can even drill down to the city.

04:02.790 --> 04:08.250
Now some people have a preference they might say like I want an outsource firm specifically in Hyderabad

04:08.310 --> 04:10.620
India that's actually sprint.

04:10.980 --> 04:13.180
We have the majority of our contractors.

04:13.650 --> 04:20.040
Or maybe you have employees or colleagues that live in a specific city and you think that you're going

04:20.040 --> 04:24.880
be able to use that as leverage to develop a better relationship with your outsourced firm.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.030
What you could do is you could look specifically for those.

04:27.030 --> 04:34.180
So what I could do is I could say Asia could go down to India and then within India I could pick the

04:34.180 --> 04:39.650
city and as you can see they just have list pretty much everywhere and right here it's going to give

04:39.650 --> 04:41.480
me a list of 23.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.300
These are the ones that they've selected that have the best presence.

04:45.310 --> 04:51.060
And then you can honestly go through see who you like see who has the copyright that speaks to you.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.810
Start getting estimates to.

04:52.810 --> 04:59.420
This is a very useful tool if you want to go and rapidly get estimates from a lot of firms.

04:59.710 --> 05:03.500
And it's also helpful you don't have to weed through Google results.

05:03.790 --> 05:10.060
So make sure that you guys are using Google and using the firm list if those are some things that you

05:10.060 --> 05:12.400
care about if you have specific criteria.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.240
Use Google.

05:13.240 --> 05:19.270
Honestly you have to kind of go through the woods a little bit but it's going to cut you through a lot

05:19.270 --> 05:24.220
of the junk pretty quickly and then if you really really really care about the city their And of the

05:24.220 --> 05:26.990
country there and try to use a firm list.

05:27.010 --> 05:34.200
OK guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
