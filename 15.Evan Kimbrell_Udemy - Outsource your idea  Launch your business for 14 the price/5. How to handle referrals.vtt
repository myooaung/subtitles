Let's talk about getting referrals for contractors and something that happens quite often someone will

00:11.550 --> 00:17.480
say hey I worked with a great team or a great freelancer which you'd like the referral all answer that

00:17.490 --> 00:18.040
for you.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.310
Yes you do want the referral.

00:20.310 --> 00:24.520
The only things that you want to be careful with with regards to referrals are one.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.440
Think about the person who's referring them.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.220
Do you trust that person.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.140
Do you trust that person's idea of quality.

00:31.950 --> 00:32.670
2.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.200
Do you like the Web site that that contractor made.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.650
So if your friend has a Web site that you've been thinking to back your head how ugly that is and you

00:40.650 --> 00:41.810
just don't want to tell them.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.780
Then you probably don't want to take a referral for the contracting team that built it seems a little

00:45.780 --> 00:51.240
obvious but you'd be surprised by how many people end up with contractors regardless of what they think

00:51.240 --> 00:52.920
of the website they've seen them build.

00:52.950 --> 00:56.490
It's weird but past that.

00:56.510 --> 00:58.700
Why do I think about referrals referrals.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.950
They are awesome.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.610
Why.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.060
Well there's two big reasons.

01:02.060 --> 01:08.980
One previously we talked about the qualification stage of picking a freelancer or a team.

01:08.980 --> 01:14.420
What I suggested doing was taking a very small test and giving them a project has to see how they work

01:14.420 --> 01:16.730
how you interact What's the responsiveness.

01:16.910 --> 01:23.270
You can skip that entire section and you can skip the entire section that's associated with finding

01:23.270 --> 01:24.420
them to begin with.

01:24.530 --> 01:26.560
So that saves you a lot of time.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.400
A lot of money you might not have the familiarity with them but they come pre-vetted you've already

01:31.400 --> 01:32.670
seen what they can build.

01:32.690 --> 01:36.360
You already have a recommendation from someone saying to communicate well that's all you need.

01:36.560 --> 01:44.370
And to the freelancer with the team they're going to be a lot more inclined to work harder for you.

01:44.370 --> 01:50.580
The reason why it's just basic psychology if I work for a client and that client thinks so well of me

01:50.580 --> 01:55.650
that he refers me to a second client and I take on that second client I now have two clients and I know

01:55.650 --> 01:56.940
that they communicate.

01:56.940 --> 02:01.800
So if I do a poor job with the second client that could affect my relationship with the first client

02:02.100 --> 02:03.910
it ups the stakes for the contractor.

02:04.080 --> 02:09.570
So and I've seen this time and time again when I get referrals and that person is referring them is

02:09.570 --> 02:14.160
an active client or they're likely to bring back a project to that contractor.

02:14.160 --> 02:19.180
I see a significant increase in the effort shown by the contractor.

02:19.230 --> 02:27.170
I've seen them go beyond what I expect out of a usual fix price project or a per hour project so if

02:27.200 --> 02:29.610
you have the option of referrals It's fantastic.

02:29.610 --> 02:33.380
Very quick thing you could easily do if you are stuck and you don't know who to pick.

02:33.510 --> 02:39.070
If you're Elance submission or Yoda's submission or whatever it is a very quick way of doing this.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.240
Ask your friends.

02:40.270 --> 02:41.770
That's Super-Duper simple.

02:41.780 --> 02:45.870
You'd be surprised how many people have outsourced poor or contracted out.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.070
You can get a referral from somebody.

02:48.270 --> 02:51.470
I mean you could even private message me and I'll give you referrals.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.320
I'm honestly not going to refer you to my company I will give you referrals from people we've worked

02:55.320 --> 03:03.900
with so share pass the love around saves everybody a lot of time and it almost always has a better outcome.
