A quick tip for those of you who do not want to spend the rest of your natural lives bug testing you

00:11.190 --> 00:17.220
can outsource this freelancer is a great Web site for finding people who can do software testing.

00:17.220 --> 00:22.530
Don't break the bank when you hire a software tester but don't get someone who doesn't understand what

00:22.530 --> 00:23.840
your application does.

00:23.850 --> 00:27.680
Use the same kind of pre-qualification skills we talked about in the earlier lectures.

00:27.810 --> 00:31.710
Make sure they understand primarily what you're is that you're doing.

00:31.770 --> 00:35.850
Otherwise they're not going to really know where to Chacun what things they should test with.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.310
If that makes sense you use somebody else's time.

00:38.310 --> 00:44.900
I think it's a great investment.
