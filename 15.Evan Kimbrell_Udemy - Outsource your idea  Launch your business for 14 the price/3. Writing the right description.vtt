00:05.850 --> 00:06.210
Hey guys.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.300
Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:08.310 --> 00:12.550
We're going to go over what makes a great job description.

00:12.570 --> 00:17.850
Now your job description is going to be different than say documentation's or specification sheets you

00:17.850 --> 00:23.700
make these I like to think of them kind of like a description of your project from 10000 feet.

00:23.700 --> 00:27.630
There are certain things you want to absolutely put in here and certain things you definitely want to

00:27.630 --> 00:28.820
leave out.

00:28.860 --> 00:33.360
Now there's a lot of different things we've noticed over our experience that contractors and freelancers

00:33.360 --> 00:35.310
really like and they really respond to.

00:35.310 --> 00:39.720
So we're going to go over those and go over some of the mistakes that you might make if you did this

00:39.720 --> 00:40.310
on your own.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.250
So let's go to screencast.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.050
All right.

00:43.110 --> 00:52.480
So we are back to now we're going to talk about writing the perfect description for these posting platforms.

00:52.660 --> 00:57.030
Now there's one thing that I need to point out which is that all of these posting platforms have their

00:57.030 --> 00:59.130
own kind of personality.

00:59.190 --> 01:03.600
They have their own freelancer base and each one's freelancer base is a little bit different than the

01:03.600 --> 01:04.510
other ones.

01:04.530 --> 01:09.270
Now does that bleed over into the description you're about to write.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.870
No actually it really doesn't.

01:10.980 --> 01:16.800
And I know a lot of people find that a little surprising but in my experience there really is no difference.

01:16.800 --> 01:25.050
I think that what you should be aware of is that freelancer in general is best for short term projects

01:25.050 --> 01:29.820
things that can be done very quickly are not nearly as complicated.

01:29.850 --> 01:37.580
They have a lot of veejays specifically or people that are really really trying to work for cheap.

01:37.710 --> 01:43.440
If you write a poem a description for your job post and you write it for Elance which is more detail

01:43.440 --> 01:48.450
more thoughtful more professional and you post freelance or just be aware that they're probably not

01:48.450 --> 01:50.500
going to read the entirety of the post.

01:50.760 --> 01:57.420
But it's not really a loss to you just be aware that typically freelancer posts are shorter.

01:57.450 --> 02:04.260
There's really no way to optimize in a way that you can make it fit for every single platform.

02:04.260 --> 02:08.550
So what I say is just optimize for Elance they're the best.

02:08.550 --> 02:14.500
They're the ones you're going to get the best bids from and then just post them to the other Web sites.

02:14.950 --> 02:15.330
OK.

02:15.390 --> 02:20.040
So in the last lecture we talked about how to build the perfect title.

02:20.220 --> 02:26.940
We talked about using perks making sure that you list out specific skills making sure that you set a

02:26.940 --> 02:33.980
barrier to certain freelancers who you don't want bidding and how to attract the ones that you do want.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.870
So really the description is kind of an extension of that.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.550
We are going to focus more on depth.

02:41.550 --> 02:47.870
We're going to focus a little bit more on elaborating what we mean by the perks above.

02:47.910 --> 02:51.930
But there's one thing that you do need to be aware of when you're writing your scription descriptions

02:52.020 --> 02:55.210
are the high level description.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.060
Okay what do I mean by that.

02:57.060 --> 03:03.030
Now if you say you're building an iOS mobile app so you're building a web site some internal application

03:03.040 --> 03:03.940
whatever it is.

03:04.020 --> 03:09.480
These things can be very very complex and there's a lot of detail to describe them with.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.460
If you are trying to be true to the idea you would try to describe them as much detail as possible.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.860
This is not the place to do that when you write a description.

03:17.940 --> 03:24.630
You are writing to just give the thought like well they call that the Ten Thousand Foot description

03:25.440 --> 03:30.690
you're trying to give the summation of what it is and not get into the nitty gritty because people are

03:30.690 --> 03:32.310
not going to read it.

03:32.730 --> 03:33.030
OK.

03:33.030 --> 03:39.210
So the way that I write these in the way that we sprint cake write these and the way that we've been

03:39.300 --> 03:45.750
very very effective at getting quality freelancers in a lot of them is that we follow a very simple

03:45.810 --> 03:49.820
framework and this is how we have it set up.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.830
It's what why how specs works.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.440
So this is what works for us in our experience.

03:56.460 --> 04:02.780
When you write a description you want to write something that's anywhere from say a half page to a page.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.150
You can go shorter.

04:04.260 --> 04:08.250
However what happens when you write a very short description is you're kind of setting the tone for

04:08.250 --> 04:09.250
the project.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.030
People who see that this is a professional project see that you're taking it seriously see that you

04:15.030 --> 04:21.480
put thought into it well subconsciously or consciously return the favor and they'll put more effort

04:21.480 --> 04:23.170
into it as well.

04:24.180 --> 04:29.040
So shoot for a minimum of say 250 words to 500 words.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.390
I wouldn't necessarily go over that because I you don't run out of things to say and I wouldn't go under

04:33.390 --> 04:35.280
that because you're definitely leaving something out.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.750
So the way that this framework works is very simple.

04:37.770 --> 04:44.120
What exactly do you think we're going to scribe what it is that we are doing just as simple as possible

04:44.140 --> 04:45.540
someone to ask you what it is.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.050
What are you building.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.790
How would you describe it to them.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.940
So let's say that we are building that dating iOS app.

04:52.950 --> 05:01.140
I would say we're building a dating application that works on your iPhone and the way that it works

05:01.170 --> 05:02.490
is this.

05:02.820 --> 05:07.380
And when I describe how it works I just give the high level how would I sum this up in two or three

05:07.380 --> 05:08.250
sentences.

05:08.250 --> 05:13.380
It's kind of like the elevator description if you're not familiar with an elevator pitch what that means

05:13.380 --> 05:17.820
is if you are standing in an elevator with someone and you had to describe something in 30 seconds how

05:17.820 --> 05:19.250
would you describe it.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.660
So that's what the what is it's very technical.

05:21.660 --> 05:26.260
No sales nothing you're not really trying to motivate anyone to understand what it is.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.570
Moving on to why this is something that you can leave out.

05:29.580 --> 05:33.930
But this is something that I prefer to put into it because I like contractors who have some kind of

05:33.930 --> 05:36.260
a connection to the project.

05:36.270 --> 05:41.750
I like people who understand the reason why we're building something.

05:41.910 --> 05:47.280
I like people who can connect with it on a different level other than hey I need to pay rent this month.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.970
So what I do is I do Y and I don't put a lot of time in this.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.340
I just put a sentence or two sentences.

05:52.500 --> 05:58.350
Help people understand that is a good idea or help them understand why this is a problem.

05:58.350 --> 06:05.790
Typically when someone is looking at a project and they have a connection to why it makes sense and

06:06.090 --> 06:11.370
they have a feeling that this is going to be a successful project you'll get more quality responses

06:11.640 --> 06:16.740
you'll get people who are more interested in it in an intrinsic way and not just for the money and that

06:16.770 --> 06:23.460
is quite important to getting high quality contractors moving on to how the way that Howe works is you

06:23.460 --> 06:24.890
just kind of list out.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.160
I usually just list off how it works now not from a technical perspective.

06:29.160 --> 06:35.940
I don't say that I want you to make this in or write it in Java in X code or you know this is how the

06:35.940 --> 06:37.540
back end works.

06:37.610 --> 06:43.070
The database functions you're basic going to say from a user perspective this is how it works.

06:43.080 --> 06:50.190
If I were to describe a dating application I could say you know user logs in and sees this.

06:50.190 --> 06:51.300
They see my page.

06:51.300 --> 06:56.610
They create a profile they log in with Facebook once they've logged in with Facebook they can type in

06:56.610 --> 07:05.400
their criteria see a list of two to three people per day and receive an e-mail notification of you know

07:05.400 --> 07:06.850
their matches for the day.

07:07.220 --> 07:07.540
OK.

07:07.590 --> 07:13.020
That is sufficient for the how anyone who's a developer or anyone who's even a designer is going to

07:13.020 --> 07:18.750
want to know in the first you know two to three minutes of them hearing this idea or reading about this

07:18.750 --> 07:24.870
idea how exactly you envision it working now then pass that I put in specs and what I mean by specifications

07:24.870 --> 07:29.610
is what specifically I should actually call this specifics.

07:29.620 --> 07:37.000
But I put specs to be sure not to be confused with specs that you're going to attach to your project.

07:37.230 --> 07:43.230
But I mean specifics so what is specific about the project and what do you specifically need from contractors.

07:43.230 --> 07:48.660
Now remember in the previous lecture we talked about maybe I specifically need an Iowa developer Maybe

07:48.660 --> 07:53.520
I specifically need someone who works for this framework maybe I specifically need someone who works

07:53.520 --> 07:56.760
with a certain language or a certain technology.

07:56.760 --> 08:03.570
So in specifics I would list those out what you can do is I also sometimes will call a section parameters

08:03.990 --> 08:09.520
and parameters means that this is where I'm going to put in specific requirements for it.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.960
So specifically you need to use this language specifically.

08:13.050 --> 08:19.800
It needs to output this you know say like certain X amount of matches per day.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.010
Specifically it needs to load quickly.

08:23.010 --> 08:27.830
Specifically these are things that I'm very particular about and I'll show you one.

08:27.840 --> 08:33.180
All right description for this theoretical idea and I will show you what some examples of those would

08:33.180 --> 08:33.770
be.

08:33.780 --> 08:38.380
Now the last one are perks now perks are written at the very end.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.530
Perks are exactly what we talked about before.

08:41.550 --> 08:45.810
Now we're going to elaborate where we take every single perk that we listed and now we put a sentence

08:45.810 --> 08:46.410
about it.

08:46.470 --> 08:46.970
Right.

08:47.010 --> 08:52.660
So if it says Simple well explain why it is simple why do you know that it's simple.

08:52.750 --> 08:59.160
Now if you said something like right now well you need to describe why is it that you need this to be

08:59.160 --> 09:00.550
done right now.

09:00.630 --> 09:05.820
What kind of bonus or what kind of incentive is there to getting it done right now.

09:05.970 --> 09:11.820
If you said that this is a long term project or you said this has repeat work please explain in this

09:11.820 --> 09:12.340
section.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.680
Why does it have repeat work.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.330
What does that mean.

09:16.350 --> 09:18.230
What do they mean by that.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.210
This is where people kind of go from.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.870
So say they read in your title Long-Term position or so they say repeat work.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.380
They go ooh I'd like to have a client that gives me repeat work that's great right because I have to

09:28.380 --> 09:33.300
spend less time finding clients and more time working then they go into the project description and

09:33.300 --> 09:35.440
they want to read about what do you mean.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.410
I mean how often do you have these projects.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.630
How big are the projects.

09:38.820 --> 09:45.570
What kind of a bar do I have to jump over for you to be you know to approve me and to give me lots of

09:45.570 --> 09:46.170
projects.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.510
This is where you're going to elaborate on that.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.230
And the last thing that's listed in this but it's not included in the framework because this is just

09:52.230 --> 09:58.410
something that you should do regardless is put instructions at the variant instructions are things like

09:59.410 --> 10:06.970
Please respond with this information please let me know if you're available please message me if you

10:06.970 --> 10:08.370
have any questions.

10:08.470 --> 10:09.310
Things like this.

10:09.310 --> 10:16.540
And we're going to cover this later in the course why we use these directives in job descriptions because

10:16.540 --> 10:21.610
what it does is it essentially isolates the people who are paying attention the ones who are responsive

10:21.910 --> 10:26.710
against the people who are just auto bidding just bidding all day long they're not even thinking about

10:26.710 --> 10:27.770
the projects.

10:27.960 --> 10:34.180
So we want to separate out the good ones from the bad ones and directives are a very easy way of doing

10:34.180 --> 10:34.520
that.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.740
But I'm not going to I'm not going to touch on that too much because in an later lecture we're going

10:38.740 --> 10:41.800
to talk in-depth about directives why they work.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.840
What do I mean by them.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.640
What are some examples of them.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.470
There are techniques that not every single person uses.

10:47.470 --> 10:49.960
And it's really up to you so we're going to cover those later.

10:50.170 --> 10:53.830
But this is the basic framework what why how specs and perks.
