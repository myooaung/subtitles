WEBVTT

00:06.870 --> 00:09.630
All right so the rest of it really is just kind of a tiny little details.

00:09.630 --> 00:13.390
It's up to you how much detail you honestly want to put in here.

00:14.310 --> 00:21.690
We can you know it's just pretend like this is here's a placeholder for the image.

00:21.690 --> 00:27.270
Whoever made the video can add and text again

00:32.730 --> 00:35.710
right here in the name of the video

00:37.790 --> 00:45.450
supersecret Web cam video because they want it to be a secret but they also want the entire world to

00:45.450 --> 00:49.710
see it and look at this realistically much wider

00:52.520 --> 00:56.880
go of this town at some space.

00:57.640 --> 01:02.440
You can add those thumbs up and thumbs down items.

01:02.460 --> 01:05.090
Just pick an icon put it over here.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.710
You can even just search for thumbs is on.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.340
Yeah.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.510
Run it small.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.430
Makes more sense right.

01:15.420 --> 01:23.660
And can can even copy it put it right next to it and then just find another icon.

01:23.730 --> 01:32.280
Thelma's again thumbs down like the video then just stick someone's face on it because it's a web cam

01:32.280 --> 01:32.970
right.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.250
You get the drift now.

01:37.390 --> 01:46.610
So when you get wide screen whatever you can put an enormous amount of detail into balsamic if you want

01:46.610 --> 01:46.950
to.

01:46.970 --> 01:53.500
But as you've noticed that really did not take me a lot of time and I have a wireframe of a video that

01:53.610 --> 01:58.600
I you know one more time and effort into whatever you actually build yourself.

01:58.790 --> 02:04.130
But once you actually get acquainted with it hopefully by now you are acquainted you can really move

02:04.130 --> 02:08.540
at lightning speed and you can really produce these very very quickly.

02:08.540 --> 02:14.330
Now if I you know wanted to make the next screen at YouTube all you know I could just go up to file

02:14.390 --> 02:19.700
clone current mock up and look I have the same exact thing and I can just move from here and start deleting

02:19.700 --> 02:23.330
things wherever I want and changing things around.

02:24.230 --> 02:30.720
There is more functionality to bosonic I just don't think it's something that you need to be.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.290
You don't need an in-depth Guide to it.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.210
You see what I did.

02:33.350 --> 02:37.460
I learned you know you could learn this very quickly you could slap it together and that's kind of the

02:37.460 --> 02:39.020
beauty of balsamic.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.840
I don't want you to spend an enormous amount of time doing this.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.850
This is if I were kind of shying away from some of the super professional hard core wire framing services

02:47.240 --> 02:52.340
and just moving towards this one which is just kind of fun and everybody kind of looks likes the design

02:52.340 --> 02:53.560
of it once it's all done.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.190
Now when you're done and you're happy with what you've got all you've got to do is just go up to file

02:58.810 --> 03:01.920
and you can save it whatever you want it to be.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.570
Make sure to back it up if you guys are on an older computer.

03:05.570 --> 03:09.290
Make sure that you don't have tons and tons and tons of tabs open it can really kind of slow down your

03:09.290 --> 03:12.020
computer but otherwise just export it to whatever you want.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.210
I like PTF.

03:13.310 --> 03:15.620
That's one of the easiest to view.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.270
Or you just do it as an image.

03:17.270 --> 03:21.590
That's what you end up sending your graphic designer or your developer and they will think 1000 times

03:21.590 --> 03:21.880
over.
