WEBVTT

00:06.420 --> 00:07.580
Welcome back.

00:07.580 --> 00:15.480
I am going to intro you to balsamic which is a wire framing tool that we spent cake use all the time.

00:15.480 --> 00:21.880
Bosonic is by far my favorite tool for wireframe framing and it's my favorite for two reasons.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.500
One is that it's very simple to use.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.390
You can pick it up very quickly.

00:27.390 --> 00:30.140
I really don't think you need to spend hours and hours with it.

00:30.150 --> 00:34.810
You can really learn it over the course of 15 20 minutes.

00:34.830 --> 00:39.420
There are a lot of tools out there that help you wireframe but they try to make their systems way too

00:39.420 --> 00:40.270
advanced.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.970
My experience you don't end up using 90 percent of the features that you try to give you.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.470
And again you really don't want to have to spend a large amount of time trying to figure out just how

00:49.470 --> 00:50.790
to wireframe.

00:50.790 --> 00:56.910
The second reason why I like balsamic is that they have a sketch kind of design to their system and

00:56.910 --> 00:58.370
you'll see this in just a second.

00:58.740 --> 01:03.040
So when you're designing wireframe it looks kind of like you sketched it out on a piece of paper.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.340
I really like that and our clients really like that.

01:06.630 --> 01:11.870
It just kind of looks quirky and cool and it kind of does look like you made it on a scratch pad.

01:12.270 --> 01:19.600
I also like how this scatch kind of look to it makes it kind of feel like you know this is a wireframe.

01:19.620 --> 01:25.020
We don't need to take it too seriously and it kind of conveys that the developer or your designer should

01:25.020 --> 01:26.940
really kind of give you the benefit the doubt.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.380
This is not an exact design of what you want and I kind of like that one downside of balsamic old Mint

01:34.380 --> 01:43.320
is that they do cost money and I believe one user license is $79 which is kind of expensive for a wireframe

01:43.320 --> 01:44.880
tool.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.610
There are other services out there that are cheaper but unfortunately I'm not aware of any that are

01:50.610 --> 01:51.910
free right now.

01:51.930 --> 01:57.960
It used to be the case that Mockingbird was a free wireframe framing tool that was available and I originally

01:57.960 --> 02:05.750
planned on making a lecture on that if you guys really do want me to do a lecture on another wire framing

02:05.760 --> 02:08.400
tool that I'm not unaware of.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.450
Just make sure the message me and let me know and I'll put it up there because I prefer if you guys

02:12.450 --> 02:16.720
have a free version but currently I just simply don't know of version.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.750
So let's just dive right into it.

02:19.770 --> 02:20.640
All right.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.880
This is what balsamic looks like.

02:22.890 --> 02:24.800
Pretty simple.

02:24.840 --> 02:33.720
You have essentially designs up at the top and these represent kind of all of the common elements that

02:33.720 --> 02:40.880
you'd be using in a web site or a mobile application wireframe you want to do mobile a section for iPhone.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.860
You want to do.

02:42.930 --> 02:47.640
Let's see if you want to make a form go to forms and have everything right here that you need.

02:47.770 --> 02:54.850
Now what you simply do is you would drag and drop it into the canvas down here and this is the canvas.

02:55.020 --> 03:00.870
So here we go here's a button you can scale it just like any other type of design application to make

03:00.870 --> 03:03.910
the button look like whatever you want.

03:04.530 --> 03:10.530
So one of the things about bosonic that I will admit is the negative is that they put everything into

03:10.680 --> 03:15.160
sections and sometimes it's actually kind of difficult to find things.

03:15.510 --> 03:20.040
That's something that I've kind of experienced so what the remedy for this is I get better at learning

03:20.040 --> 03:21.430
the names of everything.

03:21.540 --> 03:29.620
So you can search for it like for instance if you wanted to make say a Facebook share button.

03:29.730 --> 03:30.030
OK.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.590
How would you do that.

03:31.620 --> 03:37.890
So do you have a button but there's no way that this really could represent a Facebook share about way

03:37.950 --> 03:40.670
you actually have to do it as you have to look for an icon.

03:41.070 --> 03:44.980
So just look for icon an icon and text label or just go with Icon.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.900
We got the text label so here you go it gives you a blank space and a name.

03:51.490 --> 03:58.120
And now if you want to bring an icon at this little user interface pops up and you can search for it

03:58.240 --> 04:02.700
or you can click this button to open their icon library.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.570
Now this loads.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.520
This is what their icon library looks like.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.570
They have tons and tons of things in here.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.940
Let's see there's the Reddit icon.

04:12.940 --> 04:15.410
Here is the YouTube.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.010
Pretty much anything you could think of.

04:18.010 --> 04:22.660
And they're all kind of in this quirky kind of sketch style which is very popular.

04:22.660 --> 04:27.100
So if I want to do Facebook and you couldn't find it you could either just go to social or you could

04:27.100 --> 04:29.300
search it down here.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.840
It is Facebook.

04:32.250 --> 04:32.490
All right.

04:32.490 --> 04:38.880
And then you can change the name but just double tapping and we'll just say how can you say share whatever

04:40.350 --> 04:44.420
doesn't look exactly like what it would look like on an actual application.

04:44.430 --> 04:45.550
But that's not the point.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.640
You just want to convey to your designer convey to a developer what exactly you want in the area they'll

04:50.640 --> 04:52.010
deal with the rest of it.

04:52.020 --> 04:52.290
All right.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.660
Now if you wanted to add text.

04:54.770 --> 04:58.070
Another tricky part and this is why I'm kind of tackling this up front.

04:58.140 --> 05:04.770
I wanted to add tax there is a section called text can also search for text search for tax though you

05:04.770 --> 05:07.760
know this is a little confusing I just want to make a line.

05:07.770 --> 05:13.650
I just want to type something you notice over here a section called text.

05:13.740 --> 05:18.690
You just need to know this it's actually string label or string of text.

05:18.690 --> 05:19.820
Drag and drop that in.

05:19.930 --> 05:21.930
Now you have some text I can type whatever I want.

05:21.930 --> 05:25.360
Some text now with some text.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.420
This is how you would modify it.

05:27.420 --> 05:30.550
And this goes for pretty much any element you put on your canvas.

05:30.570 --> 05:34.050
Your button is going to pop up and you to be able to edit it over here.

05:34.050 --> 05:38.710
Same with our icon same and virtually the same features.

05:38.730 --> 05:45.720
Well pop up over here if you want to copy whatever you made here is a duplicate Here's a cut.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.200
And here is your copy paste and you can trash it.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.440
We'll get to grouping here in a second.

05:52.260 --> 05:53.800
Now I've created some text.

05:53.910 --> 05:57.800
And what I want to do with it I can change the orientation.

05:58.260 --> 06:04.760
Here I can use the state and state just means that if I know normal disabled if I disable it.

06:04.890 --> 06:11.550
What that basically means is that when I go and save my balsamic as a PDA for P and G or J pag or whatever

06:11.970 --> 06:13.110
it's not going to show up.

06:13.140 --> 06:20.100
And so this can be helpful sometimes if you're copying large bits of wireframe over and using them over

06:20.100 --> 06:23.970
and over again and sometimes you just want to disable it or sometimes you want to disable something

06:23.970 --> 06:27.640
just so it helps you see something else that it might be covering.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.430
But if you want it to happen you want it to be there.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.680
Make sure that it's checked as normal link you can link to another.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.230
You can link to a web page.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.740
You can turn this into a link so that when you save it as a PDA the person that has it can click it

06:41.070 --> 06:43.200
and it can take them somewhere here.

06:43.230 --> 06:47.580
Regular text editing features you can make it bold italic underline etc. etc..

06:47.640 --> 06:49.220
Here's what you change the size.

06:49.230 --> 06:51.680
You can also change your size over here.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.860
I prefer not to play with this but this is much more exact.

06:55.890 --> 07:03.320
This will resize it in a way that you kind of can't really get when you're picking just these increments.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.780
So I would typically stick to this.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.830
What will happen oftentimes is see how it went from some text to some.

07:10.830 --> 07:16.230
Because I went to large I can open the container and the container large enough to show what the actual

07:16.230 --> 07:19.240
content in the element is.

07:19.350 --> 07:28.020
If you want to duplicate items you will do as you can duplicate creates a copy of it when you move things

07:28.020 --> 07:34.770
around it will show you grid lines relative relative to whatever else is on your canvas.

07:34.770 --> 07:46.880
Now if I wanted to say Copy two things I could hit the key and select both.

07:47.610 --> 07:56.160
Now if I get duplicate it's going to duplicate both the interesting one thing what will happen also

07:56.160 --> 08:03.090
is if I am duplicating an item and it's notice it's a pattern in their online media look at this.

08:03.090 --> 08:04.870
It should show below it.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.470
Wow.

08:06.570 --> 08:06.870
All right.

08:06.870 --> 08:10.020
Well sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't.

08:10.140 --> 08:10.390
OK.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.630
There you go.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.500
And keep doing that all day.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.650
System isn't totally foolproof.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.770
You'll notice that it has some quirks to it.

08:18.870 --> 08:24.510
No but the point is it's still very simple and easy to use.

08:24.570 --> 08:32.510
Do you want to include links to text that show link makes something look like a link type in your link.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.470
I can show you some of these other things.

08:34.740 --> 08:39.960
This is called bread crumbs bread crumbs of the things you expect to see at the top of a Web site that

08:39.960 --> 08:43.870
shows you you know where in the sub page of the website you are.

08:43.920 --> 08:49.860
I don't usually include those unless I'm trying to be really specific with my wireframe if you want

08:49.860 --> 08:56.460
to make a you want to make a wireframe for a mobile application.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.540
You just start right here.

08:57.570 --> 08:57.770
Good.

08:57.770 --> 09:03.600
IPhone and iPhone you have right here an actual iPhone.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.380
Again it has that kind of goofy sketch style to it.

09:07.380 --> 09:13.920
So on the iPhone you'll notice that you can expand it make it larger but it has a minimum.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.460
It should have a.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.460
So I can't make a guinea iPhone.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.890
It'll always be proportional.

09:21.010 --> 09:25.790
But regardless and there's also a maximum size that you'll hit something like.

09:26.240 --> 09:31.080
And then what you can do is you can kind of make screens of your mobile application if you want.

09:31.090 --> 09:36.520
There's some easy to use things that pop these in here like there's an iPhone keyboard and I can put

09:36.520 --> 09:42.250
together a quick alert screen and then whenever you're trying to edit something with balsamic it might

09:42.250 --> 09:44.240
look like it's not particularly polished.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.070
It's kind of the design they're going for but you'll notice that like for instance how do I change.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.420
Alert alert text Texaco's here.

09:49.420 --> 09:53.070
No and yes I notice that there's three lines.

09:53.080 --> 09:58.480
And so anything I do on the second line is going to modify the subtitle of the alert anything I modify

09:58.480 --> 10:03.060
in the top line is going to modify the top line and you get the point.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.890
Third the third one will change the buttons.

10:05.920 --> 10:15.400
Now if I wanted to go ahead and make multiple screens of this there's two ways of doing it I could go

10:15.400 --> 10:19.180
to the bottom and create a new mockup.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.390
So you do as you click.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.760
So that'll create a new screen and I can go go and create a new screen.

10:25.940 --> 10:34.900
Well you can also do is go up to file and then do new clone of current mockup and Shokri.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.200
OK so now you see that we've moved to a new page with the exact same thing.

10:39.220 --> 10:40.220
So that's one way of doing.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.990
Showing incremental changes.

10:42.220 --> 10:48.820
Sometimes you can do is you can show one screen write some text over here explaining it and maybe you

10:48.820 --> 10:52.610
want to have multiple screens of the same kind of design with text next to it.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.350
There's a lot of ways you can use this.

10:55.810 --> 11:00.610
You can also just so I will not save that because I don't want it.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.900
You can also do is if I want to copy this.

11:02.980 --> 11:08.080
And typically when I make wire frames I'll be honest I actually make a lot of them all within the same

11:08.080 --> 11:09.070
canvas.

11:09.070 --> 11:13.240
And the way that you would just do it is you just build out to one side or build down because it's an

11:13.240 --> 11:15.400
infinite canvas.

11:15.460 --> 11:21.480
So what I could do is if I wanted to copy everything here I going to select everything was shift key.

11:23.670 --> 11:24.430
OK.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.960
And then I can copy it just duplicate everything.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.990
Now I have another one.

11:31.500 --> 11:37.540
One thing that I think is quite useful is this thing called the group where you can use in group and

11:37.570 --> 11:38.270
ungroup.

11:38.470 --> 11:42.220
So say I want all three of these things.

11:42.220 --> 11:46.840
I made the iPhone the alert message and the keyboard to be associated together.

11:46.840 --> 11:52.600
What I might do is just lock them together so that I don't have to constantly hit shift and click every

11:52.600 --> 11:57.130
single thing I can just group them together and see how the color change happened.

11:57.130 --> 11:59.400
So now I can exit out.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.320
I don't need to select it.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.050
Oh sorry.

12:05.250 --> 12:09.430
Exit out with clicking outside the canvas click it.

12:09.430 --> 12:11.800
And look now I can move the whole thing.

12:11.840 --> 12:12.790
That's because here.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.430
I can only move one thing.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.980
One thing that you can do.

12:17.980 --> 12:22.650
And guys keep in mind you really don't need to make this look to the TV.

12:22.660 --> 12:26.290
Perfect when you make a balsamic wireframe.

12:26.560 --> 12:33.460
What I like to do is I'll make arrows and we typically with erro you call it a shape use a geometric

12:33.460 --> 12:34.870
shape.

12:34.870 --> 12:39.120
So it starts out as a circle.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.070
Here again is one way to do it.

12:43.940 --> 12:48.920
All I can do like that and I think that looks kind of cool because what you do is you can look at it

12:48.920 --> 12:53.450
and go oh first screen second screen right.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.990
Or obviously you can just do it with an icon

12:59.920 --> 13:04.120
or an icon over and let's make an arrow out of it.

13:05.720 --> 13:13.250
Search for arrow shows me direction or direction or what you want to make that larger Go sell on it

13:13.730 --> 13:14.400
go.

13:14.510 --> 13:16.050
Now you can't miss it.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.900
OK.

13:18.530 --> 13:25.910
That is I mean Bosnak is like saying very simple so there's not a ton of explanation that needs to go

13:25.910 --> 13:26.640
with this.

13:26.810 --> 13:32.280
And you might be looking at this and saying wow it is really basic How am I supposed to make a web site.

13:32.300 --> 13:36.920
And it you know at first it is a little bit complicated but you'll notice the more and more you play

13:36.920 --> 13:37.190
with it.

13:37.190 --> 13:39.980
It really does have everything you want covered.

13:40.310 --> 13:46.540
So to prove my point I can go ahead and make a web site.

13:46.670 --> 13:53.780
I'm going to make a copy of YouTube and YouTube when I speak for you too I'm not talking on the home

13:53.780 --> 13:58.340
page and talking about what the screen looks like when you're actually viewing a sub page.

13:58.340 --> 14:05.750
So I would go to all the browser window and the browser window I can type in you too.

14:06.990 --> 14:10.310
And there you go see it shows it up in YouTube.

14:10.890 --> 14:12.350
It's expand the size

14:15.500 --> 14:16.520
you know.

14:16.990 --> 14:25.050
OK now let's make something like where you'd watch the videos or as the media player in the media media

14:25.050 --> 14:30.420
is where you're going to insert pretty much anything you want like can be associated with images.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.320
There's a progress bar has a street map so pull this out and see it.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.390
That's like a Google Maps street map.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.370
It is a video player.

14:41.980 --> 14:47.600
To say that this is you know where you watch videos.

14:48.490 --> 14:51.740
So let's say we're going to put a search bar at the top.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.200
You can use the search bar.

14:53.390 --> 15:02.040
Let's just call the search box on the top where you would be searching for your videos.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.570
Let's see.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.030
I love this about bosonic.

15:06.070 --> 15:14.620
You can just use icons and they have a lot of the logos that you would commonly use like they have the

15:14.620 --> 15:21.880
Twitter logo and the Instagram logo and pretty much everything you'd want for the most common social

15:22.570 --> 15:28.130
platforms that like now am or logo YouTube.

15:28.190 --> 15:33.120
It's like that little section over here where you chose you suggested videos.

15:33.130 --> 15:39.820
Now what I would do for that concert thumbnails so use an image images just like boxes which is perfect

15:39.820 --> 15:41.280
for what we want.

15:41.350 --> 15:46.560
Just call it videos of it and our developer graphic designer knows what that is.

15:46.720 --> 15:56.380
Now with Image placeholders what you can do is you can add borders and you can actually upload images

15:56.440 --> 16:03.690
and insert them into balsamic So you do as you just double tap it or browse for a file.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.840
Everybody loves cats.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.890
So we use cats.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.340
This is a cool feature I like.

16:07.410 --> 16:08.910
You can just sketch it.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.260
So if I don't get it it's gonna insert this image with all color.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.760
You know look kind of weird the whole black and white thing going on so I'll just say sketch it.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.870
I say load now.

16:18.940 --> 16:19.790
There goes.

16:19.800 --> 16:25.360
Now let's try to put it back into the size that you'd expect.

16:25.580 --> 16:26.880
And so it looks weird.

16:26.890 --> 16:30.200
Now we want to put let's put a border on it and it'll look better.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.110
There you.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.700
Now looks kind of like one of those videos you'd have suggested to you.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.520
Now it's out the text that you would go next to it.

16:38.860 --> 16:46.040
So we had no idea what the string string of tax put it as the title

16:49.890 --> 16:53.790
of Cananea super super original.

16:54.120 --> 16:59.600
And since it's the title I want to make it bold it's increased the size.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.120
So we put

17:03.960 --> 17:07.110
it now you can use your keyboard to to move things around.

17:07.110 --> 17:15.250
So if I just go left it's going to be one pixel left right up or down point and then right below that.

17:15.390 --> 17:16.910
See now for want of a text right below it.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.070
I want to do is it duplicate.

17:19.500 --> 17:24.400
Put it right below it and change it.

17:24.710 --> 17:34.740
It's called by I'll just call it the cat person person because everybody knows a cat person but nobody

17:34.740 --> 17:37.450
knows a cat person person.

17:37.630 --> 17:39.990
The animal make it smaller.

17:41.610 --> 17:48.580
Remove the bolding and you go and lets put a view counter.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.060
That's usually just a number.

17:53.090 --> 17:57.110
So let's say a million people watch this video.

17:57.790 --> 18:02.730
And that is a little bit smaller.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.360
I think it's pretty believable.

18:04.390 --> 18:08.830
So what I'm going to do is I want to create this little grouping and I want to make it go all the way

18:08.830 --> 18:12.250
down the screen which is typically what you see in YouTube.

18:12.530 --> 18:16.730
So we do it in a group these together.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.840
Very We do group we group.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.150
Now they're together.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.440
Now when I copy my group and even exit out it doesn't really matter.

18:26.450 --> 18:36.770
Coffee my group blog you match the grades up and you go there are suggested videos.

18:37.010 --> 18:43.350
Now maybe I wanted to put a container around that something light and just go to shape again.

18:44.970 --> 18:46.210
How a shape.

18:46.310 --> 18:51.490
I am just going to pick a rectangle right here right here.

18:54.090 --> 18:58.030
I want to expand it over to notice so it covered it.

18:58.030 --> 19:02.970
Now they bosonic has a layering kind of like Photoshop.

19:03.020 --> 19:05.610
You use Photoshop for it has layers.

19:05.620 --> 19:12.760
The way that you would want this to fade to the back is you would use this little subgroup.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.450
This will send it back one.

19:14.510 --> 19:18.110
This will send it all the way to the back so this will be the bottom of your.

19:18.130 --> 19:20.680
Imagine this is kind of like paper laying on top of each other.

19:20.710 --> 19:23.040
This would be the bottom piece of paper you could this.

19:23.170 --> 19:27.410
If you cook this it's going to bring all the way to the top so it's going to cover anything behind it.

19:27.430 --> 19:28.710
I just want to send it back.

19:28.890 --> 19:31.910
Intel it's behind the cat videos.

19:33.810 --> 19:39.710
But it's in front of the actual background that we established.
