00:05.730 --> 00:08.050
Welcome back to the course.

00:08.160 --> 00:14.130
So in this lecture this is actually going to be the beginning of where we start prototyping.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.830
Now this is of course different than the previous section where we are wireframe.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.460
Those are all low fidelity.

00:19.460 --> 00:26.130
Those are all used just to basically show off structure and to show off roughly what goes in what area

00:26.370 --> 00:27.550
what it should look like.

00:27.630 --> 00:31.410
And those are primarily used for giving them to developers or give them to designers.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.230
Now now we're going to do is we're going to get into prototyping.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.510
Prototypes are much more interactive.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.300
They're much more real looking and they're much more high fidelity.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.170
So in order to show you easily what this is like.

00:44.250 --> 00:49.860
I've actually brought in a project that we at Sprint could use and I think it's a good example because

00:51.180 --> 00:53.910
it's an internal project that we decided to build.

00:54.210 --> 00:59.490
And it's very helpful to see because we have it all the way from the beginning all the way to the end

00:59.490 --> 01:01.800
and it's something that we're currently developing.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.530
But I can show you all of the documentation that we've built for it.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.820
And then I can use that as an example to go into Paducah and then show you how if I wanted to create

01:11.820 --> 01:17.350
a prototype I could do that and then deploy it to whatever device that and putting it into.

01:17.400 --> 01:24.870
So we called it the marketing access panel and what the idea behind this project was was that we wanted

01:24.870 --> 01:32.610
to create a web portal where designers or developers or really anyone who works with web projects can

01:32.640 --> 01:40.350
show off their portfolio but do it in a simpler easier way then a lot of the things that are available

01:40.350 --> 01:40.890
out there.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.560
Now a lot of people use like core a lot.

01:44.220 --> 01:51.210
I might be pronouncing that wrong or dribble or a lot of like be Hanse is very popular with designers.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.360
Now those all have different angles they are going for.

01:54.450 --> 02:01.800
We wanted to create something that was ideal for studios specifically we wanted to go after people who

02:02.400 --> 02:10.470
worked in a team had large projects and wanted to be able to do case studies on their individual portfolio

02:10.530 --> 02:11.370
items.

02:11.370 --> 02:15.450
Now that's obviously different than some people what they do is they'll just literally take whatever

02:15.450 --> 02:17.780
they design or they develop throw it up.

02:18.020 --> 02:22.740
You know you see it and they just show you images maybe the couple senses of text that's not useful

02:23.370 --> 02:27.000
for a large group of creatives out there.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.780
And so we decided that maybe you know why don't we try something out instead.

02:31.080 --> 02:36.080
So here is actually the wireframe of the front page.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.660
Now I can explain a little bit what's going on over here.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.050
Now I built this in balsamic.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.310
We didn't actually use Pinocchio.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.950
This is something we switched to just recently.

02:44.070 --> 02:47.370
But here you can see it's really not very complicated.

02:47.370 --> 02:52.440
The idea behind this was that when you land on the Web site you have a top bar at the top where you

02:52.440 --> 02:57.270
could search through someone's project logo would be something that's selectable.

02:57.270 --> 03:02.700
Whoever is creating this portfolio could put whatever they want up here their name their logo whatever

03:03.120 --> 03:10.160
and then they could tag individual sections within their portfolio and use those categories button over

03:10.170 --> 03:15.510
here I just put circles and the idea behind the circles was that you would upload an image that represents

03:15.600 --> 03:20.720
your portfolio item and this system would automatically put that into a circle and display it here.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.190
And then here was a way that they could click a button and change the way that it's organized.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.580
Now over here we had notes and these are the things that we were just thinking about as we put it together

03:30.060 --> 03:36.400
some design notes some explanation of functionality that otherwise was not kind of obvious.

03:37.080 --> 03:41.700
And so like right here what we can see is this would be what happened after you click this button right

03:41.700 --> 03:48.790
here once you click that button it would put you into a line item list out all of your portfolios.

03:48.890 --> 03:54.360
So then all of a sudden you know the person who setting this would pick what the ranking is and be able

03:54.360 --> 03:57.260
to put a subtitle for each one.

03:57.300 --> 04:02.670
So just scrolling through this is the idea that after you click on one of these circles it would rotate

04:02.970 --> 04:04.930
over to the top left corner.

04:05.100 --> 04:11.670
And then you would have this standard static design where you could display a cover image a title subtitle

04:11.730 --> 04:18.210
some text some basic statistics and then you could just scroll all the way down where you could do kind

04:18.210 --> 04:23.670
of popular case study techniques where you would say here's a quote here's the person who said the quote

04:23.850 --> 04:25.340
here's another screenshot.

04:25.350 --> 04:28.830
Here are some like process screenshots here.

04:28.930 --> 04:33.960
You know more process screen shots and then here's something like this is what we did for the client.

04:33.960 --> 04:38.730
So you would list all your items have another screen shot and this would link directly to the site.

04:38.730 --> 04:39.540
Very simple.

04:39.540 --> 04:43.130
I mean this is quite literally a two page design.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.390
We wanted it to never have to load a separate page so quite literally you'd see dots you click on the

04:48.390 --> 04:53.350
dot it pops open if you want to get to this you click out of it it goes right back.

04:53.670 --> 04:58.170
Now I've been right here is what I did as I just listed out the functionality as I was thinking about

04:58.170 --> 05:01.640
it of what I thought people would need when they were creating this.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.810
So we just kind of stuck together all those things we would need.

05:04.800 --> 05:10.160
So literally all we did is we went up and found these sections up here and then said OK while the user

05:10.160 --> 05:15.540
is going to find some way to input this and like pick this image pick this image picks these list items.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.160
So this is kind of what we came up with.

05:18.350 --> 05:24.470
And then down here it was a separate design that we created separately and then we ended up getting

05:24.470 --> 05:27.050
both in design and we picked which ones we like better.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.820
This was just kind of a concept where you might have a tag bubble where you took a tag and it presents

05:31.820 --> 05:36.440
all the tags that the user has identified you click it and then it gets rid of some of the circles and

05:36.440 --> 05:38.580
shows them something else.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.730
I know I'll show you at the back end looked like really quickly.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.650
So this is the back end back it was a little bit more complicated.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.890
So what we decided to do was make it look really like a portal and at all times have a preview button

05:51.890 --> 05:57.890
up here so as I was inputting my information about my portfolio I could always just click here and preview

05:57.890 --> 06:01.130
so I can see what it looks like as I'm building it in real time.

06:01.190 --> 06:05.630
Over here you would add projects so I would add a project and I would add something here and list out

06:05.630 --> 06:11.360
the name set my settings over here and then I think the idea behind this was that we were going to make

06:11.360 --> 06:15.460
this all free and it would be kind of like a Legion.

06:15.460 --> 06:19.720
And so here obviously is how we would see each form looking.

06:19.730 --> 06:22.790
And we tried to make it as simple as possible very conversational.

06:22.790 --> 06:28.550
Here's how you would create a project Picketts positioning you'd upload your logo etc. etc..

06:28.820 --> 06:35.500
And here's where they would go and insert all the information that we just previously saw here is somewhere

06:35.510 --> 06:40.850
or you take clicked your settings and you do universal changes where you can change your logo change

06:40.850 --> 06:46.340
your background change the for like your email pick your fonts things like that.

06:46.400 --> 06:51.270
Some of these are aspirational so tightly surefooted to put them in but we put it that way.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.260
So those were the low fidelity wireframe.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.270
That's what they would look like.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.810
Now I'll show you what it actually came out looking like.

06:59.970 --> 07:02.270
OK so we can take a look here.

07:02.450 --> 07:06.130
What the final designs ended up looking like.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.520
I'll show you what the front page looks like.

07:08.960 --> 07:16.890
So this is what our designers came back with and this is just the web version.

07:17.630 --> 07:22.420
So here was the stack version that we saw previously at Stax.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.100
Each individual item.

07:25.630 --> 07:29.960
And so I can show you what the end kind of the finished designs look like.

07:29.970 --> 07:32.330
So this would be the view.

07:32.670 --> 07:34.100
Now you can see a little bit better.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.800
What we are talking about here would be the logo.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.630
Here's their categories.

07:38.630 --> 07:42.180
Some of these are already designed such that it looks like you've already touched them.

07:42.360 --> 07:47.440
And this is the idea behind what each individual portfolio item would look like.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.890
Then there's a contact button at the bottom.

07:50.030 --> 07:54.610
All show you quickly what the back end looks like.

07:55.890 --> 07:57.950
So this would be the back end.

07:58.190 --> 08:04.080
So it looks like over here right at the project here is where you contact us preview Web site et cetera

08:04.080 --> 08:05.560
et cetera.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.520
And so this pretty much is ready for programming.

08:10.650 --> 08:17.160
Now if you didn't want to go all the way and start spending big money to build it or taking a lot of

08:17.160 --> 08:21.090
time to build yourself then you'd go into the prototyping phase.

08:21.120 --> 08:28.470
We went ahead and got a lot of separate sections developed because it will make the prototype look a

08:28.470 --> 08:29.040
lot better.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.160
So for instance we use walk through screens.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.150
So the first time someone logs onto the screen they can see things like this.

08:35.150 --> 08:41.270
It directs them where to go how things work and you'd be amazed how much we can simulate in POKO.

08:41.280 --> 08:46.650
We also went ahead and made mobile versions and I'll show you how to do that in this section how we

08:46.650 --> 08:48.120
can make mobile section.

08:48.120 --> 08:54.420
So for instance this would be the back end panel where you upload all your information.

08:54.420 --> 08:59.010
Now whether or not you would want to do all of this in Mobile that's a decision you probably would have

08:59.010 --> 09:00.290
made previously.

09:00.390 --> 09:06.060
We decided that we wanted it to work on mobile and so we designed this kind of section for it up here

09:06.060 --> 09:11.700
you can tell this is actually you just swipe through to go to individual projects and then you upload

09:11.700 --> 09:14.370
it just kind of like you would.

09:14.670 --> 09:14.940
Yeah.

09:14.940 --> 09:18.090
So we made a lot of secondary screens.

09:18.090 --> 09:22.860
We put together quite a bit of everything we could think of.

09:23.590 --> 09:30.040
This is the page that you would see on the front end to where I were if you were to click on a project.

09:30.100 --> 09:35.940
So here we could see you know here's your cover photo your text description individual items etc. etc..

09:35.980 --> 09:36.900
So all right.

09:36.910 --> 09:41.740
So follow along in the section and I'm going to show you how you can take these designs that we've created

09:41.980 --> 09:46.250
put them into POKO and start adding some interactivity So in the next lecture.
