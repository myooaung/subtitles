00:10.730 --> 00:15.500
You guys all come back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about a strategy called adding

00:15.630 --> 00:22.680
keywords or what we call Chirs into your project descriptions and into your specifications.

00:22.730 --> 00:29.850
Now right off the bat I just kind of made up the word when I say Chirs I use this quite frequently.

00:30.140 --> 00:32.180
So it's much easier just to call it something.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.490
So that's kind of the nickname I've given it.

00:34.490 --> 00:39.590
It doesn't necessarily have to be key words but it could be key phrases are key questions.

00:39.620 --> 00:43.730
Now what are the biggest problems that you'll have when you're going over a list of people and you're

00:43.730 --> 00:50.060
trying to determine who you should give the project to is that you have a mass of people that may or

00:50.060 --> 00:56.000
may not have written a template response and you don't know if they've read read the entirety of the

00:56.000 --> 00:57.150
project description.

00:57.170 --> 01:02.480
That's obviously a problem because you don't want them to be bidding on something that they haven't

01:02.480 --> 01:03.700
actually thought about.

01:03.710 --> 01:08.540
You also don't want them to be signing up saying they can do something if they haven't tried and actually

01:08.990 --> 01:13.880
comprehended every section of what needs to be done that's obviously going to set you up for problems

01:13.880 --> 01:14.450
down the road.

01:14.450 --> 01:21.170
A lot of times freelancers bid on 10 projects not realizing that they can't actually fulfill four of

01:21.170 --> 01:21.530
them.

01:21.530 --> 01:26.450
Similarly a lot of times freelancers just bid based on what other people say and if they ever win the

01:26.450 --> 01:32.210
project then what ends up happening is they either try to renegotiate the price or they might quit halfway.

01:32.210 --> 01:34.460
So that's a risk you want to avoid.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.890
So to get around that what you can do is you can add to your questions and they're very similar to like

01:39.890 --> 01:47.090
screener questions that we saw an up work on uptick we saw that they asked a question up front and the

01:47.090 --> 01:48.830
person has to answer to even bid.

01:48.830 --> 01:51.500
But this is actually going a little bit farther than that.

01:51.500 --> 01:59.330
So a key question is when you add a question or you add some kind of key instruction inside of the project

01:59.330 --> 02:03.970
description that only someone who read the project description would actually be able to see.

02:03.980 --> 02:11.690
So to give you an example you might say in your project description you know in your bid please say

02:11.690 --> 02:12.940
this phrase.

02:13.070 --> 02:19.010
That's a common one I've seen what they're basically trying to do is very quickly identify who has read

02:19.010 --> 02:20.400
and who has not.

02:20.420 --> 02:27.260
Now we don't use that technique because freelancers and freelance firms they can see each other's bids.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.730
And so if they put that at the top of their message ends up happening is if a lot of people seeing that

02:32.000 --> 02:37.880
and posting it and it's also gotten to a point where that technique has become so popular that groups

02:37.880 --> 02:43.070
actually kind of anticipate that so they'll look into other people's bids to see if they can steal that.

02:43.070 --> 02:49.640
So I'm going to give you some strategies for adding in key questions adding in these little snippets

02:49.640 --> 02:53.350
that basically test to see whether or not the freelancer has read the entire description.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.670
My favorite technique is probably the simplest what I want you to do is basically take your project

02:58.970 --> 03:01.280
and divide it out into sections.

03:01.280 --> 03:06.050
So it's pretty easy honestly if you have a description in your ascriptions two pages long just figure

03:06.050 --> 03:12.830
out where you're shifting from one side of your application or one side of your work and just divide

03:12.830 --> 03:18.410
it out put a section to it and then what you want to do is put every single section ask a question and

03:18.440 --> 03:23.660
ask them to say Give me an estimate for how long they'll take to get this section done.

03:23.660 --> 03:28.370
Now traditionally what you do is you put one big project description and then you ask them to give you

03:28.370 --> 03:29.700
an estimate based on that.

03:29.840 --> 03:35.660
But what you can do is just cut in half thirds or fourths and say Give me an estimate for each section.

03:35.660 --> 03:40.190
Now if the person is paying attention they should be able to do this very very easily.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.290
It shouldn't be that hard.

03:42.320 --> 03:47.360
Some of them might struggle with it a little bit because sections can be interrelated but you just want

03:47.360 --> 03:50.490
to make sure that they at least give it an attempt towards it.

03:50.510 --> 03:55.940
And as we talk about in a separate lecture it's always a good idea to ask for a time not money don't

03:55.940 --> 03:58.800
say estimate the cost of a section.

03:58.850 --> 04:03.970
Ask them how many hours it will take and we'll explain later in the course why that's important.

04:03.980 --> 04:08.600
Another option what you can do is at the very beginning of your project description or within your specification

04:08.600 --> 04:11.660
sheet ask them to give you two pieces of information.

04:11.660 --> 04:17.180
So essentially what you're doing is emulating the screener questions that we saw in up work and then

04:17.180 --> 04:21.680
kind of inputting that into your project description itself.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.410
So what you could do is you could just ask them say show me a portfolio item that is similar to this

04:27.410 --> 04:34.910
project tell me what your availability is something that is maybe specific maybe generic but it's something

04:34.910 --> 04:40.670
that if they don't respond with that information you know that they're not someone who's has like strong

04:40.670 --> 04:46.160
attention to detail and they clearly might have glossed over your project description.

04:46.160 --> 04:52.340
Another strategy is within your project description if you have a section that might be a little bit

04:52.340 --> 04:58.880
more difficult or could be done in multiple ways what you can do is you can say to the freelancer in

04:58.880 --> 05:02.170
the project description how would you address this.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.870
How would you build this.

05:04.010 --> 05:06.450
What thoughts do you have on this.

05:06.710 --> 05:12.700
And then what you can do is that you can look through the project easels and see who exactly actually

05:12.700 --> 05:17.170
answered the question and this is helpful because it's also a test to see how thoughtful and how experienced

05:17.200 --> 05:21.970
they are thoughtful people will actually give you multiple options or they'll just straight up tell

05:21.970 --> 05:26.530
you I'm not entirely sure but when I do do the project I'll research it and I'm confident I'd find an

05:26.530 --> 05:27.120
answer.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.790
That's a perfectly acceptable answer because you have to understand these people are bidding on lots

05:30.790 --> 05:31.660
of projects.

05:31.780 --> 05:36.430
They don't want to waste their time doing the research up front for a project they're not going to get.

05:36.460 --> 05:43.420
Of course that does have mixed results obviously don't pick a PR technique that is too obscure or too

05:43.420 --> 05:46.780
time intensive because it might be the case that no one does it.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.590
That didn't exactly help you then.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.750
So if you're doing a big project and people are going to spend more time up front in their proposals

05:52.900 --> 05:54.160
you can try that technique.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.930
This is a short project low budget probably not worth doing.

05:57.940 --> 06:03.790
The last technique I like to use is a very generic easy one what you can do at the very end of your

06:03.790 --> 06:11.170
project description is just ask them and say What do you think of the project that is it all that does

06:11.170 --> 06:17.680
is it ask them to step back a little bit not speak specifically about what they're building but actually

06:17.680 --> 06:19.390
give you a thought about it.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.240
Now do not expect that answer to be poetic.

06:23.290 --> 06:29.830
Don't exactly expect an answer that you would hear from a co-founder or a business partner or even like

06:29.830 --> 06:31.390
a consultant.

06:31.390 --> 06:35.540
There's a good chance that they'll just say there that whatever your idea is it's great.

06:35.650 --> 06:39.700
And obviously because they don't want insult you or make it sound like they're not interested in the

06:39.700 --> 06:43.450
project but a lot of times you can tell if people do have genuine interest.

06:43.450 --> 06:47.500
The point here is again just a test of whether or not they're thinking about it whether or not they've

06:47.500 --> 06:54.610
read that and then to get some kind of an idea of how articulate how dynamic and again how thoughtful

06:54.610 --> 06:55.270
they are.

06:55.270 --> 07:01.690
So those are good techniques for putting in career questions and remember key questions are the little

07:01.690 --> 07:07.720
snippets little Easter eggs you hide to see who exactly read your description.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.280
It's really helpful because then when you just glance over all your projects you can very easily figure

07:12.280 --> 07:16.930
out the ones you did not answer your question correctly didn't see it and you can remove them from the

07:16.930 --> 07:17.240
list.

07:17.260 --> 07:23.110
That way you can start whittling it down from say you know 40 people down to eight or nine or something

07:23.110 --> 07:25.280
like that something where it's now manageable.

07:25.300 --> 07:29.560
All right guys try out these techniques and your own projects if you have some other suggestions for

07:29.560 --> 07:41.910
what's worked for you post in the group discussion otherwise I'll see you in the next lecture.
