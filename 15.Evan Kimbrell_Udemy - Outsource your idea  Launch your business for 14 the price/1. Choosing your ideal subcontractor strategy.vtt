00:10.730 --> 00:14.640
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about your subcontracting

00:14.880 --> 00:19.470
strategy and we're going to talk a little bit about what's the best path for you.

00:19.470 --> 00:25.740
So before you start your journey of putting together a killer team and finally signing your first multimillion

00:25.740 --> 00:30.200
dollar contract you need to sit down and have a little bit of a think about what you're subcontracting

00:30.200 --> 00:31.260
strategy is going to be.

00:31.260 --> 00:38.190
So let me give you a little bit of transparency about how freelancers and contractors are typically

00:38.190 --> 00:38.920
divided up.

00:38.940 --> 00:44.040
Now it's really helpful before you go and look for a subcontractor to know what you're going to expect

00:44.310 --> 00:46.320
and to know exactly what you're looking for.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.150
Now first off you're going to need to make a decision about price and language.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.740
Now the reason why I say those together is because they're almost always related to each other.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.110
There are some exceptions of course.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.290
Now some contractors are going to be from countries you've never heard of and some contractors they're

01:01.290 --> 01:03.200
going to be from probably down the street.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.230
There's a big gap when we're talking about distance.

01:06.270 --> 01:12.510
Now the same time some of them will be able to effectively communicate and communicate fluidly and other

01:12.510 --> 01:17.640
ones are going to sound probably like drunk robots really hard to understand sometimes they speak like

01:17.920 --> 01:22.390
remember Max speak that old software program you would use in elementary school.

01:22.410 --> 01:28.440
Now a contractor with bad communication skills and an inconvenient time zone they're probably going

01:28.440 --> 01:29.730
to be a lot cheaper.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.620
Now obviously there's exceptions to this.

01:31.620 --> 01:36.680
There are still expensive areas that have terrible language skills and terrible time zones.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.080
But this is just a generalization.

01:38.100 --> 01:43.860
Now a fluent English speaker who lives in the same exact time zone as you almost sometimes the same

01:43.860 --> 01:46.270
city they're obviously going to be a lot more expensive.

01:46.320 --> 01:53.670
Now how this relates to your business is that each type of contractor can dramatically change the dynamic

01:53.970 --> 01:58.170
of how you deliver projects how you pitch your projects and how you find clients.

01:58.200 --> 02:04.290
Now an expensive articulate contractor they're probably going to deliver much higher quality work but

02:04.290 --> 02:06.400
they're also going to be considerably more expensive.

02:06.420 --> 02:12.240
Now that for you means that you're gonna have to push higher prices to your clients and because your

02:12.240 --> 02:18.180
rates are higher now all of a sudden your clients are going to expect a considerably higher standard

02:18.180 --> 02:19.580
of project quality.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.970
So in a lot of cases it can actually cancel itself out.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.780
You charge more but the same time your clients ask for a lot more.

02:27.830 --> 02:33.130
Now in this scenario you might have to cut your margins especially at the very beginning.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.510
So if you go this route.

02:34.560 --> 02:40.650
The key here is going to be your ability to land higher paying contracts that are also probably longer

02:40.650 --> 02:47.760
term or you need to plan on having a strategy of using higher paying contractors but also having access

02:47.760 --> 02:53.870
to other experts that you can bring in to really put that top polish on your products.

02:53.940 --> 02:58.430
Now a cheaper lower cost contractor with poor English skills.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.740
That means that you're going to have to compensate upfront with more effort from your end.

03:02.880 --> 03:08.760
And also you might have to deal with lower product quality but in this scenario your margins are always

03:08.760 --> 03:10.110
going to be a lot healthier.

03:10.140 --> 03:13.290
And that allows you the option to undercut other providers.

03:13.290 --> 03:19.110
So the key to this scenario is if you pick a lower cost option someone who is not as great at communicating

03:19.140 --> 03:22.830
or explaining what they're doing or what needs to be done.

03:22.860 --> 03:29.100
The key here is going to be whether or not you can manage them effectively enough to get a good product

03:29.370 --> 03:33.890
because if you can do that then you're price to quality ratio is going to be fantastic.

03:33.900 --> 03:40.090
Now in the scenario of a more articulate more qualified contractor is more expensive you're not going

03:40.090 --> 03:43.980
to have to spend as much time with them which means you can spend more time on other things.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.760
Now a low cost contractor it's going to be the opposite.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.320
You're going to spend more time on project management.

03:49.350 --> 03:53.360
So which one you want to go if you want to focus more on sales.

03:53.400 --> 03:58.800
And then just knowing that your project is more or less covered or do you spend more time on project

03:58.800 --> 04:02.760
management knowing that at the end of the day you make more money per project.

04:02.760 --> 04:07.440
Now here's the key distinction for me and this is what I always use when making the decision or consulting

04:07.440 --> 04:09.290
someone on how to make this decision.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.700
Think about yourself and think about your experience.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.310
Do you have a lot of experience working with contractors.

04:14.340 --> 04:17.610
Do you have a lot of experience working with distributed teams.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.110
Do you speak another language potentially.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.700
Do you have any experience being a project manager.

04:22.710 --> 04:27.390
How much experience do you have in web development and web development projects.

04:27.450 --> 04:32.070
If you have a lot of experience and answer yes to a lot of the questions I just asked you then you're

04:32.070 --> 04:36.360
a very good candidate for someone who can use the low cost high margin option.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.790
Now if you're under developed in this kind of area then it might make more sense for you to focus on

04:41.790 --> 04:48.480
higher paid contractors who can deal with more have more autonomy and you focus more on sales.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.620
So now one other division that you need to be aware of and you need to make a decision about is whether

04:52.620 --> 04:56.870
or not you hire a freelancer or a firm an individual or company.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.830
Now if you're coming from my outsourcing course you know that we covered this like to death but for

05:01.830 --> 05:03.310
this course I'm just going to simplify it.

05:03.330 --> 05:07.380
So one firms come with what are called management layers.

05:07.380 --> 05:13.050
This provides transparency and this provides a counter ability for your project it also offloads the

05:13.050 --> 05:19.080
work from you on to them when it comes to day to day management because of this they're much less likely

05:19.080 --> 05:20.570
to disappear.

05:20.880 --> 05:26.160
They're much less likely to run into problems and if they do run into problems they're more capable

05:26.160 --> 05:29.340
of solving it on their own before pulling you into the project.

05:29.340 --> 05:34.590
Now on the flip side they come at a much higher price tag because you're not just paying for your developer

05:34.590 --> 05:39.540
you're also paying for the project manager or whoever ends up managing them and also firms always have

05:39.540 --> 05:40.530
a profit line.

05:40.530 --> 05:43.080
Also keep in mind that firms are slower to move.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.780
They have a lot more people in the organization.

05:45.810 --> 05:50.140
They can't just drop everything and pick up whatever you need at this moment that you want it now.

05:50.160 --> 05:55.120
Individuals are going to be considerably cheaper and considerably more flexible.

05:55.260 --> 06:00.040
However you are the last line of defense in case anything goes wrong.

06:00.150 --> 06:03.790
They get sick or any problem arises.

06:03.870 --> 06:07.140
They're going to require a lot more management time from you.

06:07.140 --> 06:11.680
So again when considering this division it really just comes down to experience.

06:11.700 --> 06:17.730
Now if you're confident you can turn a low cost freelancer or a contractor into high quality work and

06:17.730 --> 06:23.280
you know you have experience and you know you kind of had your stripes in this field then you definitely

06:23.280 --> 06:25.680
can go for an outsourced freelancer.

06:25.680 --> 06:31.170
Now if you're new to this and you want to focus a little bit more on the sales the branding the marketing

06:31.690 --> 06:35.570
the promotion pretty much everything else that's involved in running a web development business.

06:35.730 --> 06:42.280
Then you might want to choose higher paid more capable better communicating freelancers.

06:42.300 --> 06:47.160
You also probably want to lean towards a firm because you will benefit the most from having that management

06:47.160 --> 06:48.370
layer that we talked about.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.600
You might want to also focus on someone who has similar time zones to you.

06:51.620 --> 06:57.090
That's going to allow you to communicate more effectively and not have this like in-between time where

06:57.090 --> 06:59.020
you can't communicate with your contractor.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.350
Now you don't always have to stay this way over time as you get more experience working with your web

07:03.360 --> 07:03.920
projects.

07:03.930 --> 07:09.180
You can transition into working with individuals and working with people who are in different time zones

07:09.180 --> 07:12.650
in different countries and then you can kind of get the best of both worlds.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.250
But at the beginning it's really helpful to know which one you should go for now.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.770
And obviously there are in-between options you just need to understand.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.010
It's kind of like a spectrum right.

07:23.010 --> 07:27.330
Certain people are better for using firm certain people are better for freelancers certain people or

07:27.330 --> 07:33.090
better for outsource labor and certain people are better for in in country near the same time zone types

07:33.090 --> 07:34.010
of contractors.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.790
Obviously the place where you create the most value for your client is when you're picking subcontractors

07:38.790 --> 07:42.060
and you look for what other people call like the diamond in the rough.

07:42.060 --> 07:46.680
And what that basically means is you look for and this is gets much easier as you have more experience.

07:46.680 --> 07:52.320
You look for people where their price compared to their communication buildings compared to their capabilities

07:52.870 --> 07:54.300
something is just off.

07:54.310 --> 07:57.410
And so a lot of times you look for people who are undervalued.

07:57.570 --> 08:02.220
They're cheaper compared to how good they are or they're really good compared to how cheap they are

08:02.400 --> 08:04.290
over time with enough experience.

08:04.290 --> 08:09.870
You can start to mix and match and you can create whatever funky configuration you can at the beginning

08:09.870 --> 08:10.550
though it's easier.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.630
Think of it kind of in this one two solution.

08:12.630 --> 08:22.720
All right guys I'll see you the next lecture.
