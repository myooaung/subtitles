WEBVTT

00:05.040 --> 00:11.850
It and so that's roughly the way you do it this is doable.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.890
Hopefully you have better handwriting than I do.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.580
So people can read it later.

00:16.580 --> 00:20.290
One thing I do like to do that is label what's my scene arcs and I really draw.

00:20.300 --> 00:32.380
So if you say your browser is browsers by then after this point it's literally kind of up to you.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.350
You know I was doing a landing page then maybe I could just do as I would probably go look at some other

00:38.350 --> 00:40.640
landing pages see what I liked about them.

00:40.750 --> 00:45.630
See roughly kind of the format that I want to remember you're just looking for content layout.

00:45.760 --> 00:52.790
So really like maybe what I put here is another why I got worry of personality doesn't really matter.

00:52.810 --> 00:59.100
Is just a sketch that I play something like you know testimonials.

01:00.670 --> 01:04.560
And then roughly you know again I'm just trying to think of the format here.

01:04.570 --> 01:08.070
So maybe it's like a face in a bubble.

01:08.070 --> 01:15.920
Now we have a call out box and bow and call off.

01:16.050 --> 01:19.460
And then Maidie the boxes.

01:19.770 --> 01:30.030
Seymour nightstands put a person's face right here Rotem label the stuff and then you know scribbles

01:30.040 --> 01:35.330
girls from all.

01:35.780 --> 01:41.150
Now keep in mind if you get to a war scroll on landing page obviously you don't draw this in the same

01:41.150 --> 01:44.760
exact format for your text and it's all the way down.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.580
But that's really the basics of it.

01:47.630 --> 01:52.760
Anything you want put it on the page don't worry about whether it follows some design convention.

01:52.850 --> 01:58.850
If you can't figure out how to look to lay out the order you just look at our website.

01:58.850 --> 02:04.610
So if I wanted to use this I honestly could just look at any old software company I could even look

02:04.610 --> 02:07.050
at the template something for us and see how they do it.

02:07.130 --> 02:10.280
So it's this long 20 page so popular right now.

02:10.660 --> 02:16.610
OK so now do another example.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.060
So it works.

02:19.470 --> 02:26.050
I'm going to show you maybe you would like a web application page would work like this is always different

02:26.050 --> 02:30.400
because it's not on every single Kostner it comes to the page and I'm looking to buy at this point.

02:30.580 --> 02:36.630
So we might want to make it plainly different so it will start up the browser again all able at the

02:36.630 --> 02:43.470
top web app.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.840
I'll call this an interior page

02:52.060 --> 02:57.040
and then we can just use browser.

02:57.340 --> 03:00.120
It's not perfect but it's also a service that

03:12.600 --> 03:14.890
we're learning about.

03:14.940 --> 03:21.710
So with a web application page with application pages like say you are inside Google Analytics say your

03:22.260 --> 03:29.370
side your SVM rough draft homos whatever weirds gains point a lot of rich information a lot of facts

03:29.370 --> 03:34.230
and data etc. you're focused more navigation on what's all be pretty.

03:34.230 --> 03:37.610
So it's really up to you the way that you see your page being laid out.

03:37.620 --> 03:44.010
Now what I typically would like to do in this kind of case is to pull up my scope list out all the functions

03:44.010 --> 03:46.090
and then kind of ticket Gaslamp pages.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.080
I think there are.

03:47.130 --> 03:50.440
Now remember this is the sketch phase it literally matter how close you are.

03:50.440 --> 04:01.180
What I put is you know I would say like we have a main page and I think we have a page for part you

04:01.180 --> 04:07.110
know say analytics analytics set up howl

04:09.670 --> 04:14.690
payment preferences and so on.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.630
Now it just depends what you think doesn't matter.

04:16.630 --> 04:20.950
So you just come up with whatever you need on this and that scenario and then I kind of like to check

04:20.950 --> 04:27.040
them off as I go because I need to make sure that I have leaks to every single page that I'm anticipating.

04:27.250 --> 04:31.880
So here what I would just us you know meteorologist's out the logo up here.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.360
Never have too much branding.

04:34.780 --> 04:48.460
So maybe we have like the top navigation bar before things so we could say like you know what it looks

04:51.010 --> 04:52.800
like had a seizure.

04:52.800 --> 05:01.830
They call it these leaks and then say you have secondary changes like media analytics lithography analytics

05:02.400 --> 05:04.020
and all this.

05:04.740 --> 05:10.590
So we have analytics page maybe with this box right here you're looking in analytics and related graphs

05:10.590 --> 05:14.040
and whatnot you don't really need to even label out what the graphs are at this point.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.110
You know that blacks are going to be here.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.630
Now we get to the skeleton now.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.600
You are going to take this in or no ok.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.210
This is roughly the analytics page graphs in this area.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.460
Other different ways of modifying your work here.

05:24.660 --> 05:28.580
And then then you make a decision as to what the actual details are.

05:28.730 --> 05:35.990
But I would put get it here to Barga the Margraf Shereef

05:40.090 --> 05:44.440
and then you know I might put some drop down boxes here

05:46.890 --> 05:47.620
triangle.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.050
You couldn't notice are they felt there.

05:53.390 --> 05:54.550
It didn't really matter.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.670
Just keep ruffling in your head when you think you are displaying it here.

05:58.670 --> 06:02.770
Maybe they want to change it based on different information over here.

06:02.810 --> 06:10.270
Make a one and a box it's called Box may be like this snapshot snapshot.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.050
That gives them

06:17.520 --> 06:23.950
you know you give them a bunch of numbers and based on what they're doing over here because maybe that's

06:23.950 --> 06:29.890
helpful media are modifying things that give them some more information and maybe over here we have

06:29.890 --> 06:31.420
more filters.

06:31.660 --> 06:44.660
So the idea on radio buttons combo box and here we have some checkboxes and whatever it doesn't really

06:44.660 --> 06:45.300
matter.

06:45.470 --> 06:45.840
Yes.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.200
Again we're dealing with a way out.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.500
It's just a decision then you have to make whether or not you think this is clutter.

06:51.590 --> 06:56.750
How does the information that you're trying to display you know uses something that you thought you

06:56.750 --> 07:01.010
we're cool things you think you could put it in here that would be helpful if you were looking at a

07:01.010 --> 07:03.970
screen that is playing with information how would you like to work on it.

07:04.130 --> 07:08.480
Well here it's always nice to put filters social when you go on a web page.

07:08.560 --> 07:13.040
I do that and you know if you look at like eBay for instance they'll have say a page and then you'll

07:13.040 --> 07:15.400
have individual listings of items.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.190
Over here you have a filter box and you just go all the way down to a hundred other things you can filter

07:19.190 --> 07:21.970
by that's perfectly normal see it like that.

07:21.990 --> 07:27.570
And then on the left side of you have more filters so don't really worry about that.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.380
If you get the hang of it put it in and it just doesn't look right.

07:30.380 --> 07:36.080
Get rid of it scratch it do any new page you know and then maybe it'll be like some pie charts

07:40.340 --> 07:44.530
and then text right here or it etc etc. etc..

07:44.540 --> 07:47.450
So there you go that's how you did the sketch phase.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.780
That's how I would draw web application.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.110
Again the thing is you might be doing the thinking like oh I know what I'm doing.

07:54.110 --> 07:57.790
The point is to get something on the page once you have something on the page.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.940
This is so much easier to understand what does it look right what looks right and then you can start

08:01.940 --> 08:02.950
moving it around.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.250
See I just threw this together.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.230
Now firstling a web application and I would say I don't want that idea.

08:08.230 --> 08:14.240
Do you want this municipally digger I mean over here much easier to move pieces around 130 out of paper

08:14.420 --> 08:17.640
versus using a blank canvas to create whatever we want.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.180
OK so then I want to show you really quickly roughly how I would sketch out the mobile application happy

08:23.180 --> 08:25.070
hour app that we've been talking about.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.010
All right so we're at the top ones that are available.

08:27.020 --> 08:30.420
I'm just to take this and move it over and over and start working with it.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.440
So I get the iPhone 6 Plus.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.960
Remember this is the most efficient solution.

08:36.080 --> 08:41.510
Typically I don't like suggesting starting with the iPhone 6 because it's so normally large especially

08:41.510 --> 08:46.270
when we're talking of the plus but in this case I think it's perfectly fine.

08:46.370 --> 08:52.070
What I do know roughly is again I call Prisco Gothamist see what we have but for the most part of that

08:52.210 --> 08:56.810
building this idea in my head for the last 20 minutes I know I think it should look like.

08:56.810 --> 09:02.210
Now remember I wrote the scope document I said things like on the first screen I wanted to be a landing

09:02.210 --> 09:06.140
page the headline in the logo and I wanted to pick between today or tomorrow.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.100
So that's actually quite easy.

09:08.120 --> 09:12.780
You have this entire thing made for me so now it's just a question of putting my welcome text.

09:12.800 --> 09:25.860
So I would just say well chrome text and then maybe subtitle text and right here are going to do what's

09:25.860 --> 09:27.400
called a call to action.

09:29.250 --> 09:34.860
Call actually just me take his thumb do something that gets the user to do something say something back

09:36.800 --> 09:39.750
and then all of a T-bonds.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.390
So today tomorrow

09:47.880 --> 09:54.690
that rather than hear me go put the logo in a circle call it logo.

09:54.730 --> 09:58.320
Never tried to sketch out the logo here it's not really worth your time.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.350
I get rewarded for just putting rough things in structure.

10:01.490 --> 10:07.510
If you read this you have no idea what it is but to me it makes sense and it's a very good starting

10:07.510 --> 10:12.350
point to move on to the next section and get more defined and get more accurate with it.

10:12.360 --> 10:19.030
So let's just say draw a line from here if they can that they could today and let's say brings you to

10:19.030 --> 10:25.330
a page that shows you know your location make it grid

10:30.040 --> 10:40.370
now label these three on three two separate cetera so they know roughly what that looks like and try

10:40.370 --> 10:43.410
to make this look like anything you'd recognize.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.590
I'll just throw of hand somewhere.

10:45.640 --> 10:55.710
So like this might be the location and then I'd say your location and then maybe we'll just put a happy

10:55.710 --> 10:59.230
hour on location here over here over here.

10:59.430 --> 11:08.840
So bar one or two or three are hard to read right after about handwriting.

11:08.850 --> 11:11.810
Hopefully you do it to spend more time on your hand writing.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.430
But you don't go through this.

11:14.720 --> 11:21.480
And then an extreme let's say old dryer from here and you've got to do it today so light upon clack

11:21.760 --> 11:25.440
saying to yourself hey I'm like look this here.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.700
And then they go this whole business page.

11:28.080 --> 11:42.990
So you have that cover photo that we talked about just engage our name our hours

11:46.660 --> 11:48.430
prices.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.230
And then you can always just call these images.

11:52.480 --> 11:58.750
I am sure you know the x x x x x x dollar signs.

11:58.820 --> 12:07.620
So now again this is a sketch face so I know that for instance we forgot to put it in the contact information.

12:07.620 --> 12:13.110
I know that we forgot to put in whether or not the hours are for today or tomorrow.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.080
And you know I just had to.

12:15.230 --> 12:19.440
I was like to look at these for a while and think about and see if I can remember if I did something

12:19.440 --> 12:20.230
wrong.

12:20.580 --> 12:27.930
So I put it today just as a reminder but it doesn't really matter when you get to the scale invasion

12:27.930 --> 12:31.050
really isn't going to make it a lot easier.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.670
And once you have this it's going to work really well as a rough guideline for how you should go for

12:35.670 --> 12:35.980
it.

12:36.150 --> 12:45.250
So that is roughly what our iPhone Happy Hour looks like to label.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.500
Hopefully I can read that if you don't then the question is going to require patient.

12:50.510 --> 12:55.890
There's just a post in a group discussion or me a private message I can go over this again I Squirtle

12:55.890 --> 13:00.810
this really quickly to show you this should not take a ton of time just to get the juices flowing to

13:00.810 --> 13:05.730
get you to a point where you feel comfortable putting things on paper and eventually transfer this to

13:05.730 --> 13:11.440
your computer and then start building something that's a little bit more substantial if you skip this

13:11.440 --> 13:11.830
step.

13:11.850 --> 13:16.010
I found that it gets considerably harder because then you're starting from scratch with a tool that's

13:16.020 --> 13:20.750
more complicated especially if you don't have experience putting down layouts.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.720
Now again if you ever hit a point where you're confused you don't know what to do.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.450
Pull open your phone if you're making a mobile app and just browsing apps try to find ones there somewhere

13:29.550 --> 13:31.500
you can find ones that are somewhere BRAF anything.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.840
It'll give you ideas eventually for how you might want to lay this out how you might want to make this

13:36.840 --> 13:39.980
work how an icon might look something like that.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.080
It's easy to find inspiration if you just look at other apps.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.300
Typically I like to look at apps that are popular because those usually have better design.

13:47.350 --> 13:53.790
So hard to say if you go to your wife or look for the top grossing or the top Salang look at the way

13:53.790 --> 13:56.930
that they actually do and follow their lead.

13:56.940 --> 14:01.680
Other than that if you're on a Web site making a web version and go on to your laptop and just start

14:01.680 --> 14:04.780
bringing up page see how they do it all right.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.710
Again if you have any questions post in the group discussion.

14:07.920 --> 14:13.350
Otherwise we're going to move on to putting this onto a computer screen and putting together our low

14:13.350 --> 14:14.470
fidelity wireframe.

14:14.470 --> 14:15.490
All right see the next lecture.
