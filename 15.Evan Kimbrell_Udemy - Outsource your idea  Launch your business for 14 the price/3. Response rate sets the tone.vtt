00:10.710 --> 00:15.840
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture or we're going to talk about one of the most important

00:15.840 --> 00:19.300
things in contracting and in outsourcing.

00:19.410 --> 00:24.830
So this thing is something I tell people all the time and I see people making this huge mistake.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.910
It's I mean you can very easily slip into.

00:28.370 --> 00:32.360
And so you need to be very aware before you can go into the project.

00:32.370 --> 00:37.350
Your response rate sets the tone for the entire relationship.

00:37.340 --> 00:43.300
Now let me explain what I mean when you first post a project someone sends you a message.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.010
You respond they respond you respond.

00:46.020 --> 00:51.820
How much time is in between you hearing a message and you responding.

00:51.850 --> 00:59.010
Now this is a very well-known sociological phenomenon when you use text messages when you use e-mails

00:59.040 --> 01:02.090
when you post in a group whatever it may be.

01:02.280 --> 01:08.130
If you signal a delay the other person will typically match that delay.

01:08.140 --> 01:12.670
Now this is especially true in freelancer relationships.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.010
You are the employer.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.770
And so it's up to you to set the tone for the relationship.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.430
Are you going to be very casual.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.010
Are you going to be very serious.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.490
Do you require lots of information.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.300
Do you respond quickly.

01:24.300 --> 01:29.700
There's a lot of different aspects and variations to every single working arrangement.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.190
So a freelancer needs to adapt to the employer.

01:33.270 --> 01:38.700
And if you signal something to them say you're signaling casual language they'll most likely respond

01:38.700 --> 01:40.390
in casual language.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.710
That's just a natural order of things.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.360
Now response rate works in the same exact way.

01:46.650 --> 01:51.990
If you take a day to respond you're freelancers going to take a day to respond you take a week to respond

01:51.990 --> 01:54.210
your freelancer is going to take a week to respond.

01:54.210 --> 01:54.890
Why.

01:54.900 --> 02:01.340
Because you're signaling to them that it's OK to literally take a week before responding to something.

02:01.350 --> 02:07.050
Now you might not think that's an issue but this is something that grows very very quickly and it becomes

02:07.050 --> 02:09.730
a problem very very quickly.

02:10.080 --> 02:15.500
If you say respond within a day during the first week in the second week it takes you two days or 30

02:15.530 --> 02:17.530
takes it takes you three days.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.900
What's going to end up happening is that every single subsequent week you're going to have your communication

02:22.900 --> 02:29.200
speed is going to slow down to the point at which you're literally commuting four times a month.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.930
That is incredibly slow for virtually any project.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.970
There have been many many cases where I had a project that had I had a responsive relationship and we

02:38.970 --> 02:41.350
were communicating within 30 minutes to each other.

02:41.430 --> 02:42.750
We would been done in a day.

02:42.900 --> 02:48.830
But because I made the mistake of not responding within two days I set the tone for the relationship

02:48.930 --> 02:50.680
and the project took a month.

02:50.760 --> 02:55.580
So now I mean think about it you really can't blame the freelancer for doing that again.

02:55.590 --> 02:59.490
They adapt to every single employer every single employer is different.

02:59.490 --> 03:05.340
So it's important for you to set the tone early and to show them that you care about the project so

03:05.370 --> 03:06.390
they should too.

03:06.390 --> 03:11.430
There's also a negative effect that in general they're not going to take the project as seriously if

03:11.430 --> 03:13.070
you're not on the ball with it.

03:13.090 --> 03:18.380
It's subconsciously signals to them that this is not particularly an important thing to you.

03:18.420 --> 03:24.120
It might be a side project maybe they're doing this outside of their expertise that is generally how

03:24.120 --> 03:25.460
someone's going to think about it.

03:25.470 --> 03:28.130
So I can't stress this enough.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.690
I mean it even gets to the point where if you're going to launch something a to post a project and you're

03:33.690 --> 03:35.650
going to try to get it done within a week.

03:35.670 --> 03:40.080
Don't post it on a day that you know you're not going to be able to respond quickly don't even posted

03:40.080 --> 03:42.180
on the weekend if you're busy on weekends.

03:42.180 --> 03:42.670
Why.

03:42.690 --> 03:48.420
Because at the very beginning if you take 12 hours to respond you've now set the tone for a 12 hour

03:48.420 --> 03:49.500
response rate.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.030
You might be OK with that.

03:51.030 --> 03:51.430
Right.

03:51.480 --> 03:57.150
And if you are that's perfectly fine but there's no reason why you couldn't just limit that limit the

03:57.150 --> 04:02.320
cycle time and limit the project time in totality.

04:02.430 --> 04:02.790
OK.

04:02.790 --> 04:04.580
So take it seriously.

04:04.650 --> 04:11.460
Be conscious when you post a job and make sure that you respond as quickly as possible your projects

04:11.460 --> 04:17.310
will get done in a fraction of the time and you're freelancers are going to take this project a lot

04:17.310 --> 04:18.180
more seriously.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.770
They asked for a piece of information and you get it to them they're going to get back to you in the

04:22.770 --> 04:26.430
same expediency that you gave to them.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.880
So set the tone correctly have a successful project.

04:29.900 --> 04:30.090
Right.

04:30.120 --> 04:37.310
So in the next lecture.
