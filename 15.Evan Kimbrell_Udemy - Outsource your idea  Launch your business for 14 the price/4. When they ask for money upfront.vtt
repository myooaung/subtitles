Hey guys.

00:11.230 --> 00:16.560
Welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about a common scenario with contracting

00:16.950 --> 00:23.730
where the freelancer asked for money up front so you might have run into this problem where you found

00:23.730 --> 00:27.390
a couple of people that you like or maybe even little to down to the one person you want to work with

00:27.900 --> 00:32.790
and that person is first kind of response to you before they start the project is I need X amount of

00:32.790 --> 00:34.350
money up front.

00:34.350 --> 00:41.790
Now there is a wide range of ways at looking at this in general asking for some money upfront is not

00:41.890 --> 00:43.080
unrealistic.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.280
Why.

00:44.280 --> 00:50.760
Because if you're doing a milestone system or you're doing a project it makes sense that you put some

00:50.760 --> 00:53.820
money down to make sure that you're serious about the project.

00:53.820 --> 00:59.580
If you have zero dollars upfront there's nothing stopping you as the employer from just deciding halfway

00:59.580 --> 01:03.080
through that you don't like the person you're working with and giving it to someone else.

01:03.090 --> 01:08.450
So realistically they're looking for protection from that exact scenario.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.730
Now how much money they ask up front.

01:10.740 --> 01:15.850
That's where we get kind of into the details what's realistic and what's not.

01:15.990 --> 01:20.310
The biggest thing to look at when determining how realistic the money they're looking they're asking

01:20.310 --> 01:26.330
for upfront is how popular is this freelancer you're working with a firm or a studio.

01:26.340 --> 01:31.020
It's not uncommon at all that they ask for a significant chunk of the money upfront.

01:31.020 --> 01:31.540
Why.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.460
Well because they have to schedule a lot of time with their workers with their freelancers.

01:35.610 --> 01:41.400
They probably have expenses up front and they allocate a lot of their management time towards you.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.260
A freelancer doesn't have overhead costs so they're probably going to ask for less.

01:46.260 --> 01:52.080
They should still be asking for some money up front but it's never going to be as much as what a studio

01:52.080 --> 01:53.540
or a company would ask for.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.980
So the biggest thing to look for is how popular are they.

01:55.980 --> 02:02.790
They have extensive experience working with clientele they have very positive remarks on their profiles.

02:02.910 --> 02:07.250
It might be acceptable that they ask for all the way up to 50 percent up front.

02:07.320 --> 02:13.470
Now if they do not have much of a track record they have fewer views and they haven't been freelancing

02:13.470 --> 02:14.380
as long.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.220
I would never expect to pay them 50 percent up front.

02:17.490 --> 02:24.060
I might expect to pay them 10 percent or 20 percent or however you desire design your milestone payments.

02:24.060 --> 02:29.400
Maybe they just asked for one milestone payment upfront and again never said that milestone to them

02:29.550 --> 02:34.950
use an escrow service now I think 50 percent is the maximum you should ever pay upfront.

02:34.950 --> 02:35.650
Why.

02:35.790 --> 02:40.530
Well because a lot of times you have a project that is so short and duration that it doesn't make sense

02:40.530 --> 02:42.430
to break up into milestones.

02:42.570 --> 02:49.050
And also as such the case that a lot of different expertise and people with certain skill sets are just

02:49.050 --> 02:50.550
used to that format.

02:50.550 --> 02:55.700
Graphic Designers typically will ask for 50 percent up front 50 percent at the end.

02:55.860 --> 03:02.670
It makes a lot of sense in scenarios where it's really hard to segment the work up like a designer can't

03:02.670 --> 03:05.340
say I'm halfway done with this button.

03:05.340 --> 03:06.730
That's a milestone too.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.280
I'm halfway done with this page.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.940
It's a milestone 3.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.250
It just that's not really how that works in graphic design.

03:13.260 --> 03:18.720
It's kind of more of a push where everything kind of develops all at once and then they get to a point

03:18.720 --> 03:21.420
where they're finished and then they go through iterations of editing.

03:21.420 --> 03:26.670
So if you're working with the designer 50/50 that's totally normal working with the development firm.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.470
It's big 50.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.920
It makes sense if they're a popular firm if they're less popular.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.320
Never heard of them don't have a big track record.

03:34.530 --> 03:39.360
You might want to negotiate something lower but you should always expect to pay something up front.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.460
Another thing to take into consideration is a lot of these freelancers have upfront costs.

03:43.530 --> 03:47.970
So if you're building out something that requires them to pay money for something upfront it might be

03:47.970 --> 03:50.610
realistic that they ask for some money upfront.

03:50.750 --> 03:55.740
So you are building a web site and they're going to use a paid tool and integrate it into your service

03:55.770 --> 03:58.410
while they don't have to pay for it and then put it in.

03:58.410 --> 04:04.290
So realistically you should probably give them some funds to put it in for the licensing for the subscription

04:04.500 --> 04:09.510
or whatever it is that they need to actually complete your project past that that's really all it is.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.270
Take a guess at how popular they are.

04:12.450 --> 04:18.210
How realistic it is that they might need cash upfront and kind of formulate that into what you'd expect

04:18.210 --> 04:19.290
to pay upfront.

04:19.290 --> 04:24.630
Remember it's always negotiable but be prepared to pay 50 percent upfront if you really really like

04:24.750 --> 04:26.560
the freelancer that you're about to work with.

04:26.670 --> 04:32.550
Pass that if someone asks you for 100 percent up front obviously never do that.

04:32.730 --> 04:39.240
I mean that is just doesn't make sense in any scenario ever if anyone ever asked for that or more than

04:39.240 --> 04:41.770
50 percent upfront just say no.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.190
That person is just not realistic.

04:44.190 --> 04:48.990
They don't have experience freelancing or it is their intention to probably scam you in some way.

04:48.990 --> 04:54.300
So just don't ever do that if you're ever going over 50 percent makes absolutely no sense and always

04:54.300 --> 04:55.590
use an escrow service.

04:55.800 --> 04:56.190
All right guys.

04:56.190 --> 05:01.170
Any other questions any weird scenarios you've had just post in the group discussion.

05:01.170 --> 05:01.970
Love to hear it.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.440
Loved actually talk about it.

05:03.450 --> 05:04.240
Help you guys through it.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.700
So seeing the next lecture.
