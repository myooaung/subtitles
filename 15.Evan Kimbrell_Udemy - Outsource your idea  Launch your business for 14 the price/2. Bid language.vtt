WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:07.170
OK and now I want to show you an example of someone who didn't even really stay on topic at all.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.710
Here's one called exceptional technologies.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.720
Interesting how they went with the casual question or casual introduction.

00:15.750 --> 00:20.570
They pretty much stay on topic for maybe one section.

00:20.730 --> 00:26.160
Yeah it looks like they're saying that oh we've attached an RFP that's a request for proposal and they

00:26.160 --> 00:31.050
say right here you know your car's messaging it doesn't actually your car messaging encroaches GPS location

00:31.050 --> 00:33.870
it doesn't require US location work shift management.

00:33.870 --> 00:34.810
That is true.

00:34.890 --> 00:38.310
Web based back end yes this is true in bits and pieces.

00:38.310 --> 00:43.770
I don't know what that means but then right here you'll just notice immediately none of this has anything

00:43.770 --> 00:48.230
to do with the project you trying to get me on Skype to talk to me.

00:48.270 --> 00:49.950
It has nothing do with my project.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.990
Looking at your video testimonials.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.250
Nothing to do with my project.

00:53.250 --> 00:57.100
Giving me a PDA a direct contact details your customer nothing nothing nothing.

00:57.210 --> 01:03.030
So pretty much all of this right here probably is just copy and pasted this right here probably was

01:03.030 --> 01:04.130
written by someone.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.780
This was copy and paste it.

01:06.200 --> 01:06.480
OK.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.830
So these are good examples of a range you will expect.

01:12.150 --> 01:18.150
You know this person is 100 percent custom 100 percent everything they're saying has to do with your

01:18.150 --> 01:18.630
project.

01:18.630 --> 01:19.580
That's a good thing.

01:19.590 --> 01:20.990
This guy is right in the middle.

01:21.090 --> 01:25.250
And this is a good example of a team that just did a very poor job.

01:25.260 --> 01:31.230
You can tell that they clearly missed some of the features and the majority of it is copy and paste

01:31.230 --> 01:32.110
it.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.810
You also noticed some weak points right here.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.300
They said they attached an RFP.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.130
They didn't actually attach an RFP.

01:37.440 --> 01:42.810
OK so now that you've looked at the ratio of copied and pasted information to custom information there

01:42.810 --> 01:45.650
are some other things that you can look for.

01:45.660 --> 01:50.430
One thing I like to look for is how well they construct their sentences.

01:50.430 --> 01:56.210
We can go back to screenies example here very very poorly constructed.

01:56.280 --> 02:03.360
I talked previously about camelback and you'll notice that really just means that they're randomly capitalizing

02:03.360 --> 02:10.020
things is just a sign that they're not particularly good at English or they're not particularly good

02:10.020 --> 02:11.350
at communication.

02:11.370 --> 02:16.220
Typically I like to look at the way that sentences are constructed and a lot of people think like OK

02:16.230 --> 02:22.410
well you're going to give a massive disadvantage to a company that doesn't speak native English and

02:22.410 --> 02:24.600
that is somewhat true and somewhat not true.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.920
I mean you have to keep in mind that a lot of these estimates are going to come from countries that

02:29.190 --> 02:32.250
don't speak perfect English which is perfectly fine.

02:32.430 --> 02:36.960
But you have to also be aware of the fact that some of them can speak English better and some of them

02:36.960 --> 02:37.730
are worse.

02:37.770 --> 02:41.790
And this is going to be reflected in how well you can communicate with them.

02:41.790 --> 02:42.130
Sure.

02:42.150 --> 02:47.790
You might think this is cosmetic details like for instance if they accidentally capitalize things but

02:47.910 --> 02:54.210
when you are communicating with them and something goes wrong any tiny little misunderstanding can become

02:54.210 --> 02:54.810
a problem.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.860
It can slow your project down and it can cost you money.

02:57.870 --> 03:03.630
So I always suggest looking over people's messages look for sections where they describe something that

03:03.630 --> 03:09.710
you don't understand what they mean or where they get off the point or where they tell you things that

03:09.780 --> 03:11.130
are just not important.

03:11.130 --> 03:15.730
These are all good indications of later on when you're working with them.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.390
How helpful are they going to be how easier are they going to be to communicate with.

03:19.410 --> 03:22.940
So we can just literally take any example on here.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.270
You know this is an example of an Indian firm it's probably in the middle.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.230
Their communication skills are ok not terrible not great.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.890
We'll just take this paragraph right here.

03:32.940 --> 03:39.120
We are a team of professional developers who hold expertise in open source development projects and

03:39.750 --> 03:44.370
double space can certainly help you figure out the best possible development approach after having a

03:44.380 --> 03:45.330
discussion with you.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.890
Nothing terrible right here.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.360
I'm not sure what this double space was maybe.

03:49.410 --> 03:53.900
I think it's ticky tack but you'll notice that like this is a massive run on sentence.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.420
We do agree in agile application development practices.

03:58.470 --> 04:05.040
I don't know if that means they like it or they actually do it and then they say and hence have implanted

04:05.040 --> 04:10.970
processes that enables us to enables us deliver cost effective and timely projects.

04:11.260 --> 04:16.140
Okay so what you can tell here is you can get the gist of what they're saying but you'll notice that

04:16.140 --> 04:17.650
it's also kind of confusing.

04:17.940 --> 04:21.150
And they might be using incorrect vocabulary in the future.

04:21.170 --> 04:24.140
That could be confusing especially to someone who's new to this project.

04:24.210 --> 04:29.190
That means you might be spending a lot of time kind of clearing yourself through the bushes and trying

04:29.190 --> 04:31.710
to figure out what exactly they are talking about.

04:32.050 --> 04:39.380
So and here is an example of a bid from ideal I.T. techno Private Limited if anybody's worked in India

04:39.420 --> 04:41.810
this is something that almost all Indian companies do.

04:41.810 --> 04:46.800
They always had private limited bill and all these different attachments to the end of their thing and

04:46.800 --> 04:51.060
then it's almost as if they just use an adjective generator for their name or they just stuck a bunch

04:51.060 --> 04:52.180
of things together.

04:52.350 --> 04:54.540
They don't even realize what techno means.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.490
The rest of the world they think it's a cool way of abbreviating technology.

04:58.810 --> 05:05.200
Anyway so here is example of one that not only has poor communication but pretty much scores poorly

05:05.210 --> 05:11.880
on all of the things that I'm telling you to look for in terms of staying on topic right here.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.600
We are an I.T. firm really having a good track of developers.

05:16.600 --> 05:21.730
What is a good track of developers working in Android iPhone you know Photoshop blah blah blah blah

05:21.730 --> 05:22.160
blah.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.980
None of this has anything to do with are talking about.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.270
Didn't mention Twilio didn't mention S.M..

05:28.450 --> 05:30.440
What does each team have to do anything.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.050
We're not building an iPhone app.

05:33.070 --> 05:35.600
Photoshop What does that have to do with anything.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.680
Right off the bat they just literally copy and pasted nonsense.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.450
Now how else can you understand them.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
Here's a here's a paragraph you should read.

05:44.590 --> 05:48.100
We have undergone with the description of assuming that just means.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.920
Read it.

05:50.110 --> 05:55.150
Under gone a process of understanding it given in your project details.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.550
For Android iPhone taxi.

05:57.730 --> 06:01.690
OK it's a mobile application that sends text messages.

06:01.690 --> 06:04.810
It has nothing to do with iPhone or Android platforms.

06:04.810 --> 06:11.070
It's supposed to work on literally any project to manage drivers Caml backing.

06:11.110 --> 06:14.340
We will give you live I am chat with app.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.190
I don't even know what that means.

06:16.270 --> 06:18.430
So users can chat frequently.

06:18.430 --> 06:24.570
Also we will implement push notifications to notify on specific time with message.

06:24.730 --> 06:26.920
That is all just jibberish.

06:26.920 --> 06:33.940
I don't think that they're talking about how we had asked for the ability to send messages to drivers

06:33.940 --> 06:38.740
through the system but drivers shouldn't be communicating with themselves and they wouldn't be doing

06:38.740 --> 06:40.380
it through the Administration panel.

06:40.390 --> 06:42.110
Neither would we.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.300
So they don't even know what that is.

06:45.340 --> 06:51.850
So this is a good example of you can see their communication skills right off the bat when in doubt

06:51.850 --> 06:52.600
throw it out.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.890
That's a great example great kind of credo to follow when you're looking at proposals.

06:56.890 --> 07:02.530
If you can't understand their well thought out proposal then you're not going to understand them when

07:02.530 --> 07:07.240
something goes wrong and you're not going to understand them when you have to change requirements and

07:07.240 --> 07:08.500
they ask questions.

07:08.530 --> 07:11.400
So one other thing that I want to talk about.

07:11.440 --> 07:18.790
You should look for is how well in their proposal do they demonstrate that they understand what you're

07:18.790 --> 07:19.870
building.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.410
OK so I'll give you a good example and a bad example.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.600
A good example would be.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.750
Here's an example of a person who actually ended up working with.

07:28.750 --> 07:34.000
So the person introduces themselves and they say that you know they'd be happy to make it they right

07:34.000 --> 07:39.160
off the bat said we've created critter's small demo of your functionality you requested they explain

07:39.160 --> 07:44.980
a problem that they had but they clearly understand that these are issues and then get around it right

07:44.980 --> 07:45.520
off the bat.

07:45.520 --> 07:52.410
This person just kind of got it right like they understood that we wanted estimated out in sections.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.660
This is one of our screener questions.

07:54.770 --> 08:00.760
Have you noticed this that I think only three of the 18 actually figured this out and gave us an estimate

08:00.760 --> 08:03.730
in three sections so he got that correct.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.160
Everything on here is custom.

08:06.190 --> 08:11.590
There's no copy and pasted information and they just built a version of it right off the bat just to

08:11.650 --> 08:15.030
prove that they knew what it was supposed to do and what it should do.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.990
That's a great thing.

08:17.260 --> 08:22.570
And as you can see here they created a system pretty much on their own.

08:22.570 --> 08:28.170
So that's usually a great thing you can tell that you know they brought up some issues.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.330
They've built a small version of it.

08:30.340 --> 08:34.210
They've clearly thought about what they're trying to build.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.510
They've read the entire thing they know that it's going to be in sections.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.910
This is a very very good proposal.

08:39.910 --> 08:45.550
Now an example of a bad proposal will go back down to our friends at ideal Tecno.

08:45.610 --> 08:48.910
They clearly do not understand what this project is about.

08:49.270 --> 08:53.130
So that's the last thing you want to look for is how well do they understand what it's about.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.280
We've already talked a little bit about this paragraph that shows that they clearly do not understand

08:57.280 --> 09:03.050
the messaging requirements in the messaging space specifications for this application.

09:03.190 --> 09:07.870
But you can also just notice that pretty much all of this is just garble.

09:07.870 --> 09:13.540
We are having expertise with server side apps with Android iPhone apps plus ph B web admin My sequel

09:13.540 --> 09:14.470
database.

09:14.890 --> 09:16.900
OK that's fine.

09:16.900 --> 09:20.570
Again it's not an Android iPhone app I don't know why they thought that.

09:20.640 --> 09:27.670
What does it matter where you build the Administration panel and direct information with developer interaction

09:27.670 --> 09:29.230
with developers on Skype.

09:29.230 --> 09:34.090
If this is any indication of how they communicate I cannot imagine that being able to communicate directly

09:34.090 --> 09:35.820
with their developers is helpful.

09:35.980 --> 09:41.200
And then they give us a link to all these apps that have nothing to do with what we're trying to build.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.800
So this obviously is just a bad bad bad proposal.

09:46.930 --> 09:52.450
They score poorly on every single thing but relevancy is what we're talking about right this moment

09:52.750 --> 09:57.310
and relevancy understate showing that they understand what it is very poor.

09:57.310 --> 10:02.300
We have expertise with location based this this is not a location based app.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.030
So look for these red flags.

10:04.040 --> 10:11.810
Honestly if they are incorrectly labeling the app if they're using overly generic information or terms

10:11.810 --> 10:19.670
to describe it if they are not using custom tacks they might be afraid of describing it correctly and

10:19.670 --> 10:22.800
it might be the case that they don't actually know what they're building.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.550
These are all things you should look for.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.890
So these guys clearly don't know what they're building Nic up here.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.120
Clearly it does.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.200
You can tell pretty quickly just from reading a couple of paragraphs that some of the other people that

10:33.200 --> 10:35.080
they do actually know what it is.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.390
OK.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.860
So those are three things that I think you should look for when going over the language.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.320
Don't obviously set to a strict rule.

10:48.410 --> 10:51.800
Make sure that you know only if you don't have a lot of proposals then you need to be a little bit more

10:51.800 --> 10:52.300
lax.

10:52.300 --> 10:59.510
You've a lot of proposals you can be very picky but pay attention to things like how much message fatigue

10:59.510 --> 11:01.070
are they signaling to you.

11:01.070 --> 11:05.030
That means that they're busy they're building over the place and they haven't thought about your project

11:05.030 --> 11:08.210
a lot they haven't thought about your project that could mean that they're going to be problems in the

11:08.210 --> 11:12.590
future look for their ability or inability to communicate.

11:12.770 --> 11:16.880
If you think that they have bad communication skills now but they'll improve once you're working on

11:16.880 --> 11:19.350
a project you are sadly mistaken.

11:19.380 --> 11:22.430
They're going to be worse when you're working on a project.

11:22.790 --> 11:26.180
And the other thing that you should look for is how well do they demonstrate that they understand your

11:26.180 --> 11:26.820
application.

11:26.840 --> 11:32.720
If they build you a small version of it that is fantastic because they can just show you and even even

11:32.720 --> 11:36.290
highlighting issues that they might have or problems they might see.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.260
Those are all good things.

11:38.330 --> 11:42.740
And then on the other side if you have people using incorrect language describing it as something that

11:42.740 --> 11:47.810
it's not talking about sections that don't exist that's a very bad thing.

11:47.820 --> 11:50.410
That's that's a red flag you should literally throw this one out.

11:50.420 --> 11:51.940
Don't even read the price.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.750
It's not worth looking at.

11:53.810 --> 11:57.950
The last thing I want to leave you with that you should look for another red flag is if you look for

11:57.950 --> 12:00.140
people who are trying to get you off the platform.

12:00.230 --> 12:00.710
It's funny.

12:00.740 --> 12:07.120
We had a previous lecture on getting you should use a strategy to get them off of the platform.

12:07.220 --> 12:11.660
But if they are trying to get you off the platform that is actually a negative sign.

12:11.660 --> 12:16.010
It means that they don't want to spend time on your proposal and they think that if you connect with

12:16.010 --> 12:21.130
them on Skype then they can use that as a pre-qualification technique to see that you're interested

12:21.140 --> 12:22.870
then they're going to dedicate time to it.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.780
That's not what you want.

12:23.780 --> 12:24.140
That's it.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.240
It's just a very cheap trick that a lot of freelancers use.

12:27.260 --> 12:33.680
They also think that if to get you off Skype you off the platform they can change the terms or say things

12:33.680 --> 12:36.230
that they wouldn't be allowed to say on here.

12:36.230 --> 12:44.050
So if you notice people doing that you can quite literally just look for control and go for Skype so

12:44.050 --> 12:48.190
right here this guy wants me to share his Skype ID with him.

12:48.370 --> 12:51.130
We have this is actually IDEAL I.T. techno.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.150
They want us to get on skype very quickly.

12:53.160 --> 12:59.080
Here's acception air wants me to get on Skype for a quick introduction and they will immediately want

12:59.080 --> 13:01.160
me to connect with them.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.430
You know hope that you'll notice this very quickly.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.170
Nick did not do that.

13:05.530 --> 13:11.450
And even up here Paul Matthews did he looks like he wants me to get on skype.

13:11.710 --> 13:14.620
And here we go we can discuss more on Skype.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.240
That's generally a bad thing.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.680
Try to avoid that.

13:17.770 --> 13:21.380
Try to get them on here.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.610
And if they want you get on skype.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.110
Keep that as a red flag in the back of your mind.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.940
But you're more than capable of handling them if you ask them to get on Skype.

13:31.390 --> 13:31.780
OK.

13:31.840 --> 13:38.200
In the next lecture we're going to talk about response rate or how that is important and what you should

13:38.590 --> 13:43.000
think about that and how you should use that as a way to judge your proposals.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.930
All right so in the next lecture.
