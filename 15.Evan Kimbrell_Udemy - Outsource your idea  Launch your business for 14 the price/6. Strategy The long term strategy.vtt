00:10.790 --> 00:11.080
You guys.

00:11.090 --> 00:16.160
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture I want to go over a really quick quick and dirty kind

00:16.160 --> 00:23.300
of strategy that you can use to get better results from your freelancer and for your job postings.

00:23.300 --> 00:28.400
So there's this one here at Sprint care we've actually tested with quite extensively and it's something

00:28.400 --> 00:34.280
that we've done a lot of people who outsource frequently do not take advantage of and so it's something

00:34.280 --> 00:38.540
that we think it's really crucial that if you're taking this course it's something that you try out

00:38.540 --> 00:40.070
at least a couple of times.

00:40.100 --> 00:46.610
So the strategy in this one is literally just whenever you are making a job posting always say it's

00:46.610 --> 00:47.960
long term.

00:48.410 --> 00:51.840
OK now let me explain why you do that and what I mean by that.

00:51.860 --> 00:56.600
Typically when you're listing out your listing and you'll see later in the course and we go over things

00:56.600 --> 01:04.310
like perks perks or things that you list in your job posting that are entice the freelancer to take

01:04.310 --> 01:07.090
your job posting more seriously and to be more interested.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.240
But when you go through that and you start thinking of perks one of the things you can always list is

01:11.240 --> 01:13.670
you can say that it's long term.

01:13.670 --> 01:20.120
Now the reason why we say this is a strategy is because it has a lot of beneficial effects but it's

01:20.120 --> 01:26.120
also something that even if you're not looking to hire someone long term it's still a valid thing that

01:26.120 --> 01:27.640
you can list and say.

01:27.710 --> 01:33.050
Now first off if you say it's a long term project a freelancer or a freelance firm they're just going

01:33.050 --> 01:34.700
to take it more seriously.

01:34.700 --> 01:35.530
That's important.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.700
You want your freelancers to take this seriously.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.670
If they don't they're going to give you templates.

01:40.730 --> 01:45.020
They're not going to pay attention to what you're asking and you're just going to get an overall lower

01:45.020 --> 01:46.670
quality experience.

01:46.750 --> 01:53.780
Now not only do they pay more attention to it you'll actually get more accurate prices and this is something

01:53.780 --> 01:58.580
we've played around with and we even caught freelancers giving us two prices for virtually the same

01:58.580 --> 01:59.560
thing.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.230
One was lower when they thought it was long term.

02:02.240 --> 02:08.300
Now to understand why this happens you need to understand why a freelancer likes a long term projects

02:08.330 --> 02:12.550
and why they do not like one off projects it seems rather obvious.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.600
But I think it's kind of important I understand what's going on here.

02:15.620 --> 02:18.320
It's not just that long term means more money.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.060
What it means is that they don't have to spend as much time looking for projects.

02:23.060 --> 02:28.730
Now imagine you're a developer and you spend four hours in a day programming and getting paid for it

02:28.760 --> 02:31.420
and you spend two hours trying to find another project.

02:31.550 --> 02:35.390
So you just spent six hours working and you're only going to get paid for four hours.

02:35.390 --> 02:39.470
That is something that freelancers and freelance firms hate having to deal with.

02:39.560 --> 02:44.660
It's bigger for freelancers because they just don't want to spend time looking for projects and they

02:44.660 --> 02:48.710
don't want to have to develop that as a separate skillset to what they're good at.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.160
They want to focus on their craft.

02:50.180 --> 02:55.880
Every time every hour they spend doing something else like acquiring clients is generally thought of

02:55.880 --> 02:58.730
as wasted time it's not time for them to grow.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.190
It's not time for them to get better what they're doing it's just not a good situation.

03:03.200 --> 03:09.950
So if they can attach to you get a long term project or get follow on projects that changes the mental

03:09.950 --> 03:11.420
calculus for them.

03:11.420 --> 03:17.390
If you knew a project was a one off project you would probably bid higher because you have to factor

03:17.390 --> 03:23.720
in the time it took to not only find the project bid on the project when the project but also established

03:23.720 --> 03:28.540
the basic rapport get set up and get working with your employer.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.740
So there's always an advantage to saying it's long term.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.340
Now how do I explain that.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.150
Every project is long term.

03:35.480 --> 03:40.010
Well it's not necessarily that the project itself is long term it's that you're looking for a long term

03:40.010 --> 03:41.050
relationship.

03:41.150 --> 03:45.500
Whenever you've worked with someone you're going to be significantly more likely to work with them in

03:45.500 --> 03:48.700
the future especially if you have a good experience with them.

03:48.890 --> 03:53.120
Even if you had an okay experience you've already worked with them you know how fast they respond you

03:53.120 --> 03:56.540
know how fast they get work done and you know exactly what they're good at and what they're not good

03:56.540 --> 03:56.900
at.

03:56.930 --> 04:02.960
That is almost always better than going into the pile and looking for another person you've never met.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.510
You have no familiarity with.

04:04.610 --> 04:08.800
So when I say long term project what I really mean is it's a long term relationship.

04:08.870 --> 04:14.210
Even if this project does not extend you're always going to be one of the first people I come to if

04:14.210 --> 04:16.310
I ever have a project that's similar to it.

04:16.550 --> 04:20.720
Almost every scenario where I've hired someone had a good experience with them and the project didn't

04:20.720 --> 04:21.530
work out.

04:21.530 --> 04:26.900
I was able to find them another project that they could work on so they still get repeat work.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.200
They still do not have to establish the rapport with me.

04:30.200 --> 04:35.960
They have to re introduce themselves to whatever the new project is but it doesn't really matter.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.280
They didn't have to find a client they've already found me.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.640
I just pass them on to the next project.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.830
So don't be squeamish when you use this term.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.290
It's one of the best things you can put.

04:44.430 --> 04:46.340
It's what freelancers really really look for.

04:46.340 --> 04:50.200
They want long term clients and it's going to reflect that in your price.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.760
When you say that.

04:51.770 --> 04:57.560
So obviously keep in mind as long as you think you're going to be contracting something else out in

04:57.560 --> 05:03.830
the future then chances are there's an opportunity for you to have a long term relationship with a contractor.

05:03.830 --> 05:06.290
That's usually the case in 95 and the time.

05:06.490 --> 05:09.850
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
