WEBVTT

00:05.730 --> 00:08.460
OK let's cover freelancer very quickly freelancer.

00:08.480 --> 00:14.110
Again the Profile for this platform is if you're looking for someone who's really cheap really easy

00:14.740 --> 00:16.690
and they do things really really quickly.

00:16.780 --> 00:22.480
That's what freelancers for freelancers for a lot of virtual assistant task data entry.

00:22.480 --> 00:29.040
You can also get web development and you also get marketing tools and marketing task done.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.720
That's just not really there for.

00:30.790 --> 00:37.260
This is great for getting tons and tons of bids very quickly and getting some menial task done immediately.

00:37.270 --> 00:44.110
Now what's different here is they have the same thing hire per hour hire for a fixed rate and they ask

00:44.110 --> 00:45.550
you for the length as well.

00:45.550 --> 00:48.970
The only difference is that you don't have that you can enter this later.

00:48.970 --> 00:53.760
You have to say micro project or simple project.

00:53.770 --> 01:00.310
Now what is wrong with this is that if you're posting a job posting chances are you do not know how

01:00.310 --> 01:04.630
expensive your job posting is going to be.

01:04.820 --> 01:08.710
You don't know expensive your application is that's why you're asking for estimates some of you might

01:08.710 --> 01:12.780
have a general idea but you know you don't really know.

01:12.790 --> 01:16.570
Also there's a big problem with this is say I was posting a big Web site like this.

01:16.570 --> 01:17.200
OK.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.910
Fifteen hundred at $3000.

01:18.920 --> 01:26.170
Well if I had a big Web site that say took 100 hours and I had an Indian group that gets paid $15 an

01:26.170 --> 01:30.210
hour in a hundred hours they would charge me dollars.

01:30.220 --> 01:37.600
Now if I had an American firm spend a hundred hours on this they would expect anywhere from 5000 to

01:37.590 --> 01:39.020
10000 dollars.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.050
Now they're completely left out of the cold here and they can't actually bid on their project.

01:44.050 --> 01:51.370
I always suggest casting a net as wide as possible so you can see a range of options because believe

01:51.370 --> 01:55.890
it or not you will almost always be surprised at what you can get this done for.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.420
What I suggest doing it this is a complete loophole in their system as you go customize budget and then

02:01.420 --> 02:06.370
asked for you for a minimum and ask you for a maximum The minimum is $10 if you want to go below $10

02:06.610 --> 02:12.110
say and your message hey tell me in your private message you'll work for below $10.

02:12.190 --> 02:17.680
They only do $10 because they don't want anything below that because it's not worth it for their fee

02:17.680 --> 02:19.940
and the processing fee to get it done.

02:20.050 --> 02:24.160
But you can always if it's that low I mean you might as well just work with someone off the system on

02:24.170 --> 02:29.380
Paypal and we talk about that strategy getting people off the system later in a later lecture.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.270
But typically it is what I do I just put the absolute lowest and the absolute highest I can think of

02:34.270 --> 02:36.570
10 million dollars.

02:36.590 --> 02:43.300
Obviously I'll put that let's say a hundred thousand dollars or something like that that are ten thousand

02:43.300 --> 02:43.840
whatever it is.

02:43.840 --> 02:49.270
What do you think the upper range is whatever you think of the absolute maximum you'll ever spend.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.870
Is because one of the things you're real.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.790
Find out very quickly is.

02:54.800 --> 03:01.900
Let's say I go simple project and my project should cost $20.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.120
I didn't realize it's only $20 or project.

03:04.150 --> 03:09.130
I put it at 30 to 250 because I thought oh it's maybe a $30 project or $40 project.

03:09.340 --> 03:14.950
When people see this 30 to 250 they're going to bid relative to what other people bid and this is something

03:14.950 --> 03:16.790
that's very specific to a freelancer.

03:17.020 --> 03:22.440
So what will happen is someone will bid for that project see that your budget is up to 250 and bid like

03:22.450 --> 03:23.960
$150.

03:23.980 --> 03:31.520
I have had and are really making this up to opportunities where I have posted this with a micro budget.

03:31.540 --> 03:36.210
Has someone bid $25 and then I posted it again a week later with simple project.

03:36.220 --> 03:38.720
Same person same message.

03:38.770 --> 03:40.540
$150.

03:40.540 --> 03:45.660
So what ends up happening is a lot of people just assume it's larger if your budget's larger.

03:46.420 --> 03:51.080
Or they assume this is an opportunity to get more money for what they're doing.

03:51.100 --> 03:56.860
A lot of people in here are not particularly honest so I was the customize and put some ridiculously

03:56.860 --> 04:00.670
high budget that's so obvious that it's not real.

04:00.690 --> 04:05.760
Then they have to pick their own number and they have to be actually honest about it.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.930
OK these are the additions that freelancer wants to charge you.

04:09.940 --> 04:13.150
It's free to post on freelancer's free to post in all of these platforms.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.960
This is how they actually make their money.

04:14.980 --> 04:19.010
Then they go a little bit of money off of what you transfer to the freelancer.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.140
But this is one of their big money makers.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.470
So when the thing is a recruiter.

04:24.470 --> 04:27.610
A recruiter is someone who helps you find the best results from your project.

04:27.610 --> 04:28.340
Don't do it.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.500
It's never worth it.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.710
250 percent higher success rate.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.370
What does that even mean.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.360
Are they guaranteeing that your project is successful.

04:37.390 --> 04:44.470
That's just nonsense it's not worth $30 to have one person send you an email or for what ends up happening.

04:44.470 --> 04:49.870
We have experiment or that you'll have someone contact you send you a template email and say hey we

04:49.870 --> 04:56.170
suggest this freelancer and that freelancer has the most billable hours and they have the highest ratings.

04:56.440 --> 05:02.410
OK I could have done that it didn't need to pay $30 to use an algorithm to determine who the best one

05:02.410 --> 05:03.030
was.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.340
In fact the best one always gets displayed at the top of the job listings or when you put your job posting

05:08.340 --> 05:10.280
the top of the freelancer bids.

05:10.410 --> 05:16.140
So featured that's just if you want to get more traffic if you have a project you're very serious about.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.000
You have a budget for it.

05:17.010 --> 05:21.180
You might think about getting featured what typically ends up happening here is you just get bombed

05:21.180 --> 05:24.460
with too many bids and that's usually a problem.

05:24.510 --> 05:31.590
There is a side effect of featured projects will get more information we'll get people who give better

05:31.590 --> 05:32.270
bids.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.160
But this is also freelancers so when I say better bids it means like maybe they customize two sentences

05:38.160 --> 05:44.760
out of their template urgent urgent can be helpful because what it does is it puts in a section for

05:45.180 --> 05:46.780
projects they need to get done now.

05:46.780 --> 05:53.670
But similarly what you can do is you can just list your project as lasting one day and that'll also

05:53.670 --> 05:59.540
put you in the urgent category so that actually is not particularly helpful sealed.

05:59.550 --> 06:03.980
That means that people can't see other people's bids.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.770
What that means is people have to be more honest about what their bidding they can't just base it off

06:07.800 --> 06:11.030
other people that generally can be helpful.

06:11.040 --> 06:17.580
But I think that also backfires a little bit because what'll happen is if someone has a project and

06:17.580 --> 06:20.860
they want to bid five hundred dollars on it because that's what they think it's worth.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.870
But they see that someone's bid for 50.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.780
They might take a harder look at it and say hey we can do it for 400.

06:26.850 --> 06:31.830
You want that process to happen because that's going to lower the price and it's going to save you a

06:31.830 --> 06:32.810
lot of money.

06:32.820 --> 06:38.070
That's one of the big advantages of these platforms because they compete against each other and you

06:38.070 --> 06:41.120
want that competition because it gives you the best price.

06:41.130 --> 06:45.600
Now you don't want too much competition because then you get unrealistic prices.

06:45.600 --> 06:51.220
You get these people who are doing it for peanuts because they want to review or they want the history.

06:51.390 --> 06:56.570
And those are just very volatile relationships and so you want to avoid that a little bit.

06:56.730 --> 07:03.180
Typically I don't like to use SEO but if you're not really interested in saving 20 percent from the

07:03.180 --> 07:05.790
competition fact you can try being sealed.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.050
Private is the same thing as before.

07:08.050 --> 07:10.650
It hides your details from search engines.

07:10.680 --> 07:17.320
So this is interesting because when you list a project freelancer will automatically put it on Google.

07:17.430 --> 07:21.840
And then when you want to delete your project and get it off google they want to charge you to remove

07:21.840 --> 07:23.160
it from their system.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.600
Ridiculous I know.

07:24.690 --> 07:31.230
But what ends up happening is if this is not sensitive information you can not pay them and just wait

07:31.230 --> 07:36.150
for it to expire once it expires it's never going to be found anyway unless someone was specifically

07:36.150 --> 07:37.190
looking for it.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.970
And even then they will not be able to find it full time.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.220
This is you're having a full time person if you're a full time person.

07:44.220 --> 07:45.900
Don't do it on freelancer.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.210
Much better places to work than freelance or this is just silly and I don't know why you pay them 200

07:51.240 --> 07:51.920
dollars.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.740
Working with them full time just get them off of the system.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.910
Save the money.

07:55.910 --> 08:00.930
Split the savings and you can just a much much better way of doing it.

08:01.020 --> 08:06.090
Nda nondisclosure agreements if that makes you feel comfortable you can do it.

08:06.090 --> 08:12.180
I used to work as a venture capitalist so I know that India is are completely worthless especially in

08:12.180 --> 08:18.930
a scenario of outsourcing someone who's overseas is just not it doesn't matter.

08:18.930 --> 08:22.500
I mean they can sign this India and then copy it or do whatever.

08:22.500 --> 08:27.340
What are you going to do send the FBI to their country it's just not going to happen.

08:27.390 --> 08:29.340
No one takes that seriously.

08:29.340 --> 08:35.970
Sometimes this conveys a little more professionalism but it is so uncommon on this platform that I don't

08:35.970 --> 08:38.000
think it's actually worth it.

08:38.010 --> 08:42.900
Now if you're just looking for a contractor in country it might be helpful.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.200
You know it's also you can do.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.970
Also you can just send them your NDA and send it on.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.010
Hello sign.

08:49.170 --> 08:54.750
And we have an NDA attached to this course so that actually saves you $20.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.180
Just upload it send it to him.

08:56.190 --> 08:56.700
It's FREE.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.020
They sign it.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.290
Same deal.

08:59.730 --> 09:00.360
OK.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.310
That is freelancer as you can tell.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.900
I hate all of these upgrades.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.750
You can try them sealed in private.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.590
Those are the ones that I had to pick something I pick it featured can sometimes help I'm doing a really

09:10.590 --> 09:11.580
large project.

09:11.670 --> 09:16.830
This is how you get around that problem of telling people what your budget is and therefore priming

09:16.830 --> 09:18.420
the discussion too much.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.290
All right now we're going to finish off with up work.

09:21.300 --> 09:25.740
I'm still not getting used to up work because you called oDesk I don't get this thing.

09:25.740 --> 09:28.160
The design looks like a fish.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.430
I don't know what was wrong with the other one.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.480
But anyway here we are.

09:31.490 --> 09:35.370
So they were very similar as you can see to Elance.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.450
So in this case we would say web mobile and software development.

09:39.450 --> 09:41.850
There you go and then you pick something as you can tell.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.520
There are a lot less specific here.

09:44.540 --> 09:49.530
But if you just want a generic development you just say mobile development the owner of the Web site

09:49.530 --> 09:50.560
you do web development.

09:50.550 --> 09:58.890
So it's a mobile and here we describe our whatever they ask for a lot more information which is kind

09:58.890 --> 10:00.200
of annoying.

10:00.650 --> 10:05.010
You know this is helpful in the sense that if I say iPhone and I also wanted it for iPads is always

10:05.010 --> 10:05.930
important.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.290
It'll it all message more people.

10:08.310 --> 10:12.870
This is something very specific to up work which is that you can say you want to hire one freelancer

10:12.870 --> 10:14.570
you can say you want to hire multiple ones.

10:14.580 --> 10:19.590
Now multiple ones might mean that if you're doing a data entry project and you want multiple people

10:19.590 --> 10:23.520
working at it at the same time and coordinating you might want multiple ones.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.800
Similarly you might want to hire specialists to build your application one person to the front and one

10:28.800 --> 10:32.750
person knows the back end or one who has the graphic design or whatever or whatever.

10:32.850 --> 10:40.650
Usually what I do is if I can possibly conceive of hiring more than one I will say it and then I'll

10:40.650 --> 10:43.000
just say like two or three or whatever it doesn't matter.

10:43.080 --> 10:49.440
The reason why is because when you're browsing projects on up work it will have a massive icon on your

10:49.440 --> 10:52.400
thing saying looking for multiple freelancers.

10:52.410 --> 10:56.430
Now the reason why that's a good thing for a freelancer is it just means the likelihood of them getting

10:56.430 --> 11:02.480
hired is much higher out of the pool of 50 people maybe they're hiring three as opposed to one.

11:02.560 --> 11:08.010
Three times as likely to get hired here or you can be more specific.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.540
This helps quite a bit.

11:09.540 --> 11:15.110
You should never click this one because if you're following this course I teach you how we build specifications.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.890
You should always put this and then design that's just whether or not you've gone out and gotten them

11:19.890 --> 11:21.210
designed.

11:21.240 --> 11:26.310
We have cores coming out on how you can get designs done very easily.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.360
But look forward to that.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.040
So then are you experienced in managing this type of job.

11:32.270 --> 11:35.480
I'm not entirely sure what this even does for you.

11:36.060 --> 11:43.260
Really I think if you say no it's going to try to up sell you on things and it's going to limit who

11:43.260 --> 11:50.190
sees the application or who sees the job posting it's going to limit it to people who have more experience

11:50.190 --> 11:54.660
on up work or have more experience in general with their craft.

11:54.660 --> 11:59.130
That's never a bad thing but we always want to open the floodgates so much as possible.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.070
And then here are things that are optional.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.780
You can talk about what are the programming languages you want to know if it's an iOS application.

12:05.780 --> 12:08.100
There's really only one you can build it in.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.250
So there's no point filling that out.

12:10.470 --> 12:15.300
Other skills you know you can get specific if there's other things they have to do if they have to design

12:15.300 --> 12:15.920
as well.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.620
You can say design.

12:18.090 --> 12:24.530
And then you can pick the right mobile application design mobile UI design is what they call it.

12:24.540 --> 12:24.790
OK.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.640
So that might be helpful.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.500
You need to integrate with any API.

12:29.610 --> 12:34.650
You know you can say other and I would say Twilio in this case but it doesn't ask me.

12:34.650 --> 12:35.790
These are all very helpful.

12:35.790 --> 12:37.200
These are all very very specific.

12:37.200 --> 12:44.010
Same question here do you go by pay by our pay fixed rate they limit you in the sense that you have

12:44.010 --> 12:45.390
to say what your budget is.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.200
You have to say what your hourly rate is.

12:48.210 --> 12:52.950
I hate that that really just sets the project up for failure.

12:52.950 --> 12:58.440
But keep in mind you're posting this on three platforms maybe even four if you do guru.com or people

12:58.440 --> 12:59.430
per hour.

12:59.820 --> 13:04.680
So you should be able to get enough between the three you can try different strategies on each platform

13:04.680 --> 13:10.380
to really kind of root out the best ones and then just ask you you know how long are they going to be

13:10.380 --> 13:11.370
working on this.

13:11.370 --> 13:19.280
Keep in mind part time what that means is it's consistently per week anywhere from 10 to 40 hours.

13:19.570 --> 13:25.010
Full time is 40 hours or over as needed as anything under 10 hours.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.650
If you don't have a set schedule always pick as needed.

13:28.650 --> 13:31.320
Otherwise you do have a set schedule you can pick these.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.140
That's nice.

13:33.610 --> 13:38.610
Freelancer preferences they do this a little bit differently.

13:38.830 --> 13:43.120
So here's the same question that you got on the other ones should only people within the system see

13:43.120 --> 13:48.610
it showing you going invites yet can anyone fineness anyone means that they can find it through Google.

13:48.610 --> 13:53.470
They don't even have a profile they can see your job posting and then they can sign up and bid.

13:53.500 --> 13:59.110
I typically do this if I want to hide some of my information for some reason or this if I don't really

13:59.110 --> 13:59.940
care.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.990
Preferred qualifications these are completely.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.650
They're helpful ish if you know what you want.

14:05.650 --> 14:11.260
So we have a lecture on if you want to work with a firm or an independent person that can be a make

14:11.260 --> 14:13.450
a big difference if you're not if you don't care.

14:13.450 --> 14:16.450
Pick no preference if you feel like you should have a preference.

14:16.450 --> 14:22.670
Go to the other lecture watch that one minimum feedback score is generally kind of silly.

14:22.990 --> 14:29.860
You just don't want to limit this too much unless you have a very very well funded project with a lot

14:29.860 --> 14:34.270
of time and effort put behind it and a lot of money behind it you're just not going to have the luxury

14:34.270 --> 14:35.620
of being too picky.

14:35.620 --> 14:40.320
So I usually just say any score and then I personally root out the ones that are good and bad.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.290
You can do this if you want to you of your find just getting fewer bids or if you have a really attractive

14:44.290 --> 14:45.940
project this one.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.460
How often are they worked on upper.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.700
That just doesn't really matter.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.050
It just means how long are they've been on the system.

14:51.070 --> 14:53.340
It means how consistent or reliable they are.

14:53.340 --> 14:54.460
So that's generally a good idea.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.250
But in my experience a lot is people work off the system.

14:57.250 --> 15:02.710
So you've got great freelancers you don't have that many billable hours on up work location.

15:02.710 --> 15:09.700
Again this is the silliness you have to pick this giant area and it's just not worth it.

15:09.700 --> 15:16.360
I don't ever do that unless for some specific reason you just love working with Ukrainian's you can

15:16.360 --> 15:19.290
pick Eastern Europe English level.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.950
That's again ridiculous.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.050
It's self-assigned.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.850
They can assign themselves whatever they want.

15:23.840 --> 15:29.110
We have people who say they're native or fluent and they speak like Google Translate.

15:29.110 --> 15:34.630
So don't do that just say any level you can root them out very quickly cover letter is a little bit

15:34.630 --> 15:41.620
different cover letter means that they have to write an introduction to you saying why they're applying.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.470
That's great if this is a big project.

15:43.510 --> 15:49.180
I usually get rid of it but it's kind of a tough call.

15:49.180 --> 15:54.880
What ends up happening with cover letters is that people so often will just forget to turn this off

15:54.880 --> 16:01.030
and they just say yes I want a cover letter and then I'll end up happening is someone comes in your

16:01.030 --> 16:04.920
application sees that its cover letter and they just have a template and they just copy their template

16:04.920 --> 16:05.950
in and send it to you.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.870
You can tell that the template reads like a template.

16:08.950 --> 16:13.940
There's no personality no individuality into it and that's just not a good idea.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.200
You just don't want to tons and tons of template copies to you.

16:18.250 --> 16:22.480
Again if it's a big project maybe it's a cover letter if you're asking for too much already.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.360
Maybe you don't want a cover letter.

16:24.790 --> 16:28.840
I've also found great freelancers because they actually took the time to write a cover letter.

16:28.840 --> 16:34.970
They actually said why they're a good fit for it why they're interested and why they have the skills.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.040
OK.

16:36.040 --> 16:41.800
So in the next lecture we're going to talk really quickly about screening questions because those take

16:41.800 --> 16:47.260
a little bit more attention and I think I've used enough of your attention already going over the details.

16:47.260 --> 16:51.400
These are details details details but they make a big difference especially if you want to become a

16:51.400 --> 16:57.320
master at getting contractors and get finding people who are outsourced.

16:57.340 --> 17:02.740
These are kind of the tools of your craft so you really want to experiment with these figuring out what

17:02.740 --> 17:07.270
works best for you but you always want to get it set up perfectly so you get the right people and have

17:07.270 --> 17:08.950
the right incentives aligned.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.330
OK guys see in the next lecture.
