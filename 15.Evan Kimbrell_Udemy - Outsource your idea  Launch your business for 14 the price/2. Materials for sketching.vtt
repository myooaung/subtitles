00:05.820 --> 00:06.320
All right guys.

00:06.390 --> 00:12.900
So the best way of starting this process and you do go and get to the point where you're doing structure.

00:12.900 --> 00:17.070
This is after we finish so this is after we finish strategy.

00:17.070 --> 00:21.150
Now we kind of a rough idea of what we want in our application we just don't really know how it's going

00:21.150 --> 00:22.270
to work.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.020
This is what I like to do honestly.

00:24.140 --> 00:28.980
I like to just pull out different pieces of paper and just start scribbling.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.880
I want to see when you start doing this process do not worry about how it comes out.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.690
Don't worry about how many mistakes you can make you can make a lot of mistakes and a lot of times you

00:36.690 --> 00:39.830
won't be able to recognize what a mistake is.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.100
But this is what I like to do.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.240
I like to grab whatever I have around me.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.490
You can do it on a napkin.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.500
You can do it on a legal pad.

00:48.930 --> 00:58.440
But my preference personally is to use the basic kind of lab grade lines and you can see this is just

00:58.440 --> 00:59.790
kind of like a lab notebook.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.940
It has automatic grids on it.

01:01.980 --> 01:09.120
And the reason why I like that is because I personally cannot draw to save my life and I can't really

01:09.120 --> 01:10.560
stay in the lines.

01:10.590 --> 01:16.350
And this really helps me be able to when I read draw a rectangle or a box or I'm drawing a browser really

01:16.350 --> 01:21.780
helps me to stay in the winds and also helps you with sizing a lot of times to make a button and I can

01:21.780 --> 01:28.740
just say ok well to recreate is button it needs to be two by three and then I can create buttons that

01:28.740 --> 01:30.300
look roughly the same size.

01:30.330 --> 01:31.260
It doesn't really matter.

01:31.260 --> 01:36.050
I just think it helps in general making something a little bit more proud of.

01:36.050 --> 01:40.100
It helps that you can visualize kind of roughly what space looks like.

01:40.110 --> 01:46.410
Now if you don't have access to this the absolute minimum requirement to scatch is not really anything.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.960
I mean like I said you can use a napkin.

01:48.060 --> 01:53.090
Here's another very easy often just computer paper computer paper is great as well.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.530
It's big it's wide open.

01:55.560 --> 02:04.680
Try to what I do if I use computer paper is I will take to put them side by side on one time and sketch

02:04.680 --> 02:09.430
out roughly my thoughts or notes as I go along.

02:09.450 --> 02:13.350
And then over here is where I try to make the final version the version where I'm actually going to

02:13.350 --> 02:16.450
create something that looks somewhat correct.

02:16.590 --> 02:22.350
Now if you look at the resource section in this course I've actually included some templates that you

02:22.350 --> 02:24.460
can use and write here.

02:24.480 --> 02:31.990
What it does is it's this is especially helpful for using mobile applications because if you're saying

02:32.010 --> 02:37.530
sketching over here over here and I want to make it for an iPhone 6 or a Samsung Galaxy or whatever

02:37.790 --> 02:44.130
or S3 I'm not entirely sure how big that should be and I might just end up kind of doing it all over

02:44.130 --> 02:44.880
the place.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.590
This could actually help you.

02:46.870 --> 02:52.560
And so if you go there and download it you can see that there are multiple versions like right here

02:52.560 --> 02:54.390
is an iPhone 6.

02:54.630 --> 02:57.460
So it's already has all of the sizes for you.

02:57.820 --> 03:00.750
Here's a 6 plus.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.620
And here is the iPad.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.340
And remember you can design this book.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.820
Why is that because I don't like this because I like this.

03:08.190 --> 03:12.180
OK so it's kind of like a set up I like to do personally.

03:12.180 --> 03:16.560
You're not going to have it like this because you don't do this professionally every day.

03:16.800 --> 03:21.570
But I like to do is just have multiple types of paper out and I like on my computer here too because

03:21.570 --> 03:28.590
constantly I will need inspiration for how to format my sites or I you know sometimes it's nice to take

03:28.590 --> 03:30.450
a little break and space out.

03:30.540 --> 03:35.070
But it's really nice to be able to pull up something over there and then walk and then try to emulate

03:35.070 --> 03:44.520
it down here.
