00:04.060 --> 00:06.440
Pick guys welcome back to the course.

00:06.450 --> 00:14.370
So something that I hear people ask quite a bit in the group discussions is how do I outsource and simultaneously

00:14.370 --> 00:17.370
protect my intellectual property rights.

00:17.370 --> 00:24.450
It's a question that so many people have asked that I decided to make an actual lecture dedicated to

00:24.450 --> 00:25.270
that question.

00:25.410 --> 00:31.740
So the idea goes that you know if I have a project idea and I'm pouring all of this time and energy

00:32.250 --> 00:40.110
and originality into it if I then go and take all of that specificity and I post it online what is stopping

00:40.110 --> 00:44.310
someone out there from just taking that idea and running with it.

00:44.310 --> 00:51.060
So in this lecture I'm going to talk about what the things you can do to protect yourself are and at

00:51.060 --> 00:56.600
the end we'll talk a little bit about in the bigger picture grander scheme.

00:56.730 --> 00:58.310
Does this even matter.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.150
First off a lot of people don't realize this but when you are hiring through up work and remember a

01:03.210 --> 01:07.370
perk is pretty much the defacto place you go to hire people.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.040
Nowadays since Elance died you already have confidentiality protection.

01:13.040 --> 01:18.780
Now it used to be on elance you could have the option that says that people sign an NDA in order to

01:18.780 --> 01:19.930
see your project.

01:19.930 --> 01:23.900
Well they got rid of that feature in up work and why did they do that.

01:23.910 --> 01:30.810
Well as it turns out any time someone bids or creates an account or signs a contract with you through

01:30.810 --> 01:38.860
up work they already have confidentiality and non-compete clauses baked into what they are signing.

01:38.990 --> 01:44.180
Clause fifteen point one you can actually look it up in the terms and agreements.

01:44.190 --> 01:49.980
It's also in other places you know it says you don't disclose any confidential information supplied

01:50.370 --> 01:54.510
to it by the other to a third party without first appearing written consent.

01:54.780 --> 01:59.550
You cannot use any such confidential information for your own purposes.

01:59.550 --> 02:00.060
There you go.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.780
They can't take any info you give them and use it for their own projects.

02:03.870 --> 02:09.840
Mark Zuckerberg only disclose disclose the information to those of its personnel that need access to

02:09.840 --> 02:14.160
it in order to complete the contract they cannot share information with people that are not part of

02:14.160 --> 02:15.220
their team.

02:15.240 --> 02:21.570
So technically if someone were to take the information you post online you do have legal grounds and

02:21.570 --> 02:29.410
it's very well-defined and it's very easy to understand process if you want to then go and pursue this.

02:29.410 --> 02:37.380
Now number two you can do is actually just have them sign an NDA before you give them more information.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.880
There's really no excuse nowadays.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.380
I mean we have hello sign.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.090
We have to sign.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.350
There's so many online signature services and a lot of them are free.

02:46.350 --> 02:53.490
Hello signed for instance is free that you don't have an excuse not to give them an NDA if that makes

02:53.490 --> 02:55.000
you feel more comfortable.

02:55.050 --> 03:01.710
At the end of the course we have India listed that you can use just grab it that you can use it yourself

03:01.710 --> 03:05.150
plug it into one of those and send them to people get them to sign it.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.540
You can also Alternatively if you don't want to do that you think that's too burdensome.

03:09.630 --> 03:17.160
You can actually just limit how much information you post on your project now in general if I'm asking

03:17.160 --> 03:24.240
for someone to build So let's say a web application I don't need to tell them what industry it's for.

03:24.240 --> 03:30.840
I don't need to tell them a lot of the core details that make the application.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.710
They don't need to know for instance what industry you're in how you're going to make money where are

03:34.710 --> 03:41.130
you going to find your customers what your copywriting says you can wipe all of that information and

03:41.130 --> 03:43.250
just use a generic description.

03:43.350 --> 03:50.490
This part saves this information to this database and this part pulls this information and displays

03:50.490 --> 03:50.630
that.

03:50.630 --> 03:56.340
Remember when you're posting a project you just want them to get a decent enough idea to give you the

03:56.340 --> 03:59.300
correct estimate for your scope.

03:59.310 --> 03:59.840
Right.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.130
And then you can decide to give them more information if you find it relevant.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.870
Of course there's obvious downsides to this and it's not perfect.

04:06.870 --> 04:13.290
I'm pretty sure anyone who is motivated enough and smart enough can still figure out what you're building

04:13.320 --> 04:16.530
even if you make it a generic description.

04:16.530 --> 04:21.780
Also if you're going to go and talk to every single contractor and tell them you design NDA before I

04:21.780 --> 04:23.370
give you any good information.

04:23.490 --> 04:29.640
Well that actually kind of negates the benefit of posting online in a type of marketplace where people

04:29.640 --> 04:36.120
bid right you want them to know a lot about the application so they can bid and see what other people

04:36.120 --> 04:42.360
are bidding and you want that kind of competition to get you the best price.

04:42.360 --> 04:48.450
Now by doing that NDA technique you're basically making it like 100 different little private projects.

04:48.510 --> 04:53.370
In general I think you're going to get a more expensive estimate.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.390
So those are two techniques you can use if it makes you feel better.

04:57.510 --> 05:01.060
But at the end of the day does any of this really matter.

05:01.080 --> 05:08.690
Well India is not closure agreements ask yourself if someone's eyes in India and they're not in the

05:08.690 --> 05:11.140
same country as you and we're outsourcing to.

05:11.150 --> 05:13.310
Probably not.

05:13.310 --> 05:18.350
Can you do anything about it if they break the terms in that contract.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.640
Probably not.

05:19.640 --> 05:26.750
I mean even if they're in your country and they break your NDA can you actually bring legal ramifications

05:26.750 --> 05:31.840
against them even if they're in the next state over again.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.040
Probably not.

05:33.050 --> 05:39.860
India's are notoriously hard to enforce because they're so so vague.

05:39.860 --> 05:45.170
When I worked in venture capital we always joke because people would make a sign in DA's and if you

05:45.170 --> 05:51.320
actually read the language of a standard T hey that would mean that if I was talking to a company in

05:51.320 --> 05:58.010
education I could not then go and talk to another company in education I would have to wait like two

05:58.010 --> 06:02.330
years before even having a conversation with someone in a similar space.

06:02.420 --> 06:05.550
It's too onerous and any judge is just gonna shoot that down.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.840
How are you to prove that they took the idea specifically.

06:09.880 --> 06:14.870
You know it mentions marks I heard before ago knows that story about how they got sued by the Winkel

06:14.870 --> 06:16.120
boss twins.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.750
Well the only reason Facebook ended up paying money was two reasons.

06:20.750 --> 06:29.660
One they settled because it was bad press and to the only actual argument they had was that he literally

06:29.660 --> 06:35.810
used code that he built for them and then deployed it in his own project.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.870
That was evidence they could actually go to the Facebook page and look and see hey you clearly wrote

06:41.870 --> 06:43.850
this for their application.

06:43.850 --> 06:49.880
Now if they don't do that specifically what hard evidence is there you just say you know he saw my idea

06:49.880 --> 06:50.710
and used it.

06:50.720 --> 06:57.050
But if they modify it even ever so slightly then you can't do anything unless you take into consideration

06:57.050 --> 06:57.740
is that.

06:57.740 --> 06:58.490
Sure.

06:58.490 --> 07:05.780
I mean you can go through abnormal links in abnormal amounts of effort to hide your IP and your idea

07:06.230 --> 07:09.110
but it's eventually going to have exposure.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.960
OK I mean posting it online.

07:11.150 --> 07:12.150
And 10 people see it.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.310
Well guess what.

07:13.310 --> 07:18.440
A lot of people are going to see this and they're going to see your idea or your application when you're

07:18.440 --> 07:21.700
testing and they're going to see it when you pitch it.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.910
They are going to hear about it when you tell other people about it.

07:24.920 --> 07:31.100
It's unreasonable to think that you're going to avoid exposure to your idea and I think it's silly to

07:31.100 --> 07:32.590
even try to hide it.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.420
It's really just better that everyone gets off of this notion that there are these people the people

07:38.420 --> 07:44.150
waiting out in the bushes with the development team just waiting for someone to accidentally drop the

07:44.150 --> 07:47.950
best idea ever and then they're just going to take it and run with it.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.660
And that's how they're finally they become billionaires.

07:50.690 --> 07:52.490
That's just not how the world works.

07:52.580 --> 07:56.090
At the end of the day their only thing that really matters is execution.

07:56.090 --> 07:59.110
Because I know it was a shocker do a lot of you out there.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.790
We have seven billion people on this planet is it eight billion seven billion.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.500
Your idea is not original.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.820
Someone else has had it before.

08:07.820 --> 08:12.530
Again all the famous companies if you look at when they started there were other people that had the

08:12.530 --> 08:14.410
same idea at the same time.

08:14.510 --> 08:19.460
They just didn't take it as seriously as the people that actually went out and worked with it.

08:19.460 --> 08:25.030
So the only that matters is you take the initiative and actually go out there and do it.

08:25.040 --> 08:31.580
And the last thing I'll say is let's be honest if a development team that's on the other side of the

08:31.580 --> 08:40.200
world that you're using specifically because they're cheap can copy your idea and make it successful.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.680
Do you really think it's a good idea at all.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.880
I would say that idea probably isn't very special.

08:46.010 --> 08:48.230
Should probably move on to something else.

08:48.230 --> 08:51.710
All right guys questions concerns both in the group discussion if you have any other things you want

08:51.710 --> 08:52.600
me to address.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.700
More than willing to make an update for you.

08:55.790 --> 08:56.230
All right.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.850
Otherwise enjoy the rest of the course.
