Hey Guys welcome to the course.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.870
In this lecture I'm going to introduce a concept we call the Goldilocks syndrome.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.040
Now what exactly that means is it has to do with when you have a project and you go out there and you

00:23.040 --> 00:28.470
start asking freelancers or freelance firms for bids and you start kind of bringing them in.

00:28.470 --> 00:34.560
You start looking at a board of all your different project bids a lot of people have what we call the

00:34.560 --> 00:42.060
Goldilocks syndrome where they don't pick based off of essentially valid reasons for working with the

00:42.060 --> 00:42.630
freelancer.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.020
They just look at price.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.030
And so what they'll do is to look at the cheapest option the most expensive option and then just make

00:48.060 --> 00:53.370
a quick rational decision that if the price is somewhere in the middle they're going to go with that.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.690
So obviously this is something that you want to avoid.

00:55.710 --> 00:56.390
Right.

00:56.490 --> 01:01.650
But more importantly you need to understand why exactly that's a bad idea.

01:01.740 --> 01:06.600
It might seem reasonable to someone who's brand new to this that when they see a bunch of bids you know

01:06.660 --> 01:11.430
someone might be charging too much and someone might be charging too little and that's that's actually

01:11.430 --> 01:17.970
rational to assume that the cheapest bid is probably someone who is artificially subsidizing their price.

01:17.970 --> 01:18.530
Right.

01:18.580 --> 01:23.180
Probably some of these brand new to this so they know they have to put the project price really low.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.750
That's always a bad idea because you know what happens if that person doesn't like the price once they're

01:27.750 --> 01:32.370
halfway through the project they're much much more likely to quit on you and you have no idea what their

01:32.370 --> 01:33.430
track records like.

01:33.510 --> 01:38.040
And the flipside though when you have an extra high price you might just assume that they're either

01:38.040 --> 01:43.920
overcharging you or they probably misunderstood the project requirements or there's a lot more going

01:43.920 --> 01:46.020
into that bid than you ever would need.

01:46.020 --> 01:49.720
So a lot of people then assume OK it has to be somewhere in the middle.

01:49.730 --> 01:53.760
I'm going to give you a couple of ways to look at the price a little bit more dynamically and make a

01:53.760 --> 01:54.640
better decision.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.340
Okay so never judge the price based off its relationship to the other bids.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.100
If you took advantage of what's called private bidding and any of these platforms that we covered you

02:05.100 --> 02:10.680
probably get to skip over this problem because a lot of times if someone bids 100 and someone bids 200

02:10.680 --> 02:16.630
someone will probably bid like a 110 or they might bid 80 it's kind of like the price is right where

02:16.650 --> 02:20.480
someone always has to bid somewhere where they think it's going to look the best.

02:20.490 --> 02:24.690
Now it's unavoidable that people do this and typically if they're bidding there and they're putting

02:24.690 --> 02:29.140
their price relative someone else's price then they're not being honest.

02:29.220 --> 02:32.820
They should be charging you exactly what they think it's going to take and they should be using their

02:32.820 --> 02:36.060
own measurements and their own techniques for determining that amount.

02:36.120 --> 02:41.190
But the best way of avoiding the Goldilocks syndrome is actually just to think about your organization

02:41.220 --> 02:42.890
and your project as a whole.

02:42.900 --> 02:47.100
We talked about this a little bit in the last lecture but what's really important for you to understand

02:47.100 --> 02:56.040
is one take a quick think about how much expertise you have with outsourcing or contracting in general.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.420
Have you worked one on one with the freelancer or a contractor before.

03:00.450 --> 03:02.960
Have you been a freelancer or contractor.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.080
How many contractors do you work with regularly.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.950
If you've worked with a lot of them then it's worth saying that you probably have a little bit of expertise

03:10.950 --> 03:11.690
with this.

03:11.730 --> 03:17.430
Now what that means to me and what that means to you is that if you have a lot of expertise that probably

03:17.430 --> 03:23.280
means you're going to be more capable of handling a contractor and you're going to be capable of handling

03:23.280 --> 03:27.530
a contractor doesn't have as much experience as say one of the more polished ones.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.700
Now a lot of what you're paying for when you hire a freelancer or a contractor is you're paying for

03:32.700 --> 03:35.630
their autonomy and their ability to think on their feet.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.110
The more upright the more you pay and the higher the price goes the more likely that person is going

03:40.110 --> 03:42.150
to be able to make judgments.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.310
And on the spot decisions that can benefit your project and you're basically saying I trust this person

03:47.310 --> 03:48.740
to have more autonomy.

03:48.930 --> 03:55.350
Now if you have more expertise yourself then you can actually lower the price so your target price should

03:55.350 --> 03:55.920
be lower.

03:55.920 --> 04:01.410
Because a lot of that burden of making decisions on the fly can be shifted onto you and that's where

04:01.440 --> 04:03.120
you get the biggest project savings.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.350
Now second thing to look at how much time are you going to spend on this project how much time are you

04:07.350 --> 04:09.440
comfortable spending on this project.

04:09.570 --> 04:15.720
If you want to spend a lot of time on the project then lowered the price it put your target lower towards

04:15.720 --> 04:17.480
lower towards the end of the range.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.550
Now if you don't want to spend a lot of time this is something you're outsourcing them aside and you

04:20.550 --> 04:25.260
are completely busy doing other things then you need to raise your target.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.000
Another thing to take into consideration.

04:27.030 --> 04:31.590
Look at the specifications that you wrote later in this course we're actually going to cover how you

04:31.590 --> 04:38.340
can do in-depth specifications and how you can do wireframe but also take into consideration how familiar

04:38.460 --> 04:40.460
are you with the project that you're building.

04:40.470 --> 04:43.840
Is this in a technology you have absolutely no familiarity with.

04:43.860 --> 04:49.920
Is this in a section of your company or your business that you don't really deal with very often if

04:49.920 --> 04:54.750
you don't have a lot of familiarity with what you're outsourcing or are contracting then you should

04:54.750 --> 05:00.750
probably think about paying more so your ideal price should be a little bit higher in the relative range.

05:00.750 --> 05:05.160
But if you're one of those people that just has an awesome spec sheet you spend a lot of time on it

05:05.250 --> 05:06.320
researching it.

05:06.450 --> 05:11.810
You know the problems that are going to arise you know what what's most important to the project and

05:11.810 --> 05:16.760
what's not as important to the project and you can prioritize like that then you have an opportunity

05:16.760 --> 05:18.190
for a lot more cost savings.

05:18.200 --> 05:23.290
And the last thing that you should take into consideration is the freelancer or the firm itself.

05:23.390 --> 05:30.440
Look at what they say to you if they have a very specific connection to what they're proposing and they're

05:30.440 --> 05:36.940
articulate and they clearly have thought about your project then you need to give that person more value.

05:36.950 --> 05:42.950
So if that person had a higher bid you should just kind of ignore their price and assume that they're

05:42.950 --> 05:45.150
actually kind of in a sense cheaper.

05:45.170 --> 05:45.400
Right.

05:45.410 --> 05:49.640
Because the more they understand your project the higher likelihood that your projects are going to

05:49.640 --> 05:50.420
be successful.

05:50.450 --> 05:55.400
Similarly look at the portfolios of the people bidding if you have some of the fantastic portfolio that's

05:55.400 --> 05:59.460
very articulate you should obviously value that person more.

05:59.570 --> 06:03.620
So key takeaways from this lecture avoid the Goldilocks syndrome.

06:03.620 --> 06:08.930
Don't just pick your price relative to the other prices you've gotten because that is not the truest

06:08.930 --> 06:09.710
way of doing this.

06:09.710 --> 06:12.860
Take into consideration you yourself your expertise.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.950
How detailed are your spec sheets.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.550
Did you do wireframe.

06:16.550 --> 06:22.430
How familiar are you with the project and the technology itself and incorporate that into what your

06:22.430 --> 06:24.100
ideal price should be.

06:24.350 --> 06:31.400
More experience better specs more familiarity with the project you should have a lower ideal price and

06:31.400 --> 06:33.070
you can save yourself a lot of money.

06:33.110 --> 06:37.010
But on the flip side if you're unfamiliar you're inexperience and you're way too busy.

06:37.010 --> 06:39.400
You need to raise your price.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.700
Now again don't make your judgments solely based off the price.

06:42.710 --> 06:44.480
Look at the individual freelancer.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.900
If they have specific portfolio items that relate to your project you should value that person more.

06:49.970 --> 06:54.440
And if they've actually taken time to think about your project it's not a cookie cutter message that

06:54.440 --> 06:59.780
they send to you and you can tell that they're dynamic and they can think on their feet and it might

06:59.780 --> 07:04.790
be the case that their price doesn't actually reflect how thoughtful they are they might be a cheaper

07:04.790 --> 07:07.810
option when you can tell they actually have thought about your project and they're interested in it

07:08.120 --> 07:09.830
you should give those people a bump.

07:09.930 --> 07:14.690
OK so I don't really want to overwhelm you with different criteria you can use to pick your freelance

07:14.690 --> 07:20.360
or run a cover or a ton of other ways and other factors you should put into your judgment when you're

07:20.360 --> 07:21.840
actually picking someone.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.260
But this is a pretty good guide.

07:23.270 --> 07:26.450
Don't just go off of the price relative to others.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.760
That is not the best way of getting the best price.

07:28.760 --> 07:28.970
All right.

07:28.980 --> 07:29.750
So in the next lecture.
