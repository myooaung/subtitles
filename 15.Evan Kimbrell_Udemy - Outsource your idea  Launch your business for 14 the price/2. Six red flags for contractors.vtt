00:05.860 --> 00:11.650
So I have to admit something in the last lecture I lied I'm not going to give you five red flags to

00:11.650 --> 00:14.300
look for I'm actually going to give you six.

00:14.350 --> 00:18.440
So enjoy the bonus tip.

00:18.570 --> 00:25.170
In my experience a lot of people graze over what I consider effectively on our minds.

00:25.170 --> 00:30.960
Things that are going to blow up later and I think that there are a lot of red flags that you might

00:30.960 --> 00:33.720
skip over because you don't have a lot of experience with this.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.160
There are also a lot of things when it comes to selecting your freelancer that you might be a little

00:38.160 --> 00:41.670
wofully on because you're new to this you're not sure how I should interpret something.

00:41.690 --> 00:45.510
Well I'm going to interject my opinion to give you a little bit of guidance.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.650
Take it for what it's worth.

00:47.670 --> 00:53.220
The first thing I want to say is number one if the person that I'm talking to when I'm trying to build

00:53.220 --> 00:58.920
my shortlist says that they don't have skype or they don't offer that that is a red flag for me that's

00:58.920 --> 00:59.880
just odd to me.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.830
I think it's very strange that they don't use Skype and they are contracting.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.700
That means to me that they don't have a lot of experience contracting or they're not realistic about

01:08.790 --> 01:12.580
how much kind of connectivity this project's going to require.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.270
Typically the best way of hashing someone out is ask for their Skype.

01:16.290 --> 01:19.130
You can talk on skype have a real time conversation.

01:19.230 --> 01:24.500
Personally I don't like to video Skype with all of my contractors I just would get a little onerous.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.190
It would take a little bit too much time.

01:26.190 --> 01:31.020
I like to just tech Skype message and having a quick conversation with them.

01:31.140 --> 01:36.150
You can get a feel for how competent you think they are how interested they are and the other 5 criteria

01:36.150 --> 01:37.910
that we listed in the previous lecture.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.020
No Skype.

01:39.030 --> 01:43.070
I consider that a red flag especially if they say no I don't have one.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.030
Or are you asked for it.

01:44.040 --> 01:44.970
They don't give it to you.

01:45.000 --> 01:45.660
That's weird.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.310
You need to have real time feedback.

01:47.310 --> 01:51.650
You're not going to run this project through messages on Elance or oDesk.

01:51.750 --> 01:56.610
The second one I kind of touched on that's a little bit last time Miss description's you know it's nice

01:56.610 --> 02:02.070
that a lot of people will put some time into their responses in their bid but actually read it and make

02:02.070 --> 02:04.820
sure that there's nothing in there that's completely off.

02:04.830 --> 02:10.380
I've had actually many many instances where someone sounds like a good applicant but in a one sentence

02:10.380 --> 02:13.230
in what they responded to my thing makes no sense.

02:13.230 --> 02:19.570
I've had outsourcing a web application and the contractor kept calling it a mobile application.

02:19.620 --> 02:24.750
I don't know what that says to you but that says to me they weren't paying attention or maybe they're

02:24.750 --> 02:26.290
just not that good.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.540
Well there are a lot of things that make a good developer.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.870
One of them is attention to detail and if they didn't pick up on that they might be over stressed maybe

02:33.870 --> 02:34.950
they're overworked.

02:34.980 --> 02:40.740
Regardless it's just not something that I want and my project number three.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.730
Are they overly anxious to start the project.

02:43.730 --> 02:48.920
You'll notice this question freelancer com and dot com There are too many freelancers.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.000
There are seven million of them versus oDesk which was three point something.

02:54.050 --> 02:58.730
And what will happen is they kind of have this problem where it feels like the squeaky wheel gets the

02:58.730 --> 02:59.120
grease.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.490
They have to shout to get noticed.

03:01.510 --> 03:04.340
So a lot of times you have people that are anxious to start the project.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.540
They're like yes yes whatever you say.

03:05.540 --> 03:06.080
Fantastic.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.420
Let's do this.

03:07.490 --> 03:12.860
A lot of them will be very active about getting you off of the Web site and their first message is I'll

03:12.860 --> 03:14.090
say I can do this.

03:14.090 --> 03:16.510
Contact me on Skype or something like that.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.560
I'm not saying don't engage with them but that is a red flag for me.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.860
That is just too strange for me.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.680
It means that they're not very mature.

03:23.720 --> 03:28.220
It means that they're trying to do a quick grab means that they're probably not realistic about what

03:28.220 --> 03:29.900
your project is going to take.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.850
Number four like all this sycophant is I'm going to put that word up on the board.

03:37.890 --> 03:46.260
Here is the definition for me that is a feature of outsourcing contractors quite often I don't know

03:46.260 --> 03:46.770
what it is.

03:46.770 --> 03:51.990
I think it's a cultural disconnect that in some countries they think that the way that you get projects

03:52.020 --> 03:56.640
is by being overly formal or overly ingratiating.

03:56.640 --> 04:02.850
Oftentimes you will get these flowery letters that they write to you that are way too over-the-top spending

04:02.850 --> 04:04.880
too much time on platitudes.

04:04.890 --> 04:08.530
It almost comes off like one of those Nigerian scam letters.

04:08.730 --> 04:12.050
Dear great honorable sir.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.610
I have heard of you from such and such.

04:14.610 --> 04:18.100
I believe you are a trustworthy and intelligent person.

04:18.330 --> 04:19.040
That's odd.

04:19.140 --> 04:20.390
I just posted a job.

04:20.580 --> 04:21.480
Chill out.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.550
That is a red flag for me.

04:23.550 --> 04:29.890
That means to me that they are actively looking for projects but it appears that they're losing time

04:30.120 --> 04:35.910
and they're not getting the projects that they want so they're just lathering on the compliments and

04:35.940 --> 04:38.420
the I can do anything sir.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.790
Attitude.

04:39.800 --> 04:47.490
Well obviously mistake some of the cultural conventions for being a sycophant sometimes with Indian

04:47.490 --> 04:50.670
developers specifically they will often just call you Sir.

04:50.670 --> 04:54.640
Even if you're a woman or they'll call you Miss or.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.700
If you're not married they will always call you Mrs..

04:57.700 --> 04:59.240
But that is just something that they do.

04:59.340 --> 05:04.200
You need to be able to tell distinction between that and that is just a convention that they use and

05:04.200 --> 05:06.590
it's just something that's kind of brainless for them to just type it.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.700
And whether or not they're trying to lather on compliments to get your business.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.730
Those are two different things.

05:14.340 --> 05:19.020
One of the red flags that I think you should pay attention to is what is your gut feeling when you look

05:19.020 --> 05:20.310
at their portfolio.

05:20.700 --> 05:26.370
If you don't have a lot of bids on your project and you go and look at their portfolio and say the graphic

05:26.370 --> 05:33.390
design on them are not so great or say the Web sites you've been to are a little too low quality a little

05:33.390 --> 05:34.340
too basic.

05:34.390 --> 05:35.920
Yeah you're just not sure.

05:36.120 --> 05:40.490
Now follow the rule it goes with bad meat.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.710
It's when in doubt throw it out.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.980
And I apply that towards software programs.

05:46.880 --> 05:53.220
What I mean by that is say you look at their portfolio and like two or three things you think look good

05:53.240 --> 05:54.530
do you think fit.

05:54.580 --> 06:02.930
Then you see three or four that don't at all don't have this kind of confirmation bias where you just

06:03.020 --> 06:07.840
assume that those three that you didn't like oh those are the client's problem.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.620
You don't think that that represents the freelancer.

06:10.820 --> 06:11.630
That's not the truth.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.430
I mean you should look at it from the other way around.

06:13.430 --> 06:19.970
When in doubt throw it out just say not worth it if you have any questions about their ability to create

06:19.970 --> 06:20.990
something that you're happy with.

06:20.990 --> 06:29.560
At the end Hemingses if you look at the portfolio move along and the six the one this one actually I'm

06:29.560 --> 06:35.100
referring back to the five criteria there the last two it was availability and responsiveness.

06:35.110 --> 06:37.460
Well these are actually interrelated.

06:37.510 --> 06:42.120
You need to tell whether or not their availability matches their responsiveness.

06:42.280 --> 06:49.360
If they say they have a lot of availability and they're not being responsive that means for me that

06:49.390 --> 06:51.290
they're not telling the truth.

06:51.490 --> 06:57.080
For me that's a little bit odd that they have all this free time but they're not dedicating it to projects

06:57.080 --> 06:59.410
they're not dedicating it to at least communication.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.210
There are a lot of free time.

07:00.210 --> 07:03.910
I mean they probably could take on more projects why aren't they spending more time.

07:03.910 --> 07:05.590
That's a mismatch for me.

07:05.590 --> 07:11.390
And then the inverse of that is are they super responsive but also incredibly busy.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.060
I don't feel great about that.

07:13.060 --> 07:18.100
That means that they might be exaggerating about how busy they are they might be hedging by saying they

07:18.100 --> 07:19.340
don't have as much time.

07:19.450 --> 07:24.090
So that allows them to underperform on your project and deliver it late.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.320
That's what I've seen before.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.430
And so this is going to take a month.

07:27.430 --> 07:31.230
Really they're not actually that busy they just want to give themselves a comfortable runway.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.220
I don't like it you shouldn't like it.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.960
So those are six things that I've noticed repeatedly that will pop up.

07:36.960 --> 07:48.680
You'll probably run into them and hopefully now you can recognize them.
