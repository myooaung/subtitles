00:06.060 --> 00:11.460
Let's talk a little bit about the question of our contractors a long term solution.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.760
I bring this up.

00:12.780 --> 00:19.080
Because a lot of you are taking this course and I'm promoting the benefits of contracting out your first

00:19.080 --> 00:24.420
version of your product and I'm kind of presenting it as if it's this obvious choice.

00:24.420 --> 00:29.340
I believe that at the beginning of your business it is the obvious choice that has so many benefits

00:29.430 --> 00:30.060
to you.

00:30.060 --> 00:35.460
The founder from equity from the leverage are going to have when you go to recruit technical founders

00:35.460 --> 00:40.710
to the terms you're in to get an investment even the amount of time and effort you're going to put up

00:40.710 --> 00:44.740
front and essentially the efficiency of your time at the very beginning.

00:44.910 --> 00:49.520
But then there is a question of Is this something that that essentially stays ripe forever.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.950
Should you always stick with contractors.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.930
The answer to this is it depends.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.310
That's the short answer.

00:56.340 --> 00:57.380
It depends on a lot of things.

00:57.380 --> 01:03.760
It depends how serious you are about your company it depends how big your company is growing.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.850
Let's imagine someone who is building a lifestyle business.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.520
You want to make a basic web application that's going to bring you $5000 a month.

01:12.930 --> 01:19.440
In that case do you even need to bring on someone to your team five dollars a month is not a huge hurdle

01:19.440 --> 01:23.970
to hit especially if you're devoting a lot of time and effort towards it.

01:24.060 --> 01:29.520
In that case then honestly this is that business is something that could be run by contractors essentially

01:29.520 --> 01:31.030
in perpetuity forever.

01:31.260 --> 01:36.060
If that's the case you want to build a small business you don't plan to turn it into a Google.

01:36.060 --> 01:41.070
I definitely think that as long as you establish good ongoing relationships with your contractors there's

01:41.070 --> 01:47.390
absolutely no reason why you would need to switch to in-house development if you're trying to build

01:47.390 --> 01:52.280
a company that is going to grow and grow and grow and you're trying to take this rocket ship to the

01:52.280 --> 01:53.570
moon so to speak.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.310
It's a different question.

01:55.310 --> 02:00.320
And typically when I was giving advice to start ups when I was in venture capital what I would tell

02:00.320 --> 02:05.870
them is the most effective way of starting your business is you start with contracting as the company

02:05.870 --> 02:14.360
starts accelerating your needs will start to change contacting has an inherent cost advantage to it.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.650
But it also has an inherent efficiency disadvantage to it when you're contracting out.

02:19.660 --> 02:24.190
That means that that person is not integrated into your core unit.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.670
The turnaround time for example when you make changes or make additions is much slower.

02:28.780 --> 02:33.100
Now at the beginning when you're testing out an idea and you're trying to gain kind of minimal traction

02:33.100 --> 02:38.890
to take your business the next step is not going to matter how much time you spend writing requirements

02:38.950 --> 02:42.230
and what the turnaround time is on a new feature.

02:43.060 --> 02:49.060
The turnaround time on a bug is still important but it's not nearly as important when you have 200 users

02:49.150 --> 02:51.050
versus when you have 2 million users.

02:51.310 --> 02:58.000
As the company grows this kind of dynamic changes all of a sudden the time it takes to do things like

02:58.000 --> 03:03.610
that becomes much more valuable and the cost advantage of contracting goes down significantly.

03:03.760 --> 03:10.990
And that's why I generally suggest as your company progresses you do shift from contracting into in-house

03:10.990 --> 03:18.000
development and that's the best way of taking advantage of the upfront cost advantages of contracting.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.400
And then later taking advantage of once money is not a huge issue.

03:21.460 --> 03:26.890
The advantages of having an in-house team someone you want sitting next to you someone who 2:00 in the

03:26.890 --> 03:31.210
morning when something goes down you are a phone call away and they'll do it immediately.

03:32.310 --> 03:37.680
Once your company is big you don't really want to deal with writing contracts constantly for new sections

03:37.890 --> 03:38.790
of development.

03:38.790 --> 03:43.400
You don't want to have to constantly deal with billing and recording time.

03:43.410 --> 03:49.470
It's much easier to for instance an in-house developer to use them for overtime or use them as an an

03:49.500 --> 03:55.120
on an as needed basis or as a contractor probably is going to adhere more to the 9:00 to 5:00 schedule.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.560
Hopefully I've explained this decently well.

03:57.630 --> 04:03.420
Bigger companies they need different things and so eventually your needs will evolve and problems that

04:03.420 --> 04:08.080
you thought were big previously will no longer be huge issues anymore.

04:08.100 --> 04:13.590
For instance you know paying an extra 50 percent per hour for your developer work it's not going to

04:13.590 --> 04:20.550
be as big of a deal when you know you have a much bigger user base and a lot more money in funding and

04:20.550 --> 04:24.080
a lot more collective effort going towards your product.

04:24.090 --> 04:27.600
This is not completely to say that you can't go the distance with contractors.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.870
There are a lot of big companies that keep contractors on their roster.

04:32.070 --> 04:37.230
But typically what you'll see is it's more of a hybrid situation where they stick with contractors for

04:37.230 --> 04:44.760
the first two years and then gradually bring in more in-house developers but they retain outside contractors

04:44.790 --> 04:48.370
because they don't want to use what we call internal velocity.

04:48.390 --> 04:55.170
What that basically means is your company's ability to produce new product new code make changes further

04:55.250 --> 05:00.450
your product they don't want to take a dip in that as they switch completely from contract to in-house

05:00.450 --> 05:03.640
developer and so they retain both then a lot of companies.

05:03.780 --> 05:10.050
Actually I'd say the vast majority of companies will utilize contractors as well as in-house developers.

05:10.350 --> 05:14.850
And if you followed this strategy in the course by using contractors at first that will actually set

05:14.850 --> 05:19.580
you up to have a much stronger ongoing relationship with your contractor.

05:19.620 --> 05:24.330
So you're not in the future trying to find efficient contractors that you have a rapport with and then

05:24.330 --> 05:29.550
you have very strong working efficiency with the guys have any other questions just post them.

05:29.790 --> 05:36.120
Dislikers really just kind of a reflection I want you guys to be as realistic as possible going forward.

05:36.180 --> 05:42.630
Just knowing that the most effective startups I've seen shift from contractor to in-house or shift from

05:42.630 --> 05:43.980
contractor to hybrid.
