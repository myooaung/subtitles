00:08.270 --> 00:13.490
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about what is outsourcing

00:13.580 --> 00:14.720
what is it not.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.820
We're going to try to dispel some myths and try to put a finger on what exactly is the definition that

00:19.820 --> 00:21.720
we're going to be working with throughout this course.

00:21.740 --> 00:26.180
Now I'm going to tell you this up front I'm actually going to use the term outsourcing and a little

00:26.180 --> 00:30.030
bit of a different way than you used to it's not the most strict definition of outsourcing.

00:30.140 --> 00:32.410
But for this course it's going to make a lot more sense.

00:32.410 --> 00:37.700
So let me try to explain to you what exactly I mean when I say outsourcing and then what in general

00:37.700 --> 00:38.790
does outsourcing mean.

00:38.930 --> 00:45.890
So I'm I'm sure you've heard the term over and over and over again with the advent of the Internet outsourcing

00:45.890 --> 00:47.690
became a real thing.

00:47.690 --> 00:53.240
You know back in the 90s it was kind of a hot topic but now it's kind of a case that everyone does it.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.550
And still though when people think outsourcing they kind of think of what the first permutation of outsourcing

00:58.550 --> 01:04.640
was which was what do you think of right a call center in the Philippines or some like outsourced Human

01:04.640 --> 01:09.920
Resources Division in India that your company takes so much information to sends it to them and it comes

01:09.920 --> 01:11.470
back done well.

01:11.510 --> 01:13.700
You know you're right in a sense right.

01:13.700 --> 01:19.000
So outsourcing does include those things like call centers and outsourced human resources.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.600
But it includes a lot more.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.190
The stereotype of outsourcing.

01:22.190 --> 01:22.480
Yeah.

01:22.490 --> 01:27.130
It's like low wages and poor English that's it everybody thinks of when they think of outsourcing.

01:27.440 --> 01:33.980
But in reality outsourcing is quite literally anything you contract out to someone who is not in the

01:33.980 --> 01:36.030
same country as yourself.

01:36.030 --> 01:40.070
Now if you were to give some work to say someone who lives down the street there in your country in

01:40.070 --> 01:44.010
your state city we wouldn't consider that outsourcing traditionally.

01:44.090 --> 01:49.550
But if that person you gave that information to that job to sat across the border somewhere or on the

01:49.550 --> 01:52.740
other side of the world then we would consider that outsourcing.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.300
Now a lot of people use it incorrectly.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.780
They use outsourcing when they say something like oh you know I don't want to do this work I'm going

01:59.780 --> 02:00.870
to outsource it.

02:01.190 --> 02:07.930
But when I say outsourcing I specifically mean taking work and getting it done outside of your country.

02:07.940 --> 02:12.470
Now if you just did it to someone else in your country typically I get to refer to that as just contracting

02:12.830 --> 02:14.270
now out of country.

02:14.270 --> 02:20.030
That's a very important distinction and it actually keeps you in kind of the reason why it was sent

02:20.560 --> 02:22.540
or offloaded in the first place.

02:22.550 --> 02:28.670
So now if you contracted it to someone in your country or say you did or a company did you probably

02:28.670 --> 02:32.750
think maybe they did it because the company didn't have the right expertise.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.940
Or maybe they did it because they at capacity.

02:34.940 --> 02:40.020
They couldn't find their own human resources to be able to do some task or some specialty.

02:40.220 --> 02:42.670
Now almost without a doubt.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.330
When you outsource it outside of your country.

02:45.410 --> 02:51.530
The main point is that you're trying to take advantage of cheap labor costs somewhere else.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.530
Now it's not just limited to labor costs.

02:53.540 --> 03:00.230
Other countries have cheap virtually everything and outsourcing is especially popular with web applications

03:00.230 --> 03:05.150
mobile applications because as long as they have an internet connection there's not a lot of other kind

03:05.150 --> 03:08.630
of fixed cost associated with them working from anywhere in the world.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.260
So now what are things that typically get outsourced.

03:11.300 --> 03:17.450
Well honestly tons and tons of stuff you know back in the 90s they started off with outsourcing smaller

03:17.450 --> 03:24.350
things things that are more easy to outsource like say a web site development or say some like accounting.

03:24.350 --> 03:27.150
But nowadays it's really expanded to almost anything.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.160
You know you can outsource a mobile application you can outsource a web application.

03:32.270 --> 03:37.970
You can outsource event promotion marketing social media management public relations.

03:38.060 --> 03:43.630
You can do human resources I've seen outsourcing for hiring and firing.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.310
I've seen outsourcing for consulting.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.080
I've seen outsourcing for.

03:48.410 --> 03:53.790
Yeah I mean strategies and even like large research projects will outsource quite a bit.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.540
I mean I've even seen recruiting being outsourced.

03:56.540 --> 04:02.120
I've seen people hiring Indian firms to help them recruit other people to hire locally.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.260
I've even seen people use outsourcing for trying to find a date.

04:06.260 --> 04:11.510
Now you need to kind of wrap your head around this is that every single company in the world.

04:11.510 --> 04:17.780
Virtually every single company in the world outsources something at some point in time in their company's

04:17.780 --> 04:18.480
lifespan.

04:18.620 --> 04:24.550
Virtually any large company probably has multiple outsourcing operations going on.

04:24.650 --> 04:30.870
There's even companies that have over 50 percent of their actual business processes outsource currently.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.010
So really the question isn't should I outsource.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.180
It's a question of what do I have that's eligible for being outsourced.

04:38.210 --> 04:42.210
And what do I have that would be something that's a good idea to outsource.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.820
And lastly what are you comfortable outsourcing.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.260
Every single company has certain things that they'd be comfortable outsourcing and not comfortable outsourcing.

04:50.270 --> 04:52.590
So the question should you outsource.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.760
I'm obviously going to say yes it is extremely helpful.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.910
It's a fantastic way of not only saving money and getting your projects done on time but it's an easy

05:01.910 --> 05:06.260
way of reaching out and getting expertise that there's no way you would have had your self you couldn't

05:06.320 --> 05:13.090
build yourself and you couldn't possibly have recruited in-house one of the biggest reasons why I say

05:13.170 --> 05:19.160
outsourcing is you can be literally anyone you can be a broke college student or you can do some gigantic

05:19.160 --> 05:23.740
fortune 500 and you can outsource really anything you can think of.

05:23.750 --> 05:27.050
And the prices can be surprisingly cheap.

05:27.050 --> 05:31.790
You do not need a traditional budget to get large applications or large projects done.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.260
Okay.

05:32.270 --> 05:37.700
So really the main takeaway from this lecture is that when I say outsourcing I mean that you're taking

05:37.700 --> 05:41.470
your work and you're trying to find someone in another country to get it done.

05:41.480 --> 05:46.460
And the reason why you're doing that is because the costs are going to be cheaper and it's going to

05:46.460 --> 05:52.400
allow you in some way to accelerate your growth either as an organization a freelancer or just an individual

05:52.400 --> 05:53.930
with the project idea.

05:53.930 --> 05:57.740
Now the question of should you outsource How should you and what should you.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.650
Well that's what the entirety of the Course is about.

06:00.650 --> 06:07.190
So by the end of the course you're going to be a master in getting your project done saving money saving

06:07.190 --> 06:12.770
time and making everybody else think you're a wizard because you can certainly just conjure up whatever

06:12.770 --> 06:16.290
you want to get built and it's done and you did it without breaking the bank.
