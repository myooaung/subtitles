00:11.110 --> 00:16.870
Let's talk about where you should go to find freelancers and freelancing firms.

00:16.870 --> 00:22.730
For me there are the big three Elance oDesk and freelancer dot com.

00:22.900 --> 00:28.710
I'm sure you've used other Web sites people per hour seems to be a decent one.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.690
There are lots of freelancing sites that target certain knishes you'll notice things like like video

00:34.690 --> 00:41.390
Pixi is her freelancer's for videos specifically in this course we're talking more about building mobile

00:41.390 --> 00:48.680
applications or web applications so we're going to focus on software freelancers the Big Three Elance

00:48.770 --> 00:54.170
oDesk and freelancer these are the ones I've used throughout my career and the ones I've used for over

00:54.170 --> 01:03.590
50 60 apps each one of these has their own pros and cons Elance is probably by far my favorite for finding

01:03.590 --> 01:10.960
high quality contractors when you bid on elance you can get bids from pretty much all over the world.

01:11.180 --> 01:19.010
When you typically post something I see a good mix between Western countries and typical outsource countries

01:19.010 --> 01:25.010
and then people all in between you'll find a lot of freelancers who are simply location independent

01:25.010 --> 01:30.160
like traveling programmers very very vibrant community of people.

01:30.200 --> 01:36.830
Elance is where you would go if you were looking for better or established firms or essentially higher

01:36.830 --> 01:43.000
quality freelancers freelancers that are in the mature stage of their freelancing career.

01:43.070 --> 01:48.920
A lot of programmers who have full time jobs that work at reputable companies will go on elance and

01:48.920 --> 01:51.680
bid on projects for their weekends and off hours.

01:51.680 --> 01:58.100
The firms on elance typically have better portfolios they're usually better at articulating what they're

01:58.100 --> 01:58.990
good at.

01:59.030 --> 02:05.540
They are typically going to give you better more thoughtful responses to your project briefs.

02:05.780 --> 02:08.950
Now like the other 30 it doesn't cost any money to post.

02:09.110 --> 02:15.380
The difference is here you'll notice that most people that bid have read your project and will actually

02:15.380 --> 02:18.360
respond with detail and with thoughts on it.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.530
That obviously comes with the downside.

02:21.540 --> 02:25.300
You'll notice that in Elance the prices are usually a bit higher.

02:25.530 --> 02:30.060
If you were to take the same application in the same brief and post them across these three systems

02:30.470 --> 02:35.970
Elance you'll notice on average is going to have the highest price and also the time line probably is

02:35.970 --> 02:37.310
going to be longer.

02:37.530 --> 02:43.080
And obviously the reason is because the people who are bidding have more experience and they also probably

02:43.080 --> 02:49.140
have more clientele themselves so they're not going to lie and say that they're going to rush the project

02:49.170 --> 02:53.630
and they're also not going to be taking kind of a loss leader position meaning that they're not going

02:53.650 --> 02:58.930
repricing so low that they're actually losing money just to get your business.

02:58.970 --> 03:05.330
The second one is oDesk oDesk in L.A. I believe are a merged company but these two different products

03:05.900 --> 03:08.270
oDesk is a little bit different.

03:08.270 --> 03:14.310
It's not like Elance in the sense that everybody who bids is going to be a high quality oDesk differentiate

03:14.600 --> 03:21.380
themselves by what they use called the team view and they have the thing called a team room how the

03:21.380 --> 03:22.740
team room works.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.730
It's a web application within oDesk that when you hire someone they get added to your team room and

03:28.790 --> 03:34.880
then they use this screen capture software on the freelancer's Web site so that you can maintain how

03:34.880 --> 03:39.080
much they've been working and what their productivity looks like and you can kind of notice if they're

03:39.080 --> 03:40.130
not working.

03:40.310 --> 03:43.680
And if they try to bill you you can look back at their time logs.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.430
Also you can use that way to combine other freelancers into the same room so that they can communicate

03:49.430 --> 03:51.290
to each other and coordinate.

03:51.350 --> 03:58.520
It's good if you're trying to put together a team from multiple freelancers or multiple development

03:58.520 --> 04:02.480
teams which is sometimes that is the case sometimes you need someone to do data entry.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.740
You need one person to program and you need one person to do graphic design.

04:05.870 --> 04:11.300
And that makes it quite convenient however because that is the focal point of their product and what

04:11.510 --> 04:13.100
they're selling point.

04:13.220 --> 04:19.010
It means that people typically go to oDesk if they're looking for per hour labor and it means that they're

04:19.010 --> 04:22.140
skewed more towards things like virtual assistants.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.430
Most of the projects you see on oDesk will skew towards.

04:25.430 --> 04:32.440
I need someone to do this manual task and do it in perpetuity and do it for a set amount of time.

04:32.870 --> 04:36.990
People do obviously post web projects and mobile projects on there.

04:37.100 --> 04:43.580
It's just better if you're looking for an individual who can just work towards your project and essentially

04:43.580 --> 04:48.350
it until it's done and it's not a great place to try to find a fixed price because of them.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.030
The team room benefit.

04:50.030 --> 04:52.040
It doesn't really help you in any way.

04:52.040 --> 04:58.490
ODesk is in terms of quality engineering it's a little bit below Elance but it's above freelancer freelancer

04:58.510 --> 05:06.220
dot com is the last one Prancer I used to be a big deal back in 2001 2002 came out of the Internet bubble

05:06.470 --> 05:07.860
but it stuck around.

05:07.970 --> 05:12.170
It is probably the least polished of the theory.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.640
You go and you use it.

05:13.640 --> 05:19.640
It is kind of confusing the way that they use a credit system you will for instance when you pay freelancers

05:19.910 --> 05:25.220
you will upload money into your account and then you can pay them and freelancer automatically will

05:25.220 --> 05:27.930
deduct certain amounts of money out of your account.

05:27.950 --> 05:32.660
So it always keeps a certain baseline amount of money in your account and that can be kind of annoying

05:32.660 --> 05:36.500
if you're trying to do small tasks but freelancer.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.260
It's kind of the Wild West of the freelancing Web sites.

05:40.280 --> 05:47.060
I use it all the time but that's because I'm skilled at managing outsourced teams and knowing what I

05:47.060 --> 05:52.230
want and I can tell very easily if a freelancer is being unrealistic.

05:52.490 --> 05:59.270
Freelancers the place you go if you want pretty much a heavy skew in terms of your bidding group from

05:59.330 --> 06:00.470
outsourced countries.

06:00.590 --> 06:06.500
When you post on freelancer you may get some people from western countries but the mule predominantly

06:06.500 --> 06:13.260
get people from you know Eastern Europe India Indonesia Vietnam places like that.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.680
Now freelancer's great if you're trying to get something done extremely cheaply.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.880
The people who bid on their bid very very low.

06:20.930 --> 06:26.240
And if you have the experience and you have the time to oversee what they're doing then you can have

06:26.240 --> 06:28.860
some pretty huge cost savings.

06:29.330 --> 06:34.700
But I always say kind of stay away unless you have experience doing this because you can get burned

06:34.700 --> 06:35.810
very easily.

06:35.870 --> 06:41.000
Often what happens on freelancer you will see that if you post say you want to make a web site and say

06:41.000 --> 06:45.830
your web site is something similar to another Web site you very often will find people who will create

06:45.830 --> 06:47.610
clones of Web sites for you.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.460
Watch out for people who are going to build your web site using a script.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.940
You don't know what the intellectual property rules around that script are you don't know where they

06:55.940 --> 06:57.060
got the script.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.540
Who owns the licensing.

06:58.670 --> 07:02.840
But that happens quite often in freelancer and that's another reason why your rates are so cheap.

07:02.870 --> 07:07.390
I notice that a lot of freelancers start off on that Web site because it is kind of the Wild West.

07:07.460 --> 07:11.640
They can get some shady air projects to get reviews.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.560
You also notice some freelance.

07:13.790 --> 07:18.800
They started listing the completion rate for each project for each freelancer because that's a big concern

07:18.800 --> 07:19.700
on freelancer.

07:19.790 --> 07:22.660
A lot of times people will bid until they were way too low.

07:22.730 --> 07:24.560
Get into the project and then abandon it.

07:24.560 --> 07:30.080
So I would say that freelancer is something you want to dive into if you have some experience it's where

07:30.080 --> 07:32.580
you get the best cost savings and it's a place you go.

07:32.580 --> 07:42.660
The U.S. I'm really kind of sketchy deed or task you need to get done.
