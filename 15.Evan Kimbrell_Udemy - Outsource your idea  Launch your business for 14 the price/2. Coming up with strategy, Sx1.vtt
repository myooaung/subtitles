WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:07.960
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:08.020 --> 00:08.260
OK.

00:08.260 --> 00:13.000
So in this lecture what we're going to do is we're going to take the framework that we talked about

00:13.180 --> 00:14.390
in The Last Lecture.

00:14.390 --> 00:20.320
Remember the five US strategy scope's structures skeleton surface and we're going to take a theoretical

00:20.320 --> 00:22.840
idea or use that theoretical idea.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.450
I'm going to show you how you could on a scratch pad on a Microsoft Word.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.090
Fill that out for yourself.

00:30.100 --> 00:37.750
I'm going to show you the usefulness of putting this on paper and using that as a way to visualize organize

00:38.500 --> 00:40.190
the entirety of your idea.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.670
So keep it completely simple.

00:42.670 --> 00:49.060
Honestly I'm one of those people that likes to go light on documentation and go heavy on actually doing

00:49.060 --> 00:49.790
it.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.930
And I know that is sometimes a problem and some people disagree with it.

00:53.960 --> 01:00.180
That's personally the strategy that I've seen work the best in terms of turnaround time and R-N.Y why

01:00.250 --> 01:02.030
you put into it and what you get out of it.

01:02.110 --> 01:07.410
So all you need to do is pull open a Microsoft Word Microsoft Word honestly you could do this in Notepad.

01:07.420 --> 01:12.500
You could do this an ever know anything you have you could do this on a piece of paper if you want to.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.660
Honestly I just like to type it because it's a lot easier.

01:16.420 --> 01:19.900
But this is the way that I've structured it out our idea.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.020
Yoga's you don't need to put that but you can put at the top what it is that you're talking about.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.460
That's helpful because if you're doing multiple ideas you can keep track of them.

01:29.650 --> 01:37.480
But then I just wrote out each individual section right over here and it's pretty simple so just to

01:37.480 --> 01:42.610
go over these one more time to make you make sure you really understand this strategy is the high level

01:43.240 --> 01:49.420
discussion about what is the hypothesis that we're testing what is it that we're trying to plan out

01:49.420 --> 01:50.330
to do.

01:50.590 --> 01:56.080
You know who's going to use it roughly what are the goals that we would try to complete by making an

01:56.080 --> 02:04.510
application or making a web site and then scope is where we then go and list out all of the things that

02:04.510 --> 02:07.150
we think that our idea or application needs.

02:07.150 --> 02:11.050
Now you don't need to get every single thing on there but this is the exercise where you just kind of

02:11.050 --> 02:16.270
think of everything you could possibly put into it and then try to shave back to the point where you

02:16.270 --> 02:18.470
find a feature set that you're happy with.

02:18.580 --> 02:20.800
Now structure and skeleton are a little bit confusing.

02:20.890 --> 02:26.970
Those two are similar in that they deal with the wire framing structures a little bit lighter.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.690
You're not doing a huge deep dive what you're doing and structure is more or less figuring out roughly

02:31.690 --> 02:33.330
where things go.

02:33.880 --> 02:39.730
And you know roughly like over here I think this should be the area where you log in and this should

02:39.730 --> 02:45.650
be the area where you see the photo album and or maybe over here is where you input your information.

02:45.650 --> 02:48.640
Here's what the form should be things like that that structure.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.940
That's where we focus primarily on things like information architecture.

02:52.970 --> 02:57.730
Number that term we went over and the previous lecture and it's really very loose.

02:57.730 --> 03:02.980
Now when you get to a skeleton that is where we get a little bit deeper and we start placing tax we

03:02.980 --> 03:08.530
start placing image holders start placing buttons and that's where your wireframe goes from a really

03:08.530 --> 03:16.270
rough sketch to something that looks more like a polished low fidelity wireframe now surface is something

03:16.270 --> 03:20.920
that we don't again cover in this course but what surface ends up being is that you take what you created

03:20.920 --> 03:25.050
and skeleton and you get it professionally designed.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.100
Now you don't have to do it professionally designed.

03:27.110 --> 03:32.600
I'm in the middle of creating a course where I can teach you as an entrepreneur product manager.

03:32.610 --> 03:38.500
Anybody who doesn't actually have design skills how to do good enough design and how to essentially

03:38.500 --> 03:45.150
skip the cost of this section in the time of this section and have a little bit more ownership over

03:45.150 --> 03:45.890
your design.

03:45.910 --> 03:51.340
But at the moment what you're gonna have to end up doing is follow that lecture later in the course

03:51.340 --> 03:53.690
where I talk about what are your options.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.740
And then after this and I'll just put in Princie so you can understand this.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.220
This is when we then go back and we prototype.

04:01.390 --> 04:06.580
So after we have the design the wireframe we know the interaction what it's going to look like what

04:06.670 --> 04:08.650
you know when I click on something where does it go.

04:08.650 --> 04:11.320
We're going to take all that information and create a final prototype.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.590
Now that's the last section of the lecture.

04:13.690 --> 04:13.890
Sorry.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.780
That's the last section of the course.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.820
Right now we're just going to strategy.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.680
I'm going to show you how to do strategy in the next lecture.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.070
We're going to go now.

04:21.070 --> 04:22.520
Don't take me word for word.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.660
I'm just going to show you an example of how you would do this.

04:24.670 --> 04:32.770
Now if you guys are coming from my idea of validation of course or my the non-technical entrepreneurs

04:32.770 --> 04:39.610
guide to launching products then you are familiar with the example that I've been using.

04:39.610 --> 04:45.570
Now if you haven't the example that I've been using is a happy hour mobile application.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.880
Now the reason why I do this is because it's a simple idea.

04:48.880 --> 04:55.000
Everyone you know roughly knows what it's like to go to a bar or drink beer or use a mobile application

04:55.000 --> 04:56.470
to do such a thing.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.530
That's why I'm using it.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.270
Super simple is it a good idea.

04:59.290 --> 05:05.610
No but it's it's I'm using it to really just show you what the process is to go through this.

05:05.650 --> 05:11.830
Now later in the course when we do low fidelity wireframe ing We are going to refer back to this idea

05:12.010 --> 05:16.690
just a little bit but we're going to spend more time actually on building Web sites you're familiar

05:16.690 --> 05:16.960
with.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.870
Just to show you how to get good at wire framing how to get skills at putting together pages quickly

05:23.140 --> 05:28.320
and then in the prototyping section I'm going to use some of the design assets my firm has and we're

05:28.320 --> 05:33.570
going to build the prototype of an internal application that we actually made.

05:33.580 --> 05:40.720
So we're going to switch it up a little bit to try to you know focus this general kind of information.

05:40.780 --> 05:43.190
We're not going to keep the same idea as we go through it.

05:43.720 --> 05:49.430
But at the end of the course you can see what roughly it will look like when we prototype a real idea.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.080
OK so in the document let's focus on strategy.

05:53.110 --> 05:59.830
Now remember this is called It's a mobile app for finding happy hours.

05:59.830 --> 06:06.220
If you're not familiar or happy hour is a drink and food special that restaurants and bars will often

06:06.280 --> 06:07.130
offer.

06:07.210 --> 06:11.690
They offer it during off times and they usually end up calling this happy hour.

06:11.710 --> 06:18.040
That's how they get customers in the door before the dinner rush and the after after dinner rush for

06:18.070 --> 06:19.730
alcohol.

06:19.730 --> 06:25.090
That's an interesting strategy with a typically do as a poll people and give them discounted prices

06:25.090 --> 06:28.090
because they know that they'll get drunk or they know that they'll buy other things and that's what

06:28.100 --> 06:29.730
they end up making their money.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.010
And they know that the crowd will stay longer.

06:32.230 --> 06:32.970
OK.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.880
So this is the idea the tagline that we came up with was

06:41.470 --> 06:44.590
happy hours on your phone.

06:44.710 --> 06:48.400
Now there was something similar to that and you get the gist of it.

06:48.610 --> 06:52.940
OK so the strategy here is again going to be very very simple.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.630
I'm going to say that the strategy is

06:58.330 --> 07:04.720
I guess I will say like it's mobile application now that is not mobile web.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.870
It's a native application.

07:09.910 --> 07:16.150
Native application means that if you use a android or use an iPhone it's an app that you actually download

07:16.840 --> 07:21.180
the app store and Google Play you open it up and you actually use it.

07:21.280 --> 07:30.370
Now a mobile web is when you go to a Web site and it loads for your browser.

07:30.470 --> 07:34.270
OK so that's the basic description High-Level.

07:34.280 --> 07:47.820
And then what I can say is people want to find happy hours but it's difficult to use Yelp.

07:48.330 --> 07:53.770
The options available are limited.

07:54.050 --> 07:58.720
The mobile solution the better.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.660
OK what else.

08:00.660 --> 08:01.870
I also put.

08:02.220 --> 08:05.220
So that's the high level that's kind of like the hypothesis.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.870
You know a hypothesis would be a little bit more well-rounded than that I would say something like I

08:09.870 --> 08:11.100
believe that.

08:11.160 --> 08:17.580
I'd say people are most likely willing to use a mobile application to find happy hours as long as it's

08:17.640 --> 08:21.210
easy and it doesn't cost them money.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.990
That would be like a hypothesis.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.600
This works just as well.

08:24.600 --> 08:30.010
Remember guys this is just for referencing seeing Remember guys this is just for referencing later.

08:30.240 --> 08:38.060
This is for our purposes so what I'll say is so I'll list out roughly what I think the users are users

08:38.510 --> 08:43.910
will say 20 to 30 you're all going out in groups

08:48.230 --> 09:08.650
that you're say couples going on dates after work groups looking for host day chatter or.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.290
So those are roughly what I think my users are going to be.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.230
That's obviously going to change once you go and actually validate the idea once you can actually get

09:15.230 --> 09:16.120
out in the wild.

09:16.180 --> 09:20.720
Testing with your prototype or even your wireframe you'll start to figure out your user base is very

09:20.720 --> 09:23.560
rarely what you actually think it is.

09:23.690 --> 09:36.430
My goals midlist out as I'd say the goal here is to be able to find a happy hour in close proximity

09:36.720 --> 09:42.110
let's say within five minutes of opening the app.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.680
So that's a goal.

09:43.740 --> 09:55.910
Another goal might be let's say be able to quickly tell the prices of all of the happy hours.

09:56.580 --> 10:02.450
OK so that's another goal you can do these pretty much to your face turns blue.

10:02.500 --> 10:07.750
So if I had script strategy and just went straight into Scopus straight into structure I totally would

10:07.750 --> 10:11.500
forget about everything that I'm trying to accommodate in my designs.

10:11.530 --> 10:15.580
It's really helpful to get everything down because then when you get stuck and trust me you will get

10:15.580 --> 10:19.090
stuck because you're not an expert at making wire frames or prototypes.

10:19.090 --> 10:24.730
You'll go back and look at this and go OK I have I've left out the ability to tell all the prices of

10:24.730 --> 10:26.970
the happy hours.

10:27.130 --> 10:38.380
What's another goal we could put in let's say see Israel representation of the happy hours on a map

10:39.070 --> 10:41.730
near me OK.

10:42.510 --> 10:48.630
One other thing I'll put is be able to see deals for tomorrow as well.

10:48.630 --> 10:49.350
Got it.

10:49.770 --> 10:50.440
OK.

10:50.790 --> 10:51.600
So there you go.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.790
That is literally all you need.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.710
You can put more information on here.

10:55.710 --> 10:59.050
Remember it's just to make it easier as you go through the process.

10:59.100 --> 11:02.580
Keep it high level Keep it general keep it even vague.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.990
Just keep in mind this is not going to be exact what you come up with like in your user base and your

11:06.990 --> 11:09.610
goals could be totally wrong you could change it later.

11:09.620 --> 11:10.490
Does it matter.

11:10.500 --> 11:16.170
The point is to get this documented saved and then onto the next step which is scope.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.100
All right so in the next lecture.
